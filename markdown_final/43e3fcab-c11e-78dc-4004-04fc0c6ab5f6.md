## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best captures Madison's argument in Federalist No. 10 about how a federal system mitigates the danger of factions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about Madison's core premise that factions are inevitable in a republic. Then, I should verify the mechanism he proposes in a large, federal republic. Next, I will examine each answer choice against that mechanism. Finally, I will select the option that aligns most closely with Madison's reasoning and briefly justify why the alternatives are weaker or incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the premise so I don't jump to conclusions: Madison does not claim we can eliminate factions; he argues they arise naturally from liberty and unequal property, so the task is to control their effects rather than prevent their existence, which immediately makes option A suspect because it implies factions can be blocked outright rather than moderated [^notfound].

> I need to check the mechanism Madison actually proposes. In a large, federal republic, he contends that the multiplicity of interests and the diffusion of power across states and branches make it unlikely that any single faction can assemble a majority capable of oppressing others, thereby limiting the capacity of factions to dominate and harm the republic, which points toward making it hard for one faction to gain governing power rather than banning factions or mandating equal representation [^notfound].

> Now, let me consider option A carefully. "Insurmountable obstacles to the founding of factions" overstates Madison's position; he explicitly treats factions as inevitable byproducts of liberty, so the goal is control, not eradication, which means A is inconsistent with the text and should be excluded [^notfound].

> Next, I should review option B. "Making it difficult for one faction to gain the power necessary to govern" matches Madison's argument that a large republic fragments interests and disperses authority, so no single faction can reliably form a majority and impose its will, which is precisely how the federal system reduces factional danger without eliminating factions themselves [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about option C. "Requiring equal representation of all factions" sounds appealing, but Madison does not propose a quota-based or guaranteed representation scheme; his mechanism is structural and probabilistic, relying on the sheer number and diversity of interests to blunt factional dominance, so C imposes a requirement that the text does not endorse and is therefore misleading [^notfound].

> I will now examine option D. "Restricting factional political activity to the state level only" misreads Madison; the federal system coordinates national and state levels and deliberately diffuses power across both, rather than confining factional activity to states, so D is too narrow and mischaracterizes the federal design Madison defends [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the best answer is B, because Madison's central claim is that in a large, federal republic the proliferation of diverse interests and the separation of powers make it structurally difficult for any one faction to consolidate enough power to govern oppressively, thereby mitigating the danger factions pose to republican government [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **B. making it difficult for one faction to gain the power necessary to govern**. Madison argues that a federal system reduces factional danger by **diluting factional influence** across a large, diverse republic, so no single faction can easily dominate. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because Madison does not claim factions are prevented, that equal representation is required, or that factional activity is restricted to the states.

## Madison's argument in Federalist No. 10

Madison defines factions as groups united by a common interest adverse to the rights of others or the community good. He views factions as inevitable in a free society because people have diverse interests and opinions. The challenge, then, is not to eliminate factions but to **control their effects** [^notfound].

---

## Mechanism of controlling factions in a federal system

Madison argues that a federal system — especially a large, diverse republic — mitigates factional influence through two main mechanisms:

- **Dilution of factional influence**: In a large republic, factions are more numerous and diverse, making it harder for any single faction to gain a majority and impose its will on others. This dilution of influence reduces the risk of tyranny by a majority faction [^notfound].

- **Representation and filtration**: A federal system with elected representatives filters and refines public opinion, making it less likely that a passionate faction will directly control government decisions. Representatives are expected to consider the broader public good rather than narrow factional interests [^notfound].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Analysis** |
|-|-|
| A. Creating insurmountable obstacles to the founding of factions | Incorrect. Madison explicitly states that factions are inevitable in a free society, so the federal system does not create insurmountable obstacles to their formation [^notfound]. |
| B. Making it difficult for one faction to gain the power necessary to govern | Correct. Madison argues that the federal system dilutes factional influence, making it difficult for any single faction to gain enough power to dominate the government [^notfound]. |
| C. Requiring equal representation of all factions within the government | Incorrect. Madison does not argue for equal representation of all factions; rather, he emphasizes the dilution of factional influence through a large, diverse republic and representative government [^notfound]. |
| D. Restricting factional political activity to the state level only | Incorrect. Madison does not propose restricting factional activity to the state level; instead, he argues that a federal system balances power between national and state governments, thereby limiting factional influence [^notfound]. |

---

## Conclusion

Madison's argument in Federalist No. 10 is that a federal system reduces the danger of political factions by **making it difficult for any single faction to gain the power necessary to govern**. This is achieved through the dilution of factional influence across a large, diverse republic and the filtration of public opinion through elected representatives. Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^9d2fadcf]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### Political activism and the dermatologist [^65d421dc]. Dermatologic Clinics (2023). Medium credibility.

The practice of medicine is governed by legislation and regulation at the state and national level. It is crucial, therefore, that dermatologists become and remain involved in the process to advocate for their patients, their practices, and the specialty itself. Maintaining a relationship with one's state and federal senators and representatives is critical for physicians to have a voice in the shaping of health care policy. Local, state, and national medical and specialty societies are a tremendous resource for physicians to remain abreast of policies affecting the practice of medicine.

### Plagues, public health, and politics [^aaeeb7f2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Smallpox

The decision to implement widespread vaccination against smallpox generated substantial interest in the general public. After believing that smallpox was not a threat for many years, we were informed by the government that cause for serious alarm existed.

Production of large quantities of vaccine was accelerated, which was a prudent and decisive action. This action was followed by a policy that called for vaccinations for hundreds of thousands of healthcare workers and millions of first responders. The science on which this decision was based seemed shaky at best, and many chose to forego vaccination, including two distinguished academic infectious disease units. The Washington Post criticized these units, saying, "There are reasons, moral and medical, to deplore the decision of those doctors who refuse in this manner… Their job is not to assess intelligence risks or to second-guess state public health officials but to be prepared to care for sick people, and to vaccinate healthy people".

The Post's statement may be correct, but academic infectious disease specialists have every right and responsibility to question decision-making that affects their patients and colleagues, especially when the scientific-political interface regarding that decision is unclear. Careful review of the literature and expert experience predicted substantial risks from adverse vaccination reactions.

The Washington Post editors seem to have missed the concept of "do no harm". Analytic and compassionate physicians realized that, in the face of little or no threat of an attack, widespread use of a potentially toxic vaccine was not in the best interest of their patients. The decision by various academic medical centers not to widely vaccinate hospital and medical personnel seems prudent, given the revised estimates of risk and the reporting of substantial adverse reactions.

Bioterrorism is not the only infectious disease challenge with political implications. Existing pathogens and newly emerging diseases remind us that infectious agents can destabilize our social structure and commerce, and they may require political or policy intervention. Therefore, the danger is that ideologic stances may intrude on the process and push us away from science and even away from good public health practice.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^bf9ec7bb]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

The constitutional setting for foodborne disease surveillance and control — public health agencies operate in the context of the U.S. Constitution, and principal features relevant to these agencies include the three-branch system of government, federalism, and protection for civil liberties and property rights; public health agencies belong to the executive branch and are broadly charged to implement laws enacted by the legislature and as interpreted by the courts. In the federal system, the Constitution enumerates specified powers for the federal government and reserves other powers to the states (tribes are autonomous or sovereign bodies), and state and local governments possess inherent police powers to protect the health and safety of the public. The Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments protect citizens from unreasonable searches and from deprivation of life, liberty, and private property without due process of law, and state constitutions, statutory law, and court rulings provide additional protections relevant to the conduct of foodborne disease surveillance and operations by public health agencies.

### Landmark plastic surgeon advocacy within the federal government: four case studies [^c91e2683]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Throughout history, plastic surgeons have advocated for the protection of the specialty and for better care for their patients. Whether through efforts to support and move legislation through Congress or through preventative advocacy in the form of lobbying against legislation, plastic surgeons have often used their expertise in the political sphere to shape patient care. We hope to inspire current and future plastic surgeons to be politically active and to devise ways in which their expertise can be used within the legislative system to better care for their patients.

Methods

This article highlights four historical examples of plastic surgeon-led advocacy within the federal government: the U.S. Flammable Fabrics Act; the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons and the Federal Trade Commission, 1979; the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act; and the Breast Cancer Patient Education Act.

Results

We hope that plastic surgeons will-like Dr. Crikelair, Dr. Wider, and the members of American Society of Plastic Surgeons/American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons-continue to play an active role in the shaping of the legislative system for our profession and, ultimately, our patients.

Conclusions

To ensure the best care for their patients, plastic surgeons must continue to maintain their relationship with public health and legal professionals and legislators. Through relationships with patients and a firm understanding of their stories, plastic surgeons can have great impacts in all local, state, and national political spheres.

### Opioid policy changes during the COVID-19 pandemic-and beyond [^a47069cd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The United States is currently in the midst of 2 public health emergencies: COVID-19 and the ongoing opioid crisis. In an attempt to reduce preventable harm to individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD), federal, state, and local governments have temporarily modified law and policy to increase access to OUD treatment and divert some individuals at high risk away from the correctional system. In this Commentary, we briefly describe how people with OUD are at increased risk for COVID-19, discuss existing policy barriers to evidence-based prevention and treatment for individuals with OUD, explain the temporary rollbacks of those barriers, and argue that these changes should be made permanent. We also suggest several additional steps that federal and state governments can urgently take to reduce barriers to care for individuals with OUD, both during the current crisis and beyond.

### Foresight approaches for future health shocks: integration into policy making and accompanying research priorities [^4d2f56fa]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Reality of politics and policy

Finally, one overarching, unresolved problem remains: how to accommodate emergency preparedness within the reality of politics as well as policy. How do we support resilient, long term (often over decades) policy making within short term electoral cycles and concerns? How do we support choosing optimal policies, in line with articulated values and objectives, if they conflict with the current political situation?

Perhaps, then, the final future research strand needs to be how to move from an aim of optimal policy making to one that is pragmatic and "good enough" — that is, resilient to the vagaries of politics and high turnover of decision makers at all levels.

### The WHO pandemic treaty: where are we on our scepticism? [^d8846c7f]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

For starter, the COVID-19 pandemic offers many lessons on these vulnerabilities — that is, how fast international agreements and mechanisms for cooperation that are based on charity dissipate when countries are plagued by a shared biological threat. Interestingly, some countries have legislation that also prohibits the export of pandemic-related supplies in the event of public health emergencies, and we have seen the restriction on exporting MCMs from Asia, the USA and Europe. Moreover, for those countries with manufacturing capacity, who may sign on initially to securing supplies for the WHO, how long they would remain committed to equitable patience once the scramble begins is also unclear. Particularly, many governments are driven to appease their electorate, who will hold them accountable if they fail to deliver quickly enough. On top of that, the return of balance of power in politics in the international system and the fluid political nature of global health generate so many uncertainties because more often than not, global health aid is a tool for international diplomacy as much as for human health.

### Political impediments to a tobacco endgame [^e0af7e33]. Tobacco Control (2013). Low credibility.

Substantial political impediments

First, it is hard to envision any future Congress bridging its sharp divides to embrace a tobacco endgame. This is problematic because any meaningful American engagement of such goals would be likely to entail new federal legislation, given the limitations of sub-federal policy and the fragility of unilateral federal executive branch actions. However, tobacco control has witnessed only 'occasional bursts of federal activity' and does not appear particularly well poised to elevate its standing on future congressional agendas. The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act emerged from a near-perfect storm of political circumstances that are unlikely to be replicated anytime soon. For advocates to raise the issue successfully into a congressional priority, they would probably have to explain why this historic legislation was inadequate, while making a compelling case to elevate tobacco elimination over a range of other issue claimants and also persuading legislators to forego an attractive source of campaign funding. If anything, the well-known hurdles imposed by the American separation-of-powers system have only been exacerbated by the emergence of deeply polarised political parties that increasingly operate in ways that are consistent with a parliamentary system. This phenomenon undermines the political prospects for any serious legislative proposal, with each previously advanced endgame option posing its own unique challenges for securing future congressional uptake.

Second, there are enormous constraints on any efforts to try to launch major federal policies solely through executive branch initiatives. Federal agency entrepreneurship does offer one potential alternative, with ample American precedent for an 'administrative presidency' approach designed to expand executive branch powers through agency reinterpretation of existing statutes. The Food and Drug Administration would be most likely to assume the lead role in such case, probably through an expansive reading of its powers under the 2009 legislation. This strategy has long faced considerable hurdles, however. It presumes not only strong and sustainable agency leadership, but also steadfast support from multiple presidents, no congressional backlash, successful deflection of inevitable court challenges and robust public support. This is hardly a reliable formula for transformational policy.

### Overcoming congressional inertia on obesity requires better literacy in obesity science [^b93fa38a]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Obesity-focused health policies, including the landmark Treat and Reduce Obesity Act, have stalled at the federal level over the past decade. Congressional inaction on obesity reflects both misconceptions of obesity as a lifestyle choice and limited awareness for the burden obesity imposes on our health care system. Given these challenges, we argue that health professionals must bolster their efforts to partner with public figures with obesity and to directly educate the public. These strategies may help destigmatize obesity and build awareness of obesity as a disease. Furthermore, we suggest that these strategies may empower patients to flex their unrealized political muscle and demand more from their elected leaders. A bold, multilevel approach that elicits a public demand for change can propel obesity policy into the 21st century.

### Suicide and political regime in new south wales and Australia during the 20th century [^d7b69238]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Australia has had a two party parliamentary political system for most of the period since its Federation in 1901, dominated either by a social democratic (Labor) or a conservative ideological perspective. This paper investigates whether such political differences at Federal and State levels have influenced suicide rates in the state of New South Wales (NSW) for the period 1901–1998.

Design

Federal government type, NSW State government type, and combinations of both Federal and NSW State government type were examined. Poisson regression models were stratified by sex and controlled for the effects of age, annual change in gross domestic product, sedative availability, drought, and both world wars.

Results

When both Federal and NSW State governments were conservative the relative risk of suicide for NSW men was 1.17 (p < 0.001) and for women 1.40 (p < 0.001) compared with both governments being Labor (1.00). A statistically significant linear trend (p < 0.001) in suicide risk was evident across the continuum of Federal/State government combinations, from both Labor (lowest), to mixed (intermediate), to both conservative (highest).

Conclusion

Significantly higher suicide risk was associated with conservative government tenures compared with social democratic incumbents. Results are discussed in terms of the differences underpinning conservative and social democratic government programme ideology, and their relevance to Durkheim's theories of suicide, social regulation, and integration.

### Understanding Washington: a nephrologist's perspective from inside the beltway [^c302078c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The major principles that drive U.S. federal health policy-making are: (1) fixed or reduced costs, (2) ensured outcomes (or no evidence of undertreatment), (3) streamlined administration, and (4) political viability. A corollary is that providers are uniquely sensitive to financial incentives. Understanding these principles is vital to understanding federal health policy. Critically, these principles are nonpartisan and have been supported and used by all administrations since President Reagan. This article examines the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) prospective payment system, colloquially called "The Bundle", in the context of these major principles. Successful health policy, successful legislation, and successful regulation building all require executive leadership, mutual trust, and compromise. This is demonstrated by the events surrounding the passage of the Medicare inpatient prospective payment system, which governs hospital reimbursement for Medicare beneficiaries, including those not covered in the ESRD program. Given that the ESRD benefit consumes 6.3% of the Medicare budget for approximately 2% of Medicare beneficiaries, if nephrology is to experience future success, we must change how both policymakers and the wider field of medicine perceive our specialty. Understanding the major principles behind health care policy may facilitate this goal.

### From response to transformation: how countries can strengthen national pandemic preparedness and response systems [^97d574f7]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Transforming and building resilient and equitable societies

Effort is needed to prepare and maintain responses grounded in robust local capacities. Ultimately, the only true preparedness is transformational change that prioritises global solidarity, and protects the health and wellbeing of people, communities, and the planet. The pandemic has brought to the fore a crisis of governance, highlighting gaps in accountability (at all levels), questioning practices of representation, power relations, and hierarchies. Indeed, political leadership and decision making have been at the heart of responses to covid-19, and are among the determinants for successes and failures of a response. Thus, achieving and sustaining high performing responses requires a shift in mindsets beyond political and economic consideration and towards health promotion across sectors and governance, to create healthy societies.

11. Building resilient and equitable societies requires a serious shift in mindsets to engage with and create policies that reflect the broader social, economic, environmental, and political factors in society. Health programmes and responses to covid-19 must no longer remain gender neutral and community blind. A change of paradigms must be accomplished through re-politicisation, foregrounding human rights and equality concerns.

12. Targeted and long term social protection of vulnerable populations should be integral to a whole-of-society approach, and should offer security in terms of food, housing, and income.

13. Implement a collaborative, gender responsive, and equitable whole-of-society approach that engages civil society, business, and government at all levels, in acknowledgment of the intersectional nature of health and wellbeing, while also dismantling inherent structural marginalisation and inequalities.

14. Implement a whole-of-government approach that ensures access to health services and protection against discrimination and vulnerabilities.

15. Heads of state and government should appoint national pandemic coordinators accountable to the highest levels of government, with the mandate to drive whole-of-government coordination for both preparedness and response.

### Reflections from the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany: lessons for global health [^8853e3aa]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Germany's strategy was to prevent the healthcare system from becoming overburdened and reduce fatalities. The main guidance during the pandemic was to protect oneself in order to protect others — a message of solidarity. The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's National Public Health Institute (NPHI), was tasked with coordinating the pandemic response. It was only because of years of networking with federal and local health authorities prior to the pandemic that this interaction which was based on trust, contributed to a good response. However, even a high-performing healthcare system is vulnerable under extreme pressure. There is no magic bullet and the successful handling of an epidemic wave depends on different factors and circumstances.

To summarise, what have we learnt from our experience?

Trust is crucial to handling any global health crisis. Globally, some governments enjoyed more public trust than others. Going forward, it is essential to better understand human behaviour and for populations to have confidence in the decisions of their scientists and local public health authorities and to be empowered to make equally good choices. Human behaviour is driven not just by education, but by living conditions too. That said, one is not compelled to trust the decisions taken by authorities and trust needs to be built. Every individual has the freedom to discern, think critically and question the reliability and expertise of scientists as well as the decisions of authorities. In a public health crisis, scientists, health authorities and governments must, therefore, do everything in their power to lay all the facts on the table, in a transparent and coherent manner. Scientists are obliged to recognise the limitations of their expertise, continue to seek strong evidence and communicate uncertainties transparently, while governments are obliged to implement measures and regulations that follow a logical pattern based on evidence. Scientific dissent in a crisis does not make a strong case for trust, and scientists must take responsibility for the recommendations they make. In Germany, the NPHI, which presented technical guidelines but had no legal mandate to implement these (as this lies within the mandate of the federal state governments), enjoyed the highest level of trust by the general population as compared with government and other institutions, though with time some of this trust declined. While most NPHIs are normally embedded within a governmental structure, which provides them with a legal mandate and framework, the science behind the public health recommendations comes from an interdisciplinary team of scientists and is independent of governmental influence. It is essential this remains so. While governments come and go and their policies change, public health institutions remain true to basic public health concepts. This stability is important towards trust building.
Public health communication: Trust is built with dialogue and transparent communication. However, experts faced many communicative challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic was the first pandemic in history where technology and social media dominated communication. This same technology also amplified infodemics. The communication triad — political, scientific and media communication — often resulted in incoherent public messages, which can be extremely challenging for society. In a global crisis, the public seeks order and stability while scientists adapt methods based on new findings. Public health often requires citizens to make the right individual choices that have a positive domino effect on the general population. Communication must, therefore, be strengthened, but it cannot be a one-way street. Especially when dealing with a pluralistic and democratic society, it is imperative to maintain the delicate balance between information and persuasion, without drifting into the manipulative or coercive territory. Furthermore, communication must be aligned with the aim of serving the common good. The role of behavioural scientists and ethics professionals is crucial to this important task. In future it might also be helpful to make better use of trusted spaces for the purpose of crisis communication, such as public museums, educational institutions and houses of worship which could present the best opportunity for engagement and dialogue.
Public health systems must be strengthened. This requires expertise and professionals, cooperation between public health actors, transparent and barrier-free exchange of information and data, and modern equipment and technology. In Germany, the government invested in a pact for public health since the first year of the pandemic. This bold move strengthened local health authorities and thus supported the work of the NPHI. Achieving health for all is a sustainable goal and it involves strengthening healthcare and public health everywhere, not just in countries with good health systems in place. Stronger public health systems must assist weaker ones in an act of global solidarity.
Digitalising healthcare and public health: Evidence-based recommendations are made possible by an expert's ability to process and analyse large quantities of data rapidly. In Germany, it is difficult to source data from a single source because such a system does not yet exist. In contrast, the German healthcare system is so siloed, that information barriers are particularly high. In a crisis, however, essential data must be made available to decision-makers and advisors quickly. The full potential of secondary data for health intelligence needs to be tapped better. The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in public health is just beginning to take shape. However, while some countries are optimising existing systems and thinking about the benefits of AI, many lack a basic system for data collection, validation and analysis. There is an urgent need to build capacity and create systems and structures that enable decision-makers globally to act in the interest of global health.
Finally, we have to prepare for the next crisis. Not every country has the same ability to respond to a crisis. Pandemic preparedness is a central task of every NPHI and every public health system needs to optimise its ability to respond to future crises. Reducing Public Health Institutes to Health protection Agencies, therefore, is a strategic misconception. We require global coordination and structures that aid this process and which can be addressed at a local, national and international level, while strengthening our surveillance and warning systems, protecting vulnerable communities and improving tailored health information. Countries must aim for health in all policies and NPHIs whose work covers the essential public health operations. We require treaties and regulations that bind nations towards certain responsibilities and duties. Member states must commit to strengthening the WHO while aiming for better sharing of resources, whether commodities or intellectual property.

### Policy and planning for large epidemics and pandemics-challenges and lessons learned from COVID-19 [^bfa0348e]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

One key lesson from COVID-19 in translating evidence into policy is the necessity of considering broad expertise. Early responses often over-relied on traditional epidemiological data and public health responses to curtail transmission, failing to integrate and balance economic, social, and political considerations. Biases and incorrect extrapolations from experience with previous similar diseases could also play a role, such as assuming that, since there was no asymptomatic transmission of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-1), the same was true with SARS-CoV-2. Informed complex multifaceted policy decisions will rely on transparent, explicit, preplanned, and institutionally led processes to create, evaluate and communicate evidence, while managing political or commercial interests. Regardless of whether institutions undergo internal organizational reform, modify external structures to alter lines of reporting and accountability, or establish formal legal protections, converting evidence into policy will be a critical function.

### The assassination of John F. Kennedy: revisiting the medical data [^0abfde44]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Doubt continues to surround the assassination of President Kennedy to this day. Unfortunately, the controversy was not diminished by the multiple commissions and panels that were convened to investigate it. This was in large part because these various panels continued to propagate much of the confusion and lack of precision that plagued the initial medical reports, and introduced some new confusion of their own. Much of this controversy was driven by incomplete information, poor documentation and analysis, and the puzzling decision to withhold key medical evidence both from investigators and the public. However, the preponderance of evidence does show that the single-shooter, three-bullet theory is plausible both medically and scientifically.

### Are national policies on global health in fact national policies on global health governance? A comparison of policy designs from Norway and Switzerland [^4734fd78]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Rationales and assumptions

Norway's history of leadership and contributions to global health as an important state actor are the cornerstone of the rationale for its policy (see ref.section 2). Examples of Norway's development aid, its global health projects and its role in initiatives like GAVI and the GFATM (see ref.pp. 7, 12, 20–23, 34, 44) or the Foreign Policy and Global Health Initiative (see ref.pp. 11, 36, 38, 43) serve to justify the logic for continuity of Norway's political leadership in global health and the path dependence of its programmes in this domain. The Norwegian policy is premised on the assumption that there is a need to combine national responsibility with global collective action for improving health on a global scale (see ref.pp. 5–7, 13, 24, 25, 43). An individual's right to health is a responsibility of national governments and health systems to ensure, but collective action at the international level is needed to support countries with limited capacity.

The underlying assumption of the Swiss policy is that working responsibly with governance of the evolving global health architecture necessitates administrative devices for structured intersectoral collaboration at the federal level (see ref.p. 18, 19). The Swiss rationale is that the institutionalisation of dialogue to improve opportunities for coherence across policy sectors in the Swiss context will increase the credibility of Swiss negotiations on global health policy positions in international settings (see ref.p. 9, 10, 13–15). The arguments rely on the experience of a previous agreement between the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and the Federal Department of Home Affairs on Swiss health foreign policy objectives (see ref.p. 7, 3–35] to demonstrate the success of tools for interdepartmental co-operation on matters of health and foreign policy.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^500f6832]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Media and public health law — federal and state powers for communicable disease control state that U.S. federal law permits the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to take measures to prevent spread of diseases when state or U.S. possession actions are insufficient, and measures may include inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, and destruction of animals or articles believed to be sources of infection. A person who has a communicable disease during the transmissible period can be restricted from traveling from one state or possession to another without a permit from the state or territorial health officer, or destination locality. For interstate conveyances on which a case or suspected case develops, the person in charge is required, as soon as practicable, to notify the local health authority at the next port of call, station, or stop, and to take measures to prevent the spread of the disease as the local health authority directs. State laws authorize quarantine and isolation powers, often granted in the state public health code, and courts have consistently upheld these powers as consistent with state police powers; scope varies, with some states having broad powers applicable to any emerging infectious disease threat and others targeting specific conditions. Constitutional limitations apply, requiring compliance with procedural and substantive due process and that when deprivation of liberty involves a fundamental right the government must demonstrate a compelling interest and that the power is narrowly tailored to achieve a public health goal. Other community containment uses of state police powers, such as social distancing, event cancellation, and related strategies, also may raise constitutional concerns but are less restrictive on liberties and therefore less likely to face strict scrutiny by a court.

### Relevance of federal antitrust statutes to clinical practice [^ea241304]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

With the advent of Medicare prospective payment systems, health care entities and physicians were forced to decrease expenses by sharing services and to increase revenue by attempting to jointly negotiate better reimbursement from third- party payers. Both activities have raised the specter of prosecution under antitrust laws that have been with us for more than a century but are poorly understood by practicing physicians. Recent monopolistic activities in the health care arena have prompted the Federal Trade Commission to file actions under specific acts of Congress, eg, the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, Clayton Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, Robinson-Patman Act, and Celler-Kefauver Act. Inasmuch as it is likely that specialties such as vascular surgery as a business will undergo substantial transformation, physicians need to be aware of the severe civil and criminal sanctions imposed if they are found guilty; fines that are several times actual damages; activities that raise antitrust issues including utilization review, medical staff privileges for competing specialties, participating provider agreements, and predatory pricing; and affirmative defenses and relief available in terms of specific exemptions. As health care providers react, innovate, and adjust to stay solvent, their business strategies will surely continue to be scrutinized for antitrust behavior by federal and state officials. The physician must have a basic understanding of the groundrules that govern any contemplated business strategy so that common pitfalls may be averted.

### The end of managed care [^f03aaf1a]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Managed care embodies an effort by employers, the insurance industry, and some elements of the medical profession to establish priorities and decide who gets what from the health care system. After a turbulent decade of trial and error, that experiment can be characterized as an economic success but a political failure. The strategy of giving with one hand while taking away with the other, of offering comprehensive benefits while restricting access through utilization review, has infuriated everyone involved. The protagonists of managed care now are in full retreat, broadening physician panels, removing restrictions, and reverting to fee-for-service payment. Governmental entities are avoiding politically volatile initiatives to balance limited resources and unlimited expectations. By default, if not by design, the consumer is emerging as the locus of priority setting in health care. The shift to consumerism is driven by a widespread skepticism of governmental, corporate, and professional dominance; unprecedented economic prosperity that reduces social tolerance for interference with individual autonomy; and the Internet technology revolution, which broadens access to information and facilitates the mass customization of insurance and delivery.

### A policy for science [^3606bbbd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Policy and science often interact. Typically, we think of policymakers looking to scientists for advice on issues informed by science. We may appreciate less the opposite look: where people outside science inform policies that affect the conduct of science. In clinical medicine, we are forced to make decisions about practices for which there is insufficient, inadequate evidence to know whether they improve clinical outcomes, yet the health care system may not be structured to rapidly generate needed evidence. For example, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services noted insufficient evidence to support routine use of computed tomography angiography and they called for a national commitment to completion of randomized trials, their call ran into substantial opposition. I use the computed tomography angiography story to illustrate how we might consider a "policy for science" in which stakeholders would band together to identify evidence gaps and to use their influence to promote the efficient design, implementation, and completion of high-quality randomized trials. Such a policy for science could create a culture that incentivizes and invigorates the rapid generation of evidence, ultimately engaging all clinicians, all patients, and indeed all stakeholders into the scientific enterprise.

### Must I respond if my health is at risk? [^f9013893]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Widespread epidemics, pandemics, and other risk-prone disasters occur with disturbing regularity. When such events occur, how should, and will, clinicians respond? The moral backbone of medical professionals-a duty to put the needs of patients first-may be sorely tested.

Discussion

It is incumbent on health care professionals to ask what we must do and what we should do if a dangerous health care situation threatens both ourselves and our community. Despite numerous medical ethical codes, nothing-either morally or legally-requires a response to risk-prone situations from civilian clinicians; it remains a personal decision. The most important questions are: What will encourage us to respond to these situations? And will we respond? These questions are necessary, not only for physicians and other direct health care providers, but also for vital health care system support personnel. Those who provide care in the face of perceived risk demonstrate heroic bravery, but the choice to do so has varied throughout history. To improve individual response rates, disaster planners and managers must communicate the risks clearly to all members of the health care system and help mitigate their risks by providing them with as much support and security as possible.

Conclusions

The decision to remain in or to leave a risky health care situation will ultimately depend on the provider's own risk assessment and value system. If history is any guide, we can rest assured that most clinicians will choose to stay, following the heroic example established through the centuries and continuing today.

### Beyond the individual: community-centric approaches to increase diversity in biomedical research [^05260d3b]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Challenges to community consent lie in the often lack of clear systems to gain the necessary approvals. A community can be defined in many ways and not all communities have hierarchical structures. Unlike in our work — where gaining approval from the CSKT Tribal Council presents a direct path to community consent — identifying leadership and accurately distinguishing helpful and harmful power dynamics in other communities can be unclear. Researchers working with amorphous communities may encounter additional challenges when attempting to identify appropriate advisors or decision makers to guide research. Identifying leaders, or coresearchers, within the community to provide a diverse representation of community members to offer insight on health priorities, potential areas of research, and culturally appropriate recruitment practices may be valuable, but this approach may not be possible in all communities. When there is no clear oversight structure, identifying synergistic grassroots efforts and community-based organizations may be an option as a starting point for developing research partnerships.

Many scholars also argue that community consent is antithetical to the principles of informed consent. Consent hinges upon the autonomy of the individual. Gaining community consent can lead to or enhance complex power structures between community leaders and members that may allow for coercion of individuals, both to participate to appease leadership or to abstain when leaders believe there is a potential risk to the community. In short, the politics and political structures, or lack thereof, within communities need to be considered when seeking community consent.

In our current political state, arguing for a community-level consent process may be difficult to conceptualize. We do not argue against individual autonomy to participate in biomedical research. Instead, we encourage researchers to reconsider a community's autonomy when that community does not fall into the norms of the majority and are not adequately protected by traditional informed consent. The model of individual informed consent is well accepted, yet dynamic. Written informed consent requirements were set by the NIH in the 1960s and not federally mandated until the 1970s, with shifts in these policies over the course of the last 50 years. Advancements in research should allow for advancements in policies around human participants protection, which in some cases may require disclosures to an individual for potential risks to their community.

### The psychology of American racism [^59a5364a]. The American Psychologist (2021). Medium credibility.

American racism is alive and well. In this essay, we amass a large body of classic and contemporary research across multiple areas of psychology (e.g., cognitive, developmental, social), as well as the broader social sciences (e.g., sociology, communication studies, public policy), and humanities (e.g., critical race studies, history, philosophy), to outline seven factors that contribute to American racism: (a) Categories, which organize people into distinct groups by promoting essentialist and normative reasoning; (b) Factions, which trigger ingroup loyalty and intergroup competition and threat; (c) Segregation, which hardens racist perceptions, preferences, and beliefs through the denial of intergroup contact; (d) Hierarchy, which emboldens people to think, feel, and behave in racist ways; (e) Power, which legislates racism on both micro and macro levels; (f) Media, which legitimize overrepresented and idealized representations of White Americans while marginalizing and minimizing people of color; and (g) Passivism, such that overlooking or denying the existence of racism obscures this reality, encouraging others to do the same and allowing racism to fester and persist. We argue that these and other factors support American racism, and we conclude with suggestions for future research, particularly in the domain of identifying ways to promote antiracism.

### Reproductive self-determination and regulation of termination of pregnancy in Germany: current controversies and developments [^37ab6349]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

In Germany, efforts to reform current legislation governing access to termination of pregnancy (TOP) have recently gained momentum. In 2023, the German Federal Government appointed a 'Commission on Reproductive Self-Determination and Reproductive Medicine', which released recommendations to revise legislation of TOP in April 2024. Currently, TOP is unlawful under the German Criminal Code, with exemptions from punishment for TOP performed within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy following mandatory counselling. Additional exemptions exist in case of criminological or medical-social indications. The Commission report recommends the decriminalisation of early-stage TOP and potential abolition of the mandatory counselling requirement. It further recommends a revision of the medical-social indication, due to a lack of clarity in its interpretation. This indication allows for TOP beyond 12 weeks of pregnancy, where there is danger to the pregnant woman's life or health. This paper provides an overview of Germany's current TOP regulation and the Commission's recommendations, with a particular focus on the ethical and legal challenges posed by the application of the current medical-social indication in cases of fetal anomalies. We argue that while legislative clarity is important, maintaining a broad interpretation of the medical-social indication is crucial to prevent undue restrictions on TOP access at later gestations. The Commission report represents a promising step forward in changes for TOP legislation in Germany, and we welcome its call for legal reform. However, given the outcome of the recent federal election in February 2025, it is unlikely that the revision of TOP legislation will be part of the new government's agenda.

### What can one legitimately expect from a health system? A conceptual analysis and a proposal for research and action [^7f04411e]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Participation and contestation across different political systems and realities

It is important to acknowledge that the above discussion around the establishment of legitimacy of expectations from a health system assumes and refers to an 'ideal' liberal democratic context where participation and contestation are seen as basic citizen rights and spaces for participation are many, are formalised, and tend to have constitutional bases. Political systems vary in their degree of political space for citizen participation and in the bases, processes, and platforms for citizens to participate in public discourse and policy. For instance, one can expect this to be different across single-party political systems and dictatorships as in parts of the Middle East, Latin American and parts of East Asia, to two-party or multi-party systems in liberal democracies in different parts of the world. Therefore, we argue that any scholarship that seeks to understand the nature of contestation and participation (including but not limited to health services-related matters) needs to explicitly take into account the political system context. While it is not within the scope of this analysis to examine how the processes of contestation and participation for establishing 'legitimate' expectations varies across political systems, we propose this as an area for future research. As an illustration, we look at the case of some countries in East Asia that have single-party polities. In these countries, understandings of citizen participation (and contestation) in the public sphere are influenced by the doctrine of 'Minben', a distinctly paternalistic idea in which the power of the government is based on responding to the welfare of common people and not in extending autonomy or participation in government. Within the Minben doctrine, the scope of citizens' political participation is limited to conveying their concerns to political leaders, with leaders having the power and freedom to deviate from public opinion when implementing policy. In this way, governmental legitimacy is established through the outcomes of policy, rather than through fair elections, such as in liberal democracies. It is therefore important to recognise that, in such polities, prevailing political traditions may constrain or even prevent the creation of 'invited spaces' for citizen participation and contestation in public policy. Moreover, peoples' expectations of their role could also be shaped by these cultural and political traditions, and they may in fact regard political leaders as, 'guardians of their interests' (p. 129). This, in turn, could influence their desire to contest and participate.

### Collaboration between public health and law enforcement: the constitutional challenge [^dc74c10d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Constitutional Limitations

The Constitution is the source of all legal authority in the United States. Written in 1789, the Constitution was shaped by the events of the time. The weak union of the Articles of Confederation made it difficult to wage the Revolutionary War, so the Constitution provided a strong central government with the power to wage war and raise revenue directly, without depending on state legislatures. The abuses of power by English colonial governors led to the Constitution's Bill of Rights, which strictly limits the state's powers to prosecute and punish individuals for violating the laws — the criminal law power — and to seize personal property for governmental use — the takings power.

At the same time, the terrible toll exacted on the colonies by epidemic disease led the drafters to allow the states very broad powers to abate nuisances and regulate other threats to the public health. The public health authority is known as the police powers, as in "to police", meaning to clean up. Formal law-enforcement departments were formed several years after the ratification of the Constitution. Originally, these departments had broader responsibilities than do modern law-enforcement agencies, including some public health functions, so calling them police forces was more consistent with their original function than their current one.

### Medical futility: a new look at an old problem [^b1e463fc]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Efforts to answer the question of whether or when physicians may unilaterally refuse to provide treatments they deem medically futile, but that are nonetheless demanded by patients or their surrogates, have been characterized as intractable failures. We propose a new look at this old problem and suggest reframing the debate in terms of the implicit social contract, in healthy democracies, between the medical profession and the society it serves. This ever-evolving contract is predicated upon providing patients with beneficial and desired medical care within the constraints of scarce resources and the characteristics of our health-care system. The contract ranges over a continuum of decisions, from those that do not need an explicit negotiated agreement with the patient or surrogate, to those that do. Between these two poles lies a contentious gray area, where the rights and obligations of patients and physicians are being shaped continuously by the many forces that are at play in a democratic society, including professional guidelines, social advocacy, legislation, and litigation. We provide examples of how this gray area has been and is negotiated around rights to refuse and demand a variety of life-sustaining treatments, and anticipate conflicts likely to arise in the future. Reframing the futility debate in this way reveals that the issue is not a story of intractable failure, but rather, a successful narrative about how democracies balance the legitimate perspectives of patients and physicians against a backdrop of societal constraints and values.

### COVID-19: time for paradigm shift in the nexus between local, national and global health [^033bc8c0]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

One real result of fragmentation of global health governance is an inefficient division of labour, where hundreds of actors such as the WHO, Global Fund, President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief, United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS, United States Agency for International Development, World Bank, the Gates Foundation and the Clinton Foundation (to name only a few) produce parallel programmes or bric-à-brac vertical health silos that have neither generated overall system strengthening in high burden countries nor allowed for effective global health policy. This creates two failures. First, contrary to sector-wide approaches, vertical 'pet-project' global initiatives often fail to promote sustainable long-term local health system strengthening, which is the best preventive defence for disease control (of all types, not just infectious diseases). Second, the global level is woefully unprepared for epidemics, since global policy has remained reactionary, symptom-based and dependent on vaccine discoveries without full appreciation of other upstream determinants of disease and access to those vaccines.

Given the state of global health governance and inadequate investments in health system strengthening — as well as the failure, by many actors, to adopt a 'systems approach' to problem resolution — the spread and danger of COVID-19 is not surprising. What is required, we argue, is to shift global health policymaking from a specific reactional paradigm to a systemic, holistic and preventive paradigm. There is no doubt that this approach will require serious resources, governance reform and political will. Nevertheless, the global economic costs of COVID-19 have already reached into at least a trillion dollars. Thus, serious efforts to improve global and local health systems would be a small fraction of this cost, with a tried and true cost-saving philosophy that 'an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure'.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### The pandemic treaty, the pandemic fund, and the global commons: our scepticism [^0e2a54cb]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

COVID-19 revealed the limitations of the International Health Regulations

When the WHO declared SARS-CoV-2, the virus which caused COVID-19 disease a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the WHO's highest alarm in response to an infectious disease outbreak, 'none of us will be safe until everyone is safe' was the mantra for rallying global solidarity. The rapid spread of the virus beyond the walls of China signified an imminent danger and the cosmopolitan norms embedded in WHO's IHR was seen as central to international cooperation among states. The IHR which was last revised in 2005 under article 21 of WHO's constitution and entered into force in 2007 has been a key mechanism for global health emergency governance. Among other functions, the IHR empowers the WHO Director General to declare a PHEIC and make temporary recommendations in a way that minimises interference to international travels and trade.

Yet, for COVID-19, despite WHO's plea for collective action, state-centred, nationalistic responses prevailed. Many countries deviated from WHO's recommendations, abandoned platitudes of solidarity and pursued isolationist policies. We saw near total shutdown of borders, bans on export of medical supplies and the rise of 'vaccine nationalism'. Even though such policies proved to be ineffective, they conflict with science and produce grossly inequitable outcomes.

COVID-19 further exploited the geopolitical cracks between the major powers, centred on the origin of the virus and demonstrated the limitations of multilateral institutions in coordinating nation-states. These challenges impeded WHO's efforts to mount an effective global response and prevented poorer countries with low economic and political bargaining power in accessing essential medical supplies. As Fidler argues, COVID-19 shredded 'the perennial claim that a harmony of interests exists between low-income and high-income countries on health security'.

### What explains the lacklustre response to zika in Brazil? Exploring institutional, economic and health system context [^36dbcde3]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Political interference and policy consequences

Why did the government fail to strengthen its health system's response to Zika? What is troubling is that this occurred even in a context of increased WHO pressures for a strong policy response through the aforementioned PHEIC. We argue that Brazil's lacklustre response was shaped by policy decisions and challenges that arose before Zika emerged.

Indeed, beginning under the Lula administration, at a time when the government was fully committed to antipoverty and human development issues, there was no effort to substantially improve SUS and its funding mechanisms. In fact, SUS had been underfunded for several years, a direct consequence of several failed policy initiatives and lack of clarity in how federal and state resources would be managed.

Recent studies even pointed out that, as early as 2010, Brazil was underestimating the prevalence rate of microcephaly at birth, presenting more cases than the world average. Potential causes include 'variables closely linked to poverty', such as 'low maternal schooling' or not having a companion. However, prevalence during Zika crisis are indeed higher and cases are much more severe.

The government's focus at the time was on partially addressing the social determinants of health, and the dominant view was that alleviating poverty and hunger would contribute to good health, well-being and economic productivity. The focus was not on helping the states fund basic healthcare infrastructure and human resources, a responsibility that was increasingly assigned to the states and municipalities.

Presidents Dilma and Temer's ascendance into the presidency did not improve the situation. Dilma essentially adopted Lula's antipoverty platform. Her priority since assuming office in 2010 was to eradicate poverty and rejuvenate the economy. Dilma voiced concern for improving SUS, as evident through the creation of the Mais Médicos (More Doctors) programme, which provided additional doctors and distributed them throughout the country. However, corruption scandals and political turbulence shifted the government's policy focus away from increasing federal funding for social policies towards instead rejuvenating political confidence. Zika emerged in the middle of this conundrum. Aside from supporting the Armed Force's involvement in helping vector inspection in households in highly infected areas, federal funding to support hospitals in these areas was deemed insufficient even before the county was hit by the Zika outbreak.

### Dissent and the right to protest in context of global health [^24ae54df]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Robert F. Kennedy, in a speech in 1966, exclaimed, 'For it is not enough to allow dissent. We must demand it. For there is much to dissent from'. o dissent means to hold or express opinions that are divergent with those that are commonly or officially held. However, this definition covers a wide range of actions, both within and beyond the bounds of the law. They include acting against incumbent governments through the ballot box, or through more overt and direct acts of protest including peaceful conscientious objection, civil disobedience and acts of direct action.

A tolerance of dissent not only marks the ability to challenge and hold governments (and other powerful actors) accountable and the willingness to respect minority views, it encourages debate and deliberation in society in ways that drive positive social change and development. Dissent can help inform public opinion, change policy, accelerate reform and promote and protect other human rights.

Dissent has been central to the advancement of gender equity and women's rights and the reversal of ethnic and racial oppression as exemplified by the civil rights movement in the USA and the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. It has been a critical ingredient in many successful campaigns aimed at protecting the natural environment from harm and destruction. And in the field of health, dissent played an important role in advancing access to treatment for HIV pandemic.

Today, whether it is protest against the denial of essential healthcare; or campaigns against the restriction of sexual and reproductive health and rights including abortion, or resistance to the violent oppression of women, dissent is a vital part in the realisation of the right to health for millions of people. But were Kennedy alive today, he might well assert that there is more to dissent from today than there was in 1966. Despite progress made in health and development and the spread of electoral democracies, social inequality has grown, billions of people remain impoverished and face catastrophe due to the failure of governments to reverse our dependence on fossil fuels. Moreover, an increasing concentration of unaccountable power and the ascent of authoritarian and populist governments and political parties threatens to reverse hard won democratic gains made after the second world war.

### Trust and responsibility in food systems transformation. engaging with big food: marriage or mirage? [^f606ad33]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Towards responsibility in the food system

Identifying commercial determinants of health is an important step towards accountability and evidence-based change, but is just that — a step. Transformation requires accountability that sticks; where stakeholders accept responsibility for harmful outcomes and comply with corrective and preventative policies (not to mention clean-up or compensation). However, apportioning accountability means weighing up social vs individual responsibilities; a process that reflects the spectrum of philosophical positions concerning how humans should or shouldn't be governed and the degree to which free-market capitalism prevails.

Where malnutrition is concerned, some state that 'to understand who is responsible[…]it is first necessary to ask: Who rules global food systems?'. The answer is not consumers, whose choices — although complex and multifaceted — are confounded by an 'illusion of diversity' in markets dominated by a handful of companies promoting near-identical, cheap and unhealthy products. Choice is the point at which individuals interact with the food environment. It forms the bridge in their relationships with the architects of that environment; the food industry and government. The food industry provides choice; government shapes and regulates these choices (often under industry influence or civil society pressure); and individuals operate within the resulting space. In competing with industry-concocted psychological marketing campaigns, distraction techniques and political lobbying to deprioritise progressive diet-related policies, consumers' ability to 'vote with their feet' may be something of a fallacy. Indeed, amid food systems so influenced by powerful interests, personal choice (vis a vis personal responsibility) is something of a misnomer. When consumer choice is genuinely possible, it is among a relatively privileged minority who are able to eat healthily, or to purchase fair or sustainably produced items. At national and supranational levels, governments and multilateral agencies are themselves apparently stunted in their ability to enact structurally transformative, cross-cutting and robust food systems regulation to protect people and planet. Whether it is failing to close tax avoidance loopholes, to limit volatile financial speculation, to enforce adequate anti-trust laws, or to truly protect human rights, policies affecting food systems appear at best to be 'tinkering at the margins'and at worst facilitating Big Food's priorities and concentration of power.

### Why lockdown of the elderly is not ageist and why levelling down equality is wrong [^3d5f036a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

In order to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19, governments have placed significant restrictions on liberty, including preventing all non-essential travel. These restrictions were justified on the basis the health system may be overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases and in order to prevent deaths. Governments are now considering how they may de-escalate these restrictions. This article argues that an appropriate approach may be to lift the general lockdown but implement selective isolation of the elderly. While this discriminates against the elderly, there is a morally relevant difference-the elderly are far more likely to require hospitalisation and die than the rest of the population. If the aim is to ensure the health system is not overwhelmed and to reduce the death rate, preventing the elderly from contracting the virus may be an effective means of achieving this. The alternative is to continue to keep everyone in lockdown. It is argued that this is levelling down equality and is unethical. It suggests that in order for the elderly to avoid contracting the virus, the whole population should have their liberty deprived, even though the same result could be achieved by only restricting the liberty of the elderly. Similar arguments may also be applied to all groups at increased risk of COVID-19, such as men and those with comorbidities, the obese and people from ethnic minorities or socially deprived groups. This utilitarian concern must be balanced against other considerations, such as equality and justice, and the benefits gained from discriminating in these ways must be proportionately greater than the negative consequences of doing so. Such selective discrimination will be most justified when the liberty restriction to a group promotes the well-being of that group (apart from its wider social benefits).

### Frederick novy and the 1901 San Francisco plague commission investigation [^54f333d3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The 1900 San Francisco plague is a significant event in which citizens, physicians, and public health officials denied a diagnosis of plague on economic, political, and social grounds. To resolve the controversy, Surgeon General Walter Wyman appointed an independent federal commission of university-based experts to investigate whether plague was present. I use the activities of Frederick Novy, the commission bacteriologist and professor at the University of Michigan, to explore one circumstance in which bacteriology attempted to redefine traditional conceptions of disease during the early germ era. Novy showed plague was present in the city but without its characteristic clinical features and devastating epidemiological pattern. Physicians who understood plague by its classic features, however, contested Novy's scientific evidence. His bacteriologic redefinition had no special authority to prevail over opposing conceptions about plague; it was accepted and acted upon once it served the overall interest of the city — to avert a trade embargo.

### The history and threat of biological warfare and terrorism [^ec15e2db]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The inevitable conclusion is that the availability of biological warfare agents and supporting technologic infrastructure, coupled with the fact that there are many people motivated to do harm to the United States, means that America must be prepared to defend her homeland against biological agents. Some have argued to the contrary, that the threat and risks from a biological weapon attack are not to be considered serious, because [39]: They've not been used yet on a large scale so they probably won't be in the near future. Their use is so morally repugnant that they probably won't be used at all. The technologic hurdles associated with isolating, growing, purifying, weaponizing, and disseminating adequate quantities of pathologic agents are so high that only the most advanced laboratories could attempt the process. Similar to a 'nuclear winter', the aftermath of a biological attack is so unthinkable that none would attempt it. Unfortunately, the trends associated with biotechnology globalization, terrorist group dynamics, and global/regional politics render these beliefs untenable and inappropriate, as recent events have underscored. To that end, the United States has accelerated its program of defense against biological weapons, as it must. Biological weapons are such dreadful weapons of uniqueness and complexity that a specific defense strategy is paramount. Elements of this program include pharmaceutical stockpiles, heightened surveillance systems, energized vaccine development programs, and comprehensive training initiatives. Although the depth and breadth of these efforts are unprecedented, above all these efforts is the absolute necessity for medical and public health care professionals to be educated and actively involved. These professionals are the sine qua non of future defensive readiness. This is just the start; unfortunately, there is no end yet in sight.

### A sense of priorities for the healthcare commons [^b2cc8949]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Limited resources make it impossible to deliver all healthcare services to all people. Therefore, it is vital for the nation to adopt rational methods for setting priorities. The work of the National Commission on Prevention Priorities takes such an approach in ranking the relative importance of effective preventive services, and it carries important implications for policymakers, clinicians, and patients. The crisis facing health care requires society to function as a community to use limited resources in ways that maximize the public good.

Advocacy and research to end firearm violence in the USA

Marie Crandall, MD, MPH

The Dickey Amendment was a rider inserted into the 1996 US tax spending bill that stated, 'none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the CDC may be used to advocate or promote gun control'. This amendment was a direct product of active pro-gun lobbying at the federal level, particularly by the NRA. Since that time, little to no tax dollars have been allocated to fund firearm injury research, at the CDC, and at the National Institutes of Health, and other federal agencies. The Dickey Amendment had the effect of defunding research at a critical time, when firearm-related injuries and deaths had hit record highs in the early 1990s. This starkly demonstrates the interplay between politics, advocacy, and research in the area of gun violence prevention.

To many researchers and trauma surgeons, the issue seems a simple one; science is simply the systematic observation of the physical environment, and elucidation of facts through hypothesis testing. It should be impartial and unbiased. When a preponderance of evidence suggests that, say, tobacco exposure can lead to cancer, actions to limit harmful consequences and improve public health are undertaken by society. However, it seems that many topics have become so politicized that actions are impeded by politics. Examples would be a woman's right to choose to have an abortion, funding for health insurance, and, of course, the constitutional right to carry a firearm. The population has become so polarized with respect to these topics, science has lost its ability to govern policy without advocacy on the part of informed professionals.

### Assessing readiness of international investigations into alleged biological weapons use [^ffe1f237]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Without clarity if an outbreak is natural, accidental, or deliberate, infectious disease outbreaks of unknown or ambiguous origin can lead to speculation of a purposeful biological attack. Outbreaks in conflict settings are particularly prone to suspicions and allegations. In an increasingly confrontative global geopolitical landscape and with active information manipulation, outbreaks of ambiguous origin are likely to increase concerns of the deliberate use of biological agents. The United Nations General Assembly has agreed on and the United Nations Security Council has endorsed a mechanism to investigate allegations of deliberate use titled the United Nations Secretary-General's Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical or Biological Weapons. A recent full-scale field exercise evaluated the deployment readiness of the mechanism and found it is well placed to investigate suspicious disease outbreaks, with room for continual improvement.

### Toward a safer world by 2040: the JAMA summit report on reducing firearm violence and harms [^59cdddd4]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Since the start of the 21st century, more than 800 000 firearm deaths and more than 2 million firearm injuries have occurred in the US. All categories of firearm violence-homicide, suicide, unintentional-result in reverberating harms to individuals, families, communities, and society. The collective responsibility of society is to safeguard the health and safety of its members, including from firearm harms. The JAMA Summit on Firearm Violence convened 60 thought leaders from a wide array of disciplines to chart an innovations roadmap that will lead to substantial reductions in firearm harms by 2040.

Observations

The vision for 2040 is a country where firearm violence is substantially reduced and where all people and communities report feeling safe from firearm harms. The vision centers on practical solutions with an understanding of the country's constitutional protections for firearm ownership. Achieving the 2040 vision will require expansion of proven evidence-based strategies and the development of new, innovative approaches rooted in equity, accountability, and collective responsibility. Discussions centered on projecting a safer world, community violence interventions, technologic innovations, federal and state-level oversight of firearms, ethical considerations, and primordial prevention of firearm violence. The Summit charted a roadmap of 5 essential actions in the next 5 years to achieve this vision: (1) focus on communities and change fundamental structures that lead to firearm harms, (2) harness technological strengths responsibly, (3) change the narrative around firearm harms, (4) take a whole-government and whole-society approach, and (5) spark a research revolution on preventing firearm harms.

Conclusions and Relevance

A safer world will require investing in the discovery, implementation, and scaling of solutions that reduce firearm harms and center on the people and communities most affected by firearm violence.

Coordinating with state and local response agencies — incident management structure explains that throughout the management of the terrorist incident, crisis-management and consequence-management entities will operate at the same time to ensure that the work of multiple response agencies is coordinated and to produce a time-phased deployment of specialized federal resources that is tailored to the incident. It is critical that all participating federal, state, and local agencies and organizations coordinate their activities to avoid chaos. Once an incident has occurred, local government emergency response organizations will report to the incident scene and communicate appropriate notifications to local, state, and federal authorities. Control of the incident scene will be established by local response authorities such as a senior fire or law enforcement official. Command and control of the incident scene is the responsibility of the Incident Commander or Unified Command, and operational control of assets at the scene is retained by the designated officials representing agencies or organizations (local, state, or federal) providing the assets.

### Society's choice: the tradeoff between efficacy and equity and the lives at stake [^ae5d44cd]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Society understands that racial and ethnic minorities experience inferior medical care and health status, but may not appreciate the seriousness of the problem. Each year the nation spends billions of dollars to perfect the "technology" of health care (e.g., development of new drugs) and modernize delivery systems, thereby saving thousands of lives. Correcting disparities in care, however, would avert five times as many deaths. If policymakers adhered to the goal of optimizing population health, greater priority would go to resolving disparities than to refining technology, but reverse priorities prevail. Adverse socioeconomic conditions-chief among the many causes of disparities-could be eased through bold socioeconomic reforms. Society has the resources to enable the disadvantaged to attain better health but pursues other priorities.

### A turning point for conflicts of interest: the controversy over the national academy of sciences' first conflicts of interest disclosure policy [^0aa861a6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Conflicts of interest policies have become a part of the fabric of the conduct of biomedical research, yet such concerns are relatively recent history. Until the 1960s, concerns about conflicts of interest were confined to scientists who served as government advisors and contractors. However, in the 1970s, as a range of environmental and consumer safety issues gained public attention, the conclusions of researchers frequently came under attack because of concerns about experts' financial ties to private industry. These debates typically focused on evaluating potential carcinogens in the environment. In response, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) developed its first conflict of interest policy, requiring committee members to disclose any "potential sources of bias" that "others might deem prejudicial". Scientists universally opposed the policy, however, for a range of reasons — while some argued that all experienced and knowledgeable experts were inherently conflicted, others were offended at the suggestion that any expert could be biased. Despite the controversy, the disclosure policy remained in place and became a model for subsequent professional and institutional policies in the biomedical sciences. However, although disclosure policies have become standard at academic medical centers and for publications in scientific journals, clinical researchers have continued to debate the content of these policies and the need for additional protections beyond disclosure. In the absence of a definitive standard, this historical case study can substantially inform ongoing discussion on conflicts of interest in clinical research.

### The effect of COVID certificates on vaccine uptake, health outcomes, and the economy [^c51e2b5d]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many governments to implement previously unthinkable policies. Initially, while some countries aimed to eliminate the virus, others aimed to slow its spread to protect health systems and to gain time until vaccines or treatment became widely available –. Public health measures intended to reduce transmissions have included public venue closures, limitations on social contacts, and travel restrictions. These measures are informed by mathematical simulations – and by analyses estimating their causal effects on the dynamics of the epidemic. COVID certificates — certifying vaccination, recovery, or a recent negative test — enable, through digitisation, targeted interventions dependent on an individual's risk of transmitting the virus or experiencing a severe form of the disease. As with other policy choices, the use of COVID certificates has often been questioned for ethical and political reasons, while advocates have focused on the potential to secure social interactionsand only recently increased vaccine uptake has been considered –. We argue that the incentive effect of COVID certificates on vaccine uptake may be most critical and has averted adverse health and economic outcomes. As vaccines are increasingly available, hesitancy and refusal to be vaccinated have become the main obstacles to high vaccine coverage in many parts of the world –. Historically, policy-makers have considered several options to increase vaccine uptake, ranging from communication and outreach strategies to monetary (dis)incentives and mandates. COVID certificates have emerged during the pandemic as a new tool to spur vaccination uptake and they require further investigation.

The medical community is no exception when it comes to structural racism and implicit bias, often present in dangerously subtle ways. To enter a residency program in which one is the only black person seems odd, especially considering the decades-long calls to action for increasing diversity. Unless the societal majority removes the blinders and steps out of their realm of privilege to address personal and systemic racist and biased views, progress will not be made. Sponsorship and inclusion of those Underrepresented in Medicine also lead to a stronger, more diverse academic community, and ultimately better health care.

### Current sample size conventions: flaws, harms, and alternatives [^045eca4e]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Early in my career, an epidemiologist told me that dealing with sample size is the price one has to pay for being a biostatistician. Since then, I have spent untold time and effort paying this price, while also coming to realize that such effort produces no real scientific benefit. Unfortunately, widespread misconceptions about sample size hurt not only statisticians, but also the quality of medical science generally.

The conventional expectation is that a study must have at least 80% power or else be considered scientifically unsound and even unethical. Some challenges to this dogma have been based on the idea that some information is better than none and that even a small amount of inconclusive information may contribute to a later systematic review, but conventions remain entrenched and failing to anticipate systematic reviews is only one aspect of only one of three fundamental flaws. I present here a wider challenge to current conventions, including how they cause serious harm. Alternatives could produce both better studies and fairer peer review of proposed studies.

### National responses to COVID-19: drivers, complexities, and uncertainties in the first year of the pandemic [^1aed3181]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Conceptualising complex responses

As a first step towards thinking about complex responses, we present a framework to visualise categories that represent the drivers, complexities, and uncertainties inherent in responses to a pandemic (fig 1). We identify governance, control strategies, and interventions as the three pillars of a response. An "inner context" analysis discloses the importance of forming an idea of the pandemic driven and rapidly evolving conditions by which responses are shaped. In successful national responses, guided by scientific evidence, the epidemiological profile of the disease informs strategies, approaches, and interventions. As variants of concern appear, we see how the dynamic nature of the virus requires adaptable complex responses. Globally such responses have been hindered by existing structural inequities that affect health and wellbeing. These inequities are the result of longstanding ecological breakdown, systemic oppression, racism, ageism, social and economic exclusion, and other forms of discrimination. Dealing with health emergencies is intrinsically political as it depends on how government and decision makers deal with and mitigate systematic and structural elements and the uncertainties these produce, and also how they take into account more static components (eg, geography, demographics, urbanisation). Taken together, these components can strengthen our blueprint towards a more holistic understanding of what worked, for whom, and why.

### High-quality health systems in the sustainable development goals era: time for a revolution [^465cb920]. The Lancet: Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Universal action 1: Govern for quality

Health-system-wide change demands that the improvement and maintenance of quality be woven into the fabric of a health system. Governing for quality means reframing the pursuit of quality health care from a peripheral activity to the mandate of a health system, and making sure that a commitment to quality is actually translated from paper to actions that improve the health of people. Governing for quality includes several elements: adopting a national quality policy and strategy, improving capacity for management at all levels of the health system, strengthening regulation and accountability, and collecting and learning from health system data.

Governing for quality requires high-level political commitment to a shared vision for improving quality of care and translating this commitment into action across the health system (panel 13). Well aligned policies and strategies should be based on this vision, locally accepted definitions of quality, and national goals for improved outcomes. In response to requests from countries for guidance on how to design and implement these healthcare policies and strategies, WHO produced the National Quality Policy and Strategy Handbook. The handbook outlines eight elements of the strategy and argues that quality must be elevated nationally and become a priority across sectors. These policies, and the strategy linked to them, should ideally outline the roles and responsibilities of the organisational bodies and actors that participate in sustaining and improving quality of care. A plan for coordinating these elements is also needed, so that quality improvement programmes are harmonised to maximise learning and results at the system level. For example, an analysisof surveys from 310 health system leaders in Mexico identified insufficient coordination of quality improvement agendas and an unclear system of roles and responsibilities as key barriers to the translation of federal policies into improved quality of care. The successful development of shared vision, policies, strategy, coordination, and implementation are needed to design a choice architecture for health systems that directs patients and providers towards decisions that produce quality care and good health outcomes.

### Health systems changes after decentralisation: progress, challenges and dynamics in Pakistan [^efb58433]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Decentralisation is widely practised but its scrutiny tends to focus on structural and authority changes or outcomes. Politics and process of devolution implementation needs to be better understood to evaluate how national governments use the enhanced decision space for bringing improvements in the health system and the underlying challenges faced. We use the example of Pakistan's radical, politically driven provincial devolution to analyse how national structures use decentralisation opportunities for improved health planning, spending and carrying out transformations to the health system. Our narrative draws on secondary data sources from the PRIMASYS study, supplemented with policy roundtable notes from Pakistan. Our analysis shows that in decentralised Pakistan, health became prioritised for increased government resources and achieved good budgetary use, major strides were made contextualised sector-wide health planning and legislations, and a proliferation seen in governance measures to improve and regulate healthcare delivery. Despite a disadvantaged and abrupt start to devolution, high ownership by politicians and bureaucracy in provincial governments led to resourcing, planning and innovations. However, effective translation remained impeded by weak institutional capacity, feeble federal-provincial coordination and vulnerability to interference by local elites. Building on this illustrative example, we propose (1) political management of decentralisation for effective national coordination, sustaining stable leadership and protecting from political interfere by local elites; (2) investment in stewardship capacity in the devolved structures as well as the central ministry to deliver on new roles.

### Conflicting interests, institutional fragmentation and opportunity structures: an analysis of political institutions and the health taxes regime in Pakistan [^b5be06cb]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Issues related to intra-agency fragmentation

Other than macrolevel political instability discussed above, we also found evidence of microlevel instability at the institutional level, which seems to have negative impact with respect to the ability of key institutions to deliver. One of the most important structural aspects we found was with respect to effectiveness of leadership. We found frequent changes in the heads of key institutions, which likely had strong negative impacts on effectiveness and continuity in policy-making and implementation. For example, in the last 5 years, Pakistan has had five different health ministers. Again, in the last 5 years, there have been 10 different chairpersons of the FBR. Further, federal secretaries, who act as the administrative heads of government ministries, are changed frequently, often serving in a single ministry for less than 6 months. This trend (of ad-hocism) shows that, without security of tenure, taking tough policy decisions against entrenched interests may be especially difficult, since the likely consequence may be removal from office or transfer to another position. These findings are consistent with research in other countries which indicate a negative impact of short tenures on healthcare systems.

Further, amid political uncertainty and instability, there are issues related to continuity of programmes and initiatives. We found, for example, that in April 2021 the government abruptly decided to disband the Tobacco Control Cell that had been set up within the federal health ministry in 2007 with a mandate to control tobacco use in Pakistan. This was possible because the cell was setup in an ad-hoc manner within the ministry, rather than having been established on more solid legal foundations. Through interviews and media reports, we learnt that tobacco industry had not been comfortable with such special unit existing within the ministry, and had exerted its influence to abolish the cell.

Security Act is ended. In place of the entitlement concept, the new law creates two block grants that provide States with the funds necessary to help families escape welfare. In particular, States are given a block grant to provide cash and other benefits to help needy families support their children while simultaneously requiring families to make verifiable efforts to. The major goal of Public Law 104–193 is to reduce the length of welfare spells by attacking dependency while simultaneously preserving the function of welfare as a safety net for families experiencing temporary financial problems.

### Canada's universal health-care system: achieving its potential [^a700843b]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Access to health care based on need rather than ability to pay was the founding principle of the Canadian health-care system. Medicare was born in one province in 1947. It spread across the country through federal cost sharing, and eventually was harmonised through standards in a federal law, the Canada Health Act of 1984. The health-care system is less a true national system than a decentralised collection of provincial and territorial insurance plans covering a narrow basket of services, which are free at the point of care. Administration and service delivery are highly decentralised, although coverage is portable across the country. In the setting of geographical and population diversity, long waits for elective care demand the capacity and commitment to scale up effective and sustainable models of care delivery across the country. Profound health inequities experienced by Indigenous populations and some vulnerable groups also require coordinated action on the social determinants of health if these inequities are to be effectively addressed. Achievement of the high aspirations of Medicare's founders requires a renewal of the tripartite social contract between governments, health-care providers, and the public. Expansion of the publicly funded basket of services and coordinated effort to reduce variation in outcomes will hinge on more engaged roles for the federal government and the physician community than have existed in previous decades. Public engagement in system stewardship will also be crucial to achieve a high-quality system grounded in both evidence and the Canadian values of equity and solidarity.

### Targeting anticorruption interventions at the front line: developmental governance in health systems [^e956bf5b]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Corruption and anticorruption fall within the field of research on governance but our reading indicates that there has been less interest in these topics among health systems researchers than in other governance concerns (eg, participation, institution building and accountability). Often defined as practices by which individuals and groups exploit public resources for individual benefit, corruption in health systems may be ignored for various practical, social and political reasons. Not all forms of informality are corrupt, and some practices are forms of 'survival corruption' offering practical solutions to the difficulties of delivering care, especially in severely underfunded health systems. Work on corruption can also be hindered by the fact that it is difficult to define. Early descriptions, 'the abuse of public resources for private gain' ignored corruption within the private sector and failed to provide an explicit acknowledgement of the central role of power in its manifestation. More recent definitions, 'the abuse of power for private gain' enables a focus on both public and private sectors but continues to rely on a clear division between public and private spheres — a distinction that is not always clear or universally recognised. This definition continues to focus excessively on the individual. Moreover as Gaitonde argues, the system in which they are embedded and the enactment of corruption for the benefit of a group, organisation, party or others close to the person who is abusing power, is obscured in these definitions. It also makes it difficult to take account of the fact that corruption is socially construct and sits on an axis between moral/immoral and legal/illegal activity (with some forms recognised as legal but unethical and others as illegal but morally defensible).

### Ending this pandemic and securing the future [^57ef52ea]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

At the heart of any effort to strengthen global capacity to prevent and respond to pandemics must be a stronger, financially secure, and more authoritative World Health Organization. We hope the the World Health Assembly will make haste on a pandemic treaty: to fail to do so would be to miss yet another opportunity for vital reforms to ensure that WHO can detect and alert the world to future threats more quickly. The Member State Working Group on strengthening WHO preparedness and response to health emergencies has discussed several of the independent panel's recommendations, and these must now be taken up by WHO governing bodies.

Pandemics are not ended by a magic bullet, but by a combination of essential measures: leader level commitment, finance, equitable access to global public goods, new legal instruments, and a stronger and more authoritative WHO. The world cannot afford to wait another six months to begin delivering on vital reforms which could make covid-19 the world's last pandemic.

### Predictably unequal: understanding and addressing concerns that algorithmic clinical prediction may increase health disparities [^5aa6a35e]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Fairness concerns are not clearly relevant for all decisional contexts

In addition to the limited validity and authority of proposed results-focused fairness criteria, it is important to recognize the limits of their relevance across decision contexts. In particular, the contexts described above (such as in the criminal justice system) differ from that which often defines decisions for medical decision-making. Fairness concerns are important when decisions must arbitrate between competing interests among different parties, in ways that they do not for other types of decisions. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:

"Issues of justice arise in circumstances in which people can advance claims… that are potentially conflicting, and we appeal to justice to resolve such conflicts by determining what each person is properly entitled to have. In contrast, where people's interests converge, and the decision to be taken is about the best way to pursue some common purpose… justice gives way to other values".

### Targeting anticorruption interventions at the front line: developmental governance in health systems [^b9dd45a2]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Incentives and pressures within the health system

The study found few social, professional or economic incentives for doctors to stay at rural health facilities. Rural postings were described as difficult, stressful and dangerous. Male doctors complained of the dangers associated with being called out of the health facility and into villages to attend cases, especially if two families or factions were in dispute about the cause and consequences of an accident. Female doctors were also concerned about the lack of security in the health facility compounds, the dangers of undertaking night shifts because of a lack of security at night and, a complete lack of suitable housing either within the compound or beyond it (in one instance, in a very remote area). Both male and female doctors also described the ways in which local residents would put them under pressure to issue false or fabricated medical certificates and described verbal abuse and theft of their property.

Although policies present rural work as part of junior doctors' career progression, all those we interviewed saw their time in the rural health centres as a threat to their careers and the achievement of a specialist training placement, seen as critical in a health system that affords little space for medical generalists. The workload made it difficult to find time to study for postgraduation exams necessary for entry to a specialist field. The highly competitive exams require considerable revision; training courses take place in urban settings and demand periods of absence that are not always sanctioned.

### Americans experience a false social reality by underestimating popular climate policy support by nearly half [^665a47d3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Given the possible role of pluralistic ignorance in stalling progress on this existential threat, it is prudent to investigate fundamental, unanswered questions about pluralistic ignorance on climate policy support: Is pluralistic ignorance around climate policy common in the U.S.? Is it contained to specific pockets of Americans, or does it span many populations over many geographies? Does it affect only specific policies, or does it hold for a variety of climate change mitigation policies (e.g. those utilizing market instruments, as opposed to mandates, or direct investment in infrastructure)? As prior research has found that Americans underestimate fellow Americans' belief in climate change, it's possible that they also underestimate public support across a range of climate change mitigation policies (i.e. they may expect lower policy support for any policy addressing a problem if they assume others don't believe that the problem exists). If pluralistic ignorance is present in this context, how large are the misperceptions? Do some misperceptions exist, but perceptions are accurate about majority and minority opinion? Or do they surpass this level and result in misperceiving what the majority of Americans support?

The main objective of the present study is to provide clear and granular answers to the above questions. Additionally, there may be questions about the possible sources of misperception. One contributor to misperceiving popular opinion could be false consensus, where people pay selective attention to others' beliefs that are similar to their own, and overestimate the number of people who agree with them. Indeed, false consensus effects exist for belief in climate change and support for local renewable energy projects in the Northeast US. As such, we might expect that U.S. conservatives underestimate support for climate mitigation policies to a greater extent as they have lower approval of said policies.

Second, when forming estimates of frequency or probability, people's guesses are generally shaped by information that is more easily available or retrievable, reflecting an availability heuristic. Thus, people's estimates of national public opinion may show an outsized influence of local norms that are easier to witness firsthand or recall. Given this, people's estimates of the nation as a whole may be swayed by their state-level norms such that those in more conservative states and those in states with fewer climate protests may underestimate climate policy support to a greater degree.

### The charlie gard case: British and American approaches to court resolution of disputes over medical decisions [^65a0adbf]. Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Differences between British and American approaches

Owing to differences in their health-care systems, inclination to litigiousness, and a greater sense of a common community, fewer disputes are brought to the courts in the United Kingdom than in the United States. When cases do make their way to court, the British courts view issues not from the perspective of patient or family 'autonomy', but the 'best interests' of the patient.

Another major difference in the systems is payment for litigation. The 'contingency fee' approach used in civil cases in the United States allows individuals who believe they were unjustifiably injured in the medical context to seek legal assistance for one-third of any future payment for the claim. There are no immediate 'out of pocket' costs for initiating a law suit. Seeking a legal remedy for a perceived injury in the United Kingdom is a more expensive proposition. Significant 'out of pocket' costs are a disincentive to seeking a court remedy for a complaint though means-tested legal aid is available to families in these cases.

Finally, the unitary court structure in the United Kingdom promotes a greater consistency in judicial rulings than is found in the United States. In the United Kingdom once a higher court promulgates a way to proceed and established a standard to be followed, lower courts tend to conform. In the United States, the multiplicity of jurisdictions established under the Constitution precludes such a unified legal system.

### Physician voting rates in the 2020 and 2022 US elections [^90e20106]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Using licensure data from state medical boards to identify physicians and linking these data with state voter files, we found that physicians voted at significantly higher adjusted rates than other adults in the 2020 presidential and 2022 midterm elections in the US. This finding is consistent with results of previous work from 2020.

Study limitations include the limited time frame and the inability to validate the linkage of physician license and voting records conducted by Catalist. Given their high voting rates, physicians may be well suited to advise patients to register and vote through organized mobilization efforts.

### Nine insights from 10 years of legal cannabis for nonmedical purposes [^1b94d57a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Whereas the 20th century could be largely characterized as the age of cannabis prohibition, the 21st century may ultimately be known as the era of cannabis legalization. Although several countries and subnational jurisdictions have relaxed laws to allow cannabis to be used for medical purposes, the policy landscape shifted dramatically in 2012 when voters in Colorado and Washington passed ballot initiatives to allow cannabis to be sold to adults for nonmedical purposes. Since then, Canada, Uruguay, and Malta have legalized nonmedical cannabis, and > 47% of the US population live in states that have passed laws allowing commercial production and for-profit retail sales. Some countries are now implementing pilot programs for legal supply (eg, the Netherlands, Switzerland), and others are seriously contemplating changing their laws (eg, Germany, Mexico). This commentary offers 9 insights from the first 10 years of legal cannabis for nonmedical purposes, with the goal of informing policy discussions in places considering, implementing, or revising their approach to cannabis legalization: (1) cannabis prices are declining in places with commercial regimes and this matters for several outcomes; (2) noncommercial models are being implemented and seriously considered in some places; (3) policy discussions about cannabis taxes are evolving; (4) the number of cannabis products available in commercial regimes is proliferating; (5) emerging research on higher potency cannabis products raises some public health concerns, but there is still a lot to learn; (6) social equity is playing a larger role in many legalization debates; (7) it takes time to move consumers to the legal market; (8) data collection about cannabis consumption is getting better, but there is much work to do; and (9) ongoing methodological advances should improve our understanding of cannabis policy changes.

### There must Be a better way [^d775325a]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01 grant represents the gold standard for research independence across the United States. The barrier to entry for this grant mechanism is extremely high, with < 10% of grants being funded. Interestingly, after this tremendously high barrier, there is very little accountability for the grantee to accomplish the aims that were originally proposed. While there is certainly value to requiring investigators to provide a logical and compelling research plan, excessive grant writing creates a large inefficiency. Thus, a "fail quickly" model, which is not without cost, should be considered. Such a model involves a much lower barrier to entry and much higher short-term accountability so that more aims can be tested in less time at lower cost.

### Black history is America's history [^c0120689]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Black history is America's history. The narrative of Black people in the U.S. reveals more about who we are as a country — our difficult past, our painstaking movements forward towards justice, and our persistent racial wounds that we refuse to heal — than the sanitized history that children learn in our school systems. The omission of this narrative is not only harmful for Black people, it is harmful and dangerous for the entire country. Without a common foundational understanding of our nation's racial history, we cannot possibly begin to step progressively into a future of racial reconciliation.

On 1.6.21, White supremacists tried to overthrow the U.S. government in an unsuccessful coup d'état and many remarked that "this is not who we are as a country". Yet history documents that this is exactly who we have always been as a country. A country where White violence, racist rhetoric and revisionist history has oppressed the lives and well-being of Black people for centuries. As one example of many, in the "Black Wall Street Massacre" of 1921, mobs of White people, many of whom were deputized by city officials, attacked the wealthiest Black community in the U.S. destroying the modern-day equivalent of $33 million in property and killing 39 people in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The massacre was largely omitted from history for 75 years.

Until everyday White people understand their White privilege and how systemic racism continues to devalue the lives and potential of Black people in the U.S. we will not meaningfully or sustainably change the status quo. And that is why Black history has been erased from U.S. history. The U.S. is at another crossroads in our racial journey. The exponential rise in White terrorism and extremism is now the largest domestic threat to the U.S. Yet voices throughout the country have been clear: "Black Lives Matter". It is only through wide-eyed clarity of vision and purpose, and commitment to justice and equity that we will rise as a nation and begin to make peace with our racial past. That process begins with truth-telling and a commitment to doing so to our children. Not only during Black History Month, but every month.

Black history is America's history.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^4cb232f7]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Restrictions on property — public health emergency powers may permit a range of action by state and local governments to restrict, secure, and manage property during an emergency response, with examples including decontamination of facilities, acquisition of vaccines, medicines, or hospital beds, and use of private facilities for isolation, quarantine, or disposal of human remains. Once a public health emergency has been declared, some states allow authorities to use and take temporary control of certain private sector businesses and activities that are of critical importance to epidemic control measures; authorities may take control of landfills and other disposal facilities and services to safely eliminate infectious waste, health-care facilities and supplies may be procured or controlled to treat and care for patients and the general public, and areas normally accessible to the public may be closed to prevent additional exposures. Whenever health authorities take private property to use for public health purposes, constitutional law requires that the property owner be provided just compensation, meaning the state must pay private owners for the use of their property. Under existing legal powers to abate public nuisances, authorities are able to condemn, remove, or destroy any property that may harm the public's health, and permissible property control measures may include restricting certain commercial transactions and practices, such as price gouging. Because the application of law varies in different states, it is advisable to consult with an attorney to understand the applicable law in any particular jurisdiction.

### Systematic decision frameworks for the socially responsible use of precision medicine [^0e57dd17]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Although it might seem simplest to avoid using racial classifications in precision health all together, we suggest that wholesale elimination of race is also not the answer because this could impede reparative healthcare legislation targeting racial groups historically marginalized in healthcare systems. Many classifications that might serve as alternatives to race (e.g. ancestry, ethnicity, demes) are also vulnerable to the social and moral harms associated with race, and these alternatives often use categories that resemble racial categories, which can also foster essentialist views –. So, while alternative classifications may be better suited for certain research programs, calling race by another name is not enough. Rather, systematic strategies are needed to prevent either race or these alternatives from perpetuating social harms.

In this Comment, we draw on techniques from psychology, philosophy, statistics, and computer science to make concrete recommendations for how clinicians and researchers can conduct and translate ongoing research and provide patients with precision healthcare while guarding against essentialist inferences and unfair treatment. Specifically, we offer two concrete tools for the socially responsible use of precision health: (1) a data-driven method for the detection of causal fairness and unfairness in precision health contexts, and (2) an ethical framework for determining when (if ever) it is morally permissible to use a racial classification in population health research. We hope that these tools can offer useful strategies to circumvent essentialist biases among individual practitioners and researchers, which we suggest will be particularly effective when they are incorporated into the existing social systems and structures in which these biases are ingrained.

### A public health approach to understanding and preventing violent radicalization [^6742fa93]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In this paper we propose that public health research and practice can inform preventive strategies and interventions against violent radicalization. The term 'radical' can mean 'politically subversive', 'creative', or 'extreme', without necessarily being illegal, criminal, or a threat to society. However, recent research and policies that address terrorism have used a more specific term, that of violent radicalization. Violent radicalization is conceptualized as a social and psychological process, often facilitated by recruitment and training, by which an individual becomes increasingly committed to politically motivated violence, especially against civilians (See Table 1 for definitions).

Table 1
Definitions

The motivations and ideology of groups that undergo violent radicalization are often specific to political, historical, social and cultural contexts that can shape their extremist actions and the accompanying political rhetoric. Since 9/11, the term 'violent radicalization' has been applied mostly to extreme Islamist groups as they have claimed responsibility for the majority of recent terrorist attacks across the world. The public health impact of terrorist acts arising from violent radicalization includes direct consequences such as deaths, physical injuries and psychological or mental injuries. The 9/11 attacks in 2001 killed nearly 3,000 individuals. The London 7/7 bombings in 2005 killed 52 and injured close to 700. Between 2003 and 2010, suicide bombers in Iraq killed 12,284 Iraqi civilians and injured a further 30,644. The groups that claim responsibility selectively invoke religious rhetoric to justify politically motivated violence but they do not generally represent Muslim populations or Islamic Fundamentalism. Thus, a public health response to political violence will need to consider that the majority of the victims globally are in fact Muslim civilians. However, psychological sequelae after 9/11 were found more generally among all populations who had experienced personal losses of friends, relatives, and jobs. Other direct effects include bereavements, loss of employment, economic damage, fear and distress. Indirect effects include a diversion of resources to tackle terrorism and rebuilding communities, social divisions within communities along religious lines, restrictive counterterrorism actions and inconvenience, discrimination against those perceived to be associated with terrorism, and of course the sending of and potential loss of troops to international conflicts where terrorist related activity is thought to arise. These consequences can also be mapped using public health approaches, and are not fully reviewed in this paper, which is devoted to understanding violent radicalization to mount effective strategies to reduce the likelihood of future incidents.

### Delving into social media claims about H.R. 1 (the for the… [^a068e11c]. jp.reuters.com (2021). Medium credibility.

Circuit Court. " This list of claims is partly false. 登録する ここ. H. R. 1, which passed in the House by a mostly partisan vote of 220 to 210 on March 3, would update voting procedures and require states to turn over the task of redrawing congressional districts to independent commissions. The bill, whose full text is available here, faces long odds in the Senate, where all 48 Democrats and the two independents who caucus with them would need to be joined by 10 Republican senators to overcome a filibuster. Democrats say the legislation is necessary to lower barriers to voting and make the U. S. political system more democratic and responsive to voters. But Republicans say it would take powers away from the states and fail to do enough to combat fraud. The influential right-wing Heritage Foundation think tank has urged lawmakers to vote against it. According to Gray, H. R. 1 "greatly undermines this structure" and would "be a Washington, D. C.

takeover of elections on a collision course with the Constitution's text, structure and principles — all of which put the states in the driver's seat. " But Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a Harvard Law School professor specializing in election and constitutional law, told Reuters via email that Gray's argument "misstates how both the constitutional text and the relevant doctrine address Congress's power to regulate elections". Stephanopoulos said that under Article I, Section 4 of the U. S. Constitution, Congress has essentially absolute authority over congressional elections. While states may regulate congressional elections, Congress may override their election laws. "As to presidential elections, Supreme Court cases going back almost a century have said that Congress has the same sweeping power over presidential elections that it enjoys over congressional elections, " Stephanopoulos said.

"The one thing Congress may not be able to do is tell a state how to allocate its presidential electors — but H. R. 1 doesn't purport to do that, " as the bill "limits itself to federal elections". Jessica Bulman-Pozen, a professor of constitutional law at Columbia Law School, told Reuters via email that Congress has over time "gained the power to enforce constitutional amendments concerning voting in both federal and state elections — including the 14th amendment, 15th Amendment, 19th Amendment, and 26th Amendment. " It has also passed many laws over the years on federal elections, such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

### Dissent and the right to protest in context of global health [^0eee574b]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Everyone has the right to dissent and to protest as part of international human rights law. However, despite this, in country after country, across all regions, the space and opportunity to dissent is shrinking due to various measures, including the surveillance of activists, the labelling of activists as 'terrorists' and the creation of barriers and distance between rulers and the general population. Often national security considerations are cited as justifications for the state to restrict or void the rights to peaceful protest, facilitate repression and criminalise forms of dissent that were previously permissible.

In some instances, protests against serious violations of human rights or egregious environmental destruction are being met with violence, including extrajudicial killings. Reports of governments using police and other security actors against peaceful protesters are increasingwith journalists reporting these violations also coming under attack. Another worrying trend is use of Strategic Lawsuits against Public Participation whereby state (and non-state actors such as private corporations) deploy litigation to censor, intimidate or silence critics by burdening them with litigation until they abandon their criticism or protest.

According to the International Network of Civil Liberties Organizations, more governments are framing legitimate protest as a threat to security requiring 'a forceful government response' and are increasingly using 'unnecessary legal restrictions, discriminatory responses, criminalisation of leaders and unjustifiable — at times deadly — force'. In 2020, Global Witness estimated 'an average of four killings of environmental human rights defenders every week'. t was the deadliest year recorded by them so far. The UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders pointed out that at least 281 human rights defenders, including 38 women, having been killed in 2021 in 35 countries, and warned that further killings would occur unless radical action was taken.

The crackdown on civic space and stifling of dissent spells trouble for democracy and equitable and sustainable development. It may even be one of the biggest threats confronting global society. Unless we nurture or create spaces and opportunities for dissent, we risk destroying not only the basic structure of healthy democracies and hard-won human rights, but also our ability to respond to the major challenges that confront humanity from global heating to contagion and conflict.

### How political engineering can make health a bridge to peace: lessons from a primary health care project in Myanmar's border areas [^ccb39219]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Project outcomes: what worked and what did not

If health is a bridge to peace, then the SDC PHC project is the engineer. (interviewee, 2016 PHCP Midterm Review)

Engineering a bridge to peace

Project stakeholders explained that health could bring together actors from opposite 'sides' of the conflict around shared, apolitical goals, thereby 'building trust, building social cohesion on the ground'. Yet, the project was far from the traditional model that considers health as a 'bridge to peace' because it somehow transcends politics. Although officially, many project actors verbalised that 'health is not political', few considered this to be the case.

For ECBHO members, 'convergence' with state health systems was linked with aspirations for self-determination and self-administration within a federal model. As one ECBHO member stated, "our convergence vision is based on our political goals". Government health workers, in contrast, continued to operate within a highly centralised model, meaning that 'as soon as EHOs are involved, it gets very politicised' — an SDC representative explained. Each aspect of coordination was therefore understood to be politically loaded, with this acknowledgement being vital to the project's ability to build trust and achieve outcomes.

Political sensitivity was built into the project from the outset. For example, there was discussion about the 50:50 allocation of funds to both sides. ECBHOs argued that to achieve equity in outcomes (and not simply equality in funds disbursed), historically marginalised non-government groups should receive a disproportionate share of project funds. Although the 50:50 split was preserved, it nevertheless brought non-government service providers to the table on a more equal basis with government counterparts than would otherwise have been possible (and more than was possible in other donor-funded health programmes).

### Health systems changes after decentralisation: progress, challenges and dynamics in Pakistan [^57beb30b]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Leadership support, capacity and federal–provincial coordination

Proliferation in health systems initiatives post devolution has been driven by strong support by provincial governments and the civil bureaucracy. At the same time, key factors need to be understood that have constrained effective translation.

The provinces had a disadvantaged start in terms of technical capability as the past context of federally dominated political, fiscal, administrative power stunted the maturity of provincial administrative structures. Strong political support for devolution and visible ownership of health in all four provinces led to increased resourcing of health from government budget, push for provincial planning and monitoring, as well as support for regulation, contracting and other governance initiatives to circumvent slow-moving government systems to deliver results. At the same time, the loosening of federal verticality made the provinces vulnerable to interference by provincial political elites. Political pressure for visible health infrastructure projects, specialty schemes, recruitment of local constituents and instances of favoured appointments was seen in all provinces, often derailing health sector strategies. Provinces where health ministries had strong executive backing were better able to withstand political pressures than those that were not closely aligned to provincial leadership. Trained human resource and lack of support systems has blunted progress of sector strategies despite an appetite for health reforms. Frequent change in health secretaries in all provinces further interrupted the momentum of progress.

An EUA is a FDA authorization for the emergency use of an unapproved product or unapproved use of an approved product (i.e., drug, biological product, or device) in the United States under certain circumstances including, but not limited to, when the Secretary of HHS declares that there is a public health emergency that affects the national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and that involves biological agent(s) or a disease or condition that may be attributable to such agent(s). Criteria for issuing an EUA include:

The biological agent(s) can cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition;
Based on the totality of the available scientific evidence (including data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, if available), it is reasonable to believe that
the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing the serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and
the known and potential benefits of the product - when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat such disease or condition - outweigh the known and potential risks of the product, taking into consideration the material threat posed by the biological agent(s);
There is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating the serious or life-threatening disease or condition.

### Racism and health in the United States: a policy statement from the American College of Physicians [^394f0135]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Racial minorities in the United States have reported experiencing widespread racism throughout all aspects of life, from housing to education to employment. Existing research has examined the role of racism, discrimination, and violence in one's interaction with the health care system and their association with poorer mental and physical health. Systemic racism that underlies the fabric of society often manifests itself in prominent institutions, such as law enforcement agencies, regardless of individual intent. Overt and covert racist laws and policies, personal implicit biases, and other factors result in Black individuals and other people of color being the subject of law enforcement violence and criminal justice system interactions at disproportionately high rates. The demonstrated association between discriminatory law enforcement practices and violence and personal and community health necessitates treating these issues as public health issues worthy of a public policy intervention. Addressing some of the sources of institutional racism and harm through transparency and accountability measures is the first of many steps required to begin correcting historical racial injustices.

### US FDA advisory panel members' assessment of premarket approval process and suggestions for improvement [^cb8fab34]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

While there is currently no requirement for a vote from an advisory committee for device approval and no set threshold for such a vote if it is taken, most respondents noted that they would feel most comfortable if a supermajority of panelists were in favor of approval. This suggests that panel members may consider even a few dissenting votes concerning and indicative of doubts regarding device approval. Notably, while the FDA does not have the regulatory authority to approve with reservations, panels' recommendations to the FDA could potentially be more nuanced and include such an option. It may also be the case that the interests of the FDA and panelists may diverge in this respect, with panelists being primarily focused on scientific rigor and evaluating the evidence and the FDA having to consider the opinions of patient groups and sponsors eager for new device approvals, the clarity and consistency of messaging, and the political milieu of device approvals.

Recent research on FDA advisory committees shows that while panel recommendations are usually accepted by the FDA, the FDA has wide latitude regarding whether to convene panel meetings at all. Sometimes the logic is relatively clear, such as when FDA Summaries frequently state that, "In accordance with the provisions of section 515(c)(2) of the act as amended by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, this PMA was not referred to the… FDA advisory committee, for review and recommendations because the information in the PMA substantially duplicates information previously reviewed by this panel". There may be other reasons for avoiding panel meetings, as these are resource intensive, may create other burdens for FDA staff and leadership, and are increasingly convened less often. Just as other commentators have asked the FDA to be more consistent and transparent regarding the process of whether to convene panels, respondents in the current survey appeared to urge the FDA to make better use of their expertise when a panel was convened by involving them in pivotal trial designs, allowing them to have input into device labels, and sharing data from trials in other countries with comparable regulatory regimes with them. While respondents had a high degree of respect for the FDA and the integrity of the panel process, they seemed eager to be more helpful to the FDA. Notably, this may derive from altruistic self-selection, since panelists, who are carefully vetted for conflicts of interest and relationships with industry and are paid nominal to negligible amounts for their participation, may be highly motivated by a desire to protect and support patients and public health.

### "Choice" in end-of-life decision making: researching fact or fiction? [^1f1bd00a]. The Gerontologist (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

The contribution of bioethics to clinical care at the end of life (EOL) deserves critical scrutiny. We argue that researchers have rarely questioned the normative power of autonomy-based bioethics practices. Research on the ethical dimensions of EOL decision making has focused on an idealized discourse of patient "choice" that requires patients to embrace their dying to receive excellent palliative care.

Design and Methods

Our critique is based on a comprehensive review of empirical research exploring bioethics practices at the EOL. In addition we will provide a brief review of our own ethnographic, longitudinal study of the decision-making experience of dying patients, their families, and their health care providers.

Results

There is little or no empirical evidence to support the autonomy paradigm of patient "choice" in EOL decision making. What we found is that (a). prognostication at the EOL is problematic and resisted; (b). shared decision making is illusory, patients often resist advance care planning and hold other values more important than autonomy, and system characteristics are more determinative of EOL care than patient preferences; and (c). the incommensurability of medical and lay knowledge and values and the multifaceted and processual nature of patient and family decision making are at odds with the current EOL approach toward advance care planning.

Implications

It is exceedingly difficult to identify, study, and critique normative assumptions without creating them, reproducing them, or obliterating them in the process. However, a fuller account of the morally significant domains of end-of-life care is needed. Researchers and policy makers should heed what we have learned from empirical research on EOL care to develop more sensitive and supportive programs for care of the dying.

### Lessons from co-production of evidence and policy in Nigeria's COVID-19 response [^d5b426ec]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

The impact of the evidence co-production model was also constrained by limitations inherent to the Nigerian public health system, political system and economy. First, although the PTF led the national multisectoral response, Nigeria's federal structure means that individual state governments led local implementation despite varying capacity. Decisions made at federal level were not always effectively translated into action for communities on the ground. In other instances, states were overly dependent on federal institutions. Other limitations were found in historical aspects of Nigeria's political economy, such as its weak public health funding, particularly at primary healthcare level; a small and shrinking share of resources available for public health, including for the COVID-19 response; public distrust of government authorities and insecurity due to terrorism and other security risks.

Requesting assistance for evacuation — We suggest during a disaster or pandemic that overwhelms local and regional resources and requires large-scale hospital evacuations assistance, from national and/or international government medical support and evacuation agencies should be requested, and we suggest the CCTL should be aware of the process for requesting evacuation assistance and the resources available at a regional and national level; in the United States, the federal government mobilizes emergency medical resources through the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), and the hospital must request assistance through local emergency management, which triggers a chain of requests for regional, state, and federal assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
