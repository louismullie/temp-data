## Question

A 64-year-old develops abdominal pain and leukocytosis hours after an ERCP. The clinician documents an 'ERCP-related postprocedural digestive complication, not elsewhere classified'. Which ICD-10-CM code should be assigned for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM diagnosis code should be assigned for a 64-year-old who develops abdominal pain and leukocytosis hours after ERCP, with the clinician documenting an "ERCP-related postprocedural digestive complication, not elsewhere classified". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this presentation maps to a recognized ERCP complication. Then, I should verify whether there is a specific ICD-10-CM code for post-ERCP complications. Next, I will check for the most appropriate "not elsewhere classified" postprocedural complication code. Finally, I should confirm whether to add a secondary code for the symptom of abdominal pain and ensure the encounter type is correct.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario. Abdominal pain with leukocytosis occurring within hours of ERCP is a classic presentation for post-ERCP pancreatitis, which is the most common serious complication of ERCP, though I should not jump to conclusions without considering other possibilities like cholangitis, perforation, or bleeding. Still, the timing and labs strongly suggest an iatrogenic complication rather than a preexisting condition, which supports using a postprocedural complication code rather than a primary disease code [^db9086dd] [^19e247d0].

> Wait, let me verify whether there is a dedicated ICD-10-CM code for post-ERCP complications. I initially thought there might be a specific code like K87.8, but hold on, I should verify that. On review, there is no unique ICD-10-CM code explicitly labeled for "post-ERCP complication", so I need to use a general postprocedural complication code and, if needed, specify the manifestation separately, which aligns with how large administrative studies operationalize PEP and other ERCP adverse events using combinations of codes rather than a single bespoke code [^95f0995a].

> I will now examine the most appropriate "not elsewhere classified" postprocedural complication code. The correct ICD-10-CM code for a digestive system complication following a digestive system procedure, not elsewhere classified, is K91.89. This fits the documented "ERCP-related postprocedural digestive complication, not elsewhere classified" and is the standard fallback when a more specific complication code is not available or the exact complication is not yet determined clinically [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify whether to add a secondary code for abdominal pain. The symptom of abdominal pain can be coded as R10.9 (unspecified abdominal pain) as an additional diagnosis to capture the clinical presentation, but I need to ensure it is not the primary diagnosis since the complication itself is the reason for care. This approach is consistent with ICD-10-CM principles of coding the complication first and adding symptoms when they contribute to the encounter or require evaluation and management [^notfound].

> Let me consider the encounter type. Because this is a new presentation of a complication hours after the procedure, this should be coded as an initial encounter, and if follow-up care is needed, subsequent encounter coding would apply. I should double-check that the documentation supports initial encounter status, which it does given the new-onset symptoms and evaluation underway [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the primary diagnosis code is K91.89 for the postprocedural digestive complication, with R10.9 as an optional secondary code for abdominal pain if clinically relevant to the encounter. I should confirm that the medical record supports the causal relationship to ERCP and that the complication arose after the procedure, which is implied by the clinician's documentation and the temporal pattern, strengthening the appropriateness of K91.89 in this context [^notfound].

The most appropriate ICD-10-CM code for an ERCP-related postprocedural digestive complication not elsewhere classified is **K91.89** (Other postprocedural complications and disorders of digestive system). This code applies when the complication is not specifically named elsewhere in ICD-10-CM and is the correct choice for a documented ERCP-related digestive complication that does not fit a more specific category such as pancreatitis, cholangitis, or perforation. If the specific complication is identified later, **code to that specific diagnosis** instead of K91.89.

---

## ICD-10-CM code selection

- **K91.89**: Other postprocedural complications and disorders of digestive system. This code is used for postprocedural digestive complications that are not otherwise classified, including ERCP-related complications that do not have a more specific ICD-10-CM code.

- **K91.8**: Other postprocedural complications and disorders of digestive system. This is the parent category that includes K91.89 and other specified postprocedural digestive complications.

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding relies on **clear clinical documentation**. The following elements should be included in the medical record:

- **Procedure details**: Document the ERCP procedure, including the date, indication, and any interventions performed (e.g. sphincterotomy, stent placement, stone extraction).

- **Complication description**: Clearly describe the complication, including symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, leukocytosis), diagnostic findings (e.g. laboratory results, imaging studies), and clinical assessment.

- **Temporal relationship**: Document the timing of the complication relative to the ERCP procedure to establish a causal relationship.

- **Exclusion of specific complications**: Document any evaluation to exclude specific complications such as pancreatitis, cholangitis, or perforation, as this supports the use of the unspecified code K91.89.

---

## Alternative ICD-10-CM codes for specific ERCP complications

If the specific complication is identified, **use the appropriate specific ICD-10-CM code**:

| **Complication** | **ICD-10-cm code** |
|-|-|
| Post-ERCP pancreatitis | K85.10 |
| Post-ERCP cholangitis | K83.0 |
| Post-ERCP perforation | K91.830 |
| Post-ERCP bleeding | K91.840 |
| Post-ERCP infection | T81.4XXA |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate ICD-10-CM code for an ERCP-related postprocedural digestive complication not elsewhere classified is **K91.89**. This code should be used when the complication does not fit a more specific category. Ensure that clinical documentation clearly supports the diagnosis and the causal relationship to the ERCP procedure. If a specific complication is identified later, **code to that specific diagnosis** instead of K91.89.

### Temporal trends and mortality of post-ERCP pancreatitis in the United States: a nationwide analysis [^56de315b]. Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP) is the most common and most serious complication of ERCP. Our aim was to estimate the nationwide incidence, temporal trends, and mortality of PEP in the United States and to establish risk factors associated with PEP development. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study analyzing Nationwide Inpatient Sample data from 2011 to 2017 using International Classification of Diseases codes. The primary outcomes were trends in PEP incidence and predictors of PEP development. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and admission to the intensive care unit. RESULTS: Of 1222467 adult patients who underwent inpatient ERCP during the study period, 55225 (4.5%) developed PEP. The hospital admission rate of PEP increased by 15.3%, from 7735 in 2011 to 8920 in 2017 (odds ratio [OR] 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.46; P = 0.02). The overall rate of mortality increased from 2.8% of PEP cases in 2011 to 4.4% in 2017 (OR 1.62, 95%CI 1.10–2.38; P = 0.01). Multiple patient-related (alcohol use, cocaine use, obesity, chronic kidney disease, heart failure), procedure-related (therapeutic ERCP, sphincterotomy, pancreatic duct stent placement, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction), and hospital-related (teaching hospitals, hospitals located in the West and Midwest) factors that impact the occurrence of PEP were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed rising hospital admission and mortality rates associated with PEP in the United States. This calls for a greater recognition of this life-threatening complication and amelioration of its risk factors, whenever possible.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Update in preventing post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis [^64bd0dbe]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Of all the possible complications associated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), acute pancreatitis undoubtedly represents the heaviest burden for patients and healthcare professionals. The overall incidence, ranging from 3.5% to around 10%, and annual estimated costs exceeding $150 million in the USA should signal caution for everyone carrying out ERCP. In-depth knowledge of the risk factors and the pharmacological and endoscopic treatment options is required to avoid this adverse event. In this review, we evaluate the relevant data published in the literature since the appearance of the latest recommendations of the leading gastroenterological societies. Thus, we intend to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the factors to consider and possible interventions applicable before and after the intervention to prevent the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis.

### Impact of atrial fibrillation on in-hospital outcomes following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: a propensity score-matched analysis of the national inpatient sample (2016–2020) [^3a9343bb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Concerning the thrombotic events, the risk of developing PE was significantly lower in patients with AF. Similarly, although it did not reach statistical significance, there was a trend toward a lesser risk of DVT in this group. This is despite patients with AF having a longer mean hospital stay (8.2 vs. 6.1 days), a well-established risk factor for the development of DVT and PE. A possible explanation for this finding is the fact that after undergoing ERCP, AF patients would be put on therapeutic anticoagulation as soon as feasible, while those without AF would be kept on prophylactic anticoagulation for the duration of their hospitalization.

Our study had several strengths, including a large sample size, which provides a robust and comprehensive overview of in-hospital outcomes across a wide variety of US hospital institutions. Moreover, the use of propensity matching mitigates confounding variables and allows for a more balanced comparison between groups. However, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the retrospective design limits inference, and causation cannot be established. Additionally, while propensity score matching helps reduce confounding, residual confounding may persist despite our best efforts to account for relevant factors. Second, the reliance on administrative data coded via ICD-10 introduces the potential for misclassification bias and limits the granularity of certain variables, particularly when assessing complications and comorbidities. Furthermore, the ICD-10 codes used to identify atrial fibrillation and procedural complications, such as biliary perforation, post-ERCP pancreatitis, and gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary bleeding, may not fully capture the clinical complexity or severity of these conditions. Additionally, administrative databases like the National Inpatient Sample do not capture data regarding the cause of death or prolonged hospital stay, limiting the interpretation of some of our findings. These limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings, highlighting the need for prospective studies with more precise data collection to validate and expand upon these results.

### Chronic liver disease as a risk factor for post-ERCP complications: a nationwide retrospective analysis [^6bedd0f9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is indicated for multiple pancreatic and biliary pathologies and carries a heightened risk profile compared with other endoscopic procedures. Considerable research has been directed towards discerning risk factors associated with complications such as post-ERCP pancreatitis and post-ERCP bleeding. Despite this, data on chronic liver disease (CLD) as a risk factor for complications is limited. We aimed to assess the outcomes of patients with CLD who underwent therapeutic or diagnostic ERCP to determine whether these patients had different outcomes relative to patients without CLD.

Methods

We used the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database to inquire for all adult patients who underwent ERCP between 2016 and 2019 using the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding. The group was stratified into 2 groups: patients with CLD and those without. The main outcome we looked at was the rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis, post-ERCP hemorrhage, and perforation between the 2 groups. The secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and length of stay. A multivariate regression model was used to estimate the association of CLD with ERCP outcomes.

Results

We identified a total of 883,825 patients who underwent ERCP between 2016 and 2019. Among these, 21,212 (2.4%) had CLD and 862,613 (97.6%) did not have CLD. The mean age for patients in liver disease group was 61.66 years and in group without liver disease was 60.46 years. The predominant ethnicity in both groups was whites. Additional admission-related factors are outlined in Table 1. The rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis (8.8% vs. 6.7%, P < 0.001) with adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.3; and post-ERCP hemorrhage (8.8% vs. 6.69%, P < 0.001) with aOR 1.35, was higher in the patient group with CLD. The rate of post-procedure perforation was not significantly different in both groups. For secondary outcomes; the in-hospital mortality (3.03% vs. 1.58%, P < 0.001) and length of stay (7 days vs. 3 days, P < 0.001) were higher in the patients with chronic liver disease. The outcomes are mentioned in Table 2.

Conclusion

Although ERCP is considered a safe procedure, it is one of the endoscopic procedures associated with the highest risk of complications. As a result, risk stratification is crucial. Certain demographics, conditions like end-stage renal disease, liver cirrhosis, and procedural factors have been identified as risk factors for post-ERCP complications. Our study represents newer data, with use of revised ICD codes, to demonstrate increased risk in patients with liver disease. On the basis of these results, ERCP should be used judiciously in this population and further studies are required for identifying reversible risk factors to improve outcomes.

### Impact of atrial fibrillation on in-hospital outcomes following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: a propensity score-matched analysis of the national inpatient sample (2016–2020) [^95f0995a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Study objective

The primary objective of this study was to elucidate the impact of atrial fibrillation on in-hospital outcomes among patients undergoing ERCP during their hospitalization. The primary outcome assessed was all-cause in-hospital mortality during the index hospitalization. Secondary outcomes encompassed the length of stay, the total cost of hospitalization, and procedure-related and non-procedure-related complications during the same hospitalization.

Study variables

Demographic variables such as age, sex and race/ethnicity were directly extracted from the NIS data. Age was categorized into 4 ranges: 18–44, 45–64, 65–84 and 85+ years. BMI categories were defined using ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes for overweight (BMI 25–29.9 kg/m 2), class I and II obesity (BMI 30–39.9 kg/m 2), and Class III obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m 2). Patients who did not fall into these 3 categories were classified as having a BMI < 25 kg/m 2. AF was identified using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. The presence or absence of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, alcohol dependence history, nicotine dependence history, heart failure, malignancy, CKD, COPD, CLD, asthma and PAH was determined using corresponding ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. The indication for the ERCP was evaluated based on the presence of 1 or more of the following conditions: acute cholangitis, acute gallstone pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis, pancreaticobiliary mass, obstructive jaundice with no clear cause; all these were coded using the corresponding ICD-10 CM codes. When none of these conditions were present during the index hospitalization, the indication for the ERCP was labeled as miscellaneous. Pancreatic and biliary stenting during the ERCP were coded using corresponding ICD-10 PCS codes. Antiplatelet or anticoagulant use, and pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implants before admission were also coded using corresponding ICD 10 codes. A literature review guided the identification of potential procedure-related and non-procedure-related complications following ERCP, and new variables were created based on the corresponding ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes. For acute post-ERCP pancreatitis, since no specific ICD-10 code was available, a previously well-validated combination of existing ICD-10 codes was used. Inpatient mortality and length of stay data were extracted directly from the NIS dataset.

### US nationwide insight into all-cause 30-day readmissions following inpatient endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^cedc590d]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is associated with a high risk for morbidity, mortality, and hospital readmission. Data regarding those risks in the United States is scarce. We assessed post-ERCP 30-day readmission rates, their etiologies, and impact on the health care system using national data.

Methods

Using the National Readmission Database 2016, we identified patients who underwent inpatient ERCP from January 2016 to December 2016 using ICD-10-CM procedure codes. The primary endpoint was all-cause 30-day readmission rate. Etiologies of readmission were identified by tallying primary diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression with complex survey design was used to identify independent risk factors associated with readmission.

Results

A total of 130,145 patients underwent ERCP, 16,278 (12.5%) were readmitted within 30 days, with an associated cost of 268 million dollars. Nearly 40% of readmissions occurred within 7 days, and 47.9% were related to gastrointestinal etiologies. Male gender, increased comorbidities, cirrhosis, Medicare insurance, and pancreatitis or pancreatitis-related indications for ERCP were readmission risk factors. Performance of cholecystectomy on index hospitalization decreased odds of readmission by 50% (adjusted odds ratio: 0.48, 95% confidence interval: 0.45–0.52, P < 0.0001). While academic and nonacademic centers had similar readmission rates, high ERCP volume centers had higher rates compared with low-volume centers (adjusted odds ratio:1.10, P = 0.008).

Conclusion

All-cause 30-day readmission rates after inpatient ERCPs are high, mostly occur shortly postdischarge, and impose a heavy health care system burden. Large, multicenter prospective studies assessing the impact of center procedure volume on complications and readmission rates are needed.

### All-cause mortality after ERCP [^ca4f2435]. Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Background and study aims: This study aimed to externally validate a recently developed English model for the prediction of 30-day mortality after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Real-world mortality data beyond 30 days post-ERCP are scarce; thus, the study also aimed to develop a prediction model for mortality up to 12 months post-ERCP. Patients and methods: All patients who underwent their first ERCP during a 3-year period (n = 16478), as identified from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Registry, were linked to the Swedish Death Registry. Factors associated with all-cause mortality up to 12 months post-ERCP were identified by Cox proportional hazards analysis. A prediction model was developed. Results: Post-ERCP mortality was 5% at 30 days and increased to 11.9% at 3 months. The English model slightly overpredicted 30-day mortality, which was corrected with recalibration. Discriminant validity of the recalibrated model was very good (c-statistic = 0.82). Independent predictors of medium-term mortality were: emergency admission (hazard ratio [HR] 1.48), cancer (HR 3.79), noncancer co-morbidity (1.33), gallstone-related diagnosis (HR 0.21), and age (HR 4.86 for ≥ 85 years vs. < 55 years). The c-statistic for 3-12-month mortality was 0.86–0.88. Specific ERCP complication codes were identified in 1.8% of deaths within 30 days post-ERCP (0.09% of ERCPs), and 75% of deaths (18% of ERCPs) within 1 year post-ERCP were due to cancer. Conclusions: Mortality doubled from 30 days to 3 months post-ERCP, but it was attributed mainly to underlying disease, notably cancer, and infrequently to ERCP-related causes. A previously developed model predicting 30-day mortality was externally validated. A model accurately predicting mortality up to 12 months post-ERCP was developed.

### Complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^b73f132b]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Up to 1 in 6 patients will experience an unplanned hospitalization after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), largely for the evaluation and management of adverse events. Therefore, a commitment to the prevention, early recognition, and effective rescue of complications related to ERCP is critical toward improving outcomes. ERCP is most often complicated by acute pancreatitis, bleeding, infection, or perforation, although myriad other adverse events may occur. The prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis has been the area of greatest interest and progress in the last decade, but the application of evidence-based prophylactic measures remains inconsistent. Innovations in stent, hemostasis, and perforation closure technology now allow effective and efficient endoscopic management of several important nonpancreatitis complications. Overall, our ability to prevent and treat ERCP-related adverse events has improved substantially, amplifying the importance of a high level of suspicion for and a thorough understanding of these events.

### Post-ERCP cholecystitis: incidence, characteristics, and outcomes from a prospective multicenter biliary endoscopy registry [^cf6e3a8f]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of post-ERCP cholecystitis are poorly described. We aimed to describe cases of post-ERCP cholecystitis from a prospective multicenter registry with protocolized 30-day follow-up.

Methods

Patient- and procedure-related data from 7 centers were obtained. The primary outcome was post-ERCP cholecystitis, defined according to a Delphi-based criteria and causal attribution system. Risk factors and outcomes were described for all cases.

Results

Seventeen cases of post-ERCP cholecystitis were identified among 4428 patients with gallbladders undergoing ERCP between 2018 and 2023 (incidence, 0.38%; 95% confidence interval, 0.20–0.57). In ERCPs with covered metal stenting, 7 of 467 resulted in cholecystitis (incidence, 1.50%; 95% confidence interval, 0.40–2.60). Patients had symptoms at a median of 5 days (interquartile range, 5) after ERCP. Management strategies included cholecystectomy, percutaneous cholecystostomy, and endoscopic stent removal/exchange.

Conclusions

Estimates of post-ERCP cholecystitis incidence can inform discussions around procedural risk.

### Risk factors for therapeutic ERCP-related complications: an analysis of 2, 715 cases performed by a single endoscopist [^e81fc401]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) remains one of the most complex endoscopic procedures in the non-surgical management of several pancreatobiliary diseases. The main complications arising from therapeutic ERCP are well-recognized and include acute pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation, and cholangitis. The reported incidence of post-ERCP complications varies widely from study to study and ranges for pancreatitis between 1–5%, hemorrhage 1–4%, perforation 1–2% and cholangitis 1–5%. Precise identification of risk factors for complications of ERCP is important because it can improve the safety of the procedure and recognize the high-risk cases in which ERCP should be avoided if possible or in which protective endoscopic (pancreatic stents) or pharmacologic measures should be considered to minimize the rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP). Moreover, the identification of the procedure's risk factors may also aid in distinguishing patients at low risk for complications who are eligible for therapeutic ERCP on an outpatient basis, thereby reducing the cost of ERCP.

The aim of the present study was to reliably investigate the patient- and procedure-related risk factors of therapeutic ERCP complications by analyzing a large collected dataset in a single center of a single expert endoscopist.

Materials and methods

Data source

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using the US-Collaborative TriNetX Analytics Network Platform (Cambridge, USA), a comprehensive global federated research network, incorporating demographic and administrative data from 69 healthcare organizations for more than 110 million patients in the US. The TriNetX platform facilitates cohort selection and the application of propensity-score matching (PSM), allowing for comparative analysis while accounting for potential confounders. PSM was performed to adjust for confounding variables, including age, sex, race/ethnicity and number of hospitalizations. Known risk factors for post-ERCP adverse events, such as younger age, female sex and history of acute pancreatitis, were prioritized. Unfortunately, ERCP-specific procedural variables, such as ductal dilation or cannulation technique, were not available in TriNetX and thus could not be included in the PSM. This was a limitation of the study. A rigorous quality assurance process is enforced during the extraction of electronic health records, ensuring that the data are systematically formatted and standardized before their inclusion in the database. In accordance with the guidelines from the National Human Research Protections Advisory Committee, this study was exempt from Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, as it involved publicly available, de-identified data. The de-identification process, as stipulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, is meticulously executed at the network level by a qualified expert within the TriNetX framework.

Study population and variables

A real-time search and analysis of the US Collaborative Network in the TriNetX platform were conducted from 2010–2024. We analyzed records of adults (≥ 18 years) who were hospitalized and underwent ERCP. We then stratified patients by the presence of CF into 2 groups, those who had CF and those who did not (control group), using codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) (ICD-10: E84).

### Study details | Cmplications of ERCP-clinicalTrials.gov… [^3a05b9ef]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Most of the complications post-ERCP are apparent during the first 6 hours after the procedure. Thus patients require careful monitoring during this phase to detect symptoms or signs suggesting adverse events. Table 1 below sums up the complications related to ERCP that has been reported in various studies. Table 1: Complications of ERCP Related to pancreaticobiliary instrumentation Pancreatitis Bleeding Infection. Related to technical issue with endoscopy Electrosurgical hazards: Thermal injury: perforation Inadequate cautery: Bleeding Air insufflation: Post ERCP pain Contrast allergy Perforation Related to anesthesia Cardiopulmonary complication: Aspiration Hypoxemia Cardiac dysrhythmia Rare complications Gallstone ileus Colonic perforation Liver abscess splenic/hepatic/vascular trauma Pneumothorax Gas embolism Impaction of retrieval basket Biloma Multiple studies have evaluated the incidence of post ERCP complications.

ERCP is generally indicated in as per guidelines published by American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.
- The jaundiced patient suspected of having biliary obstruction.
- The patient without jaundice whose clinical and biochemical or imaging data suggest pancreatic duct or biliary tract disease.
- Evaluation of signs or symptoms suggesting pancreatic malignancy when results of direct imaging are equivocal or normal.
- Evaluation of pancreatitis of unknown etiology.
- Preoperative evaluation of the patient with chronic pancreatitis and/or pseudocyst.
- Evaluation of the sphincter of Oddi by manometry. Empirical biliary sphincterotomy without sphincter of Oddi manometry is not recommended in patients with suspected type III sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.
- Ampullectomy of adenomatous neoplasms of the major papilla.
- Therapy of disorders of the biliary and pancreatic ducts.
- Facilitation of cholangioscopy and/or pancreatoscopy. It is generally recommended that patients not undergo routine pre-procedure laboratory testing, chest radiography, or electrocardiography prior to endoscopic procedures. The overall specific complications varies from 5 to 10 percent in various studies. In a prospective study of total 2347 patients, complications occurred in 229 patients. In a summary of 21 studies involving 16, 855 patients between 1987 and 2003, specific complications totalled 1154, with 55 deaths., younger age, precut sphincterotomy, difficult cannulation, number of pancreatic contrast injection, pancreas divisum, failed clearance of biliary stone, prior post ERCP pancreatitis, female sex, normal serum bilirubin, absence of chronic pancreatitis, placement of stent and ASA score III-IV. BLEEDING: It is the second most common complication post ERCP in most studies. Bleeding was the most feared complication when therapeutic biliary endoscopy was first introduced. Because of advances in equipment and experience, it has become a relatively uncommon complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and it is mostly observed after sphincterotomy.

### Defining and measuring endoscopic complications: more questions than answers [^8a8e2d8e]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The demand for information on quality in health care has risen sharply over the past decade. Endoscopic outcomes, including complication rates, need to be accurately measured and reported. Such documentation continues to be problematic because of the lack of a widely accepted classification system for endoscopic complications. Such a system should (1) include unequivocal definitions for the various types of negative outcomes and categories of complications; (2) define what negative outcomes are to be classified as complications, and (3) standardize the stratification of complications by severity. Establishing such a standardized classification of endoscopic complications could facilitate clinical research, improve the position of gastroenterologists vis-à-vis pay-for-performance programs, and result in better and more meaningful quality improvement programs, ultimately improving the care provided to patients.

### Evolution in the management of acute cholecystitis in the elderly: population-based cohort study [^adfb7933]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Data were derived from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database. This is an administrative dataset that collects patient-level data from all National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England. It captures all patients treated in public sector hospitals and a minority of patients treated in privately funded institutions. Patients are linked to a unique HES identifier, which allows all of their hospital admissions to be tracked throughout the dataset. Permissions for the comparison of anonymized administrative data were obtained from the National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care in England.

Coding of data

Relevant International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes were used to identify all patients over the age of 80 years who were admitted as an emergency for the treatment of acute cholecystitis (Supplementary Material), between 1st January 1997 and 31st December 2012. Patients primarily admitted with other gallstone-related disorders, including biliary colic, acute cholangitis, and acute pancreatitis were excluded from this study. Only patients identified as emergency admissions were included in this analysis using the admission codes (method of admission 21–28). Readmissions following index emergency admission with further gallstone-related disease were identified using relevant ICD-10 codes (Supplementary Material). Local verification of ICD-10 codes used for diagnosis and patient allocation was performed as part of the quality assurance for the data included.

Allocation to treatment groups

Treatments were identified using the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures 4th revision (OPCS-4) codes (Supplementary Material). Treatment groups included the following:

Conservative management (defined as best supportive medical treatment alone in the absence of any formal surgical, endoscopic, or radiological intervention).
Cholecystectomy on index admission.
Percutaneous cholecystostomy placement on index admission.

All patients requiring initial intervention with endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatogram (ERCP) were excluded from analysis due to the potential influence of common bile duct stones or the presence of ascending cholangitis upon outcomes.

Within the cholecystectomy group, patients were subdivided into those receiving laparoscopic cholecystectomy and those undergoing open surgery. Patients who had initial attempt at a laparoscopic approach followed by conversion to open were included in the laparoscopic surgery group (based on an intention to treat analysis). Post-operative complications were defined as bile duct injury (defined by need for biliary reconstruction) or need for post-operative ERCP (as treatment of post-operative bile leak or retained stones). These interventions were identified through the relevant OPCS-4 codes (Supplementary Material).

### Safety and indications for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in liver transplant patients: an analysis of the United States' national inpatient sample database [^d01861e5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

We also noted that indications to perform ERCP were significantly different between the liver transplantation and the general adult population. Bile duct anastomotic stricture, bile leak and cholangitis are commonly reported indications in liver transplant patients, while choledocholithiasis, biliary pancreatitis and cholangitis are the most common indications in the general adult population for ERCP, according to previous studies. Like these studies, bile duct stricture was the most common indication for ERCP in our study in transplant patients, while choledocholithiasis was the main reason for performing ERCP in the general adult population.

There are various shortcomings to our study. First, the retrospective nature of our study meant that the exposure was not entirely randomized. However, we employed multivariate regression, including diverse patient and hospital-level characteristics in the model to control for confounders. Second, using ICD-10 codes instead of clinical parameters can result in misclassification of the diagnosis. Third, data on laboratory parameters are not stored in the NIS; therefore, the severity of complications could not be accounted for. Regardless of these constraints, our study has numerous strengths. We used the NIS database, which includes data on patients and various hospital-level characteristics from more than 45 states, resulting in better external validity and generalizability; hence we believe that the results should reflect the patient population admitted to hospitals across the United States.

Moreover, NIS eliminates the commonly encountered limitation of single-center studies by allowing the use of a nationally representative large sample size. Another striking feature of our study is that we excluded patients admitted for new transplants, given the high comorbidity burden in the peri-transplant period. This resulted in a bias-free assessment of the outcomes.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Biliary complications represent a substantial cause of post-liver transplant morbidity and mortality, affecting about 6–34% of patients
Biliary stricture and bile leak are the 2 most common complications seen in liver transplant recipients
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the main treatment modality for biliary complications in liver transplant recipients

What the new findings are:

In our analysis we found that ERCP is safe in live transplant recipients
No difference in the adjusted odds of post-ERCP pancreatitis, bleeding, cholangitis and sepsis was seen between the liver transplant and no-transplant groups
Biliary stricture was the most common indication for ERCP in liver transplant patients
Biliary stricture patients who underwent sphincterotomy have a higher rate of complications in the liver transplant group compared to no-transplant patients

### Optimum timing of emergency cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis in england: population-based cohort study [^7203706f]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Data were derived from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database. This is an administrative dataset that collects patient-level data from all National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England.

Patients are linked to a unique HES identifier, which allows all of their hospital admissions to be tracked throughout the dataset. Permissions for the comparison of anonymized administrative data were obtained from the National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care in England.

Coding of data

Relevant International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes were used to identify all patients who were admitted as an emergency for the treatment of acute cholecystitis (ICD-10 Codes K80.0, K80.1, K80.4, K81.0, K81.8, K81.9), between 1st January 1997 and 31st December 2012. Only patients identified as emergency admissions were included in this analysis using the admission codes (method of admission 21–28). Patients primarily admitted with other gallstone related disorders, including biliary colic, acute cholangitis and acute pancreatitis were excluded from this study. Local verification of ICD-10 codes used for diagnosis and patient allocation was performed as part of the quality assurance for the data included.

Allocation to treatment groups

Those patients who underwent cholecystectomy during index admission were identified using the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures 4th revision (OPCS-4) codes (supplementary material). Patients were allocated to three treatment groups based upon the elapsed time between admission and cholecystectomy. Definition of treatment groups was undertaken prior to data analysis through consensus between authors to identify clinically relevant threshold values. Treatment groups were defined as:

Patients undergoing cholecystectomy from day of admission to day three following admission (0–3 days)
Patients receiving cholecystectomy between days four and seven following admission (4–7 days)
Patients undergoing cholecystectomy greater than 8 days following admission (≥ 8 days)

All patients requiring pre-operative primary intervention with endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatogram (ERCP) were excluded from analysis due to the potential influence of need for ERCP affecting time delay to cholecystectomy.

Post-operative biliary complications were defined as need for post-operative ERCP (as treatment of post-operative bile leak or retained stones) or bile duct injury (defined by need for biliary reconstruction). These interventions were identified through the relevant OPCS-4 codes (supplementary material).

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^336983a5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Post-ERCP pancreatitis risk and diagnostic alternatives — Acute pancreatitis (AP) remains the most common complication of ERCP, and the incidence of AP varies widely 1%–30%. In general, diagnostic ERCP should be avoided in most patients and, if needed, should be performed in Centers of Excellence. The risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) is greater in a patient with a normal caliber CBD and normal bilirubin (odds ratio 3.4) compared with a jaundiced patient with a dilated CBD (odds ratio 0.2). In these patients, noninvasive MRCP or less-invasive EUS should be used because these methods of evaluating the CBD are as accurate and pose no risk of pancreatitis.

### Adverse events associated with ERCP [^84d1e156]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

ERCP bleeding — classification and grading describe a serious adverse event most commonly resulting from endoscopic biliary and/or pancreatic sphincterotomy, with the rate of post-sphincterotomy bleeding after ERCP estimated to be 0.3% to 2%. Bleeding after ERCP is classified as immediate or delayed, with delayed bleeding occurring from hours up to several weeks after endoscopic sphincterotomy, and bleeding can be clinically significant or insignificant based on the presence or absence of overt gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and change in hemoglobin; based on an ASGE lexicon, requirement of blood transfusion or angiographic therapy is moderate and severe bleeding results in prolonged hospital stay (> 10 days), prolonged intensive care unit stay (> 1 day), or required surgical intervention.

### Frailty as a predictor of outcomes in patients with post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis [^8513f4e8]. Pancreas (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to determine the association between frailty status and outcomes in patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP).

Methods

Appended data was obtained from the 2016–2017 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. We performed a nationwide cohort study utilizing International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic codes to identify adult patients with PEP. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) was used to classify patients as frail or non-frail. The primary outcome was composite complications related to PEP including all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of stay and total hospitalization costs.

Results

There were 41,615 patients represented in the data, with 34.6% (14,382) characterized as frail and 65.4% (27,233) as non-frail. 60.7% of frail patients suffered composite complications related to PEP compared to 29.3% of non-frail patients (P < 0.001). Frail patients had more cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal and endocrine, neurologic, and infectious complications compared to non- frail patients. Frail patients also had higher all-cause mortality rates during inpatient admission (4.6% vs. under 0.1%, P < 0.001) and increased length of stay (11.6 d vs. 0.8, P < 0.001) as well total hospitalization charges ($140,855 vs. $73,539, P < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, positive frailty status was associated with 2.94 times increased odds of having composite complications.

Conclusion

Frailty assessments can be utilized as a predictor of outcomes and serve to guide clinical decision-making when determining prophylactic measures in patients undergoing ERCP who may be at risk for PEP.

Methods to reduce post-ERCP pancreatitis — patient selection: "Appropriate patient selection is instrumental in reducing the incidence of PEP". "EUS and MRCP are equivalent to ERCP for the detection of some pancreaticobiliary disorders such as choledocholithiasis but lack the risk of pancreatitis associated with ERCP". Consequently, "ERCP is now largely reserved for indications in which the likelihood of therapeutic intervention is high", and "One high-risk group that should no longer be offered ERCP routinely is individuals with right upper quadrant abdominal pain after cholecystectomy without evidence of bile duct dilation or elevated liver-associated enzyme levels, the so-called type 3 SOD".

2 Methods

2.1 Hospital Episode Statistics

Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) is an administrative database including all episodes of secondary care treatment within England under the National Health Service. Information is recorded longitudinally to allow individual episodes to be linked. Data items include; diagnostic(International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD10) codes), procedures (Office of Population Census and Surveys Classification of Interventions and Procedures, version 4 (OPCS4) codes), demographic and administrative variables. Records are linked to the Office of National Statistics (ONS) to provide mortality data. The data has been analysed in concordance with the data sharing agreement with NHS Digital for HES data. As per national guidelines any data item of 5 or less patients is suppressed from publication.

2.2 Patient cohort

All patients with an OPCS4 code for ERCP (Appendix 1) from April 2006 to March 2017 and an ICD10 code for a primary hepatobiliary, pancreatic or small bowel malignancy (Appendix 2) in the preceding 2 years or the following 6 months were included to allow for delays in coding of a cancer diagnosis, and to ensure diagnoses were chronologically appropriate. Patients under 18 years of age, or with missing or invalid age or sex data were excluded, as these variables along with NHS number are used to generate the unique patient identifiers in HES. Patients not resident within England or of unknown region of residence were also excluded as their follow-up may occur outside of England and thus not be captured in HES. Any patients that following ERCP underwent a potentially curative operation (Appendix 3) were excluded to ensure only palliative patients were included.

Cancer aetiology was considered to be the most frequently recurring cancer diagnosis code in HES in the preceding 2 years or 6 months following ERCP. Any patient in whom this did not match their initial diagnosis code were excluded, as patients were included based on their initial diagnosis meeting the criteria for inclusion.

A patient with history of a Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass was admitted with choledocholithiasis. During the admission, the patient had an endoscopic ultrasound directed trans-gastric ERCP procedure with stent placement for a biliary anastomotic stricture. This is a two-stage procedure where in stage one, a fistula is created to connect the gastric pouch to the excluded stomach. Once the fistula forms, stage two is completed which involves relieving any obstructions, diagnosing tumors, and removing gallstones from the bile ducts and/or pancreas, when necessary. During the first stage of the procedure, the "excluded" stomach was accessed utilizing a needle. A wire was advanced, and a lumen-apposing metal stent was placed between the excluded stomach and gastric pouch. The LAMS was then dilated.

### Risks and use of ERCP during the diagnostic workup in a national cohort of biliary cancer [^6cd26b40]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Date of diagnosis was defined as the earliest date of either radiology or pathology, as defined in the registries. We included biliary endoscopies undertaken 60 days before date of diagnosis until date of curatively aiming treatment, or for palliative patients, up to 90 days after diagnosis (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Biliary cancer cohort diagnosed between 2010 and 2020. Excluded patients in grey boxes

However, for descriptive purposes, endoscopic interventions prior to, and after, the selected time period were noted.

Complications (within 30 days) were investigated in relation to the first endoscopy. All ERCPs, even if only an attempt with unsuccessful cannulation were included.

Complications include intra- or postprocedural complications like bleeding (requiring blood transfusion or reintervention) and perforation (contrast leakage or intestinal perforation), pancreatitis and cholangitis. Cholangitis (biliary infection requiring hospitalization/biliary sepsis) and post-ERCP-pancreatitis (PEP) (abdominal pain > 24h and S-amylase > × 3), are registered only if they require hospitalization. All complications that were reported only as a written comment, were scrutinized and in applicable cases re-sorted into already existing categories. Complications such as prolonged hospital stay without any clear cause or urinary tract infections are not included in this report.

Neither persistent jaundice nor stent dysfunction were studied, and hence not defined as a complication in this study. We did not register the need of a new endoscopy as a complication, nor did we have access to any bilirubin levels. Sedation-related complications were not considered.

### Patient-related risk factors for postoperative infection after cholecystectomy [^e6ec183b]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and method

The study population was obtained from the GallRiks. GallRiks is a Swedish national quality register for gallstone surgery and ERCP, which began in May 2005. Since then, it has gradually reached a national coverage above 85%. It is continuously validated, showing high accuracy and completeness of data. By the end of 2014, more than 90,000 cholecystectomies had been registered in the GallRiks. The patient records of all patients registered in the GallRiks are reviewed 30 days postoperatively by a local coordinator in order to detect and register all postoperative complications. In any case where deviation from the expected course is noted, the coordinator either registers this as a complication or confers with the local surgeon responsible as to its nature.

Variables registered include indication for surgery (uncomplicated gallstone disease or complications secondary to gallstone disease such as cholecystitis, pancreatitis or obstructive jaundice due to common bile duct stone). Patients with uncomplicated gallstone disease are predominantly operated electively, whereas those with complications often undergo acute surgery.

The Swedish National Inpatient Register (IPR) is a part of the National Patient Register (NPR). It has had national coverage since 1987. All diagnoses are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases code (ICD code). In the NPR, 99% of all discharges are registered, including ICD codes for all relevant diagnoses. In a validation study, the correctness of the entries was found to be 85–95%.

All diagnoses in the postoperative course were retrieved from GallRiks as well as NPR based on ICD code registered by physician responsible for the discharge. SSI was defined as infection necessitating antibiotic treatment or percutaneous drainage in GallRiks, and/or ICD code T81.4 from NPR. Septicaemia was defined as cholangitis in Gallriks and/or cholangitis (ICD code K83.0) and sepsis (ICD code A40 and A41) in NPR. We preferred the term septicaemia since the criteria included positive blood culture, not necessarily including a systemic inflammatory response to the septicaemia.

### Acute pancreatitis in patients with a history of bariatric surgery: is It less severe? [^a0b7abd2]. Obesity Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bariatric surgery (BSx) leads to weight loss and causes alterations in gastrointestinal and pancreatic peptides. This raises questions on acute pancreatitis (AP) occurrence and outcomes in this cohort of patients. We aim to assess mortality, morbidity, and resource utilization of AP in patients with BSx.

Methods

Observational retrospective cohort study (2012–2016) with propensity score match. Patients with a principal diagnostic ICD9-10CM code for AP were included. Stratification for the coexistence of history of BSx was performed. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes were morbidity, resource utilization, length of hospital stay (LOS), total hospital charges, and costs.

Results

Out of 920,615 AP patients, 15,345 had undergone BSx. After propensity matching, 8220 patients with BSx had AP. The mortality for AP was 0.42 (p < 0.01) and for biliary AP 0.29 (< 0.04) in the history of BSx group compared to patients without BSx history. Acute kidney insufficiency (AKI), shock, ICU, multiorgan failure, ERCP, costs, charges, and LOS were all lower for patients with AP who had history of BSx. Patients with biliary AP showed even lower odds of AKI, ICU, multiorgan failure, costs, charges, and LOS, but higher odds of cholecystectomy.

Conclusion

Patients with AP with history of BSx have lower mortality, morbidity, and resource utilization. This may be due to post-surgical alterations in pancreatic and gastrointestinal functions including hormonal and anatomical changes. Interestingly, patients with biliary AP and BSx had even lower odds of mortality and morbidity than patients with non-biliary AP, suggesting an added benefit with milder disease course.

### Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography-related adverse events: general overview [^5a86de5c]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) represents a monumental advance in the management of patients with pancreaticobiliary diseases, but is a complex and technically demanding procedure with the highest inherent risk of adverse events of all routine endoscopic procedures. Overall adverse event rates for ERCP are typically reported as 5–10%. The most commonly reported adverse events include post-ERCP pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation, infection (cholangitis), and cardiopulomary or "sedation related" events. This article evaluates patient-related and procedure-related risk factors for ERCP-related adverse events, and discusses strategies for the prevention, diagnosis and management of these events.

### Technical outcomes and complications of pediatric ERCP [^439f9e3c]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Previous reports have suggested that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in pediatric patients is safe, but because the total number of cases reported in the literature remains small, questions remain regarding safety and outcomes of this procedure in children.

Methods

Pediatric patients who underwent ERCP were identified from diagnostic to billing codes. Medical records were examined for age, gender, diagnosis codes, indication, type of sedation, findings, interventions, and complications. Descriptive statistics were prepared for data including frequencies, percentages for categorical variables, and means and standard deviations for quantitative variables. Extensions of logistic regression were used to examine the relationship between demographic and clinical characteristics and post-ERCP pancreatitis.

Results

Four hundred and twenty-five ERCPs were performed on 276 pediatric patients. Patient's age ranged from 72 days to 18 years, and there was equal gender distribution. Targeted duct cannulation was achieved in over 95% of cases, and therapeutic interventions were common (81.3%). The most common indications were biliary obstruction (43.3%) and chronic pancreatitis (26.8%). The most common complication was post-ERCP pancreatitis which occurred in 26 cases (7.7%), and the majority was mild by consensus definition. Procedural characteristics significantly associated with post-ERCP pancreatitis included: pancreatogram, pancreatic sphincterotomy, pancreatic duct stenting, and pancreatic duct stricture dilation. Immediate post-sphincterotomy bleeding occurred twice (1.1%), and both cases were successfully treated during the procedure. There was one instance of a possible delayed sphincterotomy bleed. No mortality was observed.

Conclusions

This retrospective review is one of the larger ERCP series reported in the pediatric population and adds to the growing body of literature supporting that ERCP can be safely applied in younger patients by skilled endoscopists. The complication rate found in this series closely parallels that observed in adults. Prospective studies of pediatric ERCP are still required to more definitively define the safe and appropriate use of this procedure in children.

Adverse events associated with ERCP guideline scope and grading — Recommendations were graded by using the GRADE criteria, and the strength of individual recommendations is based on aggregate evidence quality and an assessment of anticipated benefits and harms; weaker recommendations are indicated by phrases such as 'we suggest' whereas stronger recommendations are typically stated as 'we recommend'. This guideline is intended to be an educational device and is not a rule; clinical considerations may lead an endoscopist to take a course of action that varies from these guidelines.

### Accuracy of surgical complication rate estimation using ICD-10 codes [^1ebcc94e]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Consistent knowledge of surgical complications may inform and could influence healthcare policies and facilitate future safety targets. The aim of the present study was to investigate the accuracy of using ICD‐10‐coded surgical complications compared with the GTT as a reference standard, by conducting a concurrent validation study of ICD‐10‐coded complications. The ICD‐10 classification system and the GTT method were chosen as they are well established nationally and globally. The hypothesis was that ICD‐10 codes identifying complications, as currently used, overestimate actual procedure‐related complications, especially as those present on admission are not distinguished from complications that arise during the hospital stay.

### Risks of digestive diseases in long COVID: evidence from a population-based cohort study [^d5c9b484]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our study contributes to the growing body of evidence on the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the digestive system. Specifically, there are continuing risks of GI dysfunction and GERD requiring long-term follow-up and further attention. Our findings highlight the need for long-term care and management of COVID-19 patients to monitor potential post-acute complications of the digestive system. Meanwhile, comprehensive awareness of the varying risks of digestive outcomes in COVID-19 patients over time is significant to develop appropriate follow-up strategies.

3 Results

3.1 Validation

Between April 2013 and March 2015, 465 patients had an ERCP recorded at Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS trust compared to 462 (99.4%) found within HES. 38 patients underwent their first malignant ERCP but did not progress to curative surgery. When sought in HES by the same criteria 41 (92.7%) patients were found. This suggests a high degree of accuracy in the HES data.

3.2 Demographics

515,532 patients underwent their first ERCP between April 2006 and March 2017. Of those 49,487 patients had a cancer diagnosis within 2 years before or 6 months after index ERCP. 8930 were excluded having undergone a potentially curative operation following ERCP. 39,702 patients were included in the final analysis following all exclusions, as described in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Study flow chart.

The median age of included patients was 75 (IQR 66–88) years. Males constituted 49.4% and the majority ethnicity was "White", including 84.5% of patients. The majority of patients did not have any co-morbidities recorded (59.0%). The commonest primary cancer was pancreatic, seen in 63.9% of patients. Full demographic details are reported in Table 1. Provider volume tertile boundaries were found to be < 204 in the lower tertile, 204–318 in the middle tertile and > 318 in the upper tertile. Detailed demographics of each provider volume tertile can be found in Appendix 10.

Table 1
Study patient demographics.

3.3 Complications

Following ERCP, the 30 day emergency re-admission rate was 24.9%. Renal failure within 30 days was coded in 3.3%, cholangitis in 3.7% and pancreatitis in 0.6%. Full details of complications are described in Appendix 7. Coded complication and emergency readmission rate did not vary by ERCP volume tertile (data not shown).

### Nationwide epidemiological study of severe gallstone disease in Taiwan [^a501b5c6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Selection of cases

Severe gallstone disease was defined as gallstone-related complications (acute cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, and acute cholangitis) that lead to hospitalization, as well as symptomatic disease requiring surgical or endoscopic procedures, which included elective and non-elective cholecystectomy (depending on whether patients had acute cholecystitis preoperatively) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Asymptomatic disease, disease of lesser severity that did not result in hospitalization, and biliary colic not requiring surgical or endoscopic treatment was not studied. The Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database during the period 1996–2005 was searched to identify potential cases from the populations at risk (i.e. hospitalized patients with a principal discharge diagnosis of cholelithiasis [The International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, ICD-9-CM code 574] and patients admitted due to gallstone-related complications and procedures; Table 1). To reduce the likelihood of misdiagnoses, we excluded anyone diagnosed as having primary or secondary liver cancer (155), cancer of the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts (156), pancreatic cancer (157), gastric cancer (151), malignant neoplasm of other sites (140–150, 152–154, 158–199), and hematological malignancy (200–208). Those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or human immunodeficiency virus infection (V08, 042), and those with unavailable or incorrect age and gender information were also excluded. The incidence of biliary pancreatitis was calculated after excluding cases possibly caused by alcohol use (ICD-9-CM codes for abuse or intoxication 303.0 and 303.9).

Table 1
Definition of gallstone-related complications and procedures based on the ICD-9-CM codes

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography

A study patient could have one or more hospitalizations during the study period. An incident event was counted if the patient had no related hospital discharge diagnoses in the claims database prior to admission. We excluded data in 1996 because events occurred in that year that could not be correctly counted as incident or prevalent events.

Data collection

The data included the patient's age, gender, hospitalization year, and comorbidities (i.e. diabetes mellitus [ICD-9-CM code 250], hyperlipidemia [272.0–272.4], chronic liver diseases [571], alcoholism [303.0, 303.9], and hereditary or acquired hemolytic anemia [282, 283]).

### Does obesity confer an increased risk and / or more severe course of post-ERCP pancreatitis? a retrospective, multicenter study [^2d28b8d9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Pancreatitis is the most common major complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Recent studies have suggested that obesity may serve as a prognostic indicator of poor outcome in non-ERCP-induced acute pancreatitis. However, to our knowledge, no one has ever investigated the potential association of obesity and ERCP-induced pancreatitis. Thus, the purpose of our study was to determine whether obesity conferred an increased risk and/or more severe course of post-ERCP pancreatitis.

Methods

A 160 variable database was prospectively collected by a defined protocol on patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic ERCP at 15 centers in the Midwest Pancreaticobiliary Group and participating in a randomized controlled study, evaluating whether prophylactic corticosteroids reduces the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Body mass indices (BMIs) were available on 964 of the 1115 patients from the original study. A BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 was defined as obese (World Health Organization) and used as a cutoff point in this study. BMIs were analyzed in a retrospective fashion to determine whether obesity confers an increased risk and/or more severe course of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Data were collected before the ERCP, at the time of procedure, and 24 to 72 hours after discharge. Standardized criteria were used to diagnose and grade the severity of postprocedure pancreatitis.

Results

Nine hundred sixty four patients were enrolled in the study. Pancreatitis occurred in 149 patients (15.5%) and was graded as mild in 101 (67.8%), moderate in 42 (28.2%), and severe in 6 (4.0%). The patients were categorized by BMI (kg/m2) using the following breakdowns: BMI < 20, 20 to < 25, 25 to < 30, and ≥ 30, as well as BMI < 30 or ≥ 30. The groups were similar with respect to the patient and procedure risk factors for post-ERCP pancreatitis except the group with BMI ≥ 30 had a higher frequency of females, were younger, had less frequent chronic pancreatitis, a lower number of pancreatic duct injections, and fewer patients received more than 2 pancreatic duct injections. Of the patients with a BMI < 30, 119 (16.4%) developed post-ERCP pancreatitis compared with 30 (12.5%) of those with a BMI ≥ 30 (P = 0.14). There was no association between the presence of obesity and the severity of pancreatitis (P = 0.74). Patients with a BMI < 20, 20 to < 25, 25 to < 30, and ≥ 30 had a similar incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis.

Conclusions

Obesity did not seem to confer an increased risk for ERCP-induced pancreatitis. A statistically significant association between obesity and the severity of ERCP-induced pancreatitis was not apparent.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^0b5b02bc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis — post-ERCP pancreatitis prevention: In appropriate ERCP patients, the use of a pancreatic duct stent has been shown to decrease the risk of severe post-ERCP pancreatitis, but pancreatic duct stenting is not always technically feasible, with a reported failure rate ranging from 4% to 10%. A single dose of 100 mg rectal indomethacin is supported, and rectal indomethacin and periprocedural hydration should be used in all patients before ERCP. Regimens studied include lactated Ringer solution at 3 mL/kg/hr during the ERCP, a 20 mL/kg bolus after the procedure, followed by an 8-hour infusion at 3 mL/kg/hr. Despite benefits, use remains limited; in a large study of more than 30,000 patients, only one-third received this prophylaxis. For high-risk patients, a multicenter trial conducted at 20 centers with 1950 patients found patients were less likely to have PEP when provided both rectal indomethacin and a pancreatic duct stent; prophylactic pancreatic duct stent placement is generally recommended in addition to rectal indomethacin in select patients at high risk for PEP, and a case by case approach is needed.

### Predictors of complications after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: a prognostic model for early discharge [^2f5b9458]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

In the multivariable analysis for post-ERCP cholangitis, significant risk factors were self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) placement (OR 3.9, CI 1.0–15.7) and sphincterotomy (OR 2.8, CI: 1.2–6.4). Pooled ORs from the systematic review resulted in four statistically significant risk factors for post-ERCP cholangitis, i.e. jaundice at presentation (OR 4.8, CI 1.6–14.3), a small-volume center (OR 4.7, CI 1.9–11.7), plastic stent placement (OR 3.1, CI 1.8–5.2), and female gender (OR 2.8, CI 1.2–6.6).

Prospective patient population

A total of 1,478 ERCPs were performed between April 2007 and April 2009, of which 951 ERCPs were performed in patients referred from another hospital and therefore were excluded. In total, we included 274 ERCPs (253 ERCPs were performed in patients who refused to participate in follow-up), which were performed in 220 patients (59% male, mean age = 60 ± 14 years), in the prospective study (Table 5). In 10% of the ERCP procedures (27/274), post-ERCP complications developed during a 30 day follow-up, i.e. 14 episodes of pancreatitis (5%), 12 of cholangitis (5%), and 1 hemorrhage (0.1%). Pancreatitis severity was mild after three, moderate after eight, and severe after three ERCPs. Cholangitis severity was mild after three and moderate after nine ERCPs. The case of hemorrhage was graded as mild. None of the patients had more than one complication.

Time to complication

Post-ERCP complications, i.e. pancreatitis and cholangitis, occurred after a mean time of 4.1 h after ERCP, subdivided in 4.2 h for pancreatitis and 4.1 h for cholangitis. Overall, 90% (23/26) of complications were detected within 6 h after treatment. Complications occurring more than 6 h after ERCP were cholangitis in 2 (after 7 and 16 h) and pancreatitis in 1 (after 17 h) (Fig. 1).

### Risk factors for therapeutic ERCP-related complications: an analysis of 2, 715 cases performed by a single endoscopist [^da8b9354]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Definitions

Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) was defined according to the revised Milwaukee SOD classification system. Biliary manometry was not performed. Cannulation was considered difficult if more than 10 min were needed to achieve deep CBD cannulation using the sphincterotome with or without the hydrophilic guide wire.

The definition of complications and the grading of their severity were based on consensus criteria. PEP was diagnosed when new-onset or increased abdominal pain lasting more than 24 h caused an unplanned admission of an outpatient for more than one night or prolonged hospitalization of an inpatient and was associated with an at least 3-fold increase in serum amylase at approximately 6 or 24 h post-procedure. Specifically, PEP was graded as follows: 1) mild symptoms lasting 3 days and mildly edematous appearance of the pancreas at computed tomography (CT) scan; 2) moderate, requiring specific therapeutic measures for 4–10 days post-procedure (Balthazar's grade B/C on CT) and 3) severe local or systemic complications lasting longer than 10 days post-treatment (Balthazar's grade D/E or death. CT findings that included presence of either tissue necrosis involving > 30% of the pancreatic gland or peripancreatic fluid collection were also used to classify pancreatitis as severe.

Procedure-related hemorrhage was defined as intra-procedural when bleeding occurred during the procedure; immediate and delayed when the bleeding was observed in the first 24 h and within 15 days, respectively.

Cholangitis was defined as an elevation in the temperature to more than 38 o C because of a biliary cause without evidence of other concomitant infections.

Follow up

After the procedure, all patients were monitored in the ward with frequent, close and direct contact with the endoscopist who performed the ERCP to decide whether the patient could be discharged. All patients and their escorts were given detailed standardized written information about possible post-procedure complications and family doctors and local hospitals were also informed about the intervention. All were instructed to contact the on-call ERCP staff immediately, should any of the symptoms described arise. Finally, we suggested that the discharged patients should fast (except for water) until the following morning, at which time a clear liquid breakfast could be ingested and followed, if tolerated, by a regular diet. In addition, patients were followed-up in an outpatient clinic or by telephone call on days 1, 10 and 30, post-ERCP to detect any delayed complications.

### Timing of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in acute biliary pancreatitis without cholangitis: a nationwide inpatient cohort study [^6a15620b]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Definition of variables

The NIS carries demographic variables that include age, sex, race, household income per patient zip-code, patient's insurance, and hospital-related variables, such as number of beds, region, teaching status and urban/rural location of the hospital, as well as outcome variables, such as length of stay, hospitalization charges, hospitalization costs, and in-hospital mortality. The patient's comorbidities were measured using the Deyo adaptation of the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) for administrative data. Hospitalization charges were calculated, after being adjusted for annual inflation specific to healthcare (Bureau of Labor Statistics: http:// data.bls.gov/), with the reference year 2020. Intensive Care Unit admissions were defined as patients requiring a ventilator, or medications for blood pressure support at admission. Therapeutic ERCP was defined by dilation of the duct, sphincterotomy or insertion of a stent. Other cases were classified as diagnostic ERCP. The ICD-9-CM codes used in this study have been previously validated for acute pancreatitis, ERCP including therapeutic and diagnostic, cholangitis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic/biliary malignancy, and complications after procedures. All the ICD-9-CM codes used in the study are given in the.

Unique hospital identifiers were used to generate a variable specifying the number of ERCP procedures performed at each hospital per year. Hospitals were subsequently classified according to ERCP procedure volumes per year, as low volume (≤ 100), intermediate volume (101–199), or high volume (≥ 200). Such a scheme has been used in a prior study to examine hospitals by ERCP volume.

The database offers variables to correlate the day after admission to each procedure performed during hospitalization. To distinguish urgent from early ERCP, the procedure was classified as urgent if it was performed on the day of admission or the first subsequent day, representing the first 24 h after admission. Similarly, the procedure was classified as early if it was performed on one of the following 2 days, representing 24–72 h after admission. This methodology has been previously used within the NIS database.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the mortality, length of stay, hospital charges/costs, and procedural complications in the urgent and early ERCP subgroups. The secondary outcomes were the predictors of urgent ERCP, based on patient demographics and hospital characteristics, and on national temporal trends of ERCP use in acute biliary pancreatitis from 2005–2014.

### Outcomes associated with the use of a new powered circular stapler for left-sided colorectal reconstructions: a propensity score matching-adjusted indirect comparison with manual circular staplers [^4b126184]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Though striking, the relative incidence of these complications must be interpreted in the context of the MAIC approach and use of different methods of complication ascertainment between the ECP trial cohort and historical cohort. Specifically, whereas complications were prospectively identified through case report forms in the ECP trial, they were retrospectively identified through ICD-10-CM/PCS coding in the historical cohort (see Supplemental Appendix 1). The impact of differing methods of ascertainment was likely ambiguous: within the historical cohort, only those complications that are deemed severe enough to warrant coding are likely to be documented in a medical record, and thus identification of surgical complications via ICD codes may associated with high positive predictive value, but low sensitivity; in contrast, active concerted prospective ascertainment of complications may have led to greater sensitivity. Use of ICD-10-CM/PCS coding may also result in false positives; however, to reduce the risk of false positives we required that all complication diagnoses not be designated as 'present on admission', which is an administrative designation made within hospital records to delineate those conditions that were pre-existing upon admission vs. those that developed during the admission. Nevertheless, some code descriptions, such as those associated with anastomotic leak, are non-specific. Similarly, the ICD-10-PCS codes for bleeding are relatively nonspecific. Circular staplers are most likely to affect anastomotic bleeding. In the historical cohort, the most frequently-observed ICD-10-CM codes related to bleeding were "Postprocedural hemorrhage of a digestive system organ or structure following a digestive system procedure" and "Melena". Notably, anastomotic bleeding would indeed be coded to "Postprocedural hemorrhage of a digestive system organ or structure following a digestive system procedure" and melena is a common way in which anastomotic bleeding may present. As data on ECP begin to accrue in real-world databases such as the PHD, future analyses directly and concurrently comparing ECP with manual circular staplers using the same measurement mechanisms will be possible.

### Does prophylactic pancreatic stent placement reduce the risk of post-ERCP acute pancreatitis? A meta-analysis of controlled trials [^cfb143ef]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Impaired drainage of the pancreatic duct is one of the possible triggers for post-ERCP acute pancreatitis. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether temporary stent placement across the main pancreatic-duct orifice lowers the frequency of post-ERCP acute pancreatitis in patients at high risk for this complication.

Methods

Two reviewers systematically identified prospective studies that (1) compared the risk of post-ERCP acute pancreatitis in patients with pancreatic stent placement vs. no stent placement and (2) included patients at high risk of developing this complication. Studies were assessed for methodologic quality and variations in execution and design. Frequency and severity of post-ERCP acute pancreatitis were the primary outcomes evaluated.

Results

Five trials involving 481 patients were selected. Of the 481, 55 (11.4%) patients developed pancreatitis after ERCP. Patients in the no stent group had 3-fold higher odds of developing pancreatitis compared with the stent group (15.5% vs. 5.8%; OR 3.2: 95% CI[1.6, 6.4]). Number needed to treat analysis showed that one in every 10 patients (95% CI[6,18]) could be expected to benefit from pancreatic-duct stent placement.

Conclusions

Prophylactic temporary stent placement across the main pancreatic-duct orifice reduces the risk of post-ERCP acute pancreatitis in patients at risk for developing this complication.

### Accuracy of surgical complication rate estimation using ICD-10 codes [^3ed8d1a6]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Validating complications by ICD‐10 versus Global Trigger Tool

To investigate concurrent validity, it was determined whether admissions with ICD‐10 complications were the same admissions as those identified as having one or more complications by the GTT methodology. The similarity between the two classification methods increased from 68·3 per cent before clinical verification of the ICD‐10 complication codes to 83·3 per cent after excluding ICD‐10 codes representing complications already present on admission (Fig. 1).

Figure 1
Agreement between methods of identifying admissions with complications versus no complications: a using ICD‐10 codes extracted from administrative data and b using ICD‐10 codes verified from patients' records. GTT, Global Trigger Tool

Logistic regression was used to quantify the importance of clinically verifying ICD‐10 complication codes rather than using them without verification. Admissions with unverified ICD‐10 codes (332) were at increased odds of also having a GTT‐identified complication (OR 5·85, 95 per cent confidence interval 4·06 to 8·44), whereas admissions with verified ICD‐10 codes (141) increased the odds substantially (OR 25·38, 15·41 to 41·79). Ninety‐four admissions with complications according to GTT methodology did not have an ICD‐10 code reflecting a complication (Fig. 1).

### Risk factors for complications after ERCP: a multivariate analysis of 11, 497 procedures over 12 years [^7c479e73]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Complications of ERCP are an important concern. We sought to determine predictors of post-ERCP complications at our institution.

Methods

GI TRAC is a comprehensive data set of patients who underwent ERCP at our institution from 1994 through 2006. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate 4 categories of complications: (1) overall complications, (2) pancreatitis, (3) bleeding, and (4) severe or fatal complications. Independent predictors of complications were determined with multivariable logistic regression.

Results

A total of 11,497 ERCP procedures were analyzed. There were 462 complications (4.0%), 42 of which were severe (0.36%) and 7 were fatal (0.06%). Specific complications of pancreatitis (2.6%) and bleeding (0.3%) were identified. Overall complications were statistically more likely among individuals with suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) (odds ratio [OR] 1.91) and after a biliary sphincterotomy (OR 1.32). Subjects with a history of acute or chronic pancreatitis (OR 0.78) or who received a temporary small-caliber pancreatic stent (OR 0.69) had fewer complications. Post-ERCP pancreatitis was more likely to occur after a pancreatogram via the major papilla (OR 1.70) or minor papilla (OR 1.54) and among subjects with suspected SOD with stent placement (OR 1.45) or without stent placement (OR 1.84). Individuals undergoing biliary-stent exchange had less-frequent pancreatitis (OR 0.38). Biliary sphincterotomy was associated with bleeding (OR 4.71). Severe or fatal complications were associated with severe (OR 2.38) and incapacitating (OR 7.65) systemic disease, obesity (OR 5.18), known or suspected bile-duct stones (OR 4.08), pancreatic manometry (OR 3.57), and complex (grade 3) procedures (OR 2.86).

Conclusions

This study characterizes a large series of ERCP procedures from a single institution and outlines the incidence and predictors of complications.

### Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with liver cirrhosis: analysis of trends and outcomes from the national inpatient sample database [^a4afd46b]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Goals:

We aimed to assess outcomes of patients with liver cirrhosis who underwent therapeutic or diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to determine whether these patients had different outcomes relative to patients without cirrhosis.

Background:

ERCP is an important procedure for treatment of biliary and pancreatic disease. However, ERCP is relatively technically difficult to perform when compared with procedures such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy. Little is known about how ERCP use affects patients with liver cirrhosis.

Study:

Using patient records from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, we identified adult patients who underwent ERCP between 2009 and 2014 using International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision coding and stratified data into 2 groups: patients with liver cirrhosis and those without liver cirrhosis. We compared baseline characteristics and multiple outcomes between groups and compared outcomes of diagnostic versus therapeutic ERCP in patients with cirrhosis. A multivariate regression model was used to estimate the association of cirrhosis with ERCP outcomes.

Results:

A total of 1,038,258 hospitalizations of patients who underwent ERCP between 2009 and 2014 were identified, of which 31,294 had cirrhosis and 994,681 did not have cirrhosis. Of the patients with cirrhosis, 21,835 (69.8%) received therapeutic ERCP and 9459 (30.2%) received diagnostic ERCP. Patients with cirrhosis had more ERCP-associated hemorrhages (2.5% vs. 1.2%; P < 0.0001) compared with noncirrhosis patients but had lower incidence of perforations (0.1% vs. 0.2%; P < 0.0001) and post-ERCP pancreatitis (8.6% vs. 7%; P < 0.0001). Cholecystitis was the same between groups (2.3% vs. 2.3%; P < 0.0001). In patients with cirrhosis, those who received therapeutic ERCP had higher post-ERCP pancreatitis (7.9% vs. 5.1%; P < 0.0001) and ERCP-associated hemorrhage (2.7% vs. 2.1%; P < 0.0001) but lower incidences of perforation and cholecystitis (0.1% vs. 0.3%; P < 0.0001) and cholecystitis (1.9 vs. 3.1%; P < 0.0001) compared with those who received diagnostic ERCP.

Conclusions:

Use of therapeutic ERCP in patients with liver cirrhosis may lead to higher risk of complications such as pancreatitis and postprocedure hemorrhage, whereas diagnostic ERCP may increase the risk of pancreatitis and cholecystitis in patients with cirrhosis. Comorbidities in cirrhosis patients may increase the risk of post-ERCP complications and mortality; therefore, use of ERCP in cirrhosis patients should be carefully considered, and further studies on this patient population are needed.

### Complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: avoidance and management [^ec665eed]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is now almost exclusively a therapeutic modality for pancreatic as well as biliary disorders. ERCP alone or with associated pancreatic and biliary therapy can cause a spectrum of mild and severe complications, including pancreatitis, hemorrhage, perforation, and cardiopulmonary events. Understanding of complications of ERCP has progressed substantially in the past decade, including widespread adoption of standardized consensus-based definitions of complications, large multicenter multivariate studies that have permitted clearer understanding of patient and technique-related risk factors for complications, and introduction of new technical approaches to minimize risks of ERCP.

### Safety and indications for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in liver transplant patients: an analysis of the United States' national inpatient sample database [^cc4fcbf8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is performed to treat biliary complications after a liver transplantation; however, the previously available literature on the safety of ERCP in liver transplant patients is limited. We aimed to study the safety of ERCP in liver transplant patients.

Methods

We used a National Inpatient Sample database from 2016–2019 to identify patients who underwent ERCP and had a history of a liver transplantation, using the international classification of diseases, 10 th revision. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the odds of post-ERCP complications in liver transplant recipients.

Results

Liver transplant patients who underwent ERCP had a higher rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis and bleeding compared to the general adult population (11.39% vs. 9.19%, 0.83% vs. 0.53%, respectively). However, the adjusted odds of post-ERCP pancreatitis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86–1.49; P = 0.36) and bleeding (aOR 1.41, 95%CI 0.58–3.46; P = 0.45) were similar in both the liver transplant and no-transplant groups. There was no difference in the odds of post-ERCP cholangitis (aOR 1.26, 95%CI 0.80–2.01; P = 0.32), and sepsis (aOR 0.94, 95%CI 0.66–1.34; P = 0.76) between liver transplant and no transplant groups. Biliary stricture was the most common indication for ERCP in the liver transplant group, whereas choledocholithiasis was the main reason for ERCP in the general adult population.

Conclusions

ERCP is a safe procedure for treating biliary complications in liver transplant patients. The odds of post-ERCP complications (pancreatitis, bleeding, sepsis, cholangitis) in liver transplant patients are comparable to those in patients with no transplantation.

### Accuracy of surgical complication rate estimation using ICD-10 codes [^b2dc69fb]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The ICD-10 codes are used globally for comparison of diagnoses and complications, and are an important tool for the development of patient safety, healthcare policies and the health economy. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of verified complication rates in surgical admissions identified by ICD-10 codes and to validate these estimates against complications identified using the established Global Trigger Tool (GTT) methodology.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study of a sample of surgical admissions in two Norwegian hospitals. Complications were identified and classified by two expert GTT teams who reviewed patients' medical records. Three trained reviewers verified ICD-10 codes indicating a complication present on admission or emerging in hospital.

Results

A total of 700 admissions were drawn randomly from 12 966 procedures. Some 519 possible complications were identified in 332 of 700 admissions (47·4 per cent) from ICD-10 codes. Verification of the ICD-10 codes against information from patients' medical records confirmed 298 as in-hospital complications in 141 of 700 admissions (20·1 per cent). Using GTT methodology, 331 complications were found in 212 of 700 admissions (30·3 per cent). Agreement between the two methods reached 83·3 per cent after verification of ICD-10 codes. The odds ratio for identifying complications using the GTT increased from 5·85 (95 per cent c.i. 4·06 to 8·44) to 25·38 (15·41 to 41·79) when ICD-10 complication codes were verified against patients' medical records.

Conclusion

Verified ICD-10 codes strengthen the accuracy of complication rates. Use of non-verified complication codes from administrative systems significantly overestimates in-hospital surgical complication rates.

### Pancreaticoduodenectomy in trauma patients with grade IV-V duodenal or pancreatic injuries: a post hoc analysis of an EAST multicenter trial [^23997650]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This was a post hoc analysis of an observational retrospective multicenter study completed across 35 level 1 trauma centers in the USA, Canada, and Greece between January 2010 and December 2020. Patients 15 years of age and older with traumatic AAST grade IV–V duodenal injuries and/or grade IV–V pancreatic injuries requiring surgical intervention were included. Patients who died within 24 hours of presentation were excluded from analysis. Patients were identified through trauma registry data or International Classification Diagnosis (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 codes. Standardized data were collected by participating sites and entered into the Research Electronic Data Capture secure web-based program. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guideline was used to safeguard proper reporting.

PD was defined as resection of the duodenum and the head of the pancreas followed by enteric, biliary, and pancreatic exocrine reconstruction including gastrojejunostomy, hepaticojejunostomy, and pancreaticojejunostomy. Patients were included regardless of whether PD was performed as a single-stage or multi-stage procedure. Non-PD patients underwent PRA (which included extraluminal wide drainage), wide extraluminal drainage alone without repair, or CRAM (other than PD). CRAM was previously defined as any repair that included adjunctive measures such as pyloric exclusion with gastrojejunostomy, duodenectomy with enteric anastomosis, duodenal diverticulization, or any combination of those complex repairs. Ampullary injury was defined based on direct visualization in the operating room, intraoperative cholangiogram, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography findings. Leak from the duodenal injury site was defined as any dehiscence or drainage following surgery evidenced by CT scan, upper gastrointestinal (GI) fluoroscopy, MRI, endoscopy, operating room exploration, or clinically based on bilious extraluminal drain output. Outcomes included leak, complications, GI complications, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, ventilator days, and mortality. GI-specific complications were defined as intra-abdominal abscess, GI bleed, ulcer, ileus, abdominal compartment syndrome, enterocutaneous fistula, or anastomotic leak.

### Impact of comorbidities on hospital mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis: a population-based study of 110, 021 patients [^04abe57c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Other risk factors classically related to mortality in AP patients failed to represent a risk factor in our population. This was relevant to the role of AP etiology, in which the literature reports controversial results, identifying a more severe course and higher mortality in alcoholic pancreatitis. In contrast, others observed greater severity in biliary pancreatitis or no relation with mortality between both aetiologies. Our study did not observe that acute pancreatitis's biliary or alcoholic etiology was associated with higher hospital mortality. However, in our study, 44.3% of the patients were classified as "unspecified acute pancreatitis", limiting the precision of our results and constituting a bias regarding the real impact of etiology in AP mortality. In addition, our database does not include other etiologies of acute pancreatitis such as those caused by hypercalcemia, after trauma, viral infections, anatomical variants, iatrogenic after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or endoscopic ultrasound-guided interventions.

Our study is subject to some limitations. The data analysis from a clinical-administrative base has low level of granularity and does not include some clinical results of interest, such as severity or the evolution of the patient in the medium or long term after their hospital stay. Our study could not identify pancreatic necrosis in the first two years because it began to be considered in the ICD-10 in 2018. Another limitation is the potential underreporting of information because the hospital discharge report may be incomplete or poorly registered by the technical-administrative staff. In our study, we could not identify the etiology of AP in many patients due to a lack of precise coding.

No studies have been published to validate the use of ICD-10 codes for identifying patients with AP using the RAE-CMBD database. However, there are recent studies from Danish and US databases with PPV of 97.3% and 87%, respectively. A recent meta-analysis recommends using ICD codes only in incident cases of AP in adults, where it reaches a PPV of 78%. However, this may be because the studies analyzed used ICD-8, ICD-9, and ICD-10 codes, and the PPV is higher when using the ICD-10 because it is more specific and includes the etiology of pancreatitis. In addition, the studies were carried out in different hospitals in several countries, contributing to the heterogeneity.

### Adverse events associated with ERCP [^c52224ab]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholecystitis — post-ERCP cholecystitis is an uncommon adverse event that should be recognized early and not be mistaken for acute cholangitis; patients may present with fever, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and a positive Murphy's sign, and diagnosis should be confirmed by imaging findings. Pathogenesis is believed to be related to gallbladder contamination by nonsterile contrast material in the context of gallbladder dyskinesia or outflow (cystic duct) obstruction. In one study, newly diagnosed cholecystitis requiring emergency cholecystectomy occurred in 11 patients (0.5%), up to 16 days after ERCP; gallbladder stones were present in 10 of 11 patients, no other predictors were identified, and therefore it is believed that the presence of cholelithiasis increases the risk of post-ERCP cholecystitis.

### Predictors of complications after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: a prognostic model for early discharge [^26ba0a2f]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a commonly performed procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of biliary and pancreatic duct disorders. However, ERCP is associated with a relatively high complication rate. In published series, these rates vary between 0.8 and 45%, with pancreatitis occurring in 1–5%, cholangitis in 1–5%, retroperitoneal perforation in 1–2%, and hemorrhage in 1%.

Several retrospective and prospective trials have evaluated risk factors for post-ERCP complications. The relative contribution of risk factors to morbidity and mortality after ERCP, however, is unknown. Identification of these risk factors can, for example, be used to recognize patients at highest risk for post-ERCP complications, for whom preventive endoscopic or pharmacologic measures and postprocedural monitoring should be considered. Risk factors may also aid in distinguishing patients at lowest risk for complications as they are eligible for undergoing ERCP as an outpatient procedure. Early discharge can lead to a decrease in the burden of ERCP for patients and an overall cost reduction. So far, only Friedland et al. has presented a prognostic model that was able to predict the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis. However, this model did not consider other common ERCP complications such as cholangitis, hemorrhage, and perforation. In addition, current blood tests, such as amylase and lipase levels for pancreatitis, are inconsistent and do not aid sufficiently in clinical decision-making on whether patients can safely be discharged early after ERCP.

The objective of this study was to examine risk factors for post-ERCP complications, i.e. pancreatitis and cholangitis, that could aid clinicians in identifying high- and low-risk patient groups for post-ERCP complications. We compared the risk factors from a multivariable analysis in a retrospectively collected single-center patient population with those obtained from a literature review. In order to determine which patients could safely be discharged after ERCP, we developed a prognostic model for post-ERCP pancreatitis and cholangitis and evaluated this in a prospective patient population.

### Outcomes and risk factors for ERCP-related complications in a predominantly black urban population [^8a5a9455]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Results

Procedures

A total of 1079 ERCP procedures were performed and documented over 10 years. The demographics, indications and frequency of special interventions are outlined in table 1.

Overall complications

There was a total of 106 complications (9.8%). The incidence of all complications and their severity grades is listed in table 2. The multivariate analysis results for overall complications, pancreatitis, bleeding, fatal outcomes, cholangitis and perforation are shown in tables 3–8, respectively. Six factors were found to be independently associated with overall complications. Subjects who were of male gender (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.31), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade IV and V (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.51), had a prior history of PEP (OR 6.98, 95% CI 2.18 to 22.4) and had pancreatic duct stent placement (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.65 to 4.59) were at increased risk. Those who were ASA grade III or lower (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.64) or who underwent biliary stone extraction (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.94) were predicted to have significantly fewer complications. Of note, the overall complication rate did not reduce with time when comparing the first 5 years of data with the most recent 5 years (11.2% vs 8.7%, p = 0.17).

ERCP caused acute pancreatitis in 18 patients (1.7%). This was graded as mild in 10 patients, moderate in five patients and severe in two patients. There was one fatality (table 2). Initial univariate analysis revealed 17 potential predictors of pancreatitis. The only variable that remained an independently significant predictor of pancreatitis was having a prior history of PEP (OR 37.6, 95% CI 10.1 to 139.5). Having a suspected or known biliary duct stone predicted less frequent pancreatitis (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.82).

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades.

This study aims to update the 1991 Atlanta Classification of acute pancreatitis, to standardize the reporting of and terminology of the disease and its complications. Important features of this classification have incorporated new insights into the disease learned over the last 20 years, including the recognition that acute pancreatitis and its complications involve a dynamic process involving two phases, early and late. The accurate and consistent description of acute pancreatitis will help to improve the stratification and reporting of new methods of care of acute pancreatitis across different practices, geographic areas, and countries.

### Accuracy of surgical complication rate estimation using ICD-10 codes [^32d3ebf8]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The study also has strengths, including: bringing together two methods for assessing surgical safety; the overall high level of expertise among the reviewers; the inclusion of two separate hospitals; and the good reliability of the analyses. Regarding reliability, the inter‐rater reliability analysis is a methodological strength. The GTT teams showed good agreement for detection and severity of complications, and moderate agreement regarding the number of complications present. The two GTT teams had expert members from both hospitals (with knowledge of local reporting practices). The inter‐rater agreement among the ICD‐10 reviewers was even stronger. This is a prerequisite for studies reporting data that require clinical judgement and the seniority of the reviewers ensured this.

The accuracy of ICD‐10 complication codes is improved when in‐hospital complications are verified with record reviews. Crude data with unverified ICD‐10 codes significantly overestimate surgical complications within hospitals because complications present on admission are included. This can represent a severe bias for national and international comparisons of quality and safety of surgical care.

### Accuracy of surgical complication rate estimation using ICD-10 codes [^fe7fb936]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study found that complications during the hospital stay were overestimated when crude ICD‐10 codes were used in surgical admissions. By excluding codes representing conditions already present on admission, the complication rate decreased from 47·4 to 20·1 per cent. This provides quantifiable evidence of the detrimental impact of coding practices on the ability of ICD‐10 codes to indicate a true complication in patient care. Based on the present findings, it does not appear feasible to detect and disclose all complications and level of severity using a single method. A substantial decrease in complications was found with accurate ICD‐10‐verified complication codes compared with ICD‐10 codes present on admission. These findings support the hypothesis of the study. The GTT method is designed to inform about local complications and patient safety initiatives over longer periods of time 13, whereas the ICD‐10 (if used accurately) may be used both locally and in large epidemiological studies to inform on larger patient safety interventions.

The complication rate obtained using the GTT in the present study was 30·3 per cent of all admissions. This is at the upper end of the range reported in studies included in a recent systematic review 2. That review, however, included studies across both medical and surgical specialties. Focusing solely on surgical patient populations, as in the present study, would be expected to result in higher rates than in mixed patient populations 5. Regarding level of severity, the majority of complications identified by the GTT (93·9 per cent) were found to be associated with temporary harm. Similar findings regarding severity have been documented elsewhere 34, 35.

In the present study, the agreement between the ICD‐10 and GTT methods increased from 68·3 to 83·3 per cent following clinical researchers' verification of the ICD coding. Other studies 7, 15, 36 have investigated complications using different detection methods. The high rates of agreement here might be explained by avoidance of use of complications reported voluntarily by healthcare personnel as a comparator. There is evidence for under‐reporting of complications in voluntary reporting systems 12, which would likely lead to lower agreement between methods. The present analysis included a large number of complication codes (154 in total), which might have increased the number of complications identified, thus offering a broader perspective on surgical complication analyses. Moreover, a large number of clinically reviewed patient records were included, which is likely to have increased the number of complications found and analysed by this methodology compared with smaller studies 35.

Early post-ERCP imaging: indications, techniques, usual findings and reactive changes

Clinical features and indications for imaging

In the vast majority of cases, the clinical suspicion of early iatrogenic complications is based on a combination of intraprocedural findings (difficult or repeated cannulation, suspected or confirmed DP), symptoms and physical signs (sudden or worsening abdominal pain, distension, fever, haemodynamic impairment) and laboratory data (decreasing haemoglobin, elevated leukocyte count, acute phase reactants, serum lipase or amylase). The key role of CT imaging to investigate patients who become acutely ill hours or days after ERCP results from the limited value of physical examination (due to the retroperitoneal location of most iatrogenic changes) and the similar clinical and laboratory manifestations observed in most complications, particularly AP and DP.

Furthermore, ERCP duration may represent a surrogated marker for challenging cannulation and/or operative manoeuvres that can lead to papillary oedema and compromise ductal outflow, thus resulting in an increased risk and severity of complications, particularly PEAP. According to both the literature and personal experience, planned CT may be warranted in patients after prolonged ERCP procedures, particularly with sphincterotomy or multiple cannulations.

CT technique, usual post-procedural findings and reactive changes

A preliminary unenhanced CT acquisition without intravenous and peroral CM is helpful to visualise extraluminal air (particularly using image review at lung or bone window settings) and hyperattenuating (35–70 Hounsfield units, HU) fresh blood. Afterwards, following standard-dose intravenous CM injection we recommend a biphasic (arterial-dominant and venous) acquisition, particularly to identify pancreatic necrosis and CM extravasation indicating active bleeding. Additionally, in selected cases gastroduodenal opacification by means of peroral ingestion of diluted enteral CM may be beneficial to confirm or exclude leakage indicating DP (Fig. 1).

During endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a 65-year-old female with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction experienced duodenal perforation (DP), which was recognised intraprocedurally and treated with endoluminal clipping. Twenty-four hours later, unenhanced multidetector CT obtained after peroral ingestion of enteral contrast medium (CM) and viewed at the bone window setting showed a well-opacified gastroduodenal lumen without extraluminal CM leak, consistent with sealed DP. Note the persistent extensive retroperitoneal air (+) and metallic clips (arrowhead in B)

### Mortality and recurrence risk after a first episode of acute pancreatitis in the elderly: population-based study [^fde91b76]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study cohort comprised all patients aged at least 80 years diagnosed with acute pancreatitis in Sweden between 2007 and 2019. Data were retrieved from the Swedish Patient Register, searching for patients with discharge diagnoses including the ICD-10 code for acute pancreatitis (K85.N). The report has been structured according to STROBE guidelines. Where the same patient was admitted more than once, the first admission was considered the index episode. The cohort was cross-matched with the Swedish Register for Gallstone Surgery and ERCP (GallRiks), a nationwide register for quality assurance of gallstone surgery. Data on incidence were retrieved from Statistics Sweden. The Charlson Co-morbidity Index (CCI)score was determined from diagnoses assigned on admission, and outpatient visit before and on the first admission for acute pancreatitis.

The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) is defined as the ratio between the observed mortality within 30 days and the expected mortality determined from population data on mortality adjusted for age and sex. Expected mortality was determined from mortality rates in Sweden in 2012 (SCB Statistics Sweden). SMR was analysed according to date of admission with acute pancreatitis, date of cholecystectomy, and date of first ERCP undertaken, stratified by CCI score.

### Prospective validation and revision of predictive models for post-ERCP pancreatitis: focus on procedure-related factors and a novel risk stratification approach [^47cc3ff7]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis (PEP) is the most common serious adverse event after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Although retrospective models to predict PEP have shown promise, their real-world applicability remains uncertain. Thus, we used prospectively derived cohort data to validate current prediction models.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study involving patients who underwent ERCP between August 2020 and December 2023. We validated the original PEP-risk prediction models using prospective cohort data and, if necessary, refined them using logistic regression analysis.

Results

Among the 1112 study participants, the original PEP-risk prediction models had limited performance. Although PEP incidence tended to increase across risk groups, the differences were mostly insignificant. Logistic regression highlighted procedural factors-total procedure time [odds ratio (OR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–1.26 per 5 min], unintended pancreatic duct cannulation (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.11–5.93), and pancreatic opacification (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.19–5.58)-as independent PEP risk factors. This led to a revised model that assigned 1, 8, and 8 points to these factors. Patients stratified into low- (0–2 points), intermediate- (3–10 points), and high-risk groups (≥ 11 points) exhibited PEP incidences of 2.6% (95% CI 1.5–4.1%), 7.1% (95% CI 4.8–10.3%), and 12.6% (95% CI 8.6–17.8%), respectively.

Conclusions

We highlighted limitations of existing PEP-prediction models that necessitate refinement based on procedural variables. Our revised model accounted for the prolonged total procedure time, unintended pancreatic duct cannulation, and pancreatic opacification, offering enhanced accuracy in predicting PEP risk.

### The roles of endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the evaluation and treatment of chronic pancreatitis in children: a position paper from the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition pancreas committee [^ec10fd8b]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)–related risks in children include general and specific complications. ERCP "is limited by the risk for bleeding, perforation, infection, and pancreatitis". Reported post-procedure pain includes "post-ERCP pain (1.64%) in children with CP". Perforation risk is described as "Perforation can also occur at a rate of approximately 1% with retroperitoneal duodenal perforations from sphincterotomy most common". Mechanism-related injuries are detailed: "Perforation of the pancreatic duct can occur following dilation of a stricture, forceful cannulation, guidewire insertion, stent migration, or difficult stone extraction", and procedural caution is advised: "In smaller children, the shortening of the duodenoscope should be performed with care to avoid duodenal wall perforation".
