## Question

Does all hyperglycemia starting from 500 mg/dl require bicarbonate evaluation for correction? Or can I correct according to the HGT?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a glucose level of 500 mg/dL mandates bicarbonate therapy, and how to interpret "correct according to HGT" in this context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic framework for hyperglycemic crises and whether 500 mg/dL alone defines DKA or HHS. Then, I should verify current guideline positions on sodium bicarbonate in DKA and HHS. Next, I will examine the limited scenarios where bicarbonate might be considered and why it is generally avoided. After that, I need to clarify what "HGT" likely refers to and how to apply it clinically. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise management approach and answer the question directly with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic thresholds so I don't jump to conclusions based on a single number. A glucose of 500 mg/dL is severe hyperglycemia, but DKA requires hyperglycemia plus ketonemia and metabolic acidosis, whereas HHS typically requires glucose ≥ 600 mg/dL with hyperosmolality and minimal ketosis, so 500 mg/dL alone does not establish either syndrome without acid–base and ketone data [^114srPLa] [^112UAbax].

> Wait, let me verify the role of bicarbonate in DKA because I recall older practices that might mislead us. Contemporary ADA consensus and standards of care advise against routine bicarbonate in DKA; randomized and observational data show no improvement in time to resolution, insulin sensitivity, or outcomes, and bicarbonate increases risks such as hypokalemia and paradoxical CNS acidosis, so it is not indicated solely for a high glucose level [^1155FWi9] [^1163TwTf] [^115hbzur].

> Hold on, I should double-check whether any exception would apply at 500 mg/dL. The only narrow scenario where bicarbonate has been considered is profound acidemia with pH less than about 6.9–7.0, and even then the evidence is limited and mixed; some guidelines historically allowed cautious use in life-threatening acidosis, but modern reviews and society guidance discourage routine use and emphasize fluids, insulin, and electrolytes as definitive therapy [^112kJ47g] [^115qNaVZ].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating HHS with DKA here. In HHS, the pathophysiology is hyperosmolarity with minimal ketosis, and bicarbonate is not indicated; management focuses on slow, controlled fluid and osmolality correction, with insulin started once glucose stops falling with fluids, reinforcing that bicarbonate is not part of standard HHS care either [^113XSYQ9] [^113595XN].

> Let me consider what "HGT" likely means in this context. I should confirm that "HGT" refers to handheld glucose testing, i.e., point-of-care capillary glucose, and that "correct according to HGT" means titrating insulin and fluids to serial glucose measurements rather than giving bicarbonate; this aligns with guideline-based protocols that adjust dextrose infusion and insulin to maintain glucose around 150–200 mg/dL while continuing insulin until ketonemia and acidosis resolve, using frequent capillary checks to guide therapy [^113aX4rv] [^116vxCdp].

> Next, I should review the core treatment steps so the plan is clinically coherent. Immediate priorities are isotonic fluid resuscitation, low-dose continuous insulin, and careful potassium replacement guided by renal function and serial levels; dextrose is added once glucose falls below about 250 mg/dL so insulin can continue until anion gap closes, and the precipitating cause must be identified and treated in parallel [^112YtsdG] [^1135r4eb] [^1117ZCKL].

> But wait, what if the glucose is 500 mg/dL and the patient looks profoundly ill — could that change the bicarbonate calculus? Even in severe presentations, the decision to use bicarbonate should be driven by pH, bicarbonate, anion gap, and hemodynamics rather than the absolute glucose value; persistent, life-threatening acidemia with pH near or below 7.0 may prompt consideration of bicarbonate as a last resort, but this is rare and should not be extrapolated from glucose alone [^115qNaVZ] [^112kJ47g].

> I should confirm pediatric considerations because they are stricter. In children with DKA, bicarbonate is contraindicated due to cerebral edema risk and lack of benefit; management relies on fluids, insulin, and electrolytes with close neurologic monitoring, again underscoring that a glucose of 500 mg/dL does not, by itself, justify bicarbonate [^115hbzur] [^113u3pne].

> Let me reconsider the original question to ensure I'm precise. Does all hyperglycemia starting from 500 mg/dL require bicarbonate evaluation for correction? No — glucose level alone does not determine bicarbonate use; bicarbonate is not indicated for hyperglycemia without severe metabolic acidosis, and management should correct according to serial glucose measurements and acid–base/electrolyte parameters rather than giving bicarbonate reflexively [^1155FWi9] [^1163TwTf] [^113aX4rv].

> Final answer: No, a glucose of 500 mg/dL does not mandate bicarbonate therapy; bicarbonate is not indicated for hyperglycemia alone and should be avoided in DKA and HHS except in rare, extreme acidemia scenarios where benefits are unproven and harms are real, so management should focus on guideline-directed fluids, insulin, electrolytes, and glucose monitoring to guide correction [^1155FWi9] [^1163TwTf] [^113XSYQ9].

No, **bicarbonate is not routinely indicated** for hyperglycemia ≥ 500 mg/dL [^1163TwTf]. It is only considered if **pH < 6.9** with severe acidosis and hemodynamic instability or life-threatening arrhythmias, and even then, evidence is limited and risks (hypokalemia, paradoxical CNS acidosis, delayed ketone clearance) are significant [^112kJ47g]. Management should prioritize **fluids, insulin, and electrolytes** [^1117ZCKL]; bicarbonate should not be used based on glucose level alone [^1155FWi9].

## Indications for bicarbonate therapy in hyperglycemic emergencies

Current guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and other expert bodies **do not recommend routine bicarbonate therapy** for hyperglycemic emergencies, including DKA and HHS [^1155FWi9]. Bicarbonate therapy is **only considered in specific, rare scenarios**:

- **Severe acidosis**: Arterial pH < 6.9 with concurrent hemodynamic instability or life-threatening arrhythmias [^116LZ16B].
- **Cardiac arrest**: As part of Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocols, though evidence is limited [^112kJ47g].
- **Special populations**: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and persistent metabolic acidosis may benefit from bicarbonate supplementation, but this is unrelated to acute hyperglycemia management [^117BgKzZ].

---

## Risks associated with bicarbonate therapy

Bicarbonate therapy carries **significant risks**, particularly in hyperglycemic emergencies:

- **Hypokalemia**: Rapid correction of acidosis can cause intracellular potassium shifts, leading to severe hypokalemia [^116f3UJa].
- **Paradoxical CNS acidosis**: Bicarbonate administration can worsen intracellular acidosis in the brain, potentially contributing to cerebral edema [^115hbzur].
- **Delayed ketone clearance**: Bicarbonate may stimulate ketone production, prolonging metabolic derangement [^116f3UJa].
- **Fluid overload**: Sodium load from bicarbonate can exacerbate fluid overload, particularly in patients with cardiac or renal compromise [^114a31TH].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding bicarbonate therapy in hyperglycemic emergencies

Multiple studies and reviews have evaluated bicarbonate therapy in DKA and HHS, consistently finding **no significant clinical benefit** and potential harm:

- **No improvement in outcomes**: Bicarbonate therapy does not improve time to resolution of acidosis, insulin sensitivity, or overall clinical outcomes in DKA [^116f3UJa].
- **Increased risk of complications**: Bicarbonate use is associated with increased risk of hypokalemia, fluid overload, and delayed ketone clearance [^notfound].
- **Limited indications**: The only potential benefit is in patients with severe acidosis (pH < 6.9) and hemodynamic instability, and even then, evidence is limited [^116LZ16B].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **strongly advise against routine bicarbonate therapy** in hyperglycemic emergencies:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding bicarbonate therapy** |
|-|-|
| ADA 2024 | - Do not administer bicarbonate routinely in DKA or HHS [^notfound] <br/> - Only consider if pH < 6.9 with hemodynamic instability [^notfound] |
| JBDS 2023 | - Bicarbonate therapy is not recommended in HHS or mixed DKA/HHS [^notfound] |
| AACE 2022 | - Bicarbonate therapy is not recommended in hyperglycemic emergencies [^notfound] |

---

## Alternative management strategies for hyperglycemia ≥ 500 mg/dL

Effective management of severe hyperglycemia **centers on the following**:

- **Fluid resuscitation**: Isotonic saline or balanced crystalloids to correct dehydration and restore intravascular volume [^112YtsdG].
- **Insulin therapy**: Continuous intravenous insulin infusion to gradually reduce blood glucose and suppress ketone production [^1163TwTf].
- **Electrolyte replacement**: Potassium, phosphate, and magnesium replacement based on serum levels and clinical context [^116dywr1].
- **Identification and treatment of precipitating causes**: Address underlying infections, medication non-compliance, or other triggers [^11244uoH].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Bicarbonate therapy is **not indicated** for hyperglycemia ≥ 500 mg/dL alone. It should only be considered in rare cases of severe acidosis (pH < 6.9) with hemodynamic instability or life-threatening arrhythmias, and even then, the evidence is limited and the risks are significant. Routine management should focus on fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and electrolyte replacement, with close monitoring of acid-base status and clinical response [^1117ZCKL].

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^116dywr1]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis requires the patient's plasma glucose concentration to be above 250 mg per dL (although it usually is much higher), the pH level to be less than 7.30, and the bicarbonate level to be 18 mEq per L or less. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is a better measurement of the degree of ketosis than serum ketones. Intravenous insulin and fluid replacement are the mainstays of therapy, with careful monitoring of potassium levels. Phosphorous and magnesium also may need to be replaced. Bicarbonate therapy rarely is needed. Infection, insulin omission, and other problems that may have precipitated ketoacidosis should be treated. Myocardial infarction is a precipitating cause of diabetic ketoacidosis that is especially important to look for in older patients with diabetes. Cerebral edema is a major complication that occurs primarily in children. Education to prevent recurrence should be offered to all patients, including how to manage sick days and when to call a physician.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis: the paradox of delayed correction of acidosis [^112sJP4K]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The effectiveness of standard treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in "euglycemic DKA" (EuDKA, blood glucose (BG) ≤ 250 mg/dL) was evaluated with respect to the time to correction of BG ≤ 200 mg/dL, anion gap (AG) ≤ 12 mmol/L, and serum bicarbonate [HCO3] ≥ 18 mmol/L.

Methods

Data were retrieved from an electronic health record (EPIC) for "diabetic ketoacidosis". Patients were categorized by initial BG as EuDKA, middle range DKA (MrDKA, > 250 < 600 mg/dL) and hyperosmolar DKA (HyperDKA ≥ 600 mg/dL).

Results

There were 56 patients (27men, 29women; age 45.8 ± 15.6 (SD) years. The initial 8-h insulin infusion rate (0.05 ± 0.02, 0.09 ± 0.03, 0.14 ± 0.05units/kg/h, p < 0.001) and the time to correction of BG (3.4 ± 1.9, 6.1 ± 2.9 and 9.6 ± 3.9 h, p < 0.001), differed for EuDKA, MrDKA and HyperDKA. There were no differences in the time to correction of AG or [HCO3]. The earlier time to correction of BG in EuDKA resulted in paradoxical longer lag times for correction of [HCO3] (p = 0.003) and AG (p = 0.048). Changes in BG, AG and [HCO3] correlated with insulin infusion rates of 0.08–0.1units/kg/h whereas in EuDKA the insulin infusion rate was 0.05 ± 0.02 units/kg/h.

Conclusion

In EuDKA, correlation analyses suggest that higher glucose and insulin infusion rates than what would be projected for the level of blood glucose are required to reverse ketoacidosis. Prospective trials are required to optimize the levels of glucose and insulin infusions in EuDKA.

### Optimal glucose reduction in diabetic emergencies (OG-RIDE) [^11639CYv]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

To minimize the risk of cerebral edema in the management of hyperglycemic emergencies, guidelines recommend gradually decreasing serum glucose levels, but there is limited literature validating these reduction goals or evaluating outcomes associated with different correction rates.

Objective

This study evaluated cerebral edema rates associated with 2 different serum glucose correction rates in adults with hyperglycemic emergencies.

Methods

This retrospective study's primary endpoint was the incidence of cerebral edema. Secondary endpoints included average hourly changes in sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, anion gap, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and calculated osmolality, over the treatment course. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on their average hourly serum glucose correction rate (> 75 mg/dL and ≤ 75 mg/dL), and their outcomes were compared. Patients were included if they were ≥ 18 years old, received the institutions' diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state insulin infusion order set within 12 hours of presenting to the hospital, and had a pre-insulin infusion glucose > 600 mg/dL.

Results

One hundred thirty-four patients had a slow correction rate, and 51 had a rapid correction rate. The median time from starting the insulin infusion to achieving a glucose < 300 mg/dL in the slow and rapid correction rate groups was 9.9 and 6.1 hours, respectively (p < 0.001). In the total population, 2 (1.5%) cerebral edema events occurred. Both patients were in the slow correction rate group and had radiographic evidence of cerebral edema on post-return of spontaneous circulation imaging. There were significantly larger decreases in glucose and osmolality levels in the rapid correction rate group at several time points during treatment.

Conclusion and Relevance

Rapid serum glucose correction rates were not associated with increased cerebral edema events. Our findings suggest glucose and osmolality levels can be corrected faster than what is currently recommended.

Pediatric HHS — targets for glucose and sodium correction during fluid therapy emphasize gradual changes: With adequate rehydration, serum glucose concentrations should decline by 75 to 100 mg/dL/hr (4.1–5.5 mmol/L/h), and lack of appropriate decline in serum glucose should prompt reassessment and evaluation of renal function; although there are no data to indicate an optimal rate of decline in serum sodium, a rate of 0.5 mEq/L per hour has been recommended for hypernatremic dehydration; replacement of urinary losses is recommended, and 0.45% saline solution approximates the typical urine sodium concentration during osmotic diuresis.

### Hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes: a consensus report [^113aX4rv]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to modify replacement fluids once the plasma glucose concentration is < 250 mg/dL (< 13.9 mmol/L) to contain 5–10% dextrose in addition to the 0.9% sodium chloride to prevent hypoglycemia and allow continued insulin administration until the ketonemia is corrected, as plasma glucose concentrations usually decrease before the resolution of ketoacidosis (usually within 4–8 hours).

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^112MEhEp]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulting from an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. It can occur in patients of all ages and can be the initial presentation of diabetes, especially in young children. Polyuria and polydipsia are the most common symptoms, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, severe fatigue, dyspnea, and preceding febrile illness. Traditionally, DKA has been diagnosed by the triad of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L, anion gap greater than 10 mEq/L), and elevated serum (preferred) or urine ketones. However, hyperglycemia has been de-emphasized in recent guidelines because of the increasing incidence of euglycemic DKA. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors modestly increases the risk of DKA and euglycemic DKA. Electrolytes, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count with differential, A1C, and electrocardiography should be evaluated for all patients diagnosed with DKA to identify causes and complications of DKA. Amylase, lipase, hepatic transaminase levels, troponin, creatine kinase, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography are additional tests to consider. Treatment involves fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin, treatment of precipitating causes, and close monitoring to adjust therapy and identify complications. Prevention strategies include identifying diabetes before DKA develops, educating patients to manage high-risk situations, and ensuring uninterrupted access to therapies for diabetes.

### Children and adolescents: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112svsDJ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Children and adolescents — initial pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes: In individuals with incidentally diagnosed or metabolically stable diabetes (A1C < 8.5% [< 69 mmol/mol] and asymptomatic), metformin is the initial pharmacologic treatment of choice if kidney function is normal (A). Youth with marked hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL [≥ 13.9 mmol/L] A1C ≥ 8.5% [≥ 69 mmol/mol]) without acidosis at diagnosis who are symptomatic with polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, and/or weight loss should be treated initially with long-acting insulin while metformin is initiated and titrated (B). Initiate subcutaneous or intravenous insulin treatment in individuals with ketoacidosis to rapidly correct the hyperglycemia and the metabolic derangement, and once acidosis is resolved, metformin should be initiated while subcutaneous insulin therapy is continued (A). In individuals presenting with severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 600 mg/dL [≥ 33.3 mmol/L]), consider assessment for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (A).

### Hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes: a consensus report [^112YtsdG]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid solutions at an initial rate of 500–1,000 mL/h during the first 2–4 hours in adult patients with DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state without renal or cardiac compromise. Decide on the subsequent choice for fluid replacement after restoration of intravascular volume based on the state of hydration assessed by BP, HR, fluid input-output balance, and sodium concentration, correcting estimated fluid deficits within the first 24–48 hours. Use caution when rapidly replacing fluids in patients at high risk of fluid overload, including older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with heart or kidney disease or other serious comorbidities.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^116f3UJa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Several studies suggest a potential role for bicarbonate therapy in the recovery phase of DKA. After volume resuscitation, bicarbonate is regenerated, but may be offset by development of hyperchloremia, as ketoacids are preferentially excreted over chloride anions. In addition, patients with persistent kidney injury and reduced production of renal bicarbonate may theoretically benefit from bicarbonate administration to correct this relative bicarbonate deficiency. Two adult RCTs found quicker reversal of acidosis with bicarbonate therapy at 2 h, but this benefit was not sustained beyond 2 h. There were no significant differences in glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, tissue oxygenation, or cerebrospinal fluid acidosis, but increased rates of hypokalemia. Finally, two studies found paradoxical worsening of ketonemia with bicarbonate therapy, theorized to be due to augmented hepatic ketogenesis.

Recommendation

Sodium bicarbonate therapy in the initial resuscitation or recovery phase of DKA is not recommended and may cause harm in pediatric patients, although data in patients with severe acidosis (pH < 7.0) and hyperkalemia are lacking (Level of evidence: B).

### Insulin resistance relates to DKA severity and affects insulin requirement in children with type 1 diabetes at onset [^115So8Av]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Fluid and insulin are the cornerstones of DKA management. The objectives of therapy are to restore circulating volume by correcting dehydration, acidosis, and reversing ketosis. If properly adopted, it may reduce the risk of related complications. After initial fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy is essential to normalize blood glucose concentration, to correct acidosis by suppression of the lipolysis and ketogenesis, to generate bicarbonate from ketoacid metabolism, and to restore the normal cellular metabolism. According to the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) guidelines the insulin infusion should be started at least 1 h after starting fluid replacement therapy at dosage ranging from 0.05 to 0.1 unit/kg/h; low dose intravenous insulin administration is safe and effective. Peculiar and relevant indications on different dosages are needed at diabetes onset. However, this information has not been completely investigated yet. Notably, distinct approaches related to different scenarios according to major confounding factors, such as insulin sensitivity states, should be evaluated. Therefore, in children with new onset type 1 diabetes, studies evaluating the effects of insulin sensitivity on insulin requirement are needed. These results might offer unique data for producing guidelines for different insulin dosages related to insulin sensitivity. Therefore, we aimed to explore whether different degrees of DKA are related to different insulin sensitivity thus requiring pH tailored insulin administration in children with new onset type 1 diabetes.

### Response to' comment on "Excessive sodium bicarbonate infusion may result in osmotic demyelination syndrome during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis: a case report" by hsieh et al' [^113b1UmH]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

We appreciate the concise comments and suggestions by Castello and colleagues. They suggested a higher correction factor of serum glucose level and plasma sodium level (P Na) be applied for more concise evaluation. Various values had been proposed for the correction factor, such as 1.6, 2.0, 2.4, or even higher.

We agreed with the suggestions by Castello et al. about the correction factors and careful calculation of osmolytes, but we would also like to mention that although we can never overemphasize the importance of estimating the correct P Na, such diversity and complexity may increase the difficulty of decision-making regarding resuscitation. There may be some limitations, such as time limit of resuscitation, extreme changes of vital signs, and so on to prevent clinicians from calculating the osmolytes from each infusion under resuscitation settings. Our main purpose is to highlight the idea that first-line clinicians should follow the treatment guidelines of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and restriction of sodium bicarbonate may be the first step of avoiding extraordinary osmolar change.

In our case, the first-line clinicians were initially facing difficult decisions to stabilize the hemodynamic status, and giving large amounts of fluids was naturally the first step. Then severe metabolic acidosis might force the clinician to decide whether to give sodium bicarbonate supplement or even renal replacement therapy. The patient also presented ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) which further interfered with clinical judgement as the VPCs might be life threatening and might result from either acidosis or electrolyte imbalances. To our knowledge, though it is possible, DKA does not typically present with VPCs and shock. The atypical presentation also made it more difficult to follow the guidelines.

Dr. Bartoli and colleagues performed great work to evaluate the relationships between sodium and water during hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), and Dr. Baldrighi and colleagues proposed a concise and detailed method of evaluating fluids and electrolytes in patients with HHS. Further implementation may help clinicians determine the adequate amount of fluid supplements. However, in DKA with life-threatening status, we may need further work to achieve the balance between timely stabilization of vital signs and precise fluid therapy.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^115W2W1J]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

This study thus raises the question about what is hoped to be achieved when initially investigating possible DKA in an acute setting. Is it to establish if there is hyperglycemia present (or another cause) which is sufficient to lead to hyperketonemia and then to determine whether this has resulted in a significant metabolic acidosis (a 'D-K-A' strategy)? Or is it to establish the reverse, namely, if there is a metabolic acidosis present, whether ketonemia is its major (or only) source and then to determine if hyperglycemia also exists (an 'A-K-D' strategy)? It could be argued that any life-threatening situation is likely to be a consequence of acidosis rather than ketonemia, irrespective of whether hyperglycemia exists, although acid-base compensatory mechanisms mean pH or bicarbonate measurements alone are unlikely to be perfect triage tests either. Certainly, guidelines cannot cover every clinical presentation and, as previously pointed out, some, such as the ADA position statement, make clear that the criteria may be inaccurate in roughly 10% of cases. In our study, 22 of 133 episodes of potential DKA (~ 17%) with a bicarbonate concentration ≤ 18mmol/L were either not diagnostically hyperglycemic (> 13.9mmol/L, n = 8) or ketonemic (≤ 3mmol/L, n = 9) or both (n = 5).

### Thirty years of personal experience in hyperglycemic crises: diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [^116kkeVh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) cause major morbidity and significant mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. For more than 30 yr, our group, in a series of prospective, randomized clinical studies, has investigated the pathogenesis and evolving strategies of the treatment of hyperglycemic crises. This paper summarizes the results of these prospective studies on the management and pathophysiology of DKA.

Setting

Our earliest studies evaluated the comparative efficacy of low-dose vs. pharmacological amounts of insulin and the use of low-dose therapy by various routes in adults and later in children. Subsequent studies evaluated phosphate and bicarbonate therapy, lipid metabolism, ketosis-prone type 2 patients, and use of rapid-acting insulin analogs as well as leptin status, cardiac risk factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and the mechanism of activation of T lymphocytes in hyperglycemic crises.

Main Outcome

The information garnered from these studies resulted in the creation of the 2001 American Diabetes Association (ADA) technical review on DKA and HHS as well as the ADA Position and Consensus Paper on the therapy for hyperglycemic crises.

Conclusions

Areas of future research include prospective randomized studies to do the following: 1) establish the efficacy of bicarbonate therapy in DKA for a pH less than 6.9; 2) establish the need for a bolus insulin dose in the initial therapy of DKA; 3) determine the pathophysiological mechanisms for the absence of ketosis in HHS; 4) investigate the reasons for elevated proinflammatory cytokines and cardiovascular risk factors; and 5) evaluate the efficacy and cost benefit of using sc regular insulin vs. more expensive insulin analogs on the general ward for the treatment of DKA.

Fluid Therapy

Dehydration can be assumed to be 5%–10% (50–100 mL/kg). As noted above, the degree of dehydration is usually overestimated. The severity of extracellular fluid (ECF) contraction may be indicated by serum urea and hematocrit concentrations. Serum Na concentration is not reliable for determining ECF deficit because of the osmotic effect of hyperglycemia-induced dilutional hyponatremia, and the low Na content of the elevated lipid fraction of the serum in DKA. Corrected Na, ie for normal glucose levels, can be estimated by adding 1.6 mEq to the measured value for each 100 mg/dL blood glucose above normal.
During the first 1–2 hours, 10–20mL/kg 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) should be provided to restore peripheral perfusion.
Maintenance can be calculated as 1000 mL for the first 10 kg body weight + 500 mL for the next 10 kg + 20 mL/kg over 20 kg or 1500 mL/m² body surface area.
The remainder of replacement after the loading dose, based on 5%–10% dehydration, and maintenance, can be distributed over the subsequent 22–23 hours. While many guidelines call for calculating replacement over 48 hours, there is no evidence basis for this being safer or more efficacious. Fluids that have recently been administered orally at home (if not vomited) and parenteral fluids provided in the emergency room or referring institution need to be incorporated into the calculation.
Except for severely ill and very young individuals, oral intake should begin before 24 hours.
While urinary output should be carefully documented, urinary losses should not be added to fluid requirements, except in the presence of HHS.
After initial 0.9% NaCl bolus, rehydration/maintenance should be continued with 0.45% NaCl. The measured Na can increase to the level of the corrected Na during rehydration as glycemia declines and then decline to normal levels if the corrected level was elevated.
Continued use of 0.9% saline after the initial resuscitation may result in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
To prevent unduly rapid decline in plasma glucose concentration and hypoglycemia, 5% glucose should be added to the IV fluid when the plasma glucose falls to 300 mg/dL (17 mmol/L). An efficient method of providing glucose as needed without long delays entailed by the changing of IV solutions is to have two IV fluid bags connected, one containing 10% dextrose and the appropriate Na and K concentrations and the other with the same salt concentrations but no dextrose, the so-called "two bag system".
K (40 mEq/L or up to 80 mEq/L as needed) can be provided as half potassium chloride (KCl), half potassium phosphate (KPO₄; to replenish low phosphate levels and to decrease the risk of hyperchloremia) or as half KPO₄ and half K acetate (which, like lactate, is converted to bicarbonate to help correct acidosis) after serum K is < 6 mmol/L or urine flow is established. Serum K concentration increases by approximately 0.6 mEq/L for every 0.1 decrease in pH, so that the serum K level does not reflect the large deficit from diuresis and vomiting, ∼5 mEq/kg body weight. Both K and phosphate shift markedly from intracellular to extracellular compartments with acidosis and re-enter cells rapidly with insulin-induced glucose uptake and rehydration.
Bicarbonate administration is not indicated in pediatric DKA. There is no evidence that bicarbonate facilitates metabolic recovery. Restoring circulatory volume will improve tissue perfusion and renal function, increasing organic acid excretion and reversing lactic acidosis. The administration of insulin stops further synthesis of ketoacids and reactivates the Krebs cycle, permitting metabolism of ketoacids, and regeneration of bicarbonate. Bicarbonate therapy may cause paradoxical central nervous system (CNS) acidosis, rapid correction of acidosis can cause hypokalemia, the additional Na can add to hyperosmolality, and alkali therapy can increase hepatic ketone production, potentially slowing recovery.

Electrolyte imbalances (potassium, phosphate, and magnesium) in pediatric hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) are emphasized as more severe than in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), with specific management guidance: Potassium replacement should begin once concentrations are normal and renal function is adequate, be initiated at 40 mEq/L of replacement fluid, and be monitored at least every 2 to 3 hours during insulin administration with possible hourly monitoring and cardiac monitoring; bicarbonate therapy is contraindicated; phosphate deficits are more severe in HHS and intravenous solutions containing a 50:50 mixture of potassium phosphate and potassium chloride generally permit adequate replacement, with phosphate concentrations monitored at least every 3 to 4 hours; and for patients with hypocalcemia and low magnesium, magnesium replacement should be considered with a recommended dose of 25 to 50 mg/kg/dose for 3 to 4 doses given every 4 to 6 hours, with a maximum infusion rate of 150 mg/min and 2 g/h.

Insulin

Insulin should be started after initial fluid expansion. This provides a more realistic starting glucose level.
0.1 U/kg/hour is given as a continuous infusion, using a pump. Fifty units of regular insulin are diluted in 50 mL normal saline to provide 1 unit/mL.
A bolus dose of insulin is not indicated and may increase the risk of CE.
In some settings it may be necessary to administer insulin subcutaneously. Studies in adults have indicated no significant difference in recovery time whether insulin was administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously after the first couple of hours of treatment. A study of subcutaneous insulin in children with DKA using a rapid-acting insulin analog (lispro) provided a dose of 0.15 units/kg every 2 hours; there were no significant differences from children randomized to receive 0.1 unit/kg per hour intravenously. The administration of 0.1 unit/kg subcutaneously every hour may be preferable and can be adjusted to maintain blood glucose concentrations at ∼180–200 mg/dL (10–11 mmol/L).
Fluid expansion alone will have a dilutional effect, lowering high blood glucose levels by as much as 180–270 mg/dL (10–15 mmol/L). With insulin infusion the rate of glucose decline should be 50–150 mg/dL (2.8–8.3 mmol/L/hour), but not > 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L/hour). If serum glucose values are not dropping adequately, the insulin dose should be increased; this is rarely necessary.
If the blood glucose concentration falls below 150 mg/dL (8.3 mmol/L) 10% dextrose solution should be given and the insulin dose reduced to 0.05 U/kg/hour if glucose concentration is not sustained by the 10% dextrose solution.
Insulin should not be stopped; a continuous supply of insulin is needed to prevent ketosis and permit continued anabolism. If the patient demonstrates marked sensitivity to insulin, the dose may be decreased to 0.05 units/kg/hour, or less, provided that metabolic acidosis continues to resolve.
Persistent acidosis, defined as bicarbonate value < 10 mmol/L after 8–10 hours of treatment, is usually caused by inadequate insulin effect. Insulin dilution and rate of administration should be checked, and a fresh preparation made. Too dilute a solution may enhance insulin adherence to the tubing. If insulin is being given by subcutaneous injection, inadequate absorption may be occurring. Rare causes of persistent acidosis include lactic acidosis due to an episode of hypotension or apnea or inadequate renal handling of hydrogen ion as a result of an episode of renal hypoperfusion.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution, defined as the time elapsed between ED presentation and resolution of ketoacidosis, using the following criteria for resolution of ketoacidosis from the American Diabetes Association Consensus Statement on Hyperglycemic Crises — plasma glucose less than 200 mg/dL and 2 of the following: plasma bicarbonate greater than or equal to 15 mEq/L, venous pH greater than 7.3, and anion gap less than or equal to 12 mEq/L. Patients discharged from the hospital without meeting laboratory criteria for DKA resolution were classified as having DKA resolution at the time of hospital discharge.

The secondary outcome was time to discontinuation of insulin infusion, defined as the time between initiation and final discontinuation of intravenous insulin infusion during the hospitalization for DKA. Patients who never had an insulin infusion started were coded as 0 for time to discontinuation of insulin infusion. Additional outcomes are described in eTable 2 in the Supplement.

### Approach to patients with high anion gap metabolic acidosis: core curriculum 2021 [^115oS1GG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The anion gap (AG) is a mathematical construct that compares the blood sodium concentration with the sum of the chloride and bicarbonate concentrations. It is a helpful calculation that divides the metabolic acidoses into 2 categories: high AG metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis-and thereby delimits the potential etiologies of the disorder. When the [AG] is compared with changes in the bicarbonate concentration, other occult acid-base disorders can be identified. Furthermore, finding that the AG is very small or negative can suggest several occult clinical disorders or raise the possibility of electrolyte measurement artifacts. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we discuss cases that represent several very common and several rare causes of HAGMA. These case scenarios highlight how the AG can provide vital clues that direct the clinician toward the correct diagnosis. We also show how to calculate and, if necessary, correct the AG for hypoalbuminemia and severe hyperglycemia. Plasma osmolality and osmolal gap calculations are described and when used together with the AG guide appropriate clinical decision making.

4.5 Potassium replacement

Hypokalaemia in HHS is multifactorial. Osmotic diuresis and consequent hypertonicity from hyperglycaemia lead to fluids shifts from the intracellular space into the extracellular space. This leads to intracellular potassium loss. In addition, hypoperfusion leads to the activation of aldosterone secretion, further exacerbating the potassium loss. Vomiting, if present, worsens hypokalaemia. Lack of insulin in DKA, accumulation of ketone bodies leading to ketoacidosis and drop in bicarbonate ion concentration leads to a further loss of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space. In both cases (DKA and/or HHS) there is a total body loss of potassium. Treatment with insulin will lead to a shift of potassium back into the intracellular space which unravels hypokalaemia.

Those on diuretics may be profoundly hypokalaemic to start with. It is also worth noting that if acute kidney injury is present, hyperkalaemia may be present owing to reduced clearance and therefore closer monitoring is required.

Potassium level assessment and replacement is crucial in management of HHS and if mixed with ketosis/DKA. For guidance on potassium replacement see Table 2.

### Management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) in adults: an updated guideline from the joint British diabetes societies (JBDS) for inpatient care group [^113XSYQ9]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic State (HHS) is a medical emergency associated with high mortality. It occurs less frequently than diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), affects those with pre‐existing/new type 2 diabetes mellitus and increasingly affecting children/younger adults. Mixed DKA/HHS may occur. The JBDS HHS care pathway consists of 3 themes (clinical assessment and monitoring, interventions, assessments and prevention of harm) and 5 phases of therapy (0–60 min, 1–6, 6–12, 12–24 and 24–72 h). Clinical features of HHS include marked hypovolaemia, osmolality ≥ 320 mOsm/kg using [(2×Na +) + glucose+urea], marked hyperglycaemia ≥ 30 mmol/L, without significant ketonaemia (≤ 3.0 mmol/L), without significant acidosis (pH > 7.3) and bicarbonate ≥ 15 mmol/L. Aims of the therapy are to improve clinical status/replace fluid losses by 24 h, gradual decline in osmolality (3.0–8.0 mOsm/kg/h to minimise the risk of neurological complications), blood glucose 10–15 mmol/L in the first 24 h, prevent hypoglycaemia/hypokalaemia and prevent harm (VTE, osmotic demyelination, fluid overload, foot ulceration). Underlying precipitants must be identified and treated. Interventions include: (1) intravenous (IV) 0.9% sodium chloride to restore circulating volume (fluid losses 100–220 ml/kg, caution in elderly), (2) fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) should be commenced once osmolality stops falling with fluid replacement unless there is ketonaemia (FRIII should be commenced at the same time as IV fluids). (3) glucose infusion (5% or 10%) should be started once glucose < 14 mmol/L and (4) potassium replacement according to potassium levels. HHS resolution criteria are: osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg, hypovolaemia corrected (urine output ≥ 0.5 ml/kg/h), cognitive status returned to pre‐morbid state and blood glucose < 15 mmol/L.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^114bw9Le]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic Ketoacidosis

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) results in severe metabolic acidosis in several ways. First, insulin deficiency and high levels of counterregulatory hormones (e.g. glucagon, catecholamines, and cortisol) trigger the release of hormone-sensitive lipase. This results in lipolysis of free fatty acids into ketoacids (β -hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate), which reliably results in a AGMA. These unmeasured anions are the predominant components in DKA. In addition, volume losses from osmolar diuresis, anorexia, and vomiting lead to acute kidney injury, which may contribute to AGMA or NAGMA. Injury to renal glomeruli and tubules may also result in inadequate excretion of other unmeasured anions, such as sulfate, phosphate, and urate, worsening acidemia and increasing the anion gap. Finally, a lactic acidosis may occur due to decreased tissue perfusion, catecholamine excess, and altered glucose metabolism, which may shunt pyruvate from glycolysis to produce lactate as well.

### Hyperosmolar diabetic ketoacidosis – review of literature and the shifting paradigm in evaluation and management [^111JLwwY]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperosmolar diabetic ketoacidosis (H-DKA), a distinct clinical entity, is the overlap of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).

Aim

We describe the clinical presentation, metabolic aberrations, and associated morbidity/mortality of these cases with H-DKA. We highlight the problem areas of medical care which require particular attention when caring for pediatric diabetes patients presenting with H-DKA.

Methods

In our study we reviewed the literature back to 1963 and retrieved twenty-four cases meeting the criteria of H-DKA: glucose > 600 mg/dL, pH < 7.3, bicarbonate < 15 mEq/L, and serum osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg, while adding three cases from our institution.

Results

Average age of presentation of H-DKA was 10.2 years ± 4.5 years in females and 13.3 years ± 4 years in males, HbA1c was 13%. Biochemical parameters were consistent with severe dehydration: serum osmolality = 394.8 ± 55 mOsm/kg, BUN = 48 ± 22 mg/dL, creatinine = 2.81 ± 1.03 mg/dL. Acute kidney injury, present in 12 cases, was the most frequent end-organ complication.

Conclusion

Multi-organ involvement with AKI, rhabdomyolysis, pancreatitis, neurological and cardiac issues such as arrhythmias, are common in H-DKA. Aggressive fluid management, insulin therapy and supportive care can prevent acute and long term adverse outcomes in children and adolescents.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in the era of SGLT-2 inhibitors [^1133osWU]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) is an emerging complication of diabetes associated with an increasing use of sodium-glucose transporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor drugs. This review highlights the growing incidence of EDKA and its diagnostic challenges due to the absence of hallmark hyperglycemia seen in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The paper presents a classification system for the severity of EDKA, categorizing it into mild, moderate, and severe based on serum pH and bicarbonate levels. Another classification system is proposed to define stages of EDKA based on anion gap and ketones at the time of diagnosis and during the treatment period. A treatment algorithm is proposed to guide clinicians in managing EDKA. This treatment algorithm includes monitoring anion gap and ketones to guide insulin and fluid management, and slower transition to subcutaneous insulin to prevent a relapse. Increased awareness of EDKA is essential for a timely diagnosis because an early diagnosis and treatment can improve clinical outcomes.

Volume management takes into consideration the cause of arrest, hemodynamic target chosen, and underlying organ dysfunction and is individualized to each patient (100%, 23/23).
Balance the risk for cerebral edema with complications associated with hyperchloremia when choosing intravenous fluid after CA. The preferred choice in the setting of cerebral edema is normal saline, although balanced crystalloid solutions may minimize hyperchloremia and the potential for AKI when cerebral edema is not present (95.7%, 22/23).
Do not use sodium bicarbonate routinely in patients after CA who have metabolic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate may be considered in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.2, bicarbonate < 20) and AKI stage 2 or 3 (82.6%, 19/23).
Consider RRT after CA for when life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolytes, and/or acid–base balance exist and for conditions that can potentially be modified with RRT (100%, 23/23).
Do not administer empirical corticosteroids to all patients after CA, although supplemental corticosteroids may be useful to treat persistent shock in patients with proven or suspected adrenal suppression (91.3%, 21/23).
Consider treatment of hyperglycemia with glucose targets of 81 to 180 mg/dL (100%, 19/19).

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^1121AWQk]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Effect of various doses of insulin on recovery parameters

Table 3 demonstrates the outcome recovery data for DKA, depicting the time that predetermined values were reached for glucose, HCO₃⁻, and pH. The results suggested no significant differences in these values for the three doses of insulin, but 5 of 12 patients in the no load group required additional insulin for control of their blood glucose. The length of hospitalization was not significantly different among the groups, there were no complications in any of the groups, and no deaths occurred in this cohort. No hypokalemia was noted in any treatment group. The potassium nadirs were 4.3, 4.2, and 3.7 mEq/l in the load, no load, and twice no load groups, respectively (Fig. 2).

Table 4 shows estimates of the slopes for glucose, venous pH, ketones, FFAs, bicarbonate, and cortisol during the first 8 h of therapy in the three insulin therapy groups. The response of serum bicarbonate and cortisol showed no differences among the treatment groups. However, the slopes for glucose, venous pH, ketones, and FFAs varied among treatment groups.

### Insulin infusion responses in diabetic ketoacidosis alone and with a mixed hypochloremic alkalosis [^115UP2ED]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Although diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) commonly presents as a pure diabetic ketoacidosis (PDKA), up to 30% of cases may be associated with a mixed hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (HMA). It is unknown whether there is a difference in treatment outcomes between these two entities. We evaluated an insulin infusion protocol (IIP), previously validated for hyperglycemia management in ICU's, for the management of PDKA and HMA.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective case series/cohort study of 41 DKA admissions was further characterized as having PDKA or HMA. HMA was defined in those having an elevated delta-delta gradient (ΔAG−ΔHCO₃) ≥ 5 mmol/L and base excess chloride (BE Cl) > 2.7 mmol/L. The main outcome measures were times to recovery of glucose levels to ≤ 250 mg/dL and of anion gap to ≤ 12 mmol/L.

Results

The initial serum glucose was 553 ± 265 mg/dL, serum bicarbonate of 8.8 ± 5.1 mmol/L, and venous pH 7.13 ± 0.2). Recovery of glucose occurred in 5 h: 25 min (± 3 h:39min), and for anion gap in 11 h:25 min (± 6 h:56min). HMA compared with PDKA had a delayed recovery of serum glucose (7 h: 23min ± 3 h: 35min vs. 4 h: 31min ± 3:h:21min, p = 0.017), which was due to the higher initial level of glucose (p = 0.02) rather than level of BE Cl (p = 0.17). There was no difference in time to anion gap closure between the PDKA and HMA.

Conclusions

Correction of hyperglycemia and acidosis in PDKA as well as in HMA was managed through the IIP. The simultaneous fluid and electrolyte management corrected the hypochloremic alkalosis.

Hyperglycemia and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) — field thresholds and testing emphasize glucose cutoffs and dehydration severity. If someone with diabetes is found to be hyperglycemic (plasma glucose level > 250 mg·dL−1), assess for HHS or DKA, and individuals with type 1 diabetes should be able to test for blood or urine ketones if they have unexplained hyperglycemia. In HHS, serum glucose level usually > 600 mg·dL−1 with extreme dehydration with a fluid deficit of 8 to 12 L.

### Comparison of a' two-bag system' versus conventional treatment protocol (' one-bag system') in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^115U69D9]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

All adult patients over the age of 18 years with an admitting diagnosis of DKA were retrospectively identified from the medical record searching through ICD-9-CM codes 250.10 (DKA in type 1 diabetes) and 250.11 (DKA in type 2 diabetes) diagnosis. Once a list of the patients was gathered, the diagnosis of DKA was verified. The following criteria were used to define DKA, a blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL and two of the following three criteria: serum bicarbonate (HCO₃) < 18 mEq/L; serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) > 3 mmol/L; and pH < 7.30. Patients with a diagnosis of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state as a final diagnosis in the chart were excluded. Ketosis from any other etiology, for example, alcoholic ketoacidosis, starvation ketosis, as a final diagnosis in the chart was excluded. Our chart review confirmed that there were no pregnant patients on our list eliminating any case of DKA associated with pregnancy. During initial chart review, we did not include any patient with DKA who was not started on an insulin drip eliminating cases of DKA treated with a subcutaneous insulin protocol. We identified 383 patients admitted with DKA that received treatment with either the one-bag system (n = 249) or the two-bag system (n = 143). Data were extracted from individual chart review using a standard data collection instrument that recorded the following information at the time of admission: patient's age and sex, hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c), body weight, body mass index (BMI), pH, anion gap, admission blood glucose, comorbidities, HCO₃, serum BHB, and the time of initiation and discontinuation of the DKA protocol. We also captured changes in anion gap, serum glucose, and bicarbonate level as patients received treatment for DKA.

Study outcomes

During the treatment of DKA, hyperglycemia is corrected faster than the ketoacidosis. Thus, we chose closure of the anion gap as our primary outcome measure which served as a surrogate for the resolution of DKA. Our secondary outcome was time to reach plasma glucose < 250 mg/dL, time to reach HCO₃ level > 18 mmol/L, and hospital length of stay.

### Management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents [^111rjvCK]. Pediatrics in Review (2008). Low credibility.

* Based on some research evidence, DKA is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in children who have type 1 diabetes, and cerebral edema is responsible for most of the deaths during DKA in children. (Dunger, 2004). * Based on strong research evidence, treatment of DKA requires replacement of water and electrolytes and correction of the insulin deficiency. (Dunger, 2004). * Based on some research data and consensus opinion, after providing initial volume expansion (if needed), fluid resuscitation of children who have DKA should be calculated to rehydrate evenly over at least 48 hours. Initial fluid resuscitation should be with an isotonic solution; subsequent fluid management should be with a solution that has a tonicity of at least 0.45% saline. (Dunger, 2004). * Based on strong research evidence, insulin treatment for DKA should begin at a dose of 0.1 units/kg per hour and generally should remain at or above this level until the ketoacidosis is resolved. (Dunger, 2004). * Based on some research evidence, risk factors for the development of cerebral edema during treatment of DKA include the severity of acidosis, greater hypocapnia (after adjusting for the degree of acidosis), higher blood urea nitrogen concentration at presentation, and treatment with bicarbonate.

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

I. Critically ill patients

Insulin therapy should be initiated for treatment of persistent hyperglycemia, starting at a threshold of no greater than 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l).
Once insulin therapy has been started, a glucose range of 140–180 mg/dl (7.8–10.0 mmol/l) is recommended for the majority of critically ill patients.
Intravenous insulin infusions are the preferred method for achieving and maintaining glycemic control in critically ill patients.
Validated insulin infusion protocols with demonstrated safety and efficacy, and with low rates of occurrence of hypoglycemia, are recommended.
With IV insulin therapy, frequent glucose monitoring is essential to minimize the occurrence of hypoglycemia and to achieve optimal glucose control.

II. Noncritically ill patients

For the majority of noncritically ill patients treated with insulin, the premeal BG target should generally be < 140 mg/dl (< 7.8 mmol/l) in conjunction with random BG values < 180 mg/dl (< 10.0 mmol/l), provided these targets can be safely achieved.
More stringent targets may be appropriate in stable patients with previous tight glycemic control.
Less stringent targets may be appropriate in terminally ill patients or in patients with severe comorbidities.
Scheduled subcutaneous administration of insulin, with basal, nutritional, and correction components, is the preferred method for achieving and maintaining glucose control.
Prolonged therapy with SSI as the sole regimen is discouraged.
Noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents are not appropriate in most hospitalized patients who require therapy for hyperglycemia.
Clinical judgment and ongoing assessment of clinical status must be incorporated into day-to-day decisions regarding treatment of hyperglycemia.

III. Safety issues

Overtreatment and undertreatment of hyperglycemia represent major safety concerns.
Education of hospital personnel is essential in engaging the support of those involved in the care of inpatients with hyperglycemia.
Caution is required in interpreting results of POC glucose meters in patients with anemia, polycythemia, hypoperfusion, or use of some medications.
Buy-in and financial support from hospital administration are required for promoting a rational systems approach to inpatient glycemic management.

IV. Cost

Appropriate inpatient management of hyperglycemia is cost-effective.

V. Discharge planning

Preparation for transition to the outpatient setting should begin at the time of hospital admission.
Discharge planning, patient education, and clear communication with outpatient providers are critical for ensuring a safe and successful transition to outpatient glycemic management.

VI. Needed research

A selected number of research questions and topics for guiding the management of inpatient hyperglycemia in various hospital settings are proposed.

### Comparison of a' two-bag system' versus conventional treatment protocol (' one-bag system') in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^115qvynR]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

In our study, although the AG corrected earlier in DKA patients treated with the two-bag protocol, the time for serum bicarbonate level to reach > 18 was similar in both groups. Additionally, improvement of the bicarbonate level lagged behind the anion gap closure. This may indicate that relative hyperchloremia, resulting from the large volume of normal saline infusions during volume resuscitation, leads to the correction of the AG. However, ketone levels remained elevated for a longer duration accompanied by reduced serum bicarbonate levels until finally correcting with the insulin infusion. Both protocols were based on guidelines of fluid resuscitation in patients with DKA published by ADA. Clinicians made the final decision regarding how much fluid was needed for a patient based on clinical findings, dehydration, and comorbidities. We could not collect the data on the total volume of intravenous fluid containing sodium chloride in our study population and do not know whether there was any difference in the intravenous fluid administered.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^113u3pne]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

DKA is the result of absolute or relative deficiency of insulin in combination with exuberant secretion of counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol, growth hormone) resulting in blockade of glucose utilization in insulin-sensitive tissues (liver, fat, muscle) and a cascade of derangement progressing to ketoacidosis and dehydration. Much new-onset DKA can be prevented by increased awareness of early signs and symptoms of diabetes and, in principle, almost all recurrent DKA is preventable by informed sick day management, recognition of psychosocial problems leading to insulin omission, and careful monitoring of insulin pump function.

Management of DKA should occur in centers with treatment experience and monitoring capability. Fluid replacement begins with 0.9% saline to restore circulation and subsequent 0.45% saline for maintenance and replacement of 5%–10% dehydration, according to severity indicators. Whether levels of serum K are normal or elevated, there will be a total K deficit that must be dealt with early and sufficiently. Bicarbonate administration is neither necessary nor safe. Mannitol or hypertonic saline should be at the bedside, for rapid intervention as indicated for CE, the most common serious complication of DKA. Other complications include hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypoglycemia, intracerebral complications other than CE, peripheral venous thrombosis, mucormycosis, aspiration pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, acute pancreatitis, and acute renal failure. Among questions that need to be addressed regarding DKA in children and adolescents are whether feasible and cost-effective methods can reduce the frequency of new-onset and recurrent DKA, what characterizes optimal fluid replacement therapy, how effective proposed monitoring and intervention criteria are in the reduction of CE morbidity and mortality, and whether hypertonic saline is as or more effective than mannitol in the treatment of CE.

Key points

Treatment of DKA requires first and foremost fluid resuscitation with 0.9% saline, followed by replacement for 5%–10% dehydration, depending on severity, and maintenance with 0.45% saline, and early and adequate K replacement.
Insulin should not be given as a bolus, but infused after the initial fluid resuscitation in a dose of 0.1 U/kg of body weight/hour.
Bicarbonate infusion is contraindicated in pediatric DKA.
CE is the most common serious complication, requiring careful neurologic and vital sign monitoring and early intervention with mannitol or hypertonic saline infusion.

Metabolic acidosis in CKD — practice points, treatment thresholds, and dietary guidance are as follows: Practice Point 3.10.1 states to consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary intervention to prevent development of acidosis with potential clinical implications (e.g., bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l in adults). Practice Point 3.10.2 advises monitoring to ensure therapy does not result in serum bicarbonate concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal and does not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, or fluid status. The KDOQI Work Group agrees that acidosis in adults should only be treated with pharmacologic agents when bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l or if there is a clear indication to do so, and notes a large clinical trial of veverimer did not demonstrate a decline in a composite CKD progression outcome. Pediatric clinicians may choose to treat milder acidosis more aggressively to help optimize growth and bone health. Nutrition guidance supports prevention and treatment via increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables, including the statement: In adults with CKD 1–4, we suggest reducing net endogenous acid production through increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables (2C) to reduce the rate of decline of residual kidney function.

### Comparison of a' two-bag system' versus conventional treatment protocol (' one-bag system') in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^113aLPgv]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nearly 10% of the population in the United States has diabetes mellitus. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a well-known, serious, acute metabolic complication. While it is primarily associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus two-thirds of the time, it also occurs in type 2 diabetes mellitus approximately 34% of the time, often as a manifestation of the syndrome of ketosis-prone diabetes. The incidence of DKA continues to rise. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there were 140 000 hospital discharges from DKA in 2009 in the United States, about 75% increase over the last two decadeswith an estimated cost annually of > $2 billion and accounts for > 500 000 hospital days per year.

Along with identification of triggering factors, management of DKA involves correction of hyperglycemia, volume depletion, acid–base derangements and electrolyte imbalances. Because of the complexities in the management protocol, many cases of DKA are managed in intensive care units (ICUs) across the United States. Losses of fluids and electrolytes are significant causes of mortality and morbidity in DKA. The mortality is < 1% in American adults; however, rises to > 5% in the elderly population with significant comorbidities. In the United States, the age-adjusted mortality rate for hyperglycemic crisis declined between 1980 and 2009. In 2009, hyperglycemic crises caused 64% lower mortality than in 1980.

Evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of DKA have been published periodically in North Americaand Europeimproving the understanding and facilitating the development of management protocols. The outcomes of DKA have been shown to improve with adherence to treatment guidelines. Minor variants of the commonly used treatment protocol for DKA based on the published guidelines use insulin infusions and intravenous electrolyte solution and dextrose solution when blood sugar drops below 250 mg/dL. In order to correct dehydration in patients with DKA, intravenous electrolyte solutions are administered at the beginning of the treatment. As the blood glucose levels fall, a new bag of intravenous fluid with different dextrose concentrations would be ordered, and multiple sequential changes of bags would occur during the course of treatment. Despite their proven effectiveness, a varying degree of non-adherence to guidelines has been documented in the literature compromising the success of published protocols. Successful implementation of the conventional DKA protocol requires not only careful assessment of the clinical status of the patient and laboratory values, but frequent changes to intravenous fluids between saline and dextrose solutions.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^112zo74N]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

The object of this review is to provide the definitions, frequency, risk factors, pathophysiology, diagnostic considerations, and management recommendations for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children and adolescents, and to convey current knowledge of the causes of permanent disability or mortality from complications of DKA or its management, particularly the most common complication, cerebral edema (CE). DKA frequency at the time of diagnosis of pediatric diabetes is 10%-70%, varying with the availability of healthcare and the incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the community. Recurrent DKA rates are also dependent on medical services and socioeconomic circumstances. Management should be in centers with experience and where vital signs, neurologic status, and biochemistry can be monitored with sufficient frequency to prevent complications or, in the case of CE, to intervene rapidly with mannitol or hypertonic saline infusion. Fluid infusion should precede insulin administration (0.1 U/kg/h) by 1–2 hours; an initial bolus of 10–20 mL/kg 0.9% saline is followed by 0.45% saline calculated to supply maintenance and replace 5%-10% dehydration. Potassium (K) must be replaced early and sufficiently. Bicarbonate administration is contraindicated. The prevention of DKA at onset of diabetes requires an informed community and high index of suspicion; prevention of recurrent DKA, which is almost always due to insulin omission, necessitates a committed team effort.

### Management of toxicity to isoform α-specific PI3K inhibitors [^114V1u4T]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Once hyperglycemia is detected, mild increases in fasting plasma glucose (≤ 160 mg/dl) do not require dose modifications, but initiation of metformin 500 mg once daily is recommended. If no GI intolerance, the dose can be titrated every 7 days by increasing to 500 mg twice daily and increasing each dose by additional 500 mg as needed up to a maximum dose of 2000 mg daily. For fasting plasma glucoses between 160 and 250 mg/dl, the PI3K pathway inhibitor can be maintained at the same dose, but one should consider consultation with an endocrinologist and an increase in the metformin dose if not already maximized. If maximized and FPG does not improve, consider the addition of an insulin-sensitizer agent such as pioglitazone. If hyperglycemia does not improve within 21 days to FPG < 160 mg/dl, the patient should restart alpelisib at a lower dose. In patients who develop FPG > 250 mg/dl, treatment with alpelisib should be interrupted for 1–2 days until blood glucose improves. Aggressive hydration and electrolyte management might also be indicated, especially if blood glucose reaches > 500 mg/dl. Treatment with insulin may be used until hyperglycemia improves as recommended in the SOLAR-1 trial. Blood glucose will normalize in the majority of patients with drug interruption given the short half life of alpelisib, so ongoing treatment with insulin might not be required. However, some patients might require insulin therapy to control their blood glucose throughout treatment. If FPG decreases to ≤ 160 mg/dl within 3 to 5 days with appropriate treatment, patients can resume alpelisib at a lower dose. Consultation with an endocrinologist is also strongly advocated. However if FPG does not improve to ≤ 160 mg/dl within 21 days despite aggressive treatment with anti-diabetic medications, alpelisib should be permanently discontinued. For patients who develop FPG > 500 mg/dl and do not improve to < 500 mg/dl within 24 h of aggressive treatment with insulin and i.v. hydration, treatment with alpelisib should be discontinued.

### The influence of chloride for the interpretation of plasma bicarbonate during the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^115reQbf]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis can occur in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and may affect the acid-base interpretation during treatment.

Objectives

This study aims to describe the prevalence of hyperchloremia during the treatment of DKA and its effect on the interpretation of bicarbonate value.

Methods

A cross-sectional study, including all cases of DKA in patients aged 1 to 18 years old admitted from 2010 to 2015, was performed. Laboratory tests were performed on admission (baseline), 2 and 6 hours after admission, and when resolution of DKA was achieved. Adjusted bicarbonate value was calculated using regression equations.

Results

Seventy-nine DKA episodes were included. The average age was 13.3 ± 3.8 years. Baseline levels were as follows: plasma glucose, 479 ± 133 mg/dL; pH 7.1 ± 0.083; bicarbonate, 9.65 ± 2.9; and anion gap, 23.9 ± 7.5. The time to achieve resolution of DKA was 12.2 ± 4.4 hours, and the decrease in capillary glucose was 25.5 (19.7–38.2) mg/dL per hour. After 6 hours of treatment, the proportion of patients presenting hyperchloremia increased from 23% to 77%. By using adjusted bicarbonate, the percentage of patients achieving resolution of DKA after 6 hours of treatment would have been 35.4% (confidence interval 95%, 28–49), in comparison with 24.1% (confidence interval 95%, 18–37) using observed bicarbonate (P = 0.004).

Conclusions

The hyperchloremia developed during the treatment of DKA could modify the value of measured plasma bicarbonate concentration and unnecessarily prolong the initial phase of treatment.

### Utilizing serum bicarbonate instead of venous pH to transition from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin shortens the duration of insulin infusion in pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis [^115ivZKD]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Standard therapy of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in pediatrics involves intravenous (IV) infusion of regular insulin until correction of acidosis, followed by transition to subcutaneous (SC) insulin. It is unclear what laboratory marker best indicates correction of acidosis. We hypothesized that an institutional protocol change to determine correction of acidosis based on serum bicarbonate level instead of venous pH would shorten the duration of insulin infusion and decrease the number of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) therapies without an increase in adverse events. Methods We conducted a retrospective (pre/post) analysis of records for patients admitted with DKA to the PICU of a large tertiary care children's hospital before and after a transition-criteria protocol change. Outcomes were compared between patients in the pH transition group (transition when venous pH ≥ 7.3) and the bicarbonate transition group (transition when serum bicarbonate ≥ 15 mmol/L). Results We evaluated 274 patient records (n = 142 pH transition group, n = 132 bicarbonate transition group). Duration of insulin infusion was shorter in the bicarbonate transition group (18.5 vs. 15.4 h, p = 0.008). PICU length of stay was 3.2 h shorter in the bicarbonate transition group (26.0 vs. 22.8 h, p = 0.04). There was no difference in the number of adverse events between the groups. Conclusions Transitioning patients from IV to SC insulin based on serum bicarbonate instead of venous pH led to a shorter duration of insulin infusion with a reduction in the number of PICU therapies without an increase in the number of adverse events.

### What should define optimal correction of metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease? [^113Byfax]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Correction of metabolic acidosis is an important goal in the management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there is no consensus as to what constitutes an optimal correction of metabolic acidosis in this setting - various expert groups from around the world have set different goals for serum bicarbonate levels for patients with CKD. Accumulating evidence seems to indicate that achieving an arterial pH closer to the upper limit of the reference range may have even greater benefits than maintaining the arterial pH closer to the lower limit of the reference range. This benefit seems to be particularly relevant for patients with protein-energy wasting and we present a review of the evidence that supports this argument. Routine measurement of arterial pH, however, is not feasible in clinical practice; using the Henderson equation, a high-normal arterial pH is generally expected to be associated with a serum bicarbonate level of 24–30 mEq/l and should be the therapeutic goal for chronic kidney disease patients with protein-energy wasting.

### Hyperglycemia-induced hyponatremia – calculation of expected serum sodium depression [^117H1HeX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1973). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia" for hypernatremia, hyponatremia, diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, diabetes mellitus type 1, diabetes mellitus type 2, diabetic nephropathy and in-hospital hyperglycemia.

The Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia calculator adjusts the measured serum sodium levels to account for hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia causes a dilutional hyponatremia due to the osmotic effect of glucose, pulling water from intracellular to extracellular compartments. This correction is vital for accurately assessing a patient's sodium status in the presence of elevated blood glucose levels.

The Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia calculator takes inputs of measured sodium and blood glucose levels to compute corrected sodium levels using three different formulas: Katz, Hillier, and Adrogué-Madias. These corrections are necessary because hyperglycemia can lead to artificially low sodium measurements, and adjusting for this helps in more accurate clinical assessments.

Inputs:

1. **Measured Sodium**: This is the serum sodium level provided by the user, which can be in units of mEq/L or mmol/L. The acceptable range is 100 to 180 for both units.
2. **Blood Glucose**: The glucose level provided by the user, which can be in units of mg/dL or mmol/L. The acceptable range is 70 to 1000 mg/dL or 3.9 to 55.5 mmol/L.

Computation:

1. If the blood glucose input is in mmol/L, it needs to be converted to mg/dL using the conversion factor (1 mmol/L = 18.02 mg/dL).
2. The calculator applies the following formulas to compute corrected sodium levels:

- **Corrected Sodium (Katz)**: 'measuredSodium + 0.016 * (glucose - 100)'
- **Corrected Sodium (Hillier)**: 'measuredSodium + 0.024 * (glucose - 100)'
- **Corrected Sodium (Adrogué-Madias)**: 'measuredSodium + 0.02 * (glucose - 100)'

3. Each of these corrected sodium values is rounded to the nearest integer to provide a precise reading in units of mEq/L.

Outputs:

1. **Corrected Sodium (Katz)**: The adjusted sodium level using the Katz formula, rounded to the nearest integer, within the range of 100 to 200 mEq/L.
2. **Corrected Sodium (Hillier)**: The adjusted sodium level using the Hillier formula, also rounded, within the range of 100 to 200 mEq/L.
3. **Corrected Sodium (Adrogué-Madias)**: The adjusted sodium level using the Adrogué-Madias formula, rounded similarly, within the range of 100 to 200 mEq/L.

Interpretation:
The different formulas account for varying perspectives on how hyperglycemia affects sodium levels. The Katz correction typically provides a more conservative correction, while the Hillier correction is more aggressive. The Adrogué-Madias correction falls between the two. Clinicians can interpret these corrected sodium values to assess the severity of hypernatremia in hyperglycemic patients more accurately, thereby guiding appropriate clinical interventions.

DKA is a severe metabolic derangement characterized by dehydration, loss of electrolytes, hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, acidosis and progressive loss of consciousness that results from severe insulin deficiency combined with the effects of increased levels of counterregulatory hormones (catecholamines, glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone). The biochemical criteria for diagnosis are: blood glucose > 200 mg/dl, venous pH < 7.3 or bicarbonate < 15 mEq/L, ketonemia > 3 mmol/L and presence of ketonuria. A patient with DKA must be managed in an emergency ward by an experienced staff or in an intensive care unit (ICU), in order to provide an intensive monitoring of the vital and neurological signs, and of the patient's clinical and biochemical response to treatment. DKA treatment guidelines include: restoration of circulating volume and electrolyte replacement; correction of insulin deficiency aiming at the resolution of metabolic acidosis and ketosis; reduction of risk of cerebral edema; avoidance of other complications of therapy (hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hyperchloremic acidosis); identification and treatment of precipitating events. In Brazil, there are few pediatric ICU beds in public hospitals, so an alternative protocol was designed to abbreviate the time on intravenous infusion lines in order to facilitate DKA management in general emergency wards. The main differences between this protocol and the international guidelines are: intravenous fluid will be stopped when oral fluids are well tolerated and total deficit will be replaced orally; if potassium analysis still indicate need for replacement, it will be given orally; subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analog is administered at 0.15 U/kg dose every 2–3 hours until resolution of metabolic acidosis; approximately 12 hours after treatment initiation, intermediate-acting (NPH) insulin is initiated at the dose of 0.6–1 U/kg/day, and it will be lowered to 0.4–0.7 U/kg/day at discharge from hospital.

### Treatment of septic shock in two pediatric patients with severe diabetic ketoacidosis using invasive hemodynamic monitoring: a case report [^112j9LTx]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the hyperglycemic emergencies that may occur in diabetic patients. The diagnostic criteria of DKA include hyperglycemia (blood glucose > 11 mmol/L [198 mg/dL]), venous pH < 7.3 or serum bicarbonate level < 15 mmol/L, and ketonemia (blood β-hydroxybutyrate ≥ 3 mmol/L) or moderate to severe ketonuria. Another serious complication in diabetic patients is extreme hyperglycemia (blood glucose > 33.3 mmol/L [600 mg/dL]), effective serum osmolality > 320 mmol/kg (mOsmol/kg H₂O), venous pH > 7.25, and absent or minimal ketosis, which is defined as hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state (HHS).

Risk factors of DKA include the lack of taking insulin at the right time or omitting it, history of previous episodes of DKA, inability to drink, having diarrhea, lack of medical follow-up, and infections.

The goals of treatment include fluid and electrolyte replacement, as well as correction of acidosis and hyperglycemia. Frequent monitoring of complications such as cerebral edema (CE), venous thrombosis, and acute renal failure, is of paramount importance.

Despite the intracellular and extracellular fluid depletion in DKA, patients have normal or even high blood pressure (BP). Maintaining normal BP is attributed to increased plasma catecholamine concentrations, antidiuretic hormone release, and increased osmotic pressure due to marked hyperglycemia. Measuring the extent of dehydration, which is commonly estimated by physical signs, depends on the examiner's skill. Therefore, it is not always precise. In children, the mortality rate of DKA is 0.15 to 0.30% in developed countries and up to 13.4% in developing countries.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a major acute life‐threatening complication of diabetes, mostly seen in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and less commonly in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). It is usually defined as a metabolic state in which the individual has either a glucose concentration of more than 11.1 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL) at presentation, or has been previously diagnosed with diabetes; they must have a plasma β‐hydroxybutyrate concentration of 3.0 mmol/L or higher, or urine ketones of more than 2+ on a standard urine ketone test‐stick; and a pH less than 7.3 or a serum bicarbonate of less than 15.0 mmol/L. Blood glucose levels may not always be elevated in DKA, a state referred to as euglycaemic ketoacidosis.

DKA results from a relative or absolute deficiency in circulating insulin associated with elevated glucagon. These, in turn, promote the uncontrolled release of free fatty acids that are converted to ketone bodies, resulting in an anion gap acidosis. Acetoacetate, the primary ketone body, is then converted enzymatically to β‐hydroxybutyrate, the predominant circulating ketone body, and non‐enzymatically to acetone, which is exhaled(Figure 1). The reduced peripheral uptake of glucose and increased endogenous glucose production results in marked hyperglycaemia and dehydration. The metabolic acidosis, hypovolaemia, electrolyte disturbance and hyperosmolar state stimulate a counter‐regulatory hormone response increasing insulin resistance and ketogenesis, further exacerbating the metabolic disturbance, resulting in a downward spiral. If left unaddressed this culminates in altered consciousness, cardiovascular collapse, coma and death.

### Prediabetes directly deteriorates into diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome triggered by acute pancreatitis: a case report illustrating a "Chicken and egg" paradigm in ketosis-prone diabetes [^116jvjoy]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Taken together, this patient was diagnosed with DKA and HHS on admission and was triaged into the ICU and started on IV fluids, IV bicarbonate, and IV insulin drip, in accordance with diabetes crisis management guidelines. Of note, the patient also presented with severe hyperkalemia with ECG changes. Hyperkalemia is a common finding in DKA, and is secondary to hypoinsulinemia and renal dysfunction (e.g. acute kidney injury in this case); the hyperkalemia is not due to the previously held opinion that metabolic acidosis causes the exchange of hydrogen ions for potassium ions across cell membranes. The severe anion gap acidosis was corrected by the second day of admission with repeat ABG showing pH 7.42, pCO₂ 31 mmHg, pO₂ 116%, HCO₃⁻ 20.1 mmol/L, SaO₂ 99%, BMP: sodium 145 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, bicarbonate 16 mmol/L, anion gap 19 mmol/L, BUN 24 mg/dL, creatinine 0.77 mg/dL, glucose 366 mg/dL, repeat ECG showed normalized T waves.

The patient also presented with abdominal pain on admission. Initially, this pain was diagnosed as DKA-associated abdominal pain. However, she had persistent abdominal pain despite the closure of the anion gap and correction of DKA and HHS. Additional laboratory tests revealed lipase 720 U/L and amylase 225 U/L, suggesting acute pancreatitis. CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast found mild–moderate right-sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter down to the level of a 6-mm stone in the proximal-mid right ureter without significant pancreatic changes. MRCP showed no biliary or pancreatic duct dilation. Current diagnostic criteria of acute pancreatitis require two out of three of the following criteria: (1) acute abdominal pain and tenderness in the upper abdomen; (2) elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes in the blood or urine; (3) abnormal finding of acute pancreatitis detected by ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Of note, imaging studies are not 100% sensitive and in mild episodes of acute pancreatitis, CT features can range from normal-appearing pancreas to diffuse enlargement and heterogeneous attenuation of the gland. Taken together, this patient was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, although the etiology was initially unknown.

In the wilderness setting, it may be possible to prevent progression to advanced illness with early recognition of ketosis and treatment with subcutaneous insulin and oral hydration/glucose repletion, and symptoms of ketosis, particularly vomiting or a change in mental status, or blood glucose level elevated above 250 mg·dL−1 should prompt ketone monitoring.

### Bicarbonate therapy in severe metabolic acidosis [^115qNaVZ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

The utility of bicarbonate administration to patients with severe metabolic acidosis remains controversial. Chronic bicarbonate replacement is obviously indicated for patients who continue to lose bicarbonate in the ambulatory setting, particularly patients with renal tubular acidosis syndromes or diarrhea. In patients with acute lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis, lactate and ketone bodies can be converted back to bicarbonate if the clinical situation improves. For these patients, therapy must be individualized. In general, bicarbonate should be given at an arterial blood pH of ≤ 7.0. The amount given should be what is calculated to bring the pH up to 7.2. The urge to give bicarbonate to a patient with severe acidemia is apt to be all but irresistible. Intervention should be restrained, however, unless the clinical situation clearly suggests benefit. Here we discuss the pros and cons of bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidosis.

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^112kJ47g]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Sodium bicarbonate for subtypes of metabolic acidosis

Administration of sodium bicarbonate has been considered for DKA not only because sodium bicarbonate reverses the acidotic status but because acidosis possibly contributes to insulin resistance. However, a retrospective single center study from the United States reported that sodium bicarbonate administration in the emergency department was not associated with time to resolution of acidosis in patients with DKA with a pH < 7.0. There was also no difference in hospital length of stay. A systematic review in 2011 found that sodium bicarbonate did not shorten the duration of acidosis, ketosis, or glycemic levels. Furthermore, there was a high incidence of hypokalemia that required correction in patients who received sodium bicarbonate. These findings imply that the beneficial effects of sodium bicarbonate administration for DKA might be limited. However, the systematic review by Chua et al. revealed a lack of rigorous randomized clinical trials that assessed patient-centered outcomes in these patients.

Sodium bicarbonate for lactic acidosis has been compared with saline in two small-scale randomized, crossover, single center trials. Cooper et al. reported that sodium bicarbonate administration increased pH and PCO2 with no change in blood pressure or cardiac output. Similarly, Mathieu et al. found an increase in pH but no change in hemodynamic parameters, including cardiac index.

For cardiac arrest, several observational studies have reported an increase in the rate of return of spontaneous circulation in patients receiving sodium bicarbonate. However, one study found that this treatment was associated with a worse survival rate and neurological outcomes to hospital discharge. A pilot RCT showed no improvement in patient mortality, return of spontaneous circulation rate, or neurologically favorable status in treated patients. At present, routine use of sodium bicarbonate is not recommended for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

3 MIXED DKA/HHS

In HHS there is usually no significant ketosis/ketonaemia (blood ketones ≤ 3.0 mmol/L), although a mild acidosis (pH < 7.3, bicarbonate > 15.0 mmol/L) may accompany those affected by acute kidney injury or severe sepsis. Some people have severe hypertonicity and ketosis and acidosis (mixed DKA and HHS). This situation is likely to reflect a relative insulin deficiency due to beta cell exhaustion as a result of temporary glucotoxicity and excess counter‐regulatory hormone production. These individuals may require a modification of this treatment guideline to take into account which aspect predominates. If a predominant diagnosis is unclear (HHS vs. mixed HHS/DKA), early specialist input should be sought to help tailor management according to the individual's need. However, if ketone concentrations are high (blood ketones > 3.0 mmol/L), then the DKA protocol may be appropriate (Figure 4).

FIGURE 4
The overlap between diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) and how to approach management.

Treat as mixed DKA/HHS if all the following criteria are met: marked hypovolaemia, marked hyperosmolality (osmolality ≥ 320 mOsm/kg), pH < 7.3, bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L and blood ketones > 3.0 mmol/L. Start a Fixed Rate Intravenous Insulin Infusion (FRIII) and IV fluids immediately and treat according to DKA pathway using 0.1 units/kg/h. IV fluid replacement should aim to achieve a positive balance of 3–6 L during the first 12 h and the remaining replacement of estimated fluid loss during the following 12 h, although complete normalisation of biochemistry may take up to 72 h.

### Management of diabetic keto-acidosis in adult patients admitted to intensive care unit: an ESICM-endorsed international survey [^113yJojX]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic keto-acidosis (DKA) is the most common metabolic emergency in patients with diabetes, accounting for almost 10% of hospital admission in patients with diabetes. There is currently an increase in hospital admissions for DKA and although the mortality rate for DKA remains low, ranging from 0.20% in patients with type 1 diabetes to 1.04% in those with type 2 diabetes, it has stopped decreasing over the last decade.

DKA results from relative or absolute insulin deficiency and failure to regulate the effect of the hyperglycemic hormones glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone and catecholamines. The result is the hepatic metabolism of free fatty acids, which generates ketone bodies such as beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia leading to osmotic diuresis, which causes dehydration and water loss, and electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and pseudohyponatremia), and metabolic acidosis linked to the production of ketone bodies. The management of DKA requires fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and correction of metabolic disorders. The provision of continuous insulin therapy and the frequent monitoring and repletion of electrolytes requires critical care expertise and thus patients with DKA are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Guidelines for managing patients with DKA are limited. While the American and British guidelines provide recommendations on fluid resuscitation and suggest isotonic saline as the first option, the supporting evidence is limited, leading to ongoing debate regarding both fluid resuscitation, specifically regarding the use balanced solution to avoid the occurrence of hyperchloremic acidosis. Other heterogeneities in practice are related to insulin therapy, administration of sodium bicarbonate and the management of metabolic disorders.

This international survey aimed to assess current clinical management of adult patients with DKA, focusing on ICU admission criteria, fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and management of metabolic disorders.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^113gXvKb]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Recommendations

All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have their diabetes clearly identified in the medical record. (E)
All patients with diabetes should have an order for blood glucose monitoring, with results available to all members of the health care team. (E)
Goals for blood glucose levels: Critically ill surgical patients' blood glucose levels should be kept as close to 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) as possible and generally < 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l). (A) These patients require an intravenous insulin protocol that has demonstrated efficacy and safety in achieving the desired glucose range without increasing risk for severe hypoglycemia. (E) Critically ill nonsurgical patients' glycemic targets are less well defined. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols targeting blood glucose levels < 110–140 mg/dl have been shown to reduced morbidity and mortality in some, but not all studies. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols that effectively and safely keep blood glucose < 140 mg/dl are recommended. (C) For non–critically ill patients, there is no clear evidence for specific blood glucose goals. Since cohort data suggest that outcomes are better in hospitalized patients with fasting glucose < 126 mg/dl and all random glucoses < 180–200, these goals are reasonable if they can be safely achieved. Insulin is the preferred drug to treat hyperglycemia in most cases. (E) Due to concerns regarding the risk of hypoglycemia, some institutions may consider these blood glucose levels to be overly aggressive for initial targets. Through quality improvement, glycemic goals should systematically be reduced to the recommended levels. (E)
Scheduled prandial insulin doses should be appropriately timed in relation to meals and should be adjusted according to point-of-care glucose levels. The traditional sliding-scale insulin regimens are ineffective as monotherapy and are generally not recommended. (C)
Using correction dose or "supplemental" insulin to correct premeal hyperglycemia in addition to scheduled prandial and basal insulin is recommended. (E)
Glucose monitoring with orders for correction insulin should be initiated in any patient not known to be diabetic who receives therapy associated with high risk for hyperglycemia, including high-dose glucocorticoids therapy, initiation of enteral or parenteral nutrition, or other medications such as octreotide or immunosuppressive medications. (B) If hyperglycemia is documented and persistent, initiation of basal/bolus insulin therapy may be necessary. Such patients should be treated to the same glycemic goals as patients with known diabetes. (E)
A plan for treating hypoglycemia should be established for each patient. Episodes of hypoglycemia in the hospital should be tracked. (E)
All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have an A1C obtained if the result of testing in the previous 2–3 months is not available. (E)
A diabetes education plan including "survival skills education" and follow-up should be developed for each patient. (E)
Patients with hyperglycemia in the hospital who do not have a diagnosis of diabetes should have appropriate plans for follow-up testing and care documented at discharge. (E)

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^112APhXu]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Normal plasma glucose (PG) concentrations — neonates, infants, and children — After the first 48 hours of life, mean PG in the postabsorptive state in normal neonates and in infants and children does not differ from adults at 70–100 mg/dL, although children under age 4 years may have a PG concentration < 70 mg/dL and lethargy and tachycardia in fatty acid oxidation defects are observed when PG decreases to 60–70 mg/dL. In normal newborns shortly after birth, the mean PG threshold for suppression of insulin secretion is ~55–65 mg/dL, compared with ~80–85 mg/dL in older infants, children, and adults; by 72 hours of age PG is similar to older infants and children, therefore the standards for normal neonates must never be extrapolated beyond 2–3 days after birth, and we suggest delaying diagnostic evaluations until 2–3 days after birth.

### Hyperglycemic crisis [^111ek5VT]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemic crisis is a metabolic emergency associated with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus that may result in significant morbidity or death. Acute interventions are required to manage hypovolemia, acidemia, hyperglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and precipitating causes. Despite advances in the prevention and management of diabetes, its prevalence and associated health care costs continue to increase worldwide. Hyperglycemic crisis typically requires critical care management and hospitalization and contributes to global health expenditures.

Objective

Diagnostic and resolution criteria and management strategies for diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic crisis are provided. A discussion of prevalence, mortality, pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management considerations for hyperglycemic crisis are included.

Discussion

Emergency physicians confront the most severe sequelae of uncontrolled diabetes and provide crucial, life-saving management. With ongoing efforts from diabetes societies to incorporate the latest clinical research to refine treatment guidelines, management and outcomes of hyperglycemic crisis in the emergency department continue to improve.

Conclusion

We provide an overview of the evaluation and treatment of hyperglycemic crisis and offer a concise, targeted management algorithm to aid the practicing emergency physician.

### Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized adult patients in non-critical care settings: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115SwnZS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for in-hospital hyperglycemia, more specifically with respect to insulin therapy, ES 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering initial therapy with correctional insulin over scheduled insulin therapy (defined as basal or basal/bolus insulin) to maintain glucose targets in the range of 100–180 mg/dL (5.6–10.0 mmol/L) in adult patients with no prior history of diabetes hospitalized for a non-critical illness and experiencing hyperglycemia (defined as blood glucose > 140 mg/dL; 7.8 mmol/L) during hospitalization. Consider adding scheduled insulin therapy in patients with persistent hyperglycemia (≥ 2 point-of-care blood glucose measurements ≥ 180 mg/dL in a 24-hour period on correctional insulin alone).

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with end-stage renal disease hospitalized with diabetes ketoacidosis [^114uMRcY]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

We suggest a modified approach for fluid replacement in patients with ESRD, preferring a small bolus of 250 mL initially with reassessment after each infusion — particularly if no hypotensive, or just insulin therapy without fluids bolus. Intensive fluid resuscitation during the initial management of DKA usually results in some degree of correction of hyperglycemia due to forced osmotic diuresis. However, hypertonicity in these patients is more a reflection of the degree of hyperglycemia and not due to osmotic diuresis, as previously discussed. It has been proposed that adequate insulin administration alone, with limited or without intravenous fluid resuscitation, may resolve the metabolic disturbances without complications. Current guidelines recommend an insulin infusion with a glucose correction rate of 50–75 mg/dL/hour. Using continuous glucose monitoring on patients with diabetes, Kazempour-Ardebili et al showed lower mean glucose levels by −36 to −190 mg/dL during dialysis days compared with days off dialysis; and Sobngwi et al showed that total daily insulin needs can decrease by ~25% on hemodialysis days. Hence, we suggest a careful and slower rate of hyperglycemia correction, considering the glucose-lowering effect of dialysis and/or potentially avoiding the use of intravenous insulin bolus on starting the insulin infusion, which may decrease the risk of hypoglycemia. However, future studies are needed to determine the best hydration regimen to manage patients with DKA and ESRD to minimize iatrogenic fluid overload.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^111bkuz4]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — Evaluation and initial management of suspected checkpoint inhibitor–associated diabetes mellitus (CIADM) emphasizes vigilance for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and timely workup. The acute risks of DKA from autoimmune beta-cell destruction require vigilance, and new-onset hyperglycemia in a patient with high risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus should raise the level of concern for CIADM. Acute onset of polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and lethargy should be evaluated without delay; urine ketones, acid base status, and electrolytes can be evaluated as screening for DKA and the need for inpatient evaluation. Antibodies, insulin, and C-peptide levels should also be sent to support diagnosis, although the initiation of therapy should not be delayed pending results; insulin should be used to treat hyperglycemia in anyone where the diagnosis is in question. Endocrinology consultation is appropriate even without evidence of DKA, and when outpatient endocrinology consultation is not readily available, hospitalization is appropriate. At this time, no immunosuppressive strategies are approved to treat type 1 diabetes and by extension are not considered to be indicated in CIADM.

### Adjusting sodium levels in patients with hyperglycemia… [^114GTgKZ]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The effect of hyperglycemia is well known for its lowering of serum sodium levels. The most commonly used correction factor is a 1. 6 mEq per L decrease in serum sodium for every 100 mg per dL increase in glucose concentration. Hillier and associates challenged this correction factor in a study that monitored serum sodium levels in a group of otherwise healthy persons who were rendered acutely insulin deficient. Once this glucose level was attained, the dextrose infusion was stopped and regular insulin was given until the glucose concentration was less than 140 mg per dL. Serum sodium and plasma glucose levels were measured three times in three subjects during induction of hyperglycemia. These measurements were obtained in all subjects every 10 minutes once the glucose infusion was stopped and their glucose levels had returned to normal.

This factor is significantly greater than the conventional correction factor. However, the decrease in serum sodium did not actually appear to be a linear value, particularly in volunteers whose glucose concentration was greater than 440 mg per dL. At this level, the slope was about −4. 0, but it dropped to −1. 6 when glucose concentration dropped below 440 mg per dL. The 2. 4 correction factor was slightly inaccurate in the 300 to 500 mg per dL range, but was accurate for values in the more clinically important range of 500 mg per dL or greater. The conventional correction factor underestimated sodium concentration in most cases when the glucose concentration was more than 300 mg per dL, and underestimated almost all measurements when the glucose concentration was more than 500 mg per dL.

The authors conclude that the conventional correction factor used to correct serum sodium in patients with hyperglycemia is inaccurate and leads to serious underestimation of serum sodium values in association with glucose levels higher than 500 mg per dL. Therefore, the authors recommend using 2. 4 as the correction factor to prevent such underestimations, particularly in patients with severe hyperglycemia who require more of a correction.

### Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized adults… [^111Lu2jG]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Although insulin has the best evidence for maintaining glycemic control in hospitalized patients, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors may be equivalent for patients with type 2 diabetes.
- Corrective insulin alone only slightly increases average blood glucose levels vs. basal-bolus insulin and may reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Monitoring Hospitalized Patients For patients without diabetes and those with diabetes controlled without insulin, point-of-care blood glucose testing is recommended. Based on low- or very low-quality evidence, continuous glucose monitoring for patients with insulin-treated diabetes may be more effective than point-of-care blood glucose monitoring alone at preventing hyperglycemia. Based on four randomized trials, continuous glucose monitoring decreases mean daily glucose levels. Continuous glucose monitoring may increase the detection of hypoglycemic events and reduce the time spent in hypoglycemia.

When insulin is used during hospitalization, regimens containing neutral protamine Hagedorn and basal-bolus insulin appear equivalent in preventing hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Glycemic Control Regimens Based on very low-quality evidence of benefit, the guideline recommends that corrective insulin be used to lower blood glucose levels of 140 mg per dL or greater in patients with hyperglyce-mia but not diabetes. In patients with diabetes not treated with insulin, corrective insulin or basal-bolus insulin can be initiated. Basal-bolus insulin is defined as a basal rate of long-acting insulin with boluses for mealtime and correction, whereas corrective insulin is only provided in response to hyperglycemia. In these patients, corrective insulin alone only slightly increases the average blood glucose level vs. basal-bolus insulin and may reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. For patients already treated with insulin, basal-bolus regimens are recommended.

For patients using insulin pump therapy before admission, continuing that therapy reduces hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia compared with shifting to an insulin regimen. Insulin pump therapy requires that patients have a sufficient level of consciousness to maintain their insulin pump settings, and it is not appropriate for patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states. Hospitals must have sufficient expertise in managing insulin pump therapy. Carbohydrate counting during hospitalization has little impact on glycemic control compared with fixed mealtime insulin doses. The Endocrine Society recommends not using carbohydrate counseling in patients not already treated with insulin therapy and using it in insulin-treated patients only if it is beneficial to model an outpatient routine.

As the patient stabilizes, fluids can be lowered to 4 to 14 mL per kg per hour, or 250 to 500 mL per hour. Once the corrected sodium concentration is normal or high, the solution can be changed to saline 0. 45%. Dextrose is added when the glucose level decreases to 200 mg per dL.
4. INSULIN To further correct hyperglycemia, insulin should be added to intravenous fluids one to two hours after fluids are initiated. An initial bolus of 0. 1 units per kg should be given with an infusion of
0. 1 units per kg per hour. DKA is resolved when the glucose level is less than 200 mg per dL, the pH is greater than 7. 3, and the bicarbonate level is 18 mEq per L or higher.
4. If the potassium level is greater than 5. 2 mEq per L, insulin therapy without potassium replacement should be initiated, and serum potassium levels should be checked every two hours. When the potassium level is between 3. 3 and

2 mEq per L, potassium replacement should be initiated. 4 Some guidelines recommend potassium replacement with potassium chloride, whereas others recommend combining it with potassium phosphate or potassium acetate. Clinical trials are lacking to determine which is best, although in the face of phosphate depletion, potassium phosphate is used. BICARBONATE Bicarbonate therapy in persons with DKA is somewhat controversial. Proponents believe that severe acidosis will cause cardiac and neurologic complications. However, studies have not demonstrated improved clinical outcomes with bicarbonate therapy, and treatment has been associated with hypokalemia. In one retrospective quasi-experimental study of 39 persons with DKA and a pH between 6. 9 and
7. 1, there was no difference in outcomes between those who received bicarbonate therapy and those who did not. Current American Diabetes Association guidelines continue to recommend bicarbonate replacement in persons with a pH lower than 6.

9 using 100 mEq of sodium bicarbonate in 400 mL of sterile water with 20 mEq of potassium chloride at a rate of 200 mL per hour for two hours. This should be repeated every two hours until the patient's pH is 6. 9 or greater. 4.
