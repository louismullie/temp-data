## Question

Evaluation of hypergammaglobulin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate hypergammaglobulinemia, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and characterizing it as polyclonal versus monoclonal. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis framework and prioritize likely etiologies by age and clinical context. Next, I will outline targeted diagnostic testing, including when to pursue IgG subclasses, IgG4-related disease workup, and bone marrow evaluation. After that, I need to consider special populations such as pediatrics and patients with renal impairment. Finally, I will synthesize management principles, including when to treat the underlying disease versus when to intervene for hyperviscosity or paraprotein-mediated organ damage, and close with a practical algorithm and follow-up plan.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and its pattern, because I need to ensure we are not reacting to a spurious result or transient post-infectious change; repeating immunoglobulin quantification and pairing serum protein electrophoresis with serum free light chains is the foundation, and I should double-check that both SPEP and sFLC are ordered together when a monoclonal gammopathy is suspected, as recommended by the CAP/ASHP expert panel, with immunofixation used to confirm any suspicious band or abnormal ratio [^113UPp1Z] [^115SXdT5] [^113SYMCU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should distinguish polyclonal from monoclonal patterns on SPEP and integrate sFLC ratio interpretation carefully, because a polyclonal increase shows a broad-based gamma region while a monoclonal spike is discrete, and an abnormal sFLC ratio supports clonality but can be confounded by renal impairment or polyclonal activation, so I need to check renal function before overcalling a ratio elevation as clonal disease [^116oz8hL] [^111YMzom].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis framework for polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia; the Lancet Haematology review organizes causes into eight pragmatic categories — liver disease, autoimmune disease and vasculitis, infection and inflammation, non-hematologic malignancy, hematologic disorders, IgG4-related disease, immunodeficiency syndromes, and iatrogenic causes such as IVIG — so I will use this scaffold to anchor my thinking and avoid premature closure.

> I will now examine likely etiologies by age and context; in adults, liver disease, chronic infections, and autoimmune conditions dominate, whereas in children, autoimmune diseases such as SLE and related disorders are disproportionately represented, so I should adjust my pretest probabilities accordingly and keep a high index of suspicion for autoimmunity in pediatrics with elevated IgG [^117V5GLa] [^112AUZqE] [^115JrtGg].

> Wait, let me verify the role of IgG subclasses and IgG4-related disease; markedly elevated IgG4 above 5 g/L is about 90% specific for IgG4-RD, but mild elevations are nonspecific, and the electrophoretic pattern may show beta–gamma bridging that can mimic biclonal gammopathy, so if suspected, I should order IgG subclasses and consider organ-specific imaging and biopsy to confirm histology per consensus criteria, while remembering that sFLC may be modestly elevated in IgG4-RD without indicating clonal plasma cell disease [^117V5GLa] [^113qSBBo] [^1114vrLW].

> Let me consider infection and inflammation more carefully; IL-6–driven states with persistently high CRP, such as multicentric Castleman disease, can drive robust polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, so I should check CRP and, if markedly elevated, pivot my workup toward inflammatory drivers and potential IL-6–targeted therapy rather than assuming a plasma cell disorder [^117V5GLa].

> I should confirm when to suspect a monoclonal gammopathy superimposed on polyclonal activation; an M-protein greater than 1.5 g/dL, an abnormal sFLC ratio, and immunoparesis of non-involved isotypes increase the risk of progression to multiple myeloma or other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, so I need to check for these features and plan longitudinal surveillance if identified [^112fUv5N] [^112nq2ci] [^11211ca9].

> Next, I should review targeted diagnostic testing; beyond SPEP, sFLC, and immunofixation, I will add CBC, renal and hepatic panels, calcium, and beta-2 microglobulin when a plasma cell disorder is suspected, and I will reserve bone marrow biopsy for patients with significant M-protein, end-organ damage, or diagnostic uncertainty, aligning with hematology guidance and recognizing that not all MGUS requires immediate marrow evaluation [^1166u3sA] [^115r5xW9] [^115bAFP4].

> But wait, what if the patient has renal impairment; I need to ensure I interpret the sFLC ratio using renal-adjusted reference intervals because a mildly increased kappa/lambda ratio up to about 3.1 can occur with reduced GFR or polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, so I should verify creatinine and apply renal-adjusted cutoffs before concluding clonality [^116oz8hL].

> Let me think about pediatrics specifically; in children with IgG levels at or above 2000 mg/dL, nearly half may harbor autoimmune disease, and female sex, leukopenia, anemia, and normal CRP together confer a very high predictive value for autoimmunity, so I should prioritize autoimmune screening and rheumatology referral in this phenotype rather than pursuing malignancy-first pathways [^112AUZqE] [^115JrtGg].

> I should double-check the approach to IgG4-RD mimics; lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia can mimic lymphoma or plasma cell neoplasms, so if the clinical picture fits, I will measure IgG subclasses, look for beta–gamma bridging on SPEP, and pursue tissue diagnosis with IgG4/IgG plasma cell ratio criteria to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate myeloma-directed therapy [^113qSBBo] [^1114vrLW].

> Now, management; for polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, I need to ensure I treat the underlying disease rather than the immunoglobulin level itself, reserving plasmapheresis for symptomatic hyperviscosity or severe immune complex–mediated disease, and for monoclonal gammopathies, I should follow risk-adapted surveillance per MGUS guidelines and escalate to clone-directed therapy if progression or organ damage occurs, including MGRS-specific algorithms when kidney involvement is present [^117V5GLa] [^115CTYvt] [^116ZxBZi].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of IVIG in polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia; IVIG administration can itself raise total IgG and confound interpretation, so I need to check for recent or ongoing IVIG use in the history and, if present, interpret immunoglobulin measurements accordingly to avoid misattribution of causality [^117V5GLa].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missing; confirm hypergammaglobulinemia with repeat testing, classify as polyclonal versus monoclonal with SPEP and sFLC, apply the eight-category differential, tailor testing to age and clinical context, evaluate for IgG4-RD when appropriate, and manage by treating the cause while monitoring for complications such as hyperviscosity or paraprotein-mediated organ damage, adjusting follow-up intensity to the underlying diagnosis and risk of progression [^117V5GLa] [^113UPp1Z].

Hypergammaglobulinemia is defined as an **elevated total serum immunoglobulin level** (IgG, IgA, or IgM) above the laboratory reference range. It can be **monoclonal** — due to a clonal plasma cell or B-cell disorder (e.g. multiple myeloma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, MGUS) — or **polyclonal** — reflecting chronic immune activation from infections, autoimmune diseases, liver disease, or chronic inflammation [^117V5GLa]. Evaluation should start with **SPEP, sFLC, and immunofixation** to distinguish monoclonal from polyclonal patterns, then proceed to targeted tests based on clinical context [^113UPp1Z] [^115SXdT5]. Management is cause-specific: treat the underlying condition, monitor MGUS, and use plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity; prognosis varies with the etiology and response to therapy [^117V5GLa] [^115CTYvt].

---

## Definition and classification

Hypergammaglobulinemia is defined as a **total serum immunoglobulin level above the upper limit of normal** for the relevant laboratory. It is classified as **monoclonal** — a single clone produces a homogeneous immunoglobulin (M-protein) — or **polyclonal** — multiple clones produce heterogeneous immunoglobulins [^113zpJPS].

---

## Causes of hypergammaglobulinemia

### Monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia

Monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia arises from clonal plasma cell or B-cell disorders, including:

- **Multiple myeloma**: Clonal plasma cells produce a monoclonal protein (M-protein) [^115uLPTN].
- **Waldenström macroglobulinemia**: Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma producing monoclonal IgM [^112jiMpa].
- **Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)**: M-protein without end-organ damage [^notfound].
- **Light chain amyloidosis**: Monoclonal light chains deposit in tissues [^notfound].
- **POEMS syndrome**: Paraneoplastic syndrome with monoclonal plasma cell disorder [^notfound].

---

### Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia

Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia reflects chronic immune activation from diverse causes, including:

- **Autoimmune diseases**: Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome [^117V5GLa].
- **Chronic infections**: HIV, hepatitis B/C, tuberculosis, endocarditis [^117V5GLa].
- **Liver disease**: Cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis [^117V5GLa].
- **Chronic inflammatory conditions**: Sarcoidosis, IgG4-related disease [^117V5GLa] [^113qSBBo].
- **Hematologic malignancies**: Hodgkin lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma [^notfound].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Clinical features vary by **cause and immunoglobulin level**:

- **Monoclonal gammopathies**: Bone pain, anemia, hypercalcemia, renal impairment, neuropathy, hyperviscosity [^112jiMpa].
- **Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia**: Fatigue, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, symptoms of underlying disease [^notfound].
- **Hyperviscosity syndrome**: Headache, visual disturbances, bleeding, neurologic deficits (especially with IgM) [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential:

| **Step** | **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) | Detect monoclonal vs polyclonal pattern [^111YMzom] |
| 2 | Serum free light chain assay (sFLC) | Detect free light chains, especially in light chain disease [^113b27Hg] |
| 3 | Immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) | Confirm and type monoclonal protein [^113T26uX] |
| 4 | Quantitative immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM) | Quantify total immunoglobulins [^1132BSSA] |
| 5 | Complete blood count (CBC), renal function, calcium | Assess end-organ involvement [^113T26uX] |
| 6 | Bone marrow biopsy | Evaluate plasma cell infiltration (indicated in monoclonal gammopathies) [^115r5xW9] |
| 7 | Imaging (skeletal survey, MRI, CT) | Detect lytic lesions or organomegaly [^113T26uX] |

---

## Management strategies

Management is **cause-specific**:

- **Monoclonal gammopathies**: Chemotherapy, immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, autologous stem cell transplantation, and targeted therapies (e.g. bortezomib, lenalidomide, daratumumab) [^notfound].
- **Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia**: Treat the underlying condition (e.g. autoimmune disease, infection, liver disease) [^117V5GLa].
- **Hyperviscosity syndrome**: Emergent plasmapheresis to rapidly reduce immunoglobulin levels [^117V5GLa].
- **MGUS**: Observation with periodic monitoring for progression [^115CTYvt].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause**, disease stage, and treatment response. Monoclonal gammopathies vary from indolent (MGUS) to aggressive (multiple myeloma), while polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia generally improves with control of the underlying condition [^117V5GLa].

### Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia: assessment, clinical interpretation, and management [^117V5GLa]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

This Review outlines a practical approach to assessing and managing polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia in adults. Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia is most commonly caused by liver disease, immune dysregulation, or inflammation, but can also provide an important diagnostic clue of rare diseases such as histiocyte disorders, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, Castleman disease, and IgG4-related disease. Causes of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia can be divided into eight categories: liver disease, autoimmune disease and vasculitis, infection and inflammation, non-haematological malignancy, haematological disorders, IgG4-related disease, immunodeficiency syndromes, and iatrogenic (from immunoglobulin therapy). Measuring serum concentrations of C-reactive protein and IgG subclasses are helpful in diagnosis. IL-6-mediated inflammation, associated with persistently elevated C-reactive protein concentrations (≥ 30 mg/L), is an important driver of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia in some cases. Although the presence of markedly elevated serum IgG4 concentrations (> 5 g/L) is around 90% specific for diagnosing IgG4-related disease, mildly elevated serum IgG4 concentrations are seen in many conditions. In most cases, managing polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia simply involves treating the underlying condition. Rarely, however, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia can lead to hyperviscosity, requiring plasmapheresis.

### Evaluation and clinical interpretation of hypergammaglobulinemia E: differentiating atopy from immunodeficiency [^1153LbNo]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Increases in total serum IgE levels can be observed in many diverse conditions, from infection to atopy to primary immunodeficiency. The differentiation of atopy from immunodeficiency most often is made on a clinical basis, after taking findings from history, physical examination, and laboratory studies into consideration. However, total IgE level is neither a sensitive nor a specific diagnostic marker for any particular disease and, therefore, should not be relied on to establish a diagnosis of either atopy or primary immunodeficiency.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^115Dm3Eg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia — definition and initial management: Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) is characterized by reduced immunoglobulin levels due to a medication or a disease process, leading to decreased antibody production or increased antibody loss, and is distinct from primary hypogammaglobulinemia due to inborn errors of immunity/primary immunodeficiencies, which comprise more than 400 inherited disorders. Of note, the distinction between primary HG and SHG can be challenging to make, and we recommend thorough consideration of both primary and secondary causes when evaluating HG. When iatrogenic causes cannot be removed or underlying conditions cannot be reversed, therapeutic options are not clearly delineated but include heightened monitoring for clinical infections, supportive antimicrobials, and in some cases, immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and initial evaluation of patients with waldenströM macroglobulinaemia: a task force from the 8th international workshop on waldenströM macroglobulinaemia [^111ESCNL]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of Waldenström macroglobulinaemia (WM) can be challenging given the variety of signs and symptoms patients can present. Furthermore, once the diagnosis of WM is established, the initial evaluation should be thorough as well as appropriately directed. During the 8th International Workshop for WM in London, United Kingdom, a multi-institutional task force was formed to develop consensus recommendations for the diagnosis and initial evaluation of patients with WM. In this document, we present the results of the deliberations that took place to address these issues. We provide recommendations for history-taking and physical examination, laboratory studies, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy analysis and imaging studies. We also provide guidance on the initial evaluation of special situations, such as anaemia, hyperviscosity, neuropathy, Bing-Neel syndrome and amyloidosis. We hope these recommendations serve as a practical guidance to clinicians taking care of patients with a suspected or an established diagnosis of WM.

### A second look at secondary hypogammaglobulinemia [^117KFWGh]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypogammaglobulinemia is defined as a reduced immunoglobulin level, which can be either primary due to inborn errors of immunity or acquired in the setting of poor antibody production or increased antibody loss. Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) should be considered in patients with a history of immunosuppressive therapy, transplant, protein loss syndromes, certain autoimmune conditions, and malignancies, as it can be associated with increased infectious risk. Appropriate history and lab-based screening in these populations can identify SHG allowing treatment and close monitoring as appropriate. Ideally, treatment focuses on control of the underlying condition or removal of iatrogenic causes of SHG. However, in many cases, treatment of the underlying condition does not reverse SHG or immunosuppressive therapy cannot be discontinued without significant risk to the patient. For these patients, strategies for risk mitigation against infectious complications include vaccination, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. This report aims to summarize the existing and emerging data in the evaluation and management of SHG and highlight areas that require further investigation.

The initial evaluation of the patient with Waldenström macroglobulinemia can be challenging. Not only is it a rare disease, but the clinical features can vary greatly from patient to patient. In this article, we aim at providing concise and practical recommendations for the initial evaluation of patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia, specifically regarding history taking, physical examination, laboratory testing, bone marrow aspiration, and biopsy evaluation and imaging studies. We then review the most common special clinical situations seen in patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia, especially anemia, hyperviscosity, cryoglobulinemia, peripheral neuropathy, extramedullary disease, Bing-Neel syndrome, and amyloidosis.

### Hypergammaglobulinemia in the pediatric population as a marker for underlying autoimmune disease: a retrospective cohort study [^112AUZqE]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Significant hypergammaglobulinemia is relatively uncommon among children, with fewer than 500 patients identified with non-iatrogenic IgG levels over 2000 mg/dl at a large, tertiary care children's hospital over the course of a decade. A significant number of these children were diagnosed with a relatively limited number of serious but treatable conditions. Though the differential diagnosis of a serum IgG level above 2000 mg/dl in children is similar to that described in adults, there are important differences. In particular, autoimmunity is significantly more highly represented, while liver disease and malignancy are relatively infrequent causes of high IgG levels in children. There should be a high index of suspicion for underlying autoimmune disease in pediatric patients with high IgG levels and no clear infectious or malignant process. This risk of an autoimmune disease may be further quantified on the basis of gender, white blood cell count, hemoglobin level and CRP.

Assessing the strength of recommendations — development of recommendations required that the panel review identified evidence and make key judgments, including determining significant findings for each key question or outcome and determining any regulatory requirements and/or evidence that support a specific action. The overall strength of evidence for each key question or outcome is graded as High, Moderate, Low, and Very Low, and the strength of recommendations is designated as Strong or Conditional. According to the GRADE approach, the strength of a recommendation demonstrates the extent to which an EP is confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh undesirable effects, with strong recommendations indicating high confidence that desirable effects outweigh undesirable effects, and conditional recommendations reflecting more central or dispersed judgments indicating lower confidence.

### IgG4-related disease: what a hematologist needs to know [^1114vrLW]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia

As for eosinophilia, IgG4-RD represents an important new diagnostic consideration in patients with hypergammaglobulinemia. An elevated serum IgG4 level, often accompanied by an increase in IgG1, causes polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Rarely, this elevation can be sufficient to result in polyclonal hyperviscosity syndrome. It is not known what causes the exuberant production of IgG4 immunoglobulins, currently considered an epiphenomenon rather than a contributor to the pathogenesis of the disease. Not surprisingly, the serum free light chains tend to be abnormally elevated. IgE is often markedly increased, particularly in patients with eosinophilia and atopy, whereas IgA and IgM levels are normal or modestly elevated. Serum IgG4 typically runs in the fast gamma or beta-gamma region on the serum protein electrophoresis, and thus the typical electrophoretic profile of a patient with IgG4-RD demonstrates polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia with beta-gamma bridging. This sometimes prominent pattern is dependent on IgG4 concentration and is highlighted in Figure 3. The hypergammaglobulinemia can be mistaken for a polyclonal increase in IgA, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or "biclonal" IgG kappa and lambda gammopathy, as laboratory physicians may not be familiar with the dense bands of IgG-lambda and kappa which in fact represent polyclonal IgG4. Some patients have even been treated for myeloma before subsequently being found to have IgG4-RD as the cause of their protein abnormalities, plasmacytosis and renal disease. Laboratory physicians must, therefore, consider the differential diagnosis of beta-gamma bridging and order or suggest additional investigations to clarify clonality and heavy chain composition where necessary.

### IgG4-related disease: what a hematologist needs to know [^113qSBBo]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Key points

IgG4-RD is an important cause of eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Hematologists should include IgG4-RD in the differential diagnosis of these abnormalities.
Other common manifestations of IgG4-RD include autoimmune pancreatitis, obstructive jaundice, orbital pseudotumor, lacrimal and salivary gland swelling, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and tubulointerstitial nephritis.
Serum protein electrophoresis and IgG subclass evaluation should be performed in patients with suspected IgG4-RD. Serum IgG4 levels are elevated in approximately 70% of cases. Mildly increased serum IgG4 (1.5–5 g/L) is a non-specific finding, but a markedly elevated level (> 5 g/L) is 90% specific for IgG4-RD.
A firm diagnosis requires histological confirmation based on the International Consensus Criteria which include a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis. There must be an increased number of IgG4 + plasma cells with an IgG4:IgG plasma cell ratio > 40%.
Early recognition and diagnosis are essential because patients typically respond well to steroids or rituximab in the early stages of the disease, but fibrotic disease and late complications such as chronic pancreatitis are often irreversible.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^113Hdf2T]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Summary of previously published literature — multiple myeloma (MM) states that SHG and infections with encapsulated bacteria are common in MM, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of IgG-RT; for evaluation, immune evaluation is recommended in the setting of severe or recurrent infections; vaccines are recommended per CDC and Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance for immunocompromised patients; for management, IgG-RT may provide benefit for those with decreased IgG and attenuated antibody responses, but decisions should reflect concurrent treatments because previous studies have shown variable results between treatments; randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether and when IgG-RT may provide benefit.

Screening and monitoring in secondary hypogammaglobulinemia — general considerations emphasize core laboratory assessments. The figure notes that "At a minimum, screening and monitoring should include an IgG level", that "Non-Ig immunoglobulins and specific antibody responses have also been recommended because IgG levels alone do not indicate normal B-cell function", and that "Lymphocyte subsets for B-cell enumeration and peripheral B-cell flow cytometry for phenotyping can be considered, particularly in patients about to receive or receiving immunosuppressants". It also states that "Additional studies are needed to clearly define which patient populations benefit from screening and monitoring as well as the timing of and the laboratories to include in screening and monitoring".

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^111gLqbE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

General evaluation and screening in hypogammaglobulinemia (HG) state that when HG is discovered it is important to clarify whether it is primary or secondary; therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) with non-plasma replacement fluid depletes immunoglobulins, with studies showing an approximately 63% decline in IgG levels after one exchange, and whether decreases in IgE due to TPE increase infection susceptibility remains inconclusive. Reviewing the history for prior TPE is important because indications span neurologic, hematologic, and renal conditions. Screening for HG before immunosuppressive treatments are initiated or when conditions known to cause SHG are diagnosed is highlighted, and in line with society guidelines, general recommendations for screening would be to obtain baseline immunoglobulin levels at the time of diagnosis of conditions associated with SHG, and before the initiation of immunosuppressive medications.

### Immunodeficiencies in adults: key considerations for diagnosis and management [^111WMqfy]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Workup for Suspected Immunodeficiency

When immunodeficiency is clinically suspected, investigations should begin with a detailed patient history and thorough physical examination. The history should assess recurrent, severe, or unusual infections, the age of onset, response to antibiotics or prophylactic treatments, and any history of chronic inflammatory, autoimmune, or allergic manifestations. A family history suggestive of IEI, the presence of comorbidities that could lead to SID, past and current medications, and prior immune evaluations must be reviewed. Finally, vaccination records and symptoms suggestive of hematologic malignancies or other occult neoplasia should be assessed. Physical examination should look for signs of chronic infections, autoimmune disorders, or systemic immune dysfunction, including splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, malnutrition, signs of chronic lung or gastrointestinal diseases and skin abnormalities.

Investigations should be completed with a laboratory workup. A reasonable, two-step approach is described in Table 3.

Laboratory workup for clinically suspected immunodeficiency

Additional autoimmunity testing (e.g. Antinuclear Antibody (ANA), Extractable Nuclear Antigen (ENA)) can be considered when clinical suspicion of immune dysregulation exists but is not part of the systematic first-line evaluation

CC On a case-by-case basis

The first step, which can be conducted by a primary care physician, includes the evaluation of secondary causes, as well as of a full blood count and total serum immunoglobulin levels. Step two includes a more in-depth evaluation of cellular and humoral immunity, as well as the complement activity. This step should ideally be interpreted by an immunologist or immunodeficiency specialist. Investigations are tailored to each case and may include IgG subclass analysis, lymphocyte proliferation assay, neutrophil function test, and genetic screening. In specific situations, baseline lung functions and chest CT imaging should be considered to evaluate for interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, or thymoma.

Abnormal quantitative results for serum immunoglobulins or blood cell count may transiently occur during acute infection. Therefore, it is generally recommended to wait 4 to 6 weeks after the resolution of last acute infection before performing an immunodeficiency assessment. An unremarkable baseline biological workup does not exclude an underlying immunodeficiency, particularly in patients suffering from recurrent, severe, or unusual infections. If clinical suspicion remains high despite normal initial results, referral to an immunology specialist for further evaluation and long-term follow-up is warranted.

### Hypergammaglobulinemia in the pediatric population as a marker for underlying autoimmune disease: a retrospective cohort study [^114j8Zop]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia in adult patients is most frequently related to liver disease, malignancy, autoimmune disease, or infection. The differential diagnosis and clinical significance of hypergammaglobulinemia have not been similarly well defined in children. Malignancies and autoimmunity are much less common in children compared to the adult population, and therefore the implications of an elevated immunoglobulin level in pediatric patients may be different than in adults. Nonetheless, in one study of children with prolonged fever of unknown origin, elevated gamma globulin levels were associated with an ultimate diagnosis of autoimmune disease. In contrast, other more common tests such as blood counts and urinalysis were of comparatively little value in determining the cause of a protracted, unexplained fever.

In children with cryptogenic inflammation, the presence of hypergammaglobulinemia might have clinical implications that hint at diagnosis and/or prognosis. Autoimmune conditions in particular may be difficult to diagnose in children due to their infrequency in the pediatric population and the variability of clinical presentation. We hypothesized that hypergammaglobulinemia might aid in the diagnosis of these conditions. In this study, we examined a cohort of patients treated at a tertiary care children's hospital over a 10 year period who were found to have significantly elevated IgG levels. We sought to determine diagnoses associated with hypergammaglobulinemia, and to identify risk factors for the presence of autoimmune disease.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) — definition, evaluation, and referral are clarified: "HG by itself is a laboratory definition (with a cutoff that varies with age and between different laboratories) and does not necessarily indicate a clinically symptomatic syndrome". Because "IgG levels alone do not measure B-cell function, and antibody function and vaccine responses need to be evaluated and taken into consideration", "If SHG is uncovered, referral to a clinical immunologist can be considered to aid in these evaluations (Fig 2)".

### IgG4-related disease: what a hematologist needs to know [^112VDEbx]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

IgG4-RD is an important condition for hematologists to recognize, both because of its common hematologic manifestations of lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, as well as its overlap with other hematologic inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. When IgG4-RD is suspected, measurement of serum IgG subclasses is a simple, non-invasive screening test; levels > 5 g/L (normal < 1.35 g/L) are highly suspicious for IgG4-RD. Regardless of serum IgG4 level, the definitive diagnosis requires histology, preferably in an affected organ other than lymph node or bone marrow, to confirm IgG4-RD and to exclude its many mimics. Early recognition and treatment with steroids, rituximab, or other immunosuppressive therapies, is essential to prevent complications such as fibrosis, periaortitis, and renal failure.

In patients with a history of recurrent, severe, or unusual infections, criteria include IgG < 700 mg/dL with associated non-IgG HG and suboptimal responses to vaccination or isolated IgG < 400 mg/dL (a cutoff of 400 mg/dL has been suggested in SOT and hematologic malignancy); management includes a trial of prophylactic antibiotics followed by an IgG replacement therapy (IgG-RT) trial. If isolated IgG < 150 mg/dL, shared decision making about IgG-RT trial is advised; otherwise, monitor clinically and repeat laboratories every 6 months. The IgG-RT trial lists a typical starting dose 400–600 mg/kg/mo using intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG), with serum IgG checked 3 months after starting IgG-RT (trough before fourth dose if IVIG) to adjust dosing, and a starting goal trough > 800 mg/dL. Ongoing follow-up includes periodic assessments every 6–12 months, consideration of pausing IgG-RT if immunosuppression is discontinued (9–12 months after discontinuation of BCTT) or the SHG-associated condition is treated, and re-evaluation of immune function about 3–4 months after pausing IgG-RT.

### Hypergammaglobulinemia in the pediatric population as a marker for underlying autoimmune disease: a retrospective cohort study [^115JrtGg]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The significance of hypergammaglobulinemia as a marker of immune activation is unknown, as a differential diagnosis for hypergammaglobulinemia in children has not been adequately established. The goal of this study was to identify conditions associated with hypergammaglobulinemia in children, with the hypothesis that elevated immunoglobulin levels may precede or predict the development of autoimmune conditions.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records for all children with IgG level ≥ 2000 mg/dL treated at a tertiary care children's hospital from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2009. We compared clinical and laboratory features of these patients, and developed an algorithm to predict the likelihood of underlying autoimmunity based on these characteristics.

Results

After excluding children who had received IVIG, a total of 442 patients with hypergammaglobulinemia were identified. Of these, nearly half had autoimmune conditions, most frequently systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus-related disorders. Autoimmune gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease were also common. Infectious diseases were the next largest category of diseases, followed with much less frequency by malignant, drug-related, and other conditions. In comparison with non-autoimmune conditions, patients with autoimmune disease had higher IgG levels, lower white blood cell counts, lower hemoglobin values, and lower C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Multivariable logistic regression confirmed that CRP (P = 0.002), white blood cell count (P < 0.001), hemoglobin (P = 0.015), and female gender (P < 0.001) are independent risk factors for autoimmune disease in patients with high IgG levels.

Conclusions

In a cohort of pediatric patients at a tertiary care children's hospital, hypergammaglobulinemia was most commonly associated with autoimmune diseases. In female patients with hypergammaglobulinemia, the presence of leukopenia, anemia, and normal CRP was 95% predictive of underlying autoimmune disease.

### Hypergammaglobulinemia in the pediatric population as a marker for underlying autoimmune disease: a retrospective cohort study [^1177R1ET]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

We present here the largest study of children with elevated serum levels of IgG. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to compile an inclusive differential diagnosis for hypergammaglobulinemia in the pediatric population. The vast majority (almost 95%) of patients in our study had identifiable disorders that could explain their hypergammaglobulinemia, and these conditions could be subdivided into clinically relevant categories. Of these, autoimmune/autoinflammatory disorders were by far the most common.

Hypergammaglobulinemia is well-recognized as a key feature of SLE and lupus-related conditions. The diffuse B cell activation and autoantibody production that is characteristic of SLE is also central to disease pathogenesis. Both MCTD and Sjogren's syndrome are thought to have related pathogenic mechanisms. SLE and MCTD were the most common diseases observed in this study, representing 17% of the children with hypergammaglobulinemia. While other rheumatologic conditions, such as forms of juvenile arthritis, were also diagnosed relatively frequently, the number with SLE and MCTD was disproportionate to the overall prevalence of these disorders in the pediatric population (approximately 3–12 per 100,000, less than 1/4 of the prevalence of juvenile arthritis). Autoimmune conditions of the gastrointestinal tract were also common, in particular inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune hepatitis.

The infectious conditions associated with high IgG levels also fell into distinct categories. Chronic respiratory infections, such as those seen in patients with CF, were the most common infection associated with high IgG levels. Hypergammaglobulinemia was first noted in CF patients almost 40 years ago, and IgG levels correlate with disease progression. Streptococcal-associated conditions were also common in our cohort, particularly non-suppurative complications of streptococcal infection (rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and post-streptococcal arthritis). Hypergammaglobulinemia has long been noted in patients with acute rheumatic fever, and was described at almost the same time that IgG was first characterized. While IgG levels do not seem to correlate with severity of disease, hypergammaglobulinemia may help distinguish active rheumatic fever from inactive rheumatic heart disease. The reason for the uniquely potent serologic response to streptococcal infections is unclear, though streptococcus has a propensity for causing a wide variety of post-infectious sequelae. Among these, Henoch-Schonlein purpura and polyarteritis nodosum were identified only rarely in the present cohort.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^1178bvzQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) is characterized by reduced immunoglobulin levels due to acquired causes of decreased antibody production or increased antibody loss. Clarification regarding whether the hypogammaglobulinemia is secondary or primary is important because this has implications for evaluation and management. Prior receipt of immunosuppressive medications and/or presence of conditions associated with SHG development, including protein loss syndromes, are histories that raise suspicion for SHG. In patients with these histories, a thorough investigation of potential etiologies of SHG reviewed in this report is needed to devise an effective treatment plan focused on removal of iatrogenic causes (eg, discontinuation of an offending drug) or treatment of the underlying condition (eg, management of nephrotic syndrome). When iatrogenic causes cannot be removed or underlying conditions cannot be reversed, therapeutic options are not clearly delineated but include heightened monitoring for clinical infections, supportive antimicrobials, and in some cases, immunoglobulin replacement therapy. This report serves to summarize the existing literature regarding immunosuppressive medications and populations (autoimmune, neurologic, hematologic/oncologic, pulmonary, posttransplant, protein-losing) associated with SHG and highlights key areas for future investigation.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) definitions and severity criteria propose that adult hypogammaglobulinemia (HG) be defined as a serum IgG level below 700 mg/dL with stratification into 400 to 699 mg/dL, 200 to 399 mg/dL, and 0 to 199 mg/dL; age-appropriate pediatric reference ranges should be considered. To characterize persistence, SHG duration can be categorized as lasting 3 to 6 months, 6 to 12 months, 12 to 24 months, and more than 24 months. Severe infection is proposed as requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, or antibiotic/antiviral/antifungal therapy for treatment, and recurrent infection is proposed per Jeffrey Modell Foundation criteria as 4 or more new ear infections, 2 or more serious sinus infections, 2 or more pneumonias, and 2 or more deep-seated infections including septicemia.

### Are we forgetting to carry out serum protein electrophoresis as part of diagnosis workup? [^111YMzom]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Serum protein electrophoresis. The numbers represent the electrophoretic run of different patients. When the sample is applied and the electric current is turned on, the serum proteins migrate differentially. Then, they are fixed and stained in blue. The most stained band is albumin, followed by alpha 1 globulin, alpha 2 globulin, beta globulin and gamma globulin. Column 6 shows a normal pattern of gamma globulin intensity and width. Column 7 is from the case reported, showing a marked reduction in the gamma globulin region. Column 8 was obtained from a patient with a monoclonal peak just after the beta globulin band and reduced gamma region. Column 3 displays a polyclonal gamma globulin augmentation (polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia). After staining, the results are read by spectrometry to quantify each band

Immunoglobulin A, G and M dosages were significantly reduced. IgA was 40 mg/dl (normal values: 70 to 400 mg/dL) while IgG was 270 mg/dL (normal values: 700 to 1600 mg/dL) and IgM was 25 mg/dl (normal values: 40 to 230 mg/dL). Peripheral blood lymphocyte count performed through flow cytometry showed B lymphocyte decrease to 2.12% (normal values: 5 to 15%). The CD4 count was 539 cells/µl (normal values: 410 to 1590 cells/µl), whereas that of CD8 was 1101 cells/µl (normal values: 190 to 1140 cells/µl). Therefore, the CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.47 (normal values: 0.9 to 2.6). The percentage of NK lymphocytes was 7.36% (normal values: 5 to 15%).

After confirming the CVID diagnosis, the patient missed follow-up again and returned two years later, complaining of epigastric pain. EGD and biopsies revealed poorly differentiated intestinal type gastric adenocarcinoma in the posterior wall of the gastric body. He was operated on, but did not tolerate the chemotherapy and passed away one year after the surgery, due to pneumonia and septic shock.

### Association of immunoglobulin levels, infectious risk, and mortality with rituximab and hypogammaglobulinemia [^114MoNsw]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Overall, our data suggest an increased risk of infections and mortality associated with hypogammaglobulinemia after rituximab therapy and highlight the importance of monitoring patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, with immunoglobulin levels determined before and after rituximab therapy. As the use of rituximab continues to increase, it is important for clinicians to be aware of hypogammaglobulinemia associated with the drug. Prior to initiation of rituximab, we recommend routinely checking immunoglobulin levels and baseline B-cell numbers to evaluate for underlying immunodeficiency. If hypogammaglobulinemia is uncovered, we recommend close monitoring for clinical infections and monitoring of laboratory values, with consideration of referral to a clinical immunologist for further evaluation. After completion of rituximab therapy, we recommend periodic laboratory monitoring to identify patients with persistent immune dysfunction who may benefit from IgR.

### What Do the elevated protein levels mean in my patients with myeloma, amyloidosis, and related disorders? [^115uLPTN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple myeloma, light chain amyloidosis, and other plasma cell dyscrasias are characterized, in part, by abnormal production of paraproteins that are often responsible for the sequelae of those diseases. These paraproteins are whole or fragmented immunoglobulins produced by clonal antibody-secreting cells (usually plasma cells, but occasionally, B lymphocytes). Significant heterogeneity exists in the presentation of these diseases, ranging from incidental detection of a monoclonal protein in an asymptomatic patient, to life-threatening manifestations that require urgent diagnostic confirmation and intervention. Successful management of such scenarios requires a fundamental understanding of the laboratory assays at one's disposal, their role in the workup of paraproteinemias, and the interpretation thereof.

### How I treat common variable immune deficiency [^115oTz18]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency is a rare immune deficiency, characterized by low levels of serum immunoglobulin G, A, and/or M with loss of antibody production. The diagnosis is most commonly made in adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years, but both children and older adults can be found to have this immune defect. The range of clinical manifestations is broad, including acute and chronic infections, inflammatory and autoimmune disease, and an increased incidence of cancer and lymphoma. For all these reasons, the disease phenotype is both heterogeneous and complex. Contributing to the complexity is that patient cohorts are generally small, criteria used for diagnosis vary, and the doses of replacement immune globulin differ. In addition, routines for monitoring patients over the years and protocols for the use of other biologic agents for complications have not been clarified or standardized. In the past few years, data from large patient registries have revealed that both selected laboratory markers and clinical phenotyping may aid in dissecting groups of subjects into biologically relevant categories. This review presents my approach to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with common variable immunodeficiency, with suggestions for the use of laboratory biomarkers and means of monitoring patients.

### WaldenströM macroglobulinemia treatment algorithm 2018 [^112jiMpa]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Waldenström macroglobulinemia is often an indolent disorder, and many patients are candidates for observation with careful monitoring. For symptomatic patients, one must distinguish between those patients whose symptoms are related to immunologic manifestations associated with the IgM monoclonal protein and those that have symptoms related to progressive marrow and nodal infiltration with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. In Waldenström macroglobulinemia, the driver for therapy in the majority of patients is progressive anemia, secondary to bone marrow replacement by lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Recent introduction of MYD88 mutational analysis has been very useful for diagnostic purposes but is unclear what effect it might have on the prognosis or response rate to therapy. An algorithm is provided on the management of asymptomatic individuals and the sequence used for chemotherapeutic intervention of symptomatic patients.

### Primary immunodeficiency or not? Making the correct diagnosis [^115jF5Sz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Making a correct diagnosis of a primary immunodeficiency disease is crucial for the selection of proper therapy. Although many cases go undiagnosed, there are also many instances of incorrect diagnosis that result in years of inappropriate treatment and failure to implement beneficial treatment. This article summarizes 2 actual cases in which incorrect diagnoses led to recommendations of unwarranted high-risk or costly treatments. Had the physicians chosen tests of immune function rather than relying on immunoglobulin levels or cell counts, they would have arrived at the true diagnoses.

### Hypogammaglobulinaemia [^11368A4w]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

This article reviews the primary immunodeficiencies that result in hypogammaglobulinemia or predominantly antibody deficiency disorders. This group makes up the largest proportion of patients with primary immunodeficiency. Significant advances have been made in understanding the molecular basis and clinical characteristics of patients with the more severe forms of antibody deficiency in the last 6 years. Recognition of these disorders remains poor with significant diagnostic delay. The milder forms of antibody deficiency disorders, especially those with normal total serum immunoglobulin G levels, remain poorly characterized and understood. Further work remains to be done in understanding and recognizing these syndromes to benefit patient care and foster further knowledge of the immune system.

### Cancer risk and gammopathies in 2123 adults with gaucher disease type 1 in the international gaucher group gaucher registry [^112JnbqW]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

The cumulative incidence of polyclonal gammopathy was about 5% by 50 years of age. Cumulative incidence may be lower among patients who began treatment within 5 years of GD1 diagnosis, although caution is warranted since the multivariable‐adjusted model did not confirm this result. The incidence of polyclonal gammopathies reported across six previous GD studies ranges from 14% to 64%. The largest study (N = 507) found an incidence of 14% and 25% in treated and untreated GD patients with ≥ 2 years of data, respectively; among treated patients, incidence of polyclonal gammopathies decreased significantly per year of ERT, but not for monoclonal gammopathies. Our low cumulative incidence of polyclonal gammopathy likely reflects the effect of GD‐specific treatment and limited information about pre‐treatment immunoglobulin concentrations in many of our patients. Assessing the risk of MGUS or MM in patients with polyclonal gammopathy is not possible due to the assessment as a "one‐time" event which may change with GD treatment.

In the setting of lipid antigenic stimulation, polyclonal activation of B cells and polyclonal gammopathy occur initially. This type of hypergammaglobulinemia reverses with ERT. Unabated lipid antigenic stimulation leads to MGUS, which is not likely to be eliminated once developed. Early studies do suggest, however, that lipid‐reactive M spike decreases significantly with SRT. Our findings of markedly increased risk of B cell malignancies and precursor MGUS in GD1 have been recapitulated in murine GD1 models. As in preliminary studies of human GD1 and MGUS, SRT with GCS inhibitor (Genz‐161) aids in ameliorating B cell malignancies in murine GD1 models, validating a long‐held view on the role of glycosphingolipids in driving carcinogenesis. If MGUS develops because of antigenic stimulation to lysolipids and B cell activation, then early initiation of GD treatment may abrogate the exposure to lysolipids and reduce the risk of MGUS. In a study of 63 patients of whom 50 received ERT, no patients developed MGUS during ERT and immunoglobulin levels either decreased or remained stable in patients with and without monoclonal gammopathy. Encouragingly, SRT (eliglustat) in a GD mouse model reduced disease‐associated gammopathy. The effects of eliglustat on GD patients with existent MGUS are still unknown, although anecdotal reports exist of MGUS concentrations decreasing. Eliglustat is also highly effective in reducing plasma concentrations of lyso‐GL1 in patients with GD, a potential antigen for the development of monoclonal antibodies.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of increasing significance: time to screen? [^1163z5bT]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy (MG) is a frequently detected clonal B-cell or plasma-cell disorder. Importantly, every multiple myeloma (MM) case is preceded by MG. Although clinical algorithms now allow earlier treatment of patients with biomarkers of malignancy before MM-induced tissue damage (CRAB) occurs, most patients are still diagnosed late. It is important to revisit how MG should be managed in clinical practice and whether screening is required. As the prevalence of MG and other medical co-morbidities both rise with increasing age, the degree of contribution of MG to disease states other than malignant progression is often unclear. This can lead to monitoring lapses and under recognition of the organ dysfunction that can occur with monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS). Therefore, models of progression to MM and/or MGCS require further refinement. While MG is currently detected incidentally, a case for screening has been made with ongoing studies in this area. Screening has the potential benefit of earlier detection and prevention of both MGCS and delayed MM presentations, but important drawbacks include the psychosocial impact on individuals and resource burden on healthcare services. MG terminology should transition alongside our increasing understanding of the condition and genomic characterization that have already begun to revise the MG nomenclature. The biology of MG has been poorly understood and is often inferred from the biology of MM, which is unhelpful. We review the literature and case for MG screening in this paper. In particular, we highlight areas that require focus to establish screening for MG.

### Screening for and diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy [^113zpJPS]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy is a spectrum of disorders characterised by clonal proliferation of plasma cells or lymphocytes, which produce abnormal immunoglobulin or its components (monoclonal proteins). Monoclonal gammopathies are often categorised as low-tumour-burden diseases (eg, amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis), premalignant disorders (such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smouldering multiple myeloma), and malignancies (eg, multiple myeloma and Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia). Such diversity of concentration and structure makes monoclonal protein a challenging clonal marker. This article provides an overview on initial laboratory testing of monoclonal gammopathy to guide clinicians and laboratory professionals in the selection and interpretation of appropriate investigations.

### Laboratory clues to immunodeficiency; missed chances for early diagnosis? [^114GHXNU]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Primary immunodeficiency is seen in an estimated one in 1200 people, and secondary immunodeficiency is increasingly common, particularly with the use of immunosuppresion, cancer therapies and the newer biological therapies such as rituximab. Delays in the diagnosis of immunodeficiency predictably lead to preventable organ damage. Examples of abnormal pathology tests that suggest immunodeficiency from all laboratory specialities are given, where vigilant interpretation of abnormal results may prompt earlier diagnosis. If immunodeficiency is suspected, suggested directed testing could include measuring immunoglobulins, a lymphocyte count and T-cell and B-cell subsets.

### IgG4-related disease: what a hematologist needs to know [^1154sTWD]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic immune-mediated disease that may present with tumefactive lesions, fibrosis, and a polyclonal IgG4-positive (IgG4 +) plasma cell-enriched infiltrate in nearly any anatomic site. In many centers, systemic therapy is guided by rheumatologists, yet nearly every medical, surgical and pathology specialty must be aware of this entity and its protean manifestations. Involvement of blood-forming and lymphoid organs, manifesting as lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, is common and IgG4-RD often mimics other hematologic conditions such as multicentric Castleman disease, lymphoma, plasma cell neoplasms, and hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES). This review provides an overview of IgG4-RD with a focus on aspects most relevant to clinical hematology practice.

### Calculated globulin (CG) as a screening test for antibody deficiency [^113TkWKo]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Some laboratories could also choose to cascade directly on discovery of a low CG, adding immunoglobulins and SEP as deemed appropriate; however, this may be hampered by the frequent lack of clinical data on the request form and the requesting clinician may be in the best position to make the most informed decision, potentially also limiting costs.

With increasing pressure on health resources, the removal of total protein has been advocated on cost grounds. As part of the process of test profile harmonization and demand management it has been suggested that 'its inclusion is more as an opportunistic screening test for monoclonal gammopathy, but no specific intervention exists other than watchful waiting'.

Data from the current study, however, argue that the range of disorders for which additional information is gained is wider than monoclonal gammopathy (Table 1); in particular, when defined cut-offs are in place, there are clear treatment advances for multiple myeloma, clinically important monoclonal bands are detected with a low CG and screening criteria are fulfilled for both primary and secondary antibody deficiency. In addition, testing costs must be evaluated in the context of the complete patient pathway, the utility losses associated with delay in the diagnosis of patients, the benefits associated with accurate immunological testing and the potentially increased use of health resources if the test is not performed. Where the test is already being performed it would seem reasonable to obtain best value for money by education regarding its use at both ends of the reference range.

With the introduction of multiple new effective therapeutic options for the treatment of macroglobulinemia, a structured approach to management of this rare lymphoma is currently needed. A review of phase II and III treatment trials over the past 20 years was performed, and high-quality trials are summarized in this manuscript. Because of the lack of large prospective trials comparing different classes of therapy, a uniform recommendation applicable to all patients cannot be made, and the approach must be individualized incorporating patient preferences, comorbidities, and the range of therapeutic toxicities. Therapeutic options for patients with newly diagnosed and previously treated macroglobulinemia are presented on the basis of the best available evidence in the literature.

Discussion

Assessment of the BM plays a key role in differentiating patients presenting with MGUS from SMM and MM and for prognostication in all groups –. The clinical presentations of patients with SMM and MM are variable, with clinical and laboratory signs guiding physicians on the need for more invasive investigation with BM or advanced imaging. However, the prevalence of MGUS increases with age, seen in 8.7% of patients above the age of 80. At presentation, nearly three-quarters of MGUS patients are low-risk or low-intermediate risk, and with increasingly sensitive techniques for screening for MGUS, that proportion will increase. It was our hypothesis (and a part of consensus guidelines) that performing a BM and advanced imaging in all patients is unnecessary.

We demonstrate that only 0.3% of patients with MM present without myeloma defining events other than excessive BM plasmacytosis. The vast majority (98.7%) of MM patients presented with some objective abnormality in CRAB features or with a markedly elevated ratio of involved-to-uninvolved FLC. More often, CRAB type abnormalities are the initial triggers for physicians to identify a monoclonal protein. Among such patients a BM with genetic risk assessment is mandatory to prognosticate the MM.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, more specifically with respect to follow-up, BSH 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain appropriate blood tests (CBC, creatinine, serum calcium, paraprotein, and serum free light chain levels) 6 months after diagnosis and annually thereafter in patients with newly diagnosed MGUS. Consider extending the interval in low-risk MGUS and reducing further investigations in patients with a short life expectancy.

### Are renal reference intervals required when screening for plasma cell disorders with serum free light chains and serum protein electrophoresis? [^116oz8hL]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Renal impairment and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia may abnormally increase the serum free light chain (sFLC) ratio, giving false-positive results with current reference intervals. We measured sFLCs with concomitant serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) in 281 patients. Results were interpreted relative to renal function (serum creatinine concentrations) and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Overall, 78 plasma cell disorders (PCDs) were detected with the serum panel of SPEP/sFLC vs 76 with SPEP/UPEP. In 13 samples with negative SPEP/UPEP, mildly increased ratios up to 3.1 (normal, 0.26–1.65) were observed: 10 were associated with increased serum creatinine and 1 with polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia; 2 were unassociated with either condition. In 2 samples, decreased kappa/lambda ratios were identified that were clinically significant despite normal SPEP/UPEP. Two monoclonal gammopathies were identified with UPEP and sFLC, but samples were normal with SPEP. Screening for PCDs with a serum panel consisting of SPEP and the sFLC assays is a highly sensitive approach that could eliminate the need for UPEP. A mildly increased kappa/lambda ratio up to 3.1 was observed with increased serum creatinine and/or polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia that was consistent with pathophysiologic changes, and, therefore, renal reference intervals are recommended.

This article is only available in the PDF format. Download the PDF to view the article, as well as its associated figures and tables. This monograph contains 197 pages with 217 references. It consists of four parts. The first is an introduction which gives a clear discussion of the nomenclature of the globulins, M-component paraproteins, and the clinical importance of monoclonal vs polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemias. Eight pages are devoted to the diagnostic importance of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The second part contains a discussion of the monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemias. This includes the incidence of reticuloendothelial malignancies associated with monoclonal globulinopathies, metabolic derangements associated with multiple myeloma, characterization and significances of the cryoglobulins, euglobulins, and cold agglutinins. Eleven pages are devoted to the differentiation between monoclonal essential hypergammaglobulinemia and myeloma.

The discussion concerning the concepts of homogeneous monoclonal and biclonal globulin production appeared confusing. The third portion of the monograph is devoted to the polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemias.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis… [^115bpJKG]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

1 Debate persists about the upper limit of normal values of mean corpuscular volume. In a recent study, 7 percent of patients had a mean corpuscular volume greater than 96 fL, and 1. 7 percent had a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL. 2 With the advent of automated complete blood cell counters and the increased use of certain medications, elevations in the mean corpuscular volume may be more commonly encountered. This article describes a strategy for the evaluation of patients with macrocytosis, as well as a brief discussion on treatment of vitamin B 12 and folate deficiencies. Diagnostic Strategy Once macrocytosis is identified, the history and physical examination help narrow the differential diagnosis. The presence of anemia, the degree of elevation of the mean corpuscular volume, and the patient's overall health guide how aggressively the work-up progresses.

At least some amount of investigation is warranted if the diagnosis is not readily apparent or if the patient is anemic. 9 The algorithm outlined in Figure 3 suggests a work-up for macrocytosis. Physicians should begin by ordering a peripheral smear, a reticulocyte count, and a vitamin B 12 serum level for all patients with macrocytosis. It may be necessary to specifically order a reticulocyte index in some laboratories, which assesses if there is an adequate bone marrow response. Although uncommon, consider the possibility of spurious macrocytosis. This may be caused by cold agglutinins, hyperglycemia, or leukocytosis. Cold agglutinins cause the RBCs to clump, making them appear larger to the automatic counter.

10 Hyperglycemic blood is more concentrated, and when it is diluted to measure the mean corpuscular volume, the cells swell more than usual, causing a false elevation. 11 Increased turbidity of a sample with marked leukocytosis also can cause the machine to overestimate the cell size.
12. If the cause remains elusive, consider again whether the degree of anemia or the patient's overall health warrants referral to a hematologist for bone marrow biopsy, or search for rarer causes, keeping in mind that the most extensive work-up will result in a diagnosis in approximately 90 percent of patients.

### Plasma cell neoplasms (including multiple myeloma) treatment… [^113T26uX]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

- Measure and follow the serum M protein by serum electrophoresis or by specific Ig assays; however, specific Ig quantification always overestimates the M protein because normal Ig are included in the result. For this reason, the preference is often that baseline and follow-up measurements of the M protein be done by the same method. Quantitative serum free light chains may be helpful to follow response when an M protein is not apparent.
- Identify the heavy and light chain of the M protein by immunofixation electrophoresis.
- Measure the hemoglobin, leukocyte, platelet, and differential counts.
- Determine the percentage of marrow plasma cells. Be aware that marrow plasma-cell distribution may vary in different sites. Bone marrow is often sent for cytogenetics and fluorescence.
- Measure serum levels of calcium, alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and, when indicated by clinical symptoms, cryoglobulins and serum viscosity.
- Obtain radiographs of the skull, ribs, vertebrae, pelvis, shoulder girdle, and long bones. 36] Rising serum creatinine, dropping glomerular filtration rates, and increasing urinary–albumin excretion are all parameters that may signify renal damage and are assessed prospectively for high-risk MGUS patients. Although the N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide is a very sensitive marker for amyloid involvement in the heart, the low specificity must be noted. These extra tests are included with the M-protein level, FLC levels, and FLC ratio when following patients with MGUS. Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma is staged by estimating the myeloma tumor cell mass based on the amount of monoclonal protein in the serum and/or urine, along with various clinical parameters, such as hemoglobin and serum calcium concentrations, the number of lytic bone lesions, and the presence or absence of renal failure.

Impaired renal function worsens prognosis regardless of stage. International staging system The International Myeloma Working Group studied 11, 171 patients, 2, 901 of whom received high-dose therapy and 8, 270 of whom received only standard-dose therapy. The IMWG evaluated 4, 445 patients to create a Revised International Staging System incorporating lactate dehydrogenase levels and interphase fluorescence.
