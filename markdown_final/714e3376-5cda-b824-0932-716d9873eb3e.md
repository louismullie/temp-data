## Question

What are the main causes of non-bacterial UTI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the main causes of non-bacterial urinary tract infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the phrase "non-bacterial UTI" is clinically coherent or a misnomer. Then, I should verify what major guidelines and reviews actually recognize as non-bacterial etiologies of lower urinary tract symptoms. Next, I will categorize these non-bacterial causes by mechanism and provide representative examples. Finally, I should clarify diagnostic implications and when to avoid calling these entities "UTIs" to prevent mislabeling and overtreatment.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not conflating "UTI" with "lower urinary tract symptoms". UTI in contemporary clinical usage refers to a bacterial infection of the urinary tract, and guidelines consistently define UTI by compatible symptoms plus evidence of bacteriuria and pyuria; without bacteria, the diagnosis is not UTI, even if symptoms are present [^55b5409c] [^5fca69be] [^c9156f44].

> Wait, let me verify the non-bacterial etiologies that commonly present with dysuria, frequency, and urgency. The main categories include fungal infections (notably Candida species), parasitic infections (such as Trichomonas vaginalis), viral infections (for example, adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis), and noninfectious inflammatory or irritative conditions like interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, urethral syndrome, and medication-induced cystitis; sexually transmitted pathogens such as Mycoplasma genitalium and Chlamydia trachomatis can cause urethritis that mimics UTI symptoms, and noninfectious causes include foreign bodies, trauma, and dermatologic conditions of the urethra or vulva [^dffd6966] [^acf2b09c] [^654040bf] [^df7c0aff].

> Hold on, I should verify the relative clinical importance of these. Fungal UTIs are most often seen in immunocompromised hosts, diabetics, or those with indwelling devices, with Candida albicans predominating; parasitic trichomoniasis can cause dysuria and frequency and is diagnosed on wet mount or NAAT; viral cystitis, particularly adenovirus, occurs in children and immunocompromised adults; noninfectious causes like interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome are common in women with chronic pelvic pain and negative cultures, and medication-induced cystitis can follow agents such as cyclophosphamide or ketamine [^dffd6966] [^332c850c] [^654040bf].

> I should double-check the diagnostic implications so we do not mislabel these as "UTI". Standard urine culture will not detect fungi, parasites, or viruses; targeted testing is required: yeast on microscopy or fungal culture for Candida, NAAT or wet mount for Trichomonas, and PCR or viral culture for suspected viral cystitis; for noninfectious etiologies, negative cultures with pyuria should prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses rather than repeated antibiotics, and guidelines emphasize documenting bacteriuria and pyuria together before labeling a symptomatic episode as bacterial UTI [^55b5409c] [^5fca69be] [^c9156f44].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist and cultures are negative? I need to ensure we consider entities like urethral syndrome, interstitial cystitis, or even chronic bacterial prostatitis in men, where standard bladder urine cultures may be negative despite infection in the prostate; in such cases, guideline-concordant evaluation for STIs, lower tract sources, and, when indicated, prostate-specific testing is warranted rather than assuming a non-bacterial "UTI" [^811f2a64] [^654040bf].

> In summary, I should confirm that "non-bacterial UTI" is a misnomer; the correct approach is to identify non-bacterial causes of lower urinary tract symptoms, which include fungal, parasitic, and viral infections, as well as noninfectious inflammatory and irritative conditions, and to diagnose these using appropriate nonstandard tests rather than routine bacterial culture, thereby avoiding unnecessary antibiotics and aligning treatment with the true etiology [^55b5409c] [^5fca69be] [^dffd6966].

---

Non-bacterial UTIs are primarily caused by **fungi (especially Candida)** [^dffd6966], **viruses (notably adenovirus)** [^notfound], and **parasites (such as Trichomonas vaginalis)** [^332c850c]. These infections are more common in immunocompromised patients, diabetics, pregnant women, and those with indwelling catheters or recent antibiotic exposure [^notfound]. Diagnosis relies on **targeted testing** (fungal cultures, viral PCR, or parasite assays) because standard bacterial cultures are often negative [^notfound]. Management is pathogen-specific: antifungals for Candida, antivirals for adenovirus, and antiparasitics for Trichomonas [^notfound]; **avoid unnecessary antibiotics** to prevent resistance and harm [^fde217b5].

---

## Fungal causes

Fungi are the **most common non-bacterial cause of UTIs**, with Candida species — particularly Candida albicans — predominating [^dffd6966]. Candida UTIs are strongly associated with:

- **Immunocompromised states**: HIV/AIDS, malignancy, or immunosuppressive therapy [^notfound].
- **Diabetes mellitus**: Glycosuria promotes fungal growth [^notfound].
- **Indwelling urinary catheters**: Biofilm formation facilitates colonization and infection [^bfc9cb63].
- **Recent antibiotic exposure**: Disruption of normal bacterial flora allows fungal overgrowth [^notfound].

Other fungi, such as Aspergillus and Cryptococcus, can rarely cause UTIs, typically in **severely immunocompromised patients** [^notfound].

---

## Viral causes

Viruses are an **important but often underrecognized cause of UTIs**, particularly in children and immunocompromised individuals [^notfound]. The most common viral pathogen is **adenovirus**, which can cause hemorrhagic cystitis, especially in pediatric and immunocompromised populations [^notfound]. Other viruses implicated include:

- **Polyomaviruses (BK virus)**: Associated with hemorrhagic cystitis in transplant recipients [^notfound].
- **Cytomegalovirus (CMV)**: Can cause UTIs in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS or transplant recipients [^notfound].

---

## Parasitic causes

Parasitic infections of the urinary tract are less common but significant, particularly in specific geographic regions or patient populations. The most notable parasitic cause is **Trichomonas vaginalis**, a protozoan parasite that can cause urethritis and cystitis, particularly in women [^notfound]. Schistosoma haematobium, a helminthic parasite, can cause chronic urinary tract infection and is endemic in parts of Africa and the Middle East [^notfound].

---

## Non-infectious inflammatory conditions

While not infectious, certain inflammatory conditions can mimic UTIs clinically and are important to consider in the differential diagnosis. These include **interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome**, a chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder characterized by urinary frequency, urgency, and pelvic pain, often with negative urine cultures [^acf2b09c]. Radiation cystitis, resulting from pelvic irradiation, can cause chronic bladder inflammation and symptoms resembling UTI [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors and predisposing conditions

Several patient-specific factors increase the risk of non-bacterial UTIs:

| **Risk factor** | **Associated non-bacterial uti pathogens** |
|-|-|
| Immunocompromised state | Candida, viruses (adenovirus, CMV), parasites |
| Diabetes mellitus | Candida |
| Indwelling urinary catheter | Candida, bacterial biofilms |
| Recent antibiotic use | Candida |
| Pregnancy | Candida |
| Geographic exposure | Schistosoma haematobium |
| Sexual activity | Trichomonas vaginalis |

---

## Diagnostic challenges

Diagnosing non-bacterial UTIs can be challenging because standard bacterial urine cultures are often negative. Specialized diagnostic methods are required:

- **Fungal UTIs**: Fungal cultures, antigen testing, or molecular methods [^notfound].
- **Viral UTIs**: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for specific viruses [^notfound].
- **Parasitic UTIs**: Microscopic examination, antigen testing, or molecular methods [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Non-bacterial UTIs require **pathogen-specific therapy**:

- **Fungal UTIs**: Antifungal agents such as fluconazole, amphotericin B, or echinocandins, depending on species and severity [^notfound].
- **Viral UTIs**: Supportive care and antiviral therapy in select cases (e.g. cidofovir for adenovirus in immunocompromised patients) [^notfound].
- **Parasitic UTIs**: Antiparasitic agents such as metronidazole for Trichomonas or praziquantel for Schistosoma [^notfound].

Avoidance of unnecessary antibiotics is crucial to prevent **antibiotic resistance** and adverse effects [^fde217b5].

---

Non-bacterial UTIs are caused by fungi, viruses, and parasites, with **Candida, adenovirus, and Trichomonas** being the most common. They occur more often in immunocompromised patients, diabetics, pregnant women, and those with indwelling catheters or recent antibiotic exposure. Accurate diagnosis requires targeted testing, and management is pathogen-specific; **avoid unnecessary antibiotics** to prevent resistance and harm [^dffd6966].

Urinary tract infections (UTIs), which include any infection of the urethra, bladder or kidneys, account for an estimated 400 million infections and billions of dollars in health-care spending per year. The most common bacterium implicated in UTI is uropathogenic Escherichia coli, but diverse pathogens including Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and even yeast such as Candida species can also cause UTIs. UTIs occur in both women and men and in both healthy and immunocompromised patients. However, certain patient factors predispose to disease: for example, female sex, history of prior UTI, or the presence of a urinary catheter or other urinary tract abnormality. The current clinical paradigm for the treatment of UTIs involves the use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this approach is dwindling as the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance rises among UTI isolates, and the immense quantity of antibiotics prescribed annually for these infections contributes to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics and non-antibiotic treatment and prevention strategies. In this Review, we discuss how recent studies of bacterial pathogenesis, recurrence, persistence, host-pathogen interactions and host susceptibility factors have elucidated new and promising targets for the treatment and prevention of UTIs.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a condition in which bacteria are present in a noncontaminated urine sample collected from a patient without signs or symptoms related to the urinary tract. ASB must be distinguished from symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) by the absence of signs and symptoms compatible with UTI or by clinical determination that a nonurinary cause accounts for the patient's symptoms. The overall purpose of this review is to promote an awareness of ASB as a distinct condition from UTI and to empower clinicians to withhold antibiotics in situations in which antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria is not indicated.

### A systematic review of non-antibiotic measures for the prevention of urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^60d0e94f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) account for the highest proportion of primary care antibiotic prescriptions issued to pregnant women in the UK. Pregnant women have an increased susceptibility to UTIs because of physiological changes. The growing uterus can result in urinary retention which predisposes the woman to infection. In addition, hormonal fluctuations relax the ureteral muscle and cause accumulation of urine in the bladder which also increases the chance of developing a UTI.

Treatment of UTIs is recommended in pregnancy if bacteria are detected in the urine even if there are no accompanying symptoms i.e. in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Both ASB and symptomatic UTIs in pregnancy are risk factors for the development of pyelonephritis which can result in severe maternal morbidity. It is estimated that 20–30% of women with bacteriuria in the first trimester go on to develop pyelonephritis in later trimesters. Therefore, although ASB on its own is not treated in the general population, guidelines published by the European Urological Association (EAU) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) recommend screening and treating bacteriuria with or without symptoms. The current management strategy according to these guidelines is to use a short course of antibiotics.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^2be4e0aa]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment, not diagnosis — describe a clinical syndrome characterized by local bladder signs and symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain, and are defined by absence of findings suggesting infection beyond the bladder: no fever unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or unstable vital signs) unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no flank pain, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. Uncomplicated UTI can occur in females or males, patients with underlying urologic abnormalities, patients with immunocompromise, and persons with diabetes; recurrent UTI can be uncomplicated. Patients with urinary catheters (including transurethral, suprapubic, and intermittent catheterization), stents, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes generally do not have uncomplicated UTI, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

Pathophysiology and microbiology — standard cultures indicate that Escherichia coli (E. coli) causes most community-acquired urinary tract infections (70%–95%) and is also the most common cause of rUTI (66%); uropathogens in rUTI are the same microbes as episode (non–rUTI) UTI episodes, but non–E. coli pathogens and resistant organisms are more likely in women with rUTI; episodes of rUTIs are often associated with the same bacterial strain, and uropathogenic E. coli can form intracellular bacterial communities that act like a biofilm and persist in quiescent intracellular reservoirs, acting as a source of recurrent infection.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infection (rUTI) microbiome and non-antibiotic approaches — emerging data highlight the role of host microbial communities and the need for alternatives to antibiotics: "Emerging data regarding the bacterial communities of the human bladder, bowel, and vagina suggests that depletion or alteration of the normal host microbiome may disrupt host innate barriers to infection and alter innate immune system function, contributing to the development of rUTI", and "Such disruptions in these communities may be the direct consequence of antibiotic treatments". "A better understanding of the relationship between the urinary microbiome and bladder health may fundamentally transform our earlier belief that urine is "sterile". Against "a worldwide crisis… due to rapid expansion of MDR bacteria", "current concepts of antibiotic stewardship have provoked a further initiative to develop agents outside the traditional pipeline of antibiotics", with "renewed vigor in pursuing non-antibiotic approaches to UTI treatment and prevention".

### Pyelonephritis (acute) in non-pregnant women [^b4e26489]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pyelonephritis is usually caused by ascent of bacteria, most often Escherichia coli, from the bladder, and is more likely in people with structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities. The prognosis is good if pyelonephritis is treated appropriately, but complications include renal abscess, renal impairment, and septic shock.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of: oral antibiotic treatments for acute pyelonephritis in women with uncomplicated infection; antibiotic treatments in women admitted to hospital with complicated infection; inpatient versus outpatient management in women with uncomplicated infection; analgesia in uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to February 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 5 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, inpatient management, intravenous antibiotics, non-opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral antibiotics, outpatient management, urinary analgesics.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women (AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline) — scope and purpose: The guideline limits scope to recurrent episodes of localized (restricted to the lower urinary tract) cystitis in women and states that it does not apply to individuals with complicating factors at higher risk for development of UTI or decreased efficacy of therapy, or those with signs or symptoms of systemic bacteremia. Within this document, the term UTI refers to acute bacterial cystitis unless otherwise specified. The stated aims are to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs by reducing recurrence of UTI events.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^fc1d9dae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Latin American consensus on uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infection-2018 [^39915984]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

An estimated 20–30% of adult women who experience an initial urinary tract infection (UTI) will have recurrent infection. In these patients, prophylaxis may be considered to improve their quality of life and control overuse of antibiotics. Despite this need, there is currently no Latin American consensus on the treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs. This consensus, signed by a panel of regional and international experts on UTI management, aims to address this need and is the first step toward a Latin American consensus on a number of urogynecological conditions. The panel agrees that antibiotics should be considered the primary treatment option for symptomatic UTI, taking into account local pathogen resistance patterns. Regarding prophylaxis, immunoactive therapy with the bacterial lysate OM-89 received a grade A recommendation and local estrogen in postmenopausal women grade B recommendation. Lower-grade recommendations include behavior modification and D-mannose; probiotics (Lactobacilli), cranberries, and hyaluronic acid (and derivatives) received limited recommendations; their use should be discussed with the patient. Though considered effective and receiving grade A recommendation, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be considered only following prophylaxis with effective non-antimicrobial measures that were not successful and chosen based on the frequency of sexual intercourse and local pathogen resistance patterns.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^26855a0b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We published a protocol (PROSPERO CRD42018114133) and followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) recommendations in the conduct of this systematic review.

Data Sources and Searches

A medical librarian (WT) performed literature searches in the following databases from their inception through January 13, 2020: PubMed, CINHAL (EBSCO), Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, EMBASE,… Searches for each database included appropriate controlled vocabulary terms when available, combined with keywords such as "UTIs", "Analgesics", and "Antibiotics" (Appendix). No search restrictions were placed on publication date, language, or completion status. To ensure inclusion of clinical trials that may have been completed but not yet published, we reviewed the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials website as well. We also performed hand-searched of bibliographies to ensure inclusion of all relevant articles.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion if they compared antibiotics versus NSAIDs for treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. Uncomplicated UTIs were defined as UTIs (diagnosed based on symptoms of urgency, dysuria, frequency, or suprapubic tenderness, with or without dipstick or culture evidence of bacteriuria) in non-pregnant adult women who were not immunocompromised and had no prior urological procedures or hardware. "Adult" was defined as 18 years of age or older for studies conducted in countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). For studies conducted in other countries, a lower age limit of 15 years of age was used after discussion among two authors (MRC, PKP). Two authors (MRC, PKP) independently determined study eligibility. A third author (VV) resolved any differences of opinion between the two primary reviewers. Interrater agreement for study eligibility was assessed using Cohen's kappa.

### Women's views about management and cause of urinary tract infection: qualitative interview study [^5074d335]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute urinary tract infection is one of the commonest acute bacterial infections among women. Most women presenting in primary care are prescribed an antibiotic. Conventional courses of antibiotics probably help to resolve symptoms but are also likely to have side effects, including skin rash, vaginal symptoms, and other side effects. The strategy of universal use of antibiotics in these women is being questioned, in part because the condition is often self limiting and non-pharmacological alternatives — such as the use of cranberry juice, teas, or herbal remedies and potassium citrate or sodium biocarbonate — exist, although the evidence for effectiveness is weak. The potential effectiveness of antibiotics must also be balanced against wider issues for the National Health Service (NHS), particularly the mounting concerns about increasing workload for self limiting illnessand the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. The use of diagnostic techniques and antibiotics might encourage belief in antibiotics and in the necessity of seeing a general practitioner for the problem, thus "medicalising" a condition that is often self limiting. This leads to greater antibiotic use and increased antibiotic resistance.

Given these concerns and the limited evidence base for alternative management options, there was a need for trials to allow estimation of the advantages and disadvantages of antibiotics, antibiotic strategies, and non-antibiotic alternatives. We conducted a pragmatic randomised controlled trial to test several management strategies, including antibiotic delay. Qualitative interviews nested in the trial explored interviewees' attitudes towards antibiotics, their experience of a delayed antibiotic prescription, and their views on the cause of urinary tract infection.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^0845abca]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, ranking as the second most frequent indication for antibiotic prescribing in the outpatient setting. The majority of UTIs are "uncomplicated", occurring in non-pregnant adult women who are not immunocompromised and have normal genitourinary structure and function. Each year, 12.6% of women will have a UTI, and half of all women will have at least one UTI by age 32. The standard of care for uncomplicated UTI is oral antibiotic therapy, which typically leads to rapid symptom resolution and reduces the risk of complications such as pyelonephritis.

In recent years, growing antibiotic resistance has led to efforts to use antibiotics more judiciously. Specifically for uncomplicated UTIs, these initiatives have sought to reduce the amount — either duration or frequency — and spectrum of antibiotics. – Interviews with women indicate willingness to delay or avoid antibiotic prescriptions when safe to do so. Furthermore, some UTIs are self-limited without treatment and thus may not require antibiotic therapy. For example, a randomized controlled trial comparing nitrofurantoin with placebo for uncomplicated UTI demonstrated spontaneous symptomatic cure or improvement in over half of participants receiving placebo who had UTIs as proven by a combination of symptoms/signs and positive laboratory testing. While a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials found placebo to be inferior to antibiotics for resolution of UTI symptoms, it is unclear whether non-antibiotic treatment regimens for uncomplicated UTIs may be feasible as an outpatient antibiotic stewardship strategy. For example, cranberry extract was initially considered a potential antibiotic-sparing option; however, subsequent research has not supported its use in the treatment of UTI over antibiotics.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^1206676c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This review adds two important pieces of information to what is currently known about UTI. First, it confirms the role of antibiotics as first-line treatment for uncomplicated UTIs compared with symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs. Second, it demonstrates that about half of patients experience symptom resolution with NSAIDs alone, indicating a potential target to reduce antibiotic prescriptions. While fewer than 5% of those using NSAIDs developed pyelonephritis, the potential adverse effects of NSAIDs as treatment need to be considered. Taken together, these data point to the importance of future research to identify patients who would most benefit from antibiotic therapy so that prescribing can be targeted towards those individuals while avoiding prescribing to those who would not derive incremental benefit. Such an approach would ensure women have adequate, prompt symptom resolution while at the same time avoiding unnecessary antibiotic prescribing — the kind of "win-win" that is the ultimate goal of antibiotic stewardship efforts.

### Urinary tract infection pathogenesis: host factors [^70c71669]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Clinically, host factors in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection (UTI) may be considered as modifiable (eg, behaviors associated with increased risk of UTI, anatomic and functional problems of the urinary tract) and thus potentially amenable to a change in patient behavior or treatment approach, or as intrinsic and nonmodifiable host factors that neither the patient nor the clinician can influence (eg, gender and genetic influences associated with UTI). Although considering nonmodifiable host factors may be discouraging to patients and clinicians at present, some genetic associations have the potential for future predictive value and may interface with future treatments.

### Nonserious infections: should there be cause for serious concerns? [^6b3ca8e1]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Nonserious infections (NSIE) as colds, flu syndromes, and urinary tract infection, are the most common infections seen in patients with immune mediated inflammatory diseases. Yet, little is known about the impact of immunosuppression, particularly with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), on these infections. A systemic review of large, randomized controlled trials was conducted to identify incidence, types, and outcomes of NSIE associated with the most commonly prescribed TNFi: adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab.

Future directions for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — the guideline highlights that A better understanding of rUTI pathophysiology will greatly aid in our ability to design more effective, mechanistically-based treatments, that Relying on results from the urinary dipstick test, including leukocyte esterase and nitrate, lacks the necessary level of sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic accuracy, and that Currently, there are no symptoms that are definitively predictive of acute cystitis, and no good quality evidence that can support a specific pathogen. It states Urine culture results or any other current methods of bacterial detection do not reflect any aspect of the host response and calls for defining initiatives for algorithms to predict treatment and partnering with our primary care colleagues and patients to provide education regarding rUTI definitions, evaluation, and treatment. It notes Advanced molecular technologies give a more complete characterization of genitourinary microbes and that PCR and NGS-based diagnostic tests have some enticing preliminary studies suggesting their utilization may facilitate equivalent or even better clinical outcomes than standard urine culture while decreasing the time to diagnosis and reducing empiric antibiotic prescriptions, while cautioning These early studies, however, are complicated by some methodological limitations and a high risk of bias and More data are needed before identifying what role these tests play in UTI diagnostics.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^7bfff2d4]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

### Molecular determinants of disease severity in urinary tract infection [^3f7609b5]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2021). High credibility.

The most common and lethal bacterial pathogens have co-evolved with the host. Pathogens are the aggressors, and the host immune system is responsible for the defence. However, immune responses can also become destructive, and excessive innate immune activation is a major cause of infection-associated morbidity, exemplified by symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are caused, in part, by excessive innate immune activation. Severe kidney infections (acute pyelonephritis) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and painful infections of the urinary bladder (acute cystitis) can become debilitating in susceptible patients. Disease severity is controlled at specific innate immune checkpoints, and a detailed understanding of their functions is crucial for strategies to counter microbial aggression with novel treatment and prevention measures. One approach is the use of bacterial molecules that reprogramme the innate immune system, accelerating or inhibiting disease processes. A very different outcome is asymptomatic bacteriuria, defined by low host immune responsiveness to bacteria with attenuated virulence. This observation provides the rationale for immunomodulation as a new therapeutic tool to deliberately modify host susceptibility, control the host response and avoid severe disease. The power of innate immunity as an arbitrator of health and disease is also highly relevant for emerging pathogens, including the current COVID-19 pandemic.

IDSA 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria — older, functionally or cognitively impaired patients: In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and delirium (acute mental status change, confusion) and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection who experience a fall, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Values and preferences emphasize avoiding adverse outcomes of antimicrobial therapy such as CDI, increased antimicrobial resistance, or adverse drug effects when benefit is unproven. Remarks note that for a bacteriuric patient with fever and other systemic signs potentially consistent with a severe infection (sepsis) and without a localizing source, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy directed against urinary and nonurinary sources should be initiated.

### Treatment of bacterial urinary tract infections: presence and future [^2aca5aa2]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defense mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs the bacterial spectrum is much broader including Gram-negative and Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors have to be treated as well. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: (i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; (ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The main drawback of current antibiotic therapies is the emergence and rapid increase of antibiotic resistance. To combat this development several strategies can be followed. Decrease the amount of antibiotics administered, optimal dosing, prevention of infection and development of new antibiotic substances. The aim of this review is to highlight the current and to describe future treatment options for UTIs.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^88a3bce3]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

UTIs are characterized according to several schema and terminologies, which are relevant to their diagnostic work-up. Anatomically, lower UTIs are confined to the bladder (cystitis) and/or urethra, while upper UTIs involve ascension to the kidneys (pyelonephritis). The latter are more commonly associated with both bacteremia (a condition defined microbiologically) and urosepsis (defined clinicopathologically), although they may occur with cystitis alone. UTIs may be further defined according to patient risk factors. Uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) affects non-pregnant, immunocompetent females without structural/functional urinary tract abnormalities or other predisposing conditions. Notably, an explicit microbiologic diagnosis (i.e. urine culture) is not necessarily indicated for routine cases of uncomplicated cystitis, as empiric antimicrobial therapy is often appropriate. Complicated UTI (cUTI) is an umbrella term for infections arising in the context of risk factor(s) listed above for uUTI. Traditionally, a UTI in a male is inherently considered complicated (although this is controversial). Complicated infections secondary to catheterization are termed catheter associated UTIs. In terms of temporal dynamics, multiple episodes of symptomatic infection (two within 6 months or three within 1 year) with intervening periods of clinical resolution are recurrent UTIs. These may represent persistent infections by the same offending organism or reinfection by a different species/strain. Likewise, the term chronic UTI is applied loosely to either recurrent or unresolving infections. Finally, the concept of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) refers to recovery of a potential uropathogen at high burden (typically > 10⁵ CFU/mL) in the absence of symptomatology. Antimicrobial therapy is typically not indicated for ASB, except in certain populations at high risk for adverse outcomes (e.g. renal transplant recipients and pregnant women, especially those undergoing invasive urologic procedures).

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^8766727a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Non-β-lactam therapy for AmpC-E urinary and nonurinary infections — preferred and alternative agents. Preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC-E are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX); ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) are alternative options for AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis. For pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by AmpC-E, TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred, with aminoglycosides as alternative options when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones. For AmpC-E infections outside of the urinary tract, transitioning from cefepime to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^34eba1bb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

Data were extracted from the included studies by one author (MRC) and verified by another (PKP) using a standardized template. Data extracted included the number and type of patients, definitions of UTI, and outcome measures (time to symptom resolution, number of antibiotic prescriptions, cases of pyelonephritis).

Two authors (MRC and PKP) independently assessed the risk of bias in included trials using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. Studies were only defined as "low risk" if they met the criteria for low risk of bias for all six domains. Studies with missing methodological data were considered to be at unclear risk of bias.

Data Synthesis and Analysis

The primary outcome of interest was the proportion of individuals with resolution of symptoms by day 3 or day 4 post-randomization. In accordance with existing studies, we chose 30 days post-randomization for assessment of secondary outcomes that included (a) incidence of pyelonephritis and (b) number of antibiotic prescriptions. For all outcomes, we reported the difference in risk with 95% confidence intervals. When data regarding symptom resolution in both groups were available, we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) with antibiotics versus NSAIDs to achieve symptom resolution by day 3 or 4 post-randomization in one additional person as the reciprocal of the difference in risk, or 1/(absolute risk reduction). Because of clinical heterogeneity in antibiotic exposure, NSAID selection, and outcomes reported in included studies, we did not conduct formal meta-analyses.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A Panel of International Experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) to update the 1999 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection Guidelines by the IDSA. Co-sponsoring organizations include the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Urological Association, Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Canada, and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine. The focus of this work is treatment of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, diagnoses limited in these guidelines to premenopausal, non-pregnant women with no known urological abnormalities or co-morbidities. The issues of in vitro resistance prevalence and the ecological adverse effects of antimicrobial therapy (collateral damage) were considered as important factors in making optimal treatment choices and thus are reflected in the rankings of recommendations.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^0ca8cb0a]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Amid growing antimicrobial resistance, there is an increasing focus on antibiotic stewardship efforts to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. In this context, novel approaches for treating infections without antibiotics are being explored. One such strategy is the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the rates of symptom resolution and infectious complications in adult women with uncomplicated UTIs treated with antibiotics versus NSAIDs.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, CINHAL, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception until January 13, 2020, for randomized controlled trials comparing NSAIDs with antibiotics for treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in adult women. Studies comparing symptom resolution between groups were eligible. Two authors screened all studies independently and in duplicate; data were abstracted using a standardized template. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool.

Results

Five randomized trials that included 1309 women with uncomplicated UTI met inclusion criteria. Three studies (1130 patients) favored antibiotic therapy in terms of symptom resolution. Two studies (179 patients) found no difference between NSAIDs and antibiotics in terms of symptom resolution. Three studies reported rates of pyelonephritis, two of which found higher rates in patients treated with NSAIDs versus antibiotics. Between two studies that reported this outcome (747 patients), patients randomized to NSAIDs received fewer antibiotic prescriptions compared with those in the antibiotics group. Three studies were at low risk of bias, one had an unclear risk of bias, and one was at high risk of bias.

Discussion

For the outcomes of symptom resolution and complications in adult women with UTI, evidence favors antibiotics over NSAIDs.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^09bd396f]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

This review has several strengths, including a comprehensive literature search that included multiple databases without language filters as well as a published protocol. It also has several limitations. We could not perform a meta-analysis given substantial heterogeneity in treatment across studies. Second, there was substantial variability in reported outcomes. Third, only five trials met inclusion criteria, limiting the ability to detect rare outcomes. Fourth, the follow-up period for all studies was 1 month or less, preventing the assessment of long-term impact of NSAID versus antibiotic therapy on patient outcomes, though a follow-up study to one trial demonstrated no impact on recurrent UTI or pyelonephritis from 28 days to 6 months post-randomization.

### Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and recurrent cystitis but negative urinalysis: what should we do? [^233df5bf]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is growing awareness that urinary tract infection (UTI), undetected by routine diagnostics, might play a causal role in the generation of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). This proposal is controversial because the exclusion of UTI is a key step in every guideline concerned with the management of LUTS. As a result, LUTS have become synonymous with noninfective disease. However, there is increasing evidence that patients presenting with LUTS may harbour a UTI despite negative tests. The problem lies with the diagnostic criteria used in culture-based diagnosis. A significant body of published literature points to the inherent flaws of quantitative urinary microbiological analysis, in which thresholds between 10³ cfu mL⁻¹ and 10⁶ cfu mL⁻¹ of a pure growth of a single urinary pathogen are employed to diagnose UTI. Dipstick urinalysis performs equally poorly, hampered by insensitivity and spectrum bias. These tests cannot reliably exclude UTI and do not take into account differences in bacterial strain virulence, host genetic variability, intracellular bacterial reservoirs, or even urine dilution due to high fluid intake before the test.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^49cf53f8]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — diagnostic criteria and documentation (Clinical Principle) states that clinicians should document evidence of inflammation (pyuria) and uropathogenic bacteria during symptomatic episodes, defining recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) as at least two acute episodes in six months of urinary tract–associated symptoms and signs. Evidence of infection should include significant bacteriuria and urinary inflammation (pyuria with ≥ 5 WBC/hpf on microscopic urinalysis), and the absence of pyuria rules out UTI in symptomatic women with confirmed bacteriuria. Documentation of bacterial uropathogens during each symptomatic period is critical, and inconsistent bacteriuria or organisms should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses; given limitations of standard urine culture, clinicians should consider additional available information, including alternative tests, with critical deliberation, and it is important to consider all clinical and laboratory data when deciding whether antibiotic treatment is needed.

### Reducing antibiotic use in uncomplicated urinary tract infections in adult women: a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis [^51e0c586]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigated analgesics, herbal formulations, delayed prescription of antibiotics, and placebo to prevent overprescription of antibiotics in women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTI).

Objectives

To estimate the effect of these strategies and to identify symptoms, signs, or other factors that indicate a benefit from these strategies.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, LILACS, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.

Study Eligibility Criteria, Participants and Interventions

RCTs investigating any strategies to reduce antibiotics vs. immediate antibiotics in adult women with uUTI in primary care.

Methods

We extracted individual participant data (IPD) if available, otherwise aggregate data (AD). Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis of the AD was used for pairwise comparisons. Candidate moderators and prognostic indicators of treatment effects were investigated using generalised linear mixed models based on IPD.

Results

We analysed IPD of 3524 patients from eight RCTs and AD of 78 patients. Non-antibiotic strategies increased the rates of incomplete recovery (OR 3.0; 95% credible interval (CrI), 1.7–5.5; Bayesian p-value (p B) = 0.0017; τ = 0.6), subsequent antibiotic treatment (OR 3.5; 95% CrI, 2.1–5.8; p B = 0.0003) and pyelonephritis (OR 5.6; 95% CrI, 2.3–13.9; p B = 0.0003). Conversely, they decreased overall antibiotic use by 63%. Patients positive for urinary erythrocytes and urine culture were at increased risk for incomplete recovery (OR 4.7; 95% CrI, 2.1–10.8; p B = 0.0010), but no difference was apparent where both were negative (OR 0.8; 95% CrI, 0.3–2.0; p B = 0.667). In patients treated using non-antibiotic strategies, urinary erythrocytes and positive urine culture were independent prognostic indicators for subsequent antibiotic treatment and pyelonephritis.

Conclusions

Compared to immediate antibiotics, non-antibiotic strategies reduce overall antibiotic use but result in poorer clinical outcomes. The presence of erythrocytes and tests to confirm bacteria in urine could be used to target antibiotic prescribing.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^55b5409c]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definition and diagnostic criteria emphasize that this Guideline supports the most commonly used definition of two episodes of acute bacterial cystitis within a six-month period sometime within the preceding year, and any patient experiencing episodes of symptomatic acute cystitis after previous resolution of similar symptoms meets the criteria for rUTI. Strong evidence suggests that the diagnosis of acute bacterial cystitis should include the combination of acute-onset symptoms referable to the urinary tract, urinary inflammation on microscopic urinalysis (pyuria), and laboratory confirmation of significant bacteriuria, with Table 1 detailing components such as acute-onset symptoms including dysuria with increased urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence; urinary tract inflammation defined as pyuria ≥ 5 WBC/high power field (hpf) on microscopic urinalysis; and detection of a bacterial uropathogen. Without symptoms, bacteriuria of any magnitude is considered asymptomatic bacteriuria, and patients who recur rapidly within two weeks of initial treatment or who display bacterial persistence without symptom resolution may require imaging, cystoscopy, or other further investigation for bacterial reservoirs.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) management — Given the presence of bacteria in a healthy urinary tract, the text emphasizes that concepts about when antibiotics are necessary must evolve, noting that symptomatic treatment and expectant management can be appropriate for some even when acute bacterial cystitis is confirmed. It urges re-evaluating the assumption that all symptomatic bacteriuria requires antibiotics and states that rUTI care should focus on symptom relief and prevention of complications rather than bacterial eradication.

### Antimicrobial agents for preventing urinary tract infections in adults undergoing cystoscopy [^1aed7d31]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cystoscopy is commonly performed for diagnostic purposes to inspect the interior lining of the bladder. One disadvantage of cystoscopy is the risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) due to pre-existing colonization or by introduction of bacteria at the time of the procedure. However, the incidence of symptomatic UTI following cystoscopy is low. Currently, there is no consensus on whether antimicrobial agents should be used to prevent symptomatic UTI for cystoscopy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antimicrobial agents compared with placebo or no treatment for prevention of UTI in adults undergoing cystoscopy.

Search Methods

We comprehensively searched electronic databases of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL. We searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We used no language or date restrictions in the electronic searches. We searched the reference lists of identified articles and contacted authors for related information. The last search of the electronic databases was 4 February 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared any prophylactic antibiotic versus placebo, no treatment, or other non-antibiotic prophylaxis in adults undergoing cystoscopy. There was no restriction on the dose, frequency, formulation, duration, or mode of administration of the antibiotics.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were systemic UTI, symptomatic UTI (composite of systemic and/or localized UTI), and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were minor adverse events, localized UTI, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and bacterial resistance. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 20 RCTs and two quasi-RCTs with 7711 participants, all of which compared antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo or no treatment control. We found no studies comparing antibiotic prophylaxis with non-antibiotic prophylaxis. Primary outcomesSystemic UTI: antibiotic prophylaxis may have little or no effect on the risk of systemic UTI compared with placebo or no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 3.32; 5 RCTs; 504 participants; low-quality evidence); this corresponds to two more people (95% CI 12 fewer to 46 more) per 1000 people developing a systemic UTI. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Symptomatic UTI: antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of symptomatic UTI (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.86; 11 RCTs; 5441 participants; low-quality evidence); this corresponds to 30 fewer people (95% CI 42 fewer to 8 fewer) per 1000 people developing a symptomatic UTI when provided with antibiotic prophylaxis. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and potential publication bias. Serious adverse events: the studies reported no serious adverse events in either the intervention group or control group and no effect size could be calculated. Antibiotic prophylaxis may have little or no effect on serious adverse events (4 RCTs, 630 participants; very low-quality evidence), but we are very uncertain of this finding. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and very serious imprecision. Secondary outcomesMinor adverse events: prophylactic antibiotics may have little or no effect on minor adverse events when compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 2.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 14.80; 4 RCTs; 630 participants; low-quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Localized UTI: prophylactic antibiotics may have little or no effect on the risk of localized UTI (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.77; 1 RCT; 200 participants; very low-quality evidence), but we were very uncertain of this finding. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and very serious imprecision. Bacterial resistance: prophylactic antibiotics may increase bacterial resistance (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.87; 38 participants; 2 RCTs; very low-quality evidence), but we were uncertain of this finding. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations, indirectness, and imprecision. We were able to perform few secondary analyses; these did not suggest any subgroup effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of symptomatic UTI but not systemic UTIs. Serious and minor adverse events may not be increased with the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. The findings are informed by low- and very low-quality evidence ratings for all outcomes.

### Diabetes mellitus and urinary tract infection: epidemiology, pathogenesis and proposed studies in animal models [^9936b3a1]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed the current state of knowledge about urinary tract infection in patients with diabetes from the clinical and basic science perspectives. We identified key knowledge gaps and areas for further research.

Materials and Methods

We performed a focused literature search on certain topics, including clinical studies related to etiology and pathophysiology of urinary tract infection in patients with diabetes, urinary tract infection studies in animal models of diabetes and basic science studies of the molecular mechanisms of urinary tract infection.

Results

Individuals with diabetes are at higher risk for urinary tract infection. Increased susceptibility in patients with diabetes is positively associated with increased duration and severity of diabetes. Clinical epidemiological data identifying mechanisms of increased urinary tract infection susceptibility in patients with diabetes are generally lacking and indicate only that urinary tract infections in women with and without diabetes are qualitatively similar in bacterial etiology and morbid sequelae. Existing animal models for diabetes have not been well characterized for urinary tract infection research. The increased incidence, prevalence and severity of urinary tract infection in patients with diabetes argue for aggressive antibacterial chemotherapy but novel therapies resulting from urinary tract infection research in nondiabetic animal models are still not available.

Conclusions

Future clinical investigations of urinary tract infection in patients with diabetes should focus on how the disease differs from that in patients without diabetes, notably on the role of glycosuria and urinary tract infection risk. Basic science research priorities for urinary tract infection in patients with diabetes should emphasize further development of diabetic animal models for urinary tract infection research and clinical translation of known important virulence determinants into new therapies.

The first difference is that age does not have a statistically significant relationship to UTI in staghorn stone group (P = 0.2150), however, age does have a statistically significant relationship to UTI in non-staghorn stone group (P = 0.0215). (see Tables 4 and 5). We guess the reason may be that the number of patients with staghorn stone is a little small.

The second difference is that the first three gram-negative bacteria in staghorn stone are Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the first three gram-negative bacteria in non-staghorn stone are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. (see Tables 6 and 7).

Through the results of the chi-squared tests, sex, age, obstruction, multiple stones, and stone shape each had a statistically significant relationship to UTI (all P < 0.05); however, this was not true of smoking and alcohol consumption (all P > 0.05).

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^60df4b65]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Policy, clinical, and research implications

Our findings detail global high level resistance to some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children primary care, which could result in several drugs becoming ineffective first line treatments in many countries. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID)recommend that an antibiotic should be selected for first line empirical treatment of urinary tract infection only if the local prevalence of resistance is less than 20%. According to these guidelines, our review suggests ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and trimethoprim are no longer suitable first line treatment options for urinary tract infection in many OECD countries and that as a result many guidelines, such as those published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), might need updating. In non-OECD countries, resistance to all first line antibiotics specified for urinary tract infections was in excess of 20% (appendix 5), suggesting that choices of first line treatment might need to be re-evaluated in less well developed countries. Our results also support the need for prescribing guidelines to reflect patterns of local resistance and that, for many areas, nitrofurantoin might be the most appropriate first line treatment for lower urinary tract infection. That said, care is needed because ruling out the use of some first line antibiotics could lead clinicians to prescribe broad spectrum second line antibiotics, such as co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, and quinolones, resulting in a vicious cycle of increasing use of broad spectrum antibiotics and bacterial resistance.

### A reference standard for urinary tract infection research: a multidisciplinary Delphi consensus study [^5fca69be]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The absence of a consensus-based reference standard for urinary tract infection (UTI) research adversely affects the internal and external validity of diagnostic and therapeutic studies. This omission hinders the accumulation of evidence for a disease that imposes a substantial burden on patients and society, particularly in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance. We did a three-round Delphi study involving an international, multidisciplinary panel of UTI experts (n = 46) and achieved a high degree of consensus (94%) on the final reference standard. New-onset dysuria, urinary frequency, and urinary urgency were considered major symptoms, and non-specific symptoms in older patients were not deemed indicative of UTI. The reference standard distinguishes between UTI with and without systemic involvement, abandoning the term complicated UTI. Moreover, different levels of pyuria were incorporated in the reference standard, encouraging quantification of pyuria in studies done in all health-care settings. The traditional bacteriuria threshold (10⁵ colony-forming units per mL) was lowered to 10⁴ colony-forming units per mL. This new reference standard can be used for UTI research across many patient populations and has the potential to increase homogeneity between studies.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^c040129a]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) definitions and related terms describe rUTI as Two separate episodes of acute bacterial cystitis and associated symptoms over a six-month period within the preceding year. Systemic urinary tract infection is defined as An infection of the urinary tract with signs and symptoms of systemic infection, with or without localized symptoms originating from any site in the urinary tract. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is Presence of bacteria in the urine that causes no illness or symptoms, and pyuria is Presence of increased numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (WBC) in the urine as evidence of an inflammatory response in the urinary tract. Complicating factors that increase risk include Anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract (e.g., stone disease, diverticulum, neurogenic bladder), Immunocompromised host, and Indwelling urinary tract foreign body (e.g., indwelling urethral catheters, ureteral stents).

### Dysuria: evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults [^acf2b09c]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The most common cause of acute dysuria is infection, especially cystitis. Other infectious causes include urethritis, sexually transmitted infections, and vaginitis. Noninfectious inflammatory causes include a foreign body in the urinary tract and dermatologic conditions. Noninflammatory causes of dysuria include medication use, urethral anatomic abnormalities, local trauma, and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. An initial targeted history includes features of a local cause (e.g., vaginal or urethral irritation), risk factors for a complicated urinary tract infection (e.g., male sex, pregnancy, presence of urologic obstruction, recent procedure), and symptoms of pyelonephritis. Women with dysuria who have no complicating features can be treated for cystitis without further diagnostic evaluation. Women with vulvovaginal symptoms should be evaluated for vaginitis. Any complicating features or recurrent symptoms warrant a history, physical examination, urinalysis, and urine culture. Findings from the secondary evaluation, selected laboratory tests, and directed imaging studies enable physicians to progress through a logical evaluation and determine the cause of dysuria or make an appropriate referral.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^861f7ede]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In adults with febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI), data on optimal treatment duration in patients other than non-pregnant women without comorbidities are lacking.

Methods

A randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority trial among 35 primary care centers and 7 emergency departments of regional hospitals in the Netherlands. Women and men aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of fUTI were randomly assigned to receive antibiotic treatment for 7 or 14 days (the second week being ciprofloxacin 500 mg or placebo orally twice daily). Patients indicated to receive antimicrobial treatment for at least 14 days were excluded from randomization. The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit with preset subgroup analysis including sex. Secondary endpoints were bacteriologic cure rate at 10–18 days post-treatment and clinical cure at 70–84 days post-treatment.

Results

Of 357 patients included, 200 were eligible for randomization; 97 patients were randomly assigned to 7 days and 103 patients to 14 days of treatment. Overall, short-term clinical cure occurred in 85 (90%) patients treated for 7 days and in 94 (95%) of those treated for 14 days (difference -4.5%; 90% CI, -10.7 to 1.7; P non-inferiority = 0.072, non-inferiority not confirmed). In women, clinical cure was 94% and 93% in those treated for 7 and 14 days, respectively (difference 0.9; 90% CI, -6.9 to 8.7, P non-inferiority = 0.011, non-inferiority confirmed) and, in men, this was 86% versus 98% (difference -11.2; 90% CI -20.6 to -1.8, P superiority = 0.025, inferiority confirmed). The bacteriologic cure rate was 93% versus 97% (difference -4.3%; 90% CI, -9.7 to 1.2, P non-inferiority = 0.041) and the long-term clinical cure rate was 92% versus 91% (difference 1.6%; 90% CI, -5.3 to 8.4; P non-inferiority = 0.005) for 7 days versus 14 days of treatment, respectively. In the subgroups of men and women, long-term clinical cure rates met the criteria for non-inferiority, indicating there was no difference in the need for antibiotic retreatment for UTI during 70–84 days follow-up post-treatment.

Conclusions

Women with fUTI can be treated successfully with antibiotics for 7 days. In men, 7 days of antibiotic treatment for fUTI is inferior to 14 days during short-term follow-up but it is non-inferior when looking at longer follow-up.

Trial Registration

The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT00809913; December 16, 2008] and trialregister.nl [NTR1583; December 19, 2008].

### Recurrent cystitis in non-pregnant women [^cb2834f3]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cystitis is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract which causes pain when passing urine, and causes urgency, haematuria, and suprapubic pain not associated with passing urine. Recurrent cystitis is usually defined as three episodes of urinary tract infection in the previous 12 months, or two episodes in the previous 6 months.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: Which interventions prevent further recurrence of cystitis in women experiencing at least two infections per year? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2007 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (trimethoprim, co-trimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, cefaclor, or a quinolone or cephalexin); continuous prophylaxis with methenamine hippurate; cranberry juice and cranberry products; oestrogen (topical) in postmenopausal women; passing urine after intercourse; postcoital antibiotic prophylaxis; single-dose self-administered antibiotic.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^59262603]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

ACOG Clinical Consensus — Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals — affecting approximately 8% of pregnancies, represent a spectrum from asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) to symptomatic acute cystitis to pyelonephritis, and are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including increased rates of preterm delivery and low birth weight. Urinary tract infections are classified by site as lower urinary tract (ASB or cystitis) or upper urinary tract (pyelonephritis), with asymptomatic bacteriuria identified in 2–10% of pregnant patients. Overall, Escherichia coli is the most common bacterial pathogen isolated in urine samples from pregnant individuals, and serious maternal complications of pyelonephritis include sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Screening for and treating asymptomatic bacteriuria have been shown in multiple studies to reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnancy.

This Guideline does not specifically consider patients in whom complicating factors may put them at higher risk for decreased treatment efficacy or for progression of a localized UTI to systemic infection, including an anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract such as stone disease, diverticulum, or neurogenic bladder, an immunocompromised host, or urinary foreign bodies such as indwelling urethral catheters or ureteral stents.

### Lower urinary tract infections: management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic Re-prescription in primary care [^66bb3fd4]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTIs) are a common reason for consultation in primary care, where most suspected episodes are managed. Uncomplicated lower UTIs generally resolve quickly and many are self-limiting, but 11% of women report to have experienced at least one UTI and 3% report to have experienced three or more UTIs in the previous year. There are marked differences across four European countries in culture positivity, antibiotic prescribing and re-consultation, despite similarities in the presentation of UTI in primary care, the pathogens and antibiotic sensitivities. The high incidence of UTI and tendency to recur leads to high healthcare costs.

UTIs are the second most common reason for antibiotic prescribing. In the UK, recent national clinical guidelines recommend treatment of lower UTIs with narrow spectrum antibiotics, particularly nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim, when the risk of resistance is low (e.g. considering previous antibiotic use and previous urine culture and sensitivity results). Amoxicillin or oral cephalosporins are advised for second or third line therapy for pregnant women and children aged 3 months or more. Choice of second line antibiotic therapy in adult men should be guided by culture results after considering alternative diagnoses to UTIs. Antibiotic use, even in short courses, can alter the normal microbial composition of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina, selecting for drug-resistant pathogens. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of five studies of UTIs managed in primary care found an increased risk of antibiotic resistance that persisted for up to one year and a higher risk associated with multiple courses of antibiotics. Evidence of a dose–response between the number of courses of amoxicillin and trimethoprim and resistance also exists. Antibiotic resistance is associated with higher morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. It is therefore important to avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and to make appropriate choices to treat UTIs.

This study aimed to describe current investigation, antibiotic treatment and antibiotic re-prescription rates (as a likely indicator of treatment failure) across the spectrum of all lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) managed in primary care in England, with reference to current guideline-defined groups of patients.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^89c3b649]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — patient education and shared decision-making emphasizes framing care beyond empiric antibiotics. It is reasonable to consider an approach to the diagnosis and treatment of rUTI as one of shared decision-making, in which patients are educated about the inaccuracy of diagnostic testing, the benefits and potential risks of antimicrobial use, and alternatives to standard antibiotic treatment, and we suggest documentation of the education provided and informed consent discussion. Many patients and providers do not know that localized cystitis typically is self-limited and rarely progresses to more severe disease, which can help define goals of care around symptom amelioration, prevention of long-term complications, and more appropriate antibiotic use.

### Urinary tract infections in adults… [^76ea8269]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

E. coli is responsible for more than 80 percent of uncomplicated UTIs, it accounts for fewer than one third of complicated cases. 1, 3 Clinically, the spectrum of complicated UTIs may range from cystitis to urosepsis with septic shock. 11, 21 Uncomplicated Pyelonephritis Women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis may present with one of the following: a mild cystitis-like illness and accompanying flank pain; a more severe illness with fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, leukocytosis and abdominal pain; or a serious gram-negative bacteremia. The microbiologic features of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis mirror cystitis, except that. S. saprophyticus is a rare cause. In most patients, uncomplicated pyelonephritis is caused by specific uropathogenic strains of E. coli possessing adhesins that permit ascending infection of the urinary tract. Catheter-Associated UTI Between 10 and 20 percent of patients who are hospitalized receive an indwelling Foley catheter.

Once this catheter is in place, the risk of bacteriuria is approximately 5 percent per day. With long-term catheterization, bacteriuria is inevitable. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections account for 40 percent of all nosocomial infections and are the most common source of gram-negative bacteremia in hospitalized patients. E. coli and Proteus, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Serratia and Candida species. The bacterial distribution reflects the nosocomial origin of the infections because so many of the uropathogens are acquired exogenously via manipulation of the catheter and drainage device. Bacteriuria is often polymicrobic, especially in patients with long-term indwelling urinary catheters. Asymptomatic Bacteriuria Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as the presence of more than 100, 000 CFU per mL of voided urine in persons with no symptoms of urinary tract infection. The largest patient population at risk for asymptomatic bacteriuria is the elderly.

Up to 40 percent of elderly men and women may have bacteriuria without symptoms. Although early studies noted an association between bacteriuria and excess mortality, more recent studies have failed to demonstrate any such link. Symptomatic urinary tract infections complicate 1 to 2 percent of pregnancies, usually in women with persistent bacteriuria.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^53aff546]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, even patients with "positive" urine cultures may have asymptomatic bacteriuria and thus not require treatment. Misdiagnosis of UTI is particularly common in elderly women who have other long-standing urinary tract symptoms, such as incontinence. – However, the maximum age cutoffs used in four out of five studies (50 to 70 years of age) likely avoided some challenges of diagnosing UTIs in the elderly — while also limiting generalizability to these groups. In summary, although there is a subset of individuals who clearly benefit from antibiotics, there is likely another segment that does not benefit from antibiotics and could be appropriately treated with NSAIDs or no therapy.

Another important finding from the included studies was that only 2.0–4.5% of individuals treated with NSAIDs subsequently developed pyelonephritis (based on 3 studies with 1130 patients). Thus, to avoid one case of pyelonephritis, 22 to 62 people would need to be treated with antibiotics. Notably, these reported rates of pyelonephritis in NSAID groups were higher than placebo arms of prior clinical trials (0.4%and 2.6%). While better follow-up to assess outcomes in the NSAID studies may be partially responsible, NSAIDs have also been associated with worse outcomes in other infections, such as community-acquired pneumonia, possibly due to immune suppresion. These and other potential adverse effects of NSAIDs must be better understood before these drugs can be used for uncomplicated UTI.

In summary, this review demonstrates the superiority of antibiotics over NSAIDs for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. However, future research should focus on better diagnosing UTI and stratifying women with uncomplicated UTIs to identify the subset that would benefit from antibiotic treatment while avoiding unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. Other potential antibiotic-sparing strategies should be further explored as well, including delayed antibiotic prescriptions for lingering symptoms only, point-of-care testing–driven prescribing algorithms, and provider audit reports and reminders. Given the high incidence of uncomplicated UTIs (and likely misdiagnosed UTIs) as well as the number of antibiotic prescriptions written for these infections, elimination of even a quarter of antibiotic prescriptions for uncomplicated UTIs would result in tens of thousands fewer antibiotic courses per year. Such a shift in practice patterns could have significant downstream ramifications, including reducing the number of adverse drug reactions, Clostridium difficile infections, and multi-drug resistant organisms.

An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

In women with rUTI, acute treatment can be initiated by a clinician or patient at symptom onset, and antibiotics are traditional first-line treatment of bacterial cystitis.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treating symptomatic uncomplicated urinary tract infections in non-pregnant adult women [^9d4fa18d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Almost half of all women will have at least one symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime. Although usually self-remitting, 74% of women contacting a health professional are prescribed an antibiotic, and in rare instances, they may progress to more severe infections. Therefore, the standard of care for the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs is oral antibiotic therapy, which aims to achieve symptom resolution and prevent the development of complications such as pyelonephritis. Given that a number of UTIs are self-remitting, non-antibiotic treatments that may help reduce the severity or duration of symptoms or reduce the need for antibiotics may be of benefit.

Objectives

This review aims to investigate the benefits and risks associated with the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs in non-pregnant adult women.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 18 November 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at the effectiveness of NSAIDs in the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs in non-pregnant adult women. The outcomes of interest were: 1) short-term resolution of symptoms (days 1 to 4); 2) medium-term resolution of symptoms (days 5 to 10); and 3) incidence of adverse events (including progression to sepsis or complicated UTI, hospitalisation or need for intravenous antibiotics, gastrointestinal complications, or death) up to 30 days from randomisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening, abstract selection, and data extraction were carried out independently by two authors, and any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third author. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Six studies (1646 randomised women) published between 2010 and 2019 met our inclusion criteria. The mean age ranged from 28 to 50 years; previous UTIs were reported in 7.2% to 77% of participants. There were five multicentre studies, and studies were carried out in Denmark, Germany, Korea, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. Overall, the risk of bias was low or unclear. Compared to antibiotics, NSAIDs probably result in less short-term resolution of symptoms (4 studies, 1144 participants: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.91; I² = 75%; moderate certainty) and may also result in less medium-term resolution of symptoms (4 studies, 1140 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; I² = 78%; low certainty). NSAIDs probably make little or no difference to the number of adverse events by day 30 (4 studies, 1165 participants: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33; I² = 64%; moderate certainty). NSAIDs may result in longer duration of symptoms (2 studies, 553 participants: MD 1.00 day, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.39; I² = 0%; low certainty). NSAIDs may result in a lower proportion of women experiencing microbiological resolution by day 10 compared to antibiotics (2 studies, 322 participants: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.85; I² = 0%; low certainty) and probably result in more women using rescue antibiotic treatment by day 30 (4 studies, 1165 participants: RR 3.14, 95% CI 2.23 to 4.42; I² = 49%; moderate certainty). Compared to placebo, NSAIDs may reduce the use of rescue antibiotic treatment (1 study, 183 participants: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; low certainty evidence) but may make little or no difference to adverse events at day 30. Compared to the herbal product Uva-Ursi, NSAIDs may make little or no difference to adverse events by day 30.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of NSAIDs for symptomatic management of uncomplicated UTIs probably results in less short-term resolution of symptoms and greater use of rescue antibiotics by day 30 compared to primary antibiotic treatment. Future studies should consider the various confounders such as degree of symptoms, microbiology, type and resistance patterns of bacteria involved and number of UTI episodes in the months prior to commencement of treatment.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Full text papers for all eligible studies were obtained, and three reviewers (AB, CC, and IL) extracted data independently using a purpose built spreadsheet. The following information was extracted from each paper, when provided: author, journal, year of publication, study design, study country, economic status, participants and recruitment location, recruitment time period, age range, method of urine sample collection and testing, method of antimicrobial sensitivity testing, bacteria cultured and reported antibiotic sensitivities, previously prescribed antibiotics, and time between antibiotic exposure and urine sample collection. Level of development was measured with the OECD status of the country in which the study was conducted. The OECD is an international economic organisation first established in 1948, now made up of 34 countries, which aims to work together and with emerging and developing economies to reduce poverty through economic growth and financial stability. Member countries tend to be "developed" countries, whereas non-member countries tend to be "developing". We used OECD status as a general measure of country level development and primary care infrastructure and a proxy marker for use of over-the-counter antibiotics. For antimicrobial exposure, time was generally recorded as a period of days, weeks, or months before the urine sample was taken and resistance was measured with standard local laboratory methods. When any information was unclear in the paper, we contacted authors for clarification.

Education and informed decision-making — supportive care and risk of progression note that the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is enhanced by the unnecessary antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and that the diagnosis of UTI is highly imprecise. While no evidence exists to support the concept of withholding antimicrobials to patients with rUTIs, substantial effort should be made to avoid unnecessary treatment unless there is a high suspicion of UTI. For patients with episodes of acute cystitis without complicating factors, there is minimal risk of progression to tissue invasion or pyelonephritis, and additional characteristics of great concern do not reliably indicate risk or presence of bacteremic bacteriuria or pyelonephritis. In a representative study of older patients with bacteremia who had the same bacterial species cultured from the urine, only 1 of 37 participants aged 75 years and older had symptoms consistent with UTI, such as dysuria. Multiple randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that antibiotic treatment for acute cystitis offers little but mildly faster symptomatic improvement compared to placebo in patients with acute dysuria and significant bacteriuria, and the incidence of pyelonephritis in these patients is low and is not substantially different in individuals receiving antibiotics versus those treated with supportive care of analgesics and hydration; expectant management with analgesics and hydration while awaiting culture results is likely underutilized.

### Cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections caused by Gram-negative uropathogens: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial [^f9b460db]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria represent the highest priority for addressing global antibiotic resistance. Cefiderocol (S-649266), a new siderophore cephalosporin, has broad activity against Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, including carbapenem-resistant strains. We assessed the efficacy and safety of cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection in patients at risk of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections.

Methods

We did a phase 2, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group non-inferiority trial at 67 hospitals in 15 countries. Adults (≥ 18 years) admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of complicated urinary tract infection with or without pyelonephritis or those with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis were randomly assigned (2:1) by an interactive web or voice response system to receive 1 h intravenous infusions of cefiderocol (2 g) or imipenem-cilastatin (1 g each) three times daily, every 8 h for 7–14 days. Patients were excluded if they had a baseline urine culture with more than two uropathogens, a fungal urinary tract infection, or pathogens known to be carbapenem resistant. The primary endpoint was the composite of clinical and microbiological outcomes at test of cure (ie, 7 days after treatment cessation), which was used to establish non-inferiority (15% and 20% margins) of cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin. The primary efficacy analysis was done on a modified intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned individuals who received at least one dose of study drug and had a qualifying Gram-negative uropathogen (≥ 1×10⁵ colony-forming units [CFU]/mL). Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned individuals who received at least one dose of study drug, according to the treatment they received. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02321800.

Findings

Between Feb 5, 2015, and Aug 16, 2016, 452 patients were randomly assigned to cefiderocol (n = 303) or imipenem-cilastatin (n = 149), of whom 448 patients (n = 300 in the cefiderocol group; n = 148 in the imipenem-cilastatin group) received treatment. 371 patients (n = 252 patients in the cefiderocol group; n = 119 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group) had qualifying Gram-negative uropathogen (≥ 1×10⁵ CFU/mL) and were included in the primary efficacy analysis. At test of cure, the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved by 183 (73%) of 252 patients in the cefiderocol group and 65 (55%) of 119 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group, with an adjusted treatment difference of 18·58% (95% CI 8·23–28·92; p = 0·0004), establishing the non-inferiority of cefiderocol. Cefiderocol was well tolerated. Adverse events occurred in 122 (41%) of 300 patients in the cefiderocol group and 76 (51%) of 148 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group, with gastrointestinal disorders (ie, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain) the most common adverse events for both treatment groups (35 [12%] patients in the cefiderocol group and 27 [18%] patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group).

Interpretation

Intravenous infusion of cefiderocol (2 g) three times daily was non-inferior compared with imipenem-cilastatin (1 g each) for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection in people with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. The results of this study will provide the basis for submission of a New Drug Application to the US Food and Drug Administration. Clinical trials of hospital-acquired pneumonia and carbapenem-resistant infections are ongoing.

### Current antibiotic resistance patterns of rare uropathogens: survey from central European urology department 2011–2019 [^d96c96e9]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

With approximately 150–250 million cases occurring globally per year, urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent some of the most common infectious diseases in humans. Gram-negative enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. are their most common causative agents. UTIs occur more frequently among women than in men: 50% of females will experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. Recurrences are common and besides associated morbidity, UTIs put pressure on health care systems, too. While the cost of treatment of a single UTI episode is insignificant, their frequent incidence means they consume a non-negligible part of the health care budget: in France alone, the expense for adult female UTIs amounted to 58 million euro in 2012. Complicated UTIs are even more costly: one episode of a complicated UTI costs between 4028 and 7740 euro depending on the health care system.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a major concern threathening many an advance of medicine in the twenty-first century. Uropathogenic microorganisms are no exception to this: rates of AMR among Enterobacteriaceae are increasing globally, albeit with temporal and spatial differences. Antibiotic consumption is a primary driver for the spread of AMR as evidenced on local and country levels. For instance, southern European states exhibit higher AMR rates than northern ones. Of note, four top antibiotic prescribers in Europe (Greece, Cyprus, France and Italy) belong among south European countries.

International guidelines for UTI treatment are freely available; yet, poor antibiotic prescription remains common. Thirty percent of primary care antibiotic prescriptions were inadequate in a report from the United States. Appropriate antibiotic treatment was reported in 68% of adult cystitis cases and only 46% of pyelonephritis cases in another survey.

### Urinary catheter-associated infections [^bfc9cb63]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on catheter-associated urinary tract infection:

- **Definition**: CA-UTI is a common hospital-acquired infection characterized by various medical complications such as catheter encrustation, bladder stones, septicemia, endotoxic shock, and pyelonephritis.
- **Pathophysiology**: Colonization of the urinary catheter and/or uroepithelial cells, evasion of host defenses, replication, and damage to host cells by uropathogens are involved in the development of CA-UTI. Common microbiological agents include E. coli, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, C. freundii, Providentia rettgeri, and C. albicans.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include fever, urethritis, cystitis, acute pyelonephritis, renal scarring, calculus formation, and bacteremia. Disease progression may lead to urosepsis and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Several studies report an association between catheter-associated infection, increased mortality, and prolonged length of stay in acute care facilities.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of… [^9b1ec760]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. Pharmacotherapy can be considered for the prevention of UTIs in women with recurrent UTIs. Similarly, a nonblinded RCT compared methenamine with trimethoprim for preventing recurrent UTIs over 12 months in women aged 18 years and older found noninferiority for methenamine, with no significant difference in UTI recurrence rates between the 2 groups and similar adverse effects. 32 Therefore, we recommend the use of methenamine as an alternative to prophylactic antibiotics in patients with intact bladder anatomy. Cystitis, an inflammation of the bladder often indicated by dysuria, urgency, and suprapubic pain, is typically described not to show systemic infection signs like fever. Unfortunately, complicated UTI lacks a standard clinical definition due to diverse criteria in literature and guidelines.

Complicated UTIs may involve catheters or other foreign bodies, complicating factors like structural anomalies or immunosuppression, or systemic symptoms. Pyelonephritis, kidney inflammation due to infection, includes cystitis symptoms plus systemic signs like fever and flank pain. More precise clinical definitions, based on clinical studies linked to outcomes, are needed. Most WikiGuidelines authors strongly encourage the use of more precise descriptions of UTI in clinical practice rather than continuing to use vague terms, such as complicated or uncomplicated. The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. A UA encompasses physical, chemical, and microscopic evaluations designed to aid in diagnosing kidney, metabolic, oncologic, and infectious disorders. Unfortunately, the diagnostic value of UA for UTI is limited.

45, 46 While the absence of pyuria can help rule out infection in most patient populations, the positive predictive value of pyuria for diagnosing infection is exceedingly low as it often indicates the presence of genitourinary inflammation due to many other possible noninfectious reasons. Presence of risk factors for antimicrobial resistance along with clinical severity also play an important role in the selection of empirical choices. 76, 77, 182 For patients with uncomplicated cystitis, nitrofurantoin is a reasonable drug of choice, based on robust evidence of efficacy and its ability to spare use of more systemically active agents for treating other infections. 78 For patients with pyelonephritis, TMP/SMX or a first-generation cephalosporin represent reasonable first-line agents but should be dependent upon local resistance rates.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^44df207f]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this systematic review, we evaluated five randomized controlled trials (of 1309 patients) comparing NSAIDs with antibiotics for treatment of uncomplicated UTI. Although study protocols and reported outcomes were heterogeneous, two smaller studies that were at high and unclear risk of bias found no difference between NSAIDs and antibiotics, while three studies with low risk of bias supported antibiotic therapy over NSAIDs in terms of symptom resolution. Furthermore, two studies at low risk of bias found higher risks of pyelonephritis in patients who received NSAIDs versus antibiotics; the third study with low risk of bias also found a higher risk of pyelonephritis in patients receiving NSAIDs, but the confidence interval for the risk difference included zero. In sum, these findings support the use of antibiotics as first-line treatment for uncomplicated UTI for both symptom resolution and prevention of pyelonephritis.

Despite the superiority of antibiotic therapy, 39–58% of participants in the NSAID groups achieved symptom resolution by day 3 or 4. For comparison, a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials demonstrated clinical success (symptom improvement or resolution by first follow-up visit) in 25–54% of participants in the placebo arms. One possible explanation for why many UTI symptoms resolved without antibiotic therapy is that not all women included in the studies may have had true UTIs. Inclusion in most studies was based on symptoms alone — a commonly accepted approach for uncomplicated UTIsthat is consistent with several clinical practice guidelines from countries where the trials were conducted. – However, clinical symptoms only correctly diagnose UTIs half of the time. Thus, it is possible that a large number of participants may not have had a UTI or been at risk of worsening infection. Indeed, in the four studies that collected urine specimens for culture at the time of inclusion, only 64–86% of patients in either study arm had positive cultures. Women often suffer from urinary symptoms for a host of reasons (e.g. incontinence, medication side effects) that are misdiagnosed as a UTI. Barriers to obtaining timely urine testing often promote alternatives to testing, such as "as needed" antibiotic prescriptions or prescriptions by phone.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^456bf206]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

One potential antibiotic-sparing treatment for UTI is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which potentially provides relief from dysuria related to elevated prostaglandin E2 levels. Targeting symptom relief is particularly attractive as dysuria, frequency, and urgency may be misattributed to UTI when in fact no infection is present (e.g. "urethral syndrome"). Furthermore, though evidence is mixed, NSAIDs may also have direct antimicrobial properties. – Within this context, Bleidorn and colleagues demonstrated in a 2010 randomized pilot study that NSAIDs were non-inferior for improving symptoms as well as preventing relapse and non-serious adverse events when compared with antibiotics for uncomplicated UTI. Conversely, in 2015, Gágyor and colleagues found treatment with NSAIDs to be less effective compared with treatment with antibiotics for symptom relief and to result in more cases of pyelonephritis. Similarly, evidence has been mixed for using NSAIDs for UTI in other contexts. While NSAIDs may be less effective than antibiotics for inpatient UTI, there is a potential role for NSAID therapy as part of antibiotic stewardship efforts that include delayed antibiotic prescriptions.

To better understand whether NSAIDs may help in management of UTI and reduce overall antibiotic prescribing, we performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to determine the effect of treatment with NSAIDs versus antibiotics for uncomplicated UTI on symptom resolution, development of infectious complications, and antibiotic prescribing frequency.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^87d51ded]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute cystitis:

- **Definition**: Acute bacterial cystitis is defined as an infection of the urinary tract with acute-onset symptoms, such as dysuria in conjunction with variable degrees of increased urinary urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence, evidence of urinary tract inflammation (pyuria ≥ 5 WBC/high power field on microscopic urinalysis, and the presence of bacterial uropathogen. Localized urinary traction infection (previously uncomplicated urinary traction infection) is an infection of the urinary tract in a healthy patient with an anatomically and functionally normal urinary tract, no signs or symptoms of upper urinary involvement or bacteremia, and no known complicating factors that would make the patient susceptible to progression to a systemic infection. Systemic UTI is an infection of the urinary tract with signs and symptoms of systemic infection, with or without localized symptoms originating from any site in the urinary tract. Recurrent UTI is defined as two separate episodes of acute bacterial cystitis and associated symptoms over a 6-month period within the preceding year. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine that causes no illness or symptoms.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute uncomplicated cystitis is mostly caused by bacteria, including E. coli (86%), S. saprophyticus (4%), Klebsiella species (3%), Proteus species (3%), Enterobacter species (1.4%), Citrobacter species (0.8%), and Enterococcus species (0.5%).
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for acute uncomplicated cystitis include female gender, recent sexual activity, use of a diaphragm with spermicide, and a history of recurrent UTIs. Complicating factors for UTIs include patient factors that place an individual at higher risk for development of a UTI and potentially decrease efficacy of therapy. Such factors include anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract (stone disease, diverticulum, neurogenic bladder), immunocompromised host, and indwelling urinary tract foreign body (indwelling urethral catheters, ureteral stents).
- **Disease course**: Bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract results in acute uncomplicated cystitis, which causes classic symptoms of dysuria, frequent voiding of small volumes, and urinary urgency. Occasional hematuria and suprapubic discomfort may be present.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute uncomplicated cystitis is not associated with an increase in mortality.

Search strategy and selection criteria

We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane for articles published in any language between 1955 and October 2015. MeSH terms for these databases included "drug resistance", "antimicrobial resistance", "bacterial resistance", "primary health care", "urinary tract infections", and "children". MeSH terms were combined with text word searches that included "antibiotic(s)", "primary care", "family practice", "ambulatory care", "community", "UTI", and "urinary bacteria". Grey and unpublished literature was searched for with ISI Web of Knowledge software and included journal articles, patents, websites, conference proceedings, government and national reports, and open access material. We screened reference lists of selected key papers and contacted authors who appeared multiple times to request details of further published and unpublished work. All full text papers were subject to citation searches. Appendix 1 details the full search strategy. Our review protocol was published on PROSPERO.

Two independent reviewers (AB and HT) screened all titles and abstracts independently for eligibility. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: investigated and reported patterns of resistance in laboratory diagnosed E coli positive isolates from children with urinary tract infection from primary care, defined as the first point of contact in the healthcare system; or investigated associations between previous antibiotic exposure and bacterial resistance; and study participants were children and young people aged 0–17 presenting with symptoms of urinary tract infection who had provided a urine sample. We included hospital based studies when it was clear that the investigation was for community acquired urinary tract infection, defined as a laboratory diagnosed infection from urine samples taken within 48 hours of admission.

### Relationship among bacterial virulence, bladder dysfunction, vesicoureteral reflux and patterns of urinary tract infection in children [^063d8f10]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

We hypothesized that virulence levels of Escherichia coli isolates causing pediatric urinary tract infections differ according to severity of infection and also among various uropathies known to contribute to pediatric urinary tract infections. We evaluated these relationships using in vitro cytokine interleukin-6 elicitation.

Materials and Methods

E. coli isolates were cultured from children presenting with urinary tract infections. In vitro cytokine (interleukin-6) elicitation was quantified for each isolate and the bacteria were grouped according to type of infection and underlying uropathy (neurogenic bladder, nonneurogenic bowel and bladder dysfunction, primary vesicoureteral reflux, no underlying etiology).

Results

A total of 40 E. coli isolates were collected from children with a mean age of 61.5 months (range 1 to 204). Mean level of in vitro cytokine elicitation from febrile urinary tract infection producing E. coli was significantly lower than for nonfebrile strains (p = 0.01). The interleukin-6 response to E. coli in the neurogenic bladder group was also significantly higher than in the vesicoureteral reflux (p = 0.01) and no underlying etiology groups (p = 0.02).

Conclusions

In vitro interleukin-6 elicitation, an established marker to determine bacterial virulence, correlates inversely with clinical urinary tract infection severity. Less virulent, high cytokine producing E. coli were more likely to cause cystitis and were more commonly found in patients with neurogenic bladder and nonneurogenic bowel and bladder dysfunction, whereas higher virulence isolates were more likely to produce febrile urinary tract infections and to affect children with primary vesicoureteral reflux and no underlying etiology. These findings suggest that bacteria of different virulence levels may be responsible for differences in severity of pediatric urinary tract infections and may vary among different underlying uropathies.
