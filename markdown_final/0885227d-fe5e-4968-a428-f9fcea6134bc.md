## Question

ACE inhibitor to close patent ductus arteriosus in adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using ACE inhibitors to close a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which medications are proven to close the ductus and in what populations. Then, I should review how PDA is managed in adults and confirm whether any guideline or series endorses medication-based closure. Next, I will check if ACE inhibitors have been studied for ductal closure or have a biologically plausible mechanism to induce ductal constriction. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion about their role, if any, and contrast it with the standard of care for adult PDA closure [^113Pade5] [^116HK1N1].

> Let me first confirm the standard pharmacologic agents for ductal closure. Indomethacin and ibuprofen — both cyclooxygenase inhibitors — are the principal drugs with evidence for PDA closure, and they are effective primarily in premature infants; indomethacin is FDA-labeled specifically for closing a hemodynamically significant PDA in premature infants 500–1,750 g, and multiple Cochrane syntheses support ibuprofen as an effective alternative with a different adverse-effect profile [^1143UpA1] [^1122ETx8] [^116HP8Uf]. Wait, let me verify the role of acetaminophen as well; yes, acetaminophen has emerging evidence and case series support as a fallback or adjunct when prostaglandin inhibitors fail or are contraindicated, again in preterm populations, not adults [^116opMrc] [^111vnc4k]. I should also confirm age dependence — pharmacologic closure is largely ineffective and generally not recommended beyond the early neonatal window or in term infants, underscoring that medical closure is a preterm-focused strategy rather than an adult one [^112PF34Q].

> Next, I should review adult PDA management. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — do contemporary adult-focused reviews or registries mention any role for pharmacologic closure? The mainstay in older infants, children, and adults is transcatheter device occlusion, with surgery reserved for anatomically unfavorable PDAs; pharmacologic therapy is not recommended for adult PDA closure and is considered ineffective beyond the first postnatal months [^113Pade5] [^112E2XhD]. I need to check safety and feasibility data in adults and larger patients; multicenter registries and adult series consistently show high success and low major adverse event rates with device or coil closure, further reinforcing procedural — not medical — management in this age group [^114mbiWN] [^111W7G4X] [^116Svoga].

> Wait, let me verify whether ACE inhibitors are mentioned anywhere as ductal-closure agents. I will now examine the pediatric Medicaid cohort that grouped ACE inhibitors among afterload-reducing agents; in that analysis, use of ACE inhibitors was associated with higher odds of undergoing PDA repair, which reads as a marker of hemodynamic management in sicker patients rather than an agent for ductal closure itself, and no study signal suggests ACE inhibitors close the ductus [^115AiRUq]. Let me double-check the pharmacologic closure literature and guidelines; ACE inhibitors are not included among agents used to achieve ductal constriction in preterm infants, and they are absent from adult PDA closure recommendations, which emphasize device or surgical closure rather than medications [^1122ETx8] [^113Pade5].

> Hold on, I should verify the mechanistic plausibility. ACE inhibitors act within the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system to reduce afterload and preload; they do not inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which is central to ductal constriction, nor do they directly target the transcriptional and structural remodeling pathways that complete anatomical closure, such as those involving TFAP2B, endothelin, HIF2α, vimentin, and Notch signaling in ductal smooth muscle and endothelium [^115dxge6] [^111rBU9r] [^114r9GCC]. I need to ensure I am not overlooking any RAAS-mediated effect on ductal tone; to my knowledge and based on available reviews, no evidence supports ACE inhibition as a trigger for ductal constriction or remodeling leading to closure [^115dxge6].

> But wait, what if ACE inhibitors "functionally" help by reducing left-to-right shunt volume and heart failure symptoms — could that be misconstrued as closure? Let me reconsider that. Symptom improvement from afterload reduction does not equate to anatomical ductal occlusion; definitive elimination of the shunt in adults requires transcatheter device occlusion (or surgery in selected anatomies), as consistently reflected in adult case series and multicenter registries, not pharmacologic manipulation of systemic vascular resistance [^113Pade5] [^114mbiWN] [^116MdwjB]. I should confirm that even in complex adult scenarios, like severe pulmonary hypertension, catheter-based strategies are evaluated for feasibility and response, again underscoring interventional — not ACE inhibitor — solutions for closure [^116Svoga].

> Synthesizing this, I need to be precise. ACE inhibitors are not used to close a PDA in adults; they may be used adjunctively for hemodynamic management of heart failure or volume overload due to chronic left-to-right shunting, but they do not induce ductal constriction or anatomical closure, and no guideline endorses them for this purpose [^115AiRUq] [^113Pade5]. The standard of care for adult PDA closure is transcatheter device occlusion when anatomy permits, with surgical repair reserved for unfavorable ducts, and pharmacologic closure has no role in the adult setting [^112E2XhD] [^114mbiWN].

ACE inhibitors are **not effective** for closing patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in adults [^116xa2eD] and are **not recommended** for this purpose [^113Pade5]. They **do not target the prostaglandin-mediated pathway** required for ductal closure [^115dxge6] and may worsen hemodynamics by increasing shunt flow. The standard of care for adult PDA is transcatheter device closure [^114mbiWN], with surgical ligation reserved for cases unsuitable for catheter-based intervention [^112E2XhD] [^116xa2eD].

---

## Pharmacological rationale and mechanism of action

ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensin II and increase bradykinin, causing vasodilation and lower systemic vascular resistance. However, they **do not inhibit prostaglandin synthesis** [^115dxge6], which is central to ductal closure; NSAIDs (indomethacin [^1143UpA1], ibuprofen) [^1122ETx8] achieve closure by reducing prostaglandin E2, but ACE inhibitors do not.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for ACE inhibitors to close PDA in adults [^113Pade5]. They are not included in any adult PDA management recommendations [^116xa2eD], and no trials or case series support their use for this indication.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

ACE inhibitors can **increase left-to-right shunt flow** by lowering systemic resistance, potentially worsening heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. They also carry risks of hypotension, renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and cough, which may complicate management in adults with hemodynamically significant PDA.

---

## Current standard of care for PDA closure in adults

The standard of care for adult PDA is **transcatheter device closure** [^114mbiWN], which is safe and effective with high success and low complication rates [^1112pWUY]. Surgical ligation is reserved for anatomically unsuitable cases or when transcatheter closure is not feasible [^113Pade5].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

ACE inhibitors are **not effective for PDA closure in adults** and are not recommended [^113Pade5]. They do not address the prostaglandin pathway required for closure [^115dxge6] and may worsen hemodynamics. Transcatheter device closure remains the preferred definitive therapy [^116xa2eD], with surgery as a backup for unsuitable cases [^113Pade5].

- **Treatments in older patients (term infant through adulthood)**: Beyond the first postnatal months, term infants are outside the window when pharmacological therapy (indomethacin and ibuprofen) to close the ductus is effective. Although diuretics may be used to treat pulmonary overcirculation among term infants with a PDA in the first months of life, decisions about the need for ductal closure are largely driven by the presence (or absence) of HSPDA, with consideration to the direction of ductal shunting and pulmonary artery systemic pressure and/or pulmonary vascular resistance indexed to systemic pressure (see Figure 5). The frequency and timing of outpatient follow-up are determined on the basis of PDA classification.

Transcatheter PDA closure remains the mainstay for definitive ductal closure in older patients. In patients weighing > 6 kg, most PDAs are amenable to transcatheter occlusion, with the notable exception of the type B ductus (see Figure 2). According to 2011 guidelines from the American Heart Association on cardiac catheterization in pediatric heart disease, based on consensus expert opinion, transcatheter PDA occlusion is indicated in older patients for the treatment of an HSPDA with "left-to-right shunt that results in any of the following: congestive heart failure, failure to thrive, pulmonary overcirculation, or an enlarged left atrium or left ventricle, provided the anatomy and patient size are suitable" (class I).

### Transcriptional regulation during development of the ductus arteriosus [^111rBU9r]. Circulation Research (2008). Low credibility.

The ductus arteriosus is a specialized blood vessel containing highly differentiated and contractile vascular smooth muscle, largely derived from neural crest cells, that is essential for fetal life but typically closes after birth. Impaired development of the ductus arteriosus or disruption of signaling pathways that initiate postnatal closure can result in persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus, the third most common congenital heart defect. We found that Tfap2beta, a transcription factor associated with patent ductus arteriosus in humans, was uniquely expressed in mouse ductal smooth muscle.

- **Endothelin-1 and hypoxia-induced transcription factor expression**: Endothelin-1 and the hypoxia-induced transcription factor, Hif2alpha, were highly enriched in ductal smooth muscle at embryonic day 13.5 and were dependent on Tfap2beta for their expression in this domain. Hif2alpha functioned as a negative regulator of Tfap2beta-induced transcription by disrupting protein-DNA interactions, suggesting a negative feedback loop regulating Tfap2beta activity.

Our data indicate that Tfap2beta, Et-1, and Hif2alpha act in a transcriptional network during ductal smooth muscle development. Disruption of this pathway may contribute to patent ductus arteriosus by affecting the development of smooth muscle within the ductus arteriosus.

### Amplatzer piccolo occluder clinical trial for percutaneous closure of the patent ductus arteriosus in patients ≥ 700 grams [^112vvHz5]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to characterize the safety and effectiveness of the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure. The presence of a hemodynamically significant PDA has been associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in children born premature.

This was a single arm, prospective, multicenter, non-randomized study conducted to evaluate the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder in treating PDA in patients weighing ≥ 700g. From June 2017 to February 2019, 200 patients were enrolled at nine centers, with 100 patients weighing ≤ 2kg. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the rate of PDA closure at the 6-month follow-up, while the primary safety endpoint was the rate of major complications over 6 months. A secondary endpoint was the rate of significant pulmonary or aortic obstruction through the 6-month follow-up.

The implant success rate was 95.5% (191/200) overall and 99% in patients ≤ 2 kg (99/100). The primary effectiveness endpoint was achieved in 99.4% of implanted patients. Four patients experienced a primary safety endpoint event, including two transfusions, one hemolysis, and one aortic obstruction. There were no branch pulmonary artery obstructions. Five patients, all ≤ 2 kg, were noted to have worsening tricuspid regurgitation (TR) after the procedure, although none of the TR incidences manifested clinically. The Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder received FDA approval in January 2019 and became the first device approved for PDA closure in patients weighing ≥ 700g.

This study supports the safety and effectiveness of the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder, particularly in patients weighing between 700g and 2kg.

### The ductus arteriosus: A refined approach [^113qSYtV]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Although the ongoing patency of the ductus arteriosus is common in extremely preterm infants, consensus is lacking regarding its clinical significance and treatment strategies. The literature on the likelihood of spontaneous closure, impact on neonatal morbidity and long-term outcomes, and adverse effects of intervention has led to uncertainty regarding the best course of action.

Enhancing the determination of hemodynamic significance and refining patient selection for therapeutic intervention will streamline the decision-making process. Targeted neonatal echocardiography performed by the clinician has gained popularity worldwide, and preliminary data show that it has the potential to optimize patient outcomes.

We review the arguments for and against medical and surgical therapy and explore how targeted neonatal echocardiography, used in conjunction with biomarkers, may refine the treatment approach. Future directions in the field are also considered.

This article reviews the physiology of the ductus arteriosus, the pathophysiology of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and the role advanced imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can play in guiding diagnosis and percutaneous or surgical intervention.

A PDA can have variable clinical and radiologic presentations and can be important to characterize in patients with vascular rings, aortic maldevelopment, and congenital heart disease. An understanding of the PDA and the application of CT and MRI can allow the radiologist to provide key information to physicians who plan to close a PDA or maintain PDA patency in the setting of ductal-dependent congenital heart disease.

### Interventions for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews [^116HK1N1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

With increasing emphasis on conservative management, surgical PDA ligation is primarily reserved for infants with persistent symptomatic PDA following the failure of medical management. Surgical PDA ligation is associated with reduced mortality, but surviving infants were found to be at increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment, which could be due to lack of studies addressing survival bias and confounding by indication.

### Failure of ductus arteriosus closure is associated with increased mortality in preterm infants [^112gcmL7]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Because the standard of care has been to attempt to close the patent ductus arteriosus in preterm neonates, there is a paucity of information on the outcome of patients with a persistent patent ductus arteriosus. Our objective was to compare the mortality of preterm infants with and without a persistent patent ductus arteriosus.

This was a single-center, retrospective study. Very preterm infants (birth weight ≤ 1500 g and gestational age ≤ 29 weeks) who survived beyond the first three postnatal days and did not undergo surgical ligation were included in the primary analysis. The mortality of neonates with a persistent and a closed patent ductus arteriosus was compared during the initial hospitalization using the chi-squared test. Cox proportional hazard regression and logistic regression were employed to account for the time until death and to assess the independent effect of each risk factor on mortality. We conducted three secondary analyses by excluding patients who died during the first seven and 14 postnatal days, and by including patients who underwent surgical ligation with different group assignments. A persistent patent ductus arteriosus was defined as a failure of either spontaneous or pharmacologic ductal closure during the initial hospitalization.

Patients with a persistent patent ductus arteriosus (n = 41) had lower birth weight and were less mature than those with a closed ductus (n = 260). The unadjusted mortality rate was higher in patients with a persistent ductus (70.7%) than in those with a closed ductus (11.2%). After adjustment for perinatal factors…

### Study protocol: Baby-OSCAR trial: Outcome after selective early treatment for closure of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm babies, a multicentre, masked, randomised placebo-controlled parallel group trial [^113ZYHup]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The ductus arteriosus (DA) is a vessel that allows blood from the right ventricle to bypass the fetal lungs to the placenta. In term babies, it closes spontaneously after birth when breathing is established and is structurally closed following a few days. However, in a large number of preterm babies, the vessel does not close spontaneously, resulting in a condition known as patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Around 7,000 extremely preterm babies (< 29 weeks' gestation) are born in the UK every year. In 40%, the PDA will fail to close spontaneously, even by four months of age.

- **Complications and consequences**: PDA is associated with a number of serious and life-threatening short and long-term complications. Complications of prematurity such as low blood pressure (hypotension), bleeding in the lungs (pulmonary hemorrhage), and brain (intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH)) present soon after birth. Other systemic complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) present before discharge. Long-term health problems such as neurodevelopmental disability and chronic respiratory issues can also be associated with PDA. The persistence of PDA has been reported to be associated with an eight-fold increase in neonatal mortality. Additionally, it places a significant financial burden on the National Health Service (NHS).

- **Historical approaches**: Historically, clinicians concerned about symptomatic PDA or complications of prematurity have attempted to close PDA using medical (pharmacological) or surgical treatment. Traditionally, medical treatment is instituted as prophylactic treatment.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: pathophysiology and management [^115WKVXq]. Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm newborns prior to 28 weeks of gestation presents many challenges regarding the type and timing of treatment regimens. A PDA results in increased pulmonary blood flow and redistribution of flow to other organs. Several co-morbidities, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary edema/hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and retinopathy, are associated with the presence of a PDA. However, it remains unclear whether a PDA is responsible for their development. The prostaglandin inhibitor indomethacin is effective in the treatment of PDA. Questions regarding the optimal timing of the intervention — whether early prophylaxis or treatment once signs and symptoms become evident — have challenged physicians for decades. Both evidence and experience are examined in this article. The comparative physiology between full-term and preterm newborns, as well as the barriers preventing the necessary cascade of events leading to the permanent constriction of the PDA, are reviewed.

### Ibuprofen for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm or low birth weight (or both) infants [^116HP8Uf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Indomethacin is used as standard therapy to close a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) but is associated with reduced blood flow to several organs. Ibuprofen, another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, may be as effective as indomethacin with fewer adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared with indomethacin, other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, placebo, or no intervention for closing a patent ductus arteriosus in preterm, low-birth-weight, or both preterm and low-birth-weight infants.

- **Search methods**: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 30 November 2017), Embase (1980 to 30 November 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 30 November 2017). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of ibuprofen for the treatment of a PDA in preterm, low birth weight, or both preterm and low-birth-weight newborn infants.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data collection and analysis conformed to the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

- **Main results**: We included 39 studies enrolling 2843 infants. Ibuprofen (IV) versus placebo: IV Ibuprofen (3 doses) reduced the failure to close a PDA compared with placebo (typical relative risk (RR); 0.62 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.86).

### Transcatheter closure of large patent ductus arteriosus using custom made devices [^114UeY72]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

There has been a paradigm shift in the transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) over the last 45 years. With the availability of various coils, plugs, and occluders, PDAs of almost all shapes and sizes are amenable to transcatheter closure. However, very large PDAs diagnosed later in life are often referred for surgical closure due to the unavailability of large-size devices, especially in developing countries. In this case series, we describe four patients with large PDAs, three of which were closed using custom-made transcatheter PDA occluders.

We report a case of a 24-year-old woman with an aneurysmal patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) that was percutaneously closed using an Amplatzer Vascular Plug II. This is the first report of the successful use of an Amplatzer Vascular Plug II for a PDA and suggests the feasibility and safety of its utilization in select cases.

### Transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults [^116Svoga]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults carries a higher risk than in children.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the application of self-expandable occluders for transcatheter closure of PDA associated with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults, and the assessment of immediate and short-term results.

- **Methods**: Twenty-nine adult patients (6 men, 23 women) underwent attempted transcatheter closure of PDA at a mean (standard deviation, SD) age of 31.1 (11.4) years, ranging from 18–58 years, and a mean (SD) weight of 54.1 (7.1) kg, ranging from 42–71 kg. On the basis of haemodynamic and clinical data obtained before and after trial occlusion, the final duct occlusion was determined and carried out. Radiographs of the chest, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms were used for follow-up evaluation of the treatment within 1 day, 1 month, and 3–6 months after successful closure.

- **Results**: Twenty of the 29 patients had successful occlusion (group 1), and 9 patients failed (group 2). In group 1, where occlusion was successful, mean (SD) pulmonary arterial pressures decreased markedly after trial occlusion: 78 (19.3) mm Hg, with a range of 50–125 mm Hg, before occlusion, and 41 (13.8) mm Hg, with a range of 23–77 mm Hg, after occlusion. Systemic arterial oxygen saturation was found to be > 90% in 19 patients and 95% during inhalation of oxygen or after occlusion in all 20 patients. In group 2, the occlusion was not successful because in two patients the device was not available.

### Chest CT examinations in patients presenting with acute chest pain: a pictorial review [^112E2XhD]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) results from the failure of the physiological mechanism that closes the fetal duct between the left pulmonary artery and the thoracic aorta after birth. Isolated PDA is estimated to account for 10–12% of all congenital heart diseases, and presentation in adult life is rare. Clinical manifestations of PDA mainly depend on ductus size and the pressure gradient that may lead to pulmonary hypertension and consequently to chest pain. PDA can be tolerated for many years without clinical signs or symptoms. However, patients may become symptomatic when associated with acquired conditions such as pneumonia or the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. For adults, transcatheter occlusion of the patent ductus is the preferred treatment. CT provides valuable pre-treatment information regarding the localization, size, and shape of the duct.

A 61-year-old female patient visited the emergency department with chest pain and mild dyspnea. The patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and had carried a pacemaker since 2000. Echocardiography showed a questionable PDA, and a thoracic CTA was ordered. The axial CT image (Fig. 13a) shows a tubular structure (arrow) abutting the aorta with adjacent coarse calcification. The sagittal multiplanar reconstruction (Fig. 13b) shows enhanced blood flowing from the aorta to the pulmonary artery via the PDA.

### Path toward proactive therapy for patent ductus arteriosus [^111NsUpB]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

Traditional approaches in PDA management, based on prostaglandin inhibitors and interventional ductus closure, are reactive. New treatment options should ideally be proactive, targeting endogenous ductus regulators, and applicable to broader PDA subpopulations with bona fide long-term benefits. These new therapies should document not only validation, such as safety and efficacy, but also utility in terms of favorable outcomes.

- **Clinical development goals**: The path for next-generation treatments includes milestones toward therapeutic goals, such as protocol optimization for enhancing success rates in potentially responsive preterm infants. Additionally, proactive alternatives should be developed for cohorts not responding to existing strategies.

Establishing surviving disease models, combined with noninvasive cardiac imaging to quantify shunt and its impact on the cardiopulmonary system and symptomatology, would enable preclinical safety and efficacy validation in a clinically relevant scenario. At the time of writing, more than 100 genes associated with defective morphogenesis, abnormal sensing, and inefficient contraction/sealing of the ductus arteriosus have been identified. These genes are considered potentially druggable and could qualify for early-stage theranostics screening. This growing list includes prostaglandin receptors and related enzymes, adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels that regulate vascular tone by linking energetic demand and membrane electrical activity, as well as TFAP2B and TBX1 transcription factors.

### Ductal closure with paracetamol: A surprising new approach to patent ductus arteriosus treatment [^116opMrc]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The standard pharmacologic closure of patent ductus arteriosus currently involves the administration of one of two cyclooxygenase inhibitors: either indomethacin or ibuprofen. However, both of these drugs can be associated with potentially significant adverse effects. We present here the cases of five preterm infants (gestational age: 26–32 weeks; postnatal age: 3–35 days) with large, hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus who had either failed or had contraindications to ibuprofen therapy. Each of these infants was treated with off-label oral paracetamol (15 mg/kg per dose every six hours). Ductal closure was achieved within 48 hours in all the treated infants, and no toxicity was observed.

### Indomethacin [^1143UpA1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Indomethacin for injection is indicated to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants weighing between 500 and 1,750 grams when 48 hours of usual medical management (e.g. fluid restriction, diuretics, digitalis, respiratory support, etc) is ineffective. Clear-cut clinical evidence of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus should be present, such as respiratory distress, a continuous murmur, a hyperactive precordium, cardiomegaly, or pulmonary plethora on chest x-ray.

Indomethacin for injection is a cardiovascular drug indicated to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants weighing between 500 and 1,750 grams.

### At a crossroads for early medical treatment of persistent patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^1131kpVo]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Low credibility.

Administration of early medical therapy for the patent ductus arteriosus has ebbed and flowed through the years, with a multitude of studies failing to demonstrate a reduction in morbidity or mortality from ductal closure in the preterm population. Concerningly, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated an increase in morbidity, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and mortality with the use of early medical therapy to close the ductus. Considering information regarding potential risk without clear benefit in an overall cohort of preterm patients with a patent ductus, the use of early medical therapy is increasingly challenging to justify. It necessitates studies that will aid in identifying a patient population that would benefit from ductal closure and the timing of therapy.

### Early prediction of spontaneous patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure and PDA-associated outcomes: A prospective cohort investigation [^11581V3u]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods - Research design overview**: A number of clinical, echocardiographic, and biomarker variables have known associations with an increased likelihood of either spontaneous PDA closure or PDA-associated morbidity. However, no one has incorporated all reported predictors to develop comprehensive, clinically focused PDA prediction models. In addition, most prior investigations have been limited by retrospective study designs, with echocardiographic surveillance at the clinician's discretion rather than uniform echocardiogram collection at pre-specified time points.

The few prospective studies were limited by exposure measurements at single, early time points, short durations of PDA exposure, and/or small sample sizes. Historically, most PDA investigations have been conducted at sites favoring early, aggressive PDA treatment, thus preventing an unbiased examination of the relationships between early PDA indicators, spontaneous closure, and outcomes following persistent PDA.

The proposed research is innovative because we will prospectively collect sequential echocardiographic measures, serum and urine biomarkers, and important clinical risk factors within a cohort of untreated infants with PDA. We will utilize that data to develop robust models to evaluate their combined ability to predict both spontaneous PDA closure timing and PDA-associated mortality, respiratory, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. This study uses a prospective cohort and a rigorously designed observational study to answer proposed questions that cannot be answered with a randomized trial.

### Safety of percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus closure: An unselected multicenter population experience [^115SQzDX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Of a total of 12,143 cases reported by the eight institutions, 496 (4%) were attempted PDA closures. The annual average PDA case volume per institution had a median of 5%, with a range of 2.1% to 7.4% (see Figure 2). There was institutional bias for the use of device versus coil for PDA minimal diameter 1.5 mm in institutions C, D, and F, while the other four centers were more likely to use coils for PDA diameters up to 2.5 mm (see Figure 3). There was a significant difference in the occurrence of any adverse events (AEs) by institution (P < 0.0001); however, there was no difference in high-severity AEs (P = 0.75) (see Figure 4).

- **Figure 2**: Average annual PDA cases for each institution. Shaded bars represent the average annual PDA cases, and stippled bars represent the PDA percentage of total cases. PDA indicates patent ductus arteriosus.

### Combination pharmacotherapy for patent ductus arteriosus: Rationale and evidence [^111vnc4k]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). High credibility.

While cyclooxygenase inhibitors have been the most common medications used to facilitate earlier closure of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants, adverse effects and low efficacy in extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs) have highlighted a need for alternative options. Combination therapy with acetaminophen and ibuprofen is a novel strategy for PDA treatment in ELGANs, as it may facilitate higher ductal closure rates via additive action on two separate pathways inhibiting prostaglandin production. Initial small observational studies and pilot randomized clinical trials indicate potentially higher efficacy of the combination regime to induce ductal closure in comparison to treatment with ibuprofen alone.

In this review, we examine the potential clinical impact of treatment failure in ELGANs with significant PDA, highlight the biological rationale in support of studying combination therapy, and review the randomized and non-randomized studies at the time of writing. With the rising number of ELGANs receiving neonatal intensive care, who are vulnerable to PDA-related morbidities, there is an urgent need for adequately powered clinical trials to systematically investigate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy for PDA treatment.

### Path toward proactive therapy for patent ductus arteriosus [^112PF34Q]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

Vulnerable pediatric populations demand rigorous benefit–risk assessment in clinical decision-making. Echocardiography is the first-line modality to quantify PDA-associated shunt and its impact on the cardiopulmonary system. Patients with PDA, who exhibit hemodynamic overload and organ failure symptomatology, face a poor prognosis and require the implementation of consensus-based advanced therapy. In premature babies with no contraindications, therapies to close a symptomatic PDA are initiated using pharmacotherapy with prostaglandin inhibitors that modulate ductus contraction. The success rate of approximately 68% across 14 widely used clinical protocols necessitates therapy escalation through invasive correction or additional treatment rounds in initial nonresponders. This may result from inadequate management regimens and/or diverse recalcitrant disease pathobiology. Despite five decades of clinical experience, pharmacotherapy for preterm PDA has not reached standardization. The selection of the most effective timing, best agent, dose, and delivery means remain central to the quest for best practice.

There is an age-dependent response to pharmacological ductus closure. Consensus exists that prostaglandin inhibitors are contraindicated for PDA in babies born at full term. The principle of "do no harm" in the setting of full-term PDA was established over three decades ago, discouraging further clinical trials. Nonpharmacological management, such as catheter-based PDA occlusion or surgical ligation, necessitates thoracic intervention.

### Patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^112sqteu]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Despite a large body of basic science and clinical research, as well as clinical experience with thousands of infants over nearly six decades, there is still uncertainty and controversy about the significance, evaluation, and management of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants, resulting in substantial heterogeneity in clinical practice. The purpose of this clinical report is to summarize the evidence available to guide evaluation and treatment of preterm infants with prolonged ductal patency in the first few weeks after birth.

### Safety of percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus closure: An unselected multicenter population experience [^111W7G4X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

The cohort includes 496 PDA closures performed at eight institutions and recorded in the database between February 1, 2007, and June 30, 2010. A device was initially used in 338 cases and a coil in 158 cases. The majority of patients (90%) had an isolated PDA with no associated congenital heart disease, and cases were predominantly performed electively (98%). Most procedures were performed under general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation (66%), while inotrope support was rarely necessary (1%).

Patients younger than six months were more likely to undergo device closure: 36 (90%) of 40 cases versus 302 (66%) of 456. Case duration was similar in the two treatment groups. More contrast was required for device placement cases compared with coil cases: median 3.9 mL/kg versus 2.3 mL/kg (P < 0.001). Coils were predominantly reserved for the smallest PDAs.

- **Patient and procedural characteristics**: Most patients had an isolated PDA, and procedures were elective.
- **Proportion of PDA closure methods**: Coils vs devices were based on PDA internal diameter.

PDA indicates patent ductus arteriosus.

### Patent ductus arteriosus in the preterm infant: to treat or not to treat [^117SPecN]. Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pharmacological and/or surgical closure of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in the very preterm infant has been the standard of care over the past few decades. However, the rationale for closure of PDA has recently been challenged. This article reviews the factors that have fueled the controversy regarding the management of PDA and highlights the gaps in our knowledge. In addition, it evaluates the pros and cons of different treatment strategies applied in clinical care, with a focus on discussing the available evidence in the literature.

### Patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants: Is early transcatheter closure a paradigm shift [^116UmbWz]. Journal of Perinatology (2019). Low credibility.

The optimal management approach for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature infants remains uncertain due to a lack of evidence for long-term benefits and limited analyses on the complications of medical and surgical interventions at the time of writing. In recent years, devices suitable for plugging the PDA of premature infants, including those with extremely low birth weight (< 1000g), have become available. Several trials have demonstrated successful and safe transcatheter PDA closure (TCPC) in this population.

Whether TCPC represents a paradigm shift in PDA management that will result in improved short- and long-term outcomes, such as less bronchopulmonary dysplasia, improved neurodevelopment, or better long-term renal function, remains to be seen. Careful and rigorous study of the potential benefits of TCPC in this highly vulnerable population, in the context of well-designed and adequately powered trials, is needed before the widespread adoption of this approach.

### PDA-TOLERATE trial: An exploratory randomized controlled trial of treatment of moderate-to-large patent ductus arteriosus at 1 week of age [^113APnDE]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

To compare early routine pharmacologic treatment of moderate-to-large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) at the end of week 1 with a conservative approach that requires prespecified respiratory and hemodynamic criteria before treatment can be given, a total of 202 neonates of < 28 weeks of gestation age (mean, 25.8 ± 1.1 weeks) with moderate-to-large PDA shunts were enrolled between age 6 and 14 days (mean, 8.1 ± 2.2 days) into an exploratory randomized controlled trial.

At enrollment, 49% of the patients were intubated and 48% required nasal ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure. There were no differences between the groups in either our primary outcome of ligation or presence of a PDA at discharge (early routine treatment [ERT], 32%; conservative treatment [CT], 39%) or any of our prespecified secondary outcomes of necrotizing enterocolitis (ERT, 16%; CT, 19%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (ERT, 49%; CT, 53%), BPD/death (ERT, 58%; CT, 57%), death (ERT, 19%; CT, 10%), and weekly need for respiratory support. Fewer infants in the ERT group met the rescue criteria (ERT, 31%; CT, 62%).

In secondary exploratory analyses, infants receiving ERT had significantly less need for inotropic support (ERT, 13%; CT, 25%). However, among infants who were ≥ 26 weeks gestational age, those receiving ERT took significantly longer to achieve enteral feeding of 120 mL/kg/day (median: ERT, 14 days [range, 4.5–19 days]; CT, 6 days [range, 3–14 days]), and had significantly higher incidences of late-onset non-coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia.

### Prevalence and management of patent ductus arteriosus in a pediatric Medicaid cohort [^115AiRUq]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The widespread use of echocardiography has made earlier diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) possible, but pharmacological or surgical intervention is highly variable. Herein, we investigate the prevalence of PDA and its management in a routine care system.

- **Methods**: A 15-year retrospective dataset (1996–2010) was analyzed. Selection criteria included age ≤ 17 years, enrollees in South Carolina State Medicaid, and diagnosis of PDA on one or more service visits to a pediatrician or pediatric cardiologist.

- **Results**: The 15-year treated prevalence rate of PDA was 0.25/1000 pediatric cases of congenital heart disease (CHD). PDA was more prevalent in non-African American patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.12), but not in females after controlling for all other CHDs diagnosed in the cohort. Associated CHDs were present in 57.6% of the cases, primarily atrial or ventricular septal defects, and fewer patients (5.5%) developed pulmonary hypertension. Of 3627 PDA cases examined, 70.0% received no medications or PDA repair. Therapeutic ibuprofen was used for closure in 24.4% of the cases, and a PDA repair was performed in 7.8%. Younger children (aOR: 0.82), those who received an atrial septal defect closure (aOR: 5.18), and those who were treated with digoxin (aOR: 1.86) or with diuretics or preload/afterload reducing agents, such as calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (aOR: 5.72), were significantly more likely to have a PDA repair procedure.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of diagnosed PDA cases did not require pharmacological or surgical intervention.

### Safety of percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus closure: An unselected multicenter population experience [^114mbiWN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

The technique and safety of transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure have evolved over the past 20 years. This study aimed to report a multicenter experience of PDA closure, focusing on the rate of adverse events (AEs) and reviewing institutional practice differences.

- **Methods and results**: Outcome data on transcatheter PDA closure were collected at eight centers prospectively using a multicenter registry, the Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Project on Outcome Registry. Between February 2007 and June 2010, 496 PDA closures were recorded using either a device in 338 cases (68%) or coils in 158 cases (32%). Most patients had an isolated PDA (90%). Fifty percent of patients were aged between 6 months and 3 years, with only 40 patients (8%) being less than 6 months old or more than 53 years old. In 9% of cases (n = 46), an AE occurred; however, only 11 (2%) were classified as high severity. Younger age was associated with a higher AE rate. Coil-related AEs were more common than device-related AEs (10% versus 2%, P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: PDA closure in the present era has a very low rate of complications, although these are higher in younger children. Technical intervention-related events were more common in coil procedures compared with device procedures.

### Challenges encountered during closure of patent ductus arteriosus [^111dM2Sr]. Pediatric Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was one of the first interventions established in invasive cardiology and is now more than 30 years old. The challenges for successful closure with the first devices in children included handling the rather large introducer sheaths and stiff application systems. Today, interventional closure can be performed with different types of plugs, occluders, and coils. Beyond infancy, transcatheter closure can be successfully performed in almost all cases.

- **Technical challenges**: Closure of window-type ducts can be technically challenging, where excessive protrusion of the device into the descending aorta should be avoided. Similarly, closure of tubular ducts can be difficult due to issues with secure anchoring of one or more devices in the vessel. When a coarctation is combined with an open duct, different strategies can be considered, and in selected cases, the use of a covered stent can be helpful.

- **Physiological challenges**: Open ducts in patients with pulmonary hypertension, with or without concomitant congenital heart diseases, can be challenging. Testing of vasoreactivity with temporarily blocked ducts and the option of subsequent treatment with vasodilators may be necessary before deciding whether the patient may benefit from definitive duct occlusion.

Large ducts in infants weighing less than 8 kg can be difficult to treat due to a relative mismatch of introducers, plugs, or occluders to the small anatomic dimensions. The implantation of multiple coils can be associated with a higher risk.

### Lack of equipoise in the PDA-TOLERATE trial: A comparison of eligible infants enrolled in the trial and those treated outside the trial [^116zT4HV]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The PDA: TO LEave it alone or Respond And Treat Early trial compared the effects of two strategies for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in infants < 28 0/7 weeks of gestation. However, 137 potentially eligible infants were not recruited and received treatment for their PDA outside the PDA-TOLERATE trial due to "lack-of-physician-equipoise" (LPE). Despite being less mature and needing more respiratory support, infants with LPE had lower rates of mortality than enrolled infants. Moreover, infants with LPE treated before day 6 had lower rates of late respiratory morbidity compared to infants with LPE treated on or after day 6.

### Genetics of patent ductus arteriosus susceptibility and treatment [^116MuVos]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

The ductus arteriosus is a vital fetal structure designed to close shortly after birth. Although many physiological and pharmacological investigations have characterized the closure of this structure, genetic studies of persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus (patent ductus arteriosus, PDA) are relatively recent. Progress in the identification of specific genes associated with PDA is well behind that of many adult-onset diseases. Several reasons contribute to this, ranging from the lack of large biorepositories for this unique population to the belief that any genetic contribution to PDA is minimal.

Viewing PDA as a complex, developmentally influenced disease with both genetic and environmental risk factors has resulted in initial successes in some genetic studies. Several genetic approaches that have been or are currently being applied to the study of PDA have succeeded in identifying polymorphisms associated with adult diseases. Genetic investigations of PDA are discussed with respect to heritability, specifically concerning risk genes. Several animal models used to study PDA-related genes will also be presented. Further advances in discovering genetic variations causing PDA will drive the more rational use of therapies and may help identify currently unknown targets for future therapeutic manipulation.

### Incidental discovery of a patent ductus arteriosus in adults [^117AvqM5]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is an uncommon clinical finding in adult primary care patients. However, with improved survival of premature infants at risk for PDA and an increase in cases discovered incidentally on echocardiograms performed for other purposes, the incidence of PDA is rising. Thus, primary care physicians need to be alert to the clinical situations suggesting a previously undiagnosed PDA.

It is estimated that the incidence of PDA is approximately 0.02% to 0.04% in term infants and slightly higher in premature infants. PDA accounts for 6% to 11% of all congenital heart defects. Although most cases of PDA seem to occur sporadically, multifactorial inheritance is believed to underlie many cases. These individuals are thought to possess a genetic predisposition acted on by an environmental trigger that occurs at an unknown but vulnerable time during pregnancy.

The clinical spectrum of presentation of a PDA may range from a "silent" PDA, one with no clinical manifestations but which is incidentally discovered on echocardiogram for other purposes, to patients who present with congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, signs of volume overload, endocarditis, atrial fibrillation, or pneumonia. We describe two cases that illustrate the discovery of an asymptomatic PDA during routine physical examination of adult patients.

### Sizing of patent ductus arteriosus in adults for transcatheter closure using the balloon pull-through technique [^112dpNxi]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

This study describes a novel balloon sizing technique used during adult transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure. It also aims to determine the clinical and procedural outcomes in six patients who underwent PDA balloon sizing with subsequent deployment of a PDA occluder device.

Transcatheter PDA closure in adults has excellent safety and procedural outcomes. However, PDA sizing in adults can be challenging due to variable defect size, high flow state, or anatomical complexity. A series of six cases are described where the balloon pull-through technique was successfully performed for PDA sizing prior to transcatheter closure.

Consecutive adult patients undergoing PDA closure at the institution were studied retrospectively. A partially inflated sizing balloon was pulled through the defect from the aorta into the pulmonary artery, and the balloon waist diameter was measured. Procedural success and clinical outcomes were obtained.

Six adult patients underwent successful balloon pull-through technique for PDA sizing during transcatheter PDA closure; conventional angiography often gave suboptimal opacification of the defect. All PDAs were treated with closure devices based on balloon PDA sizing with complete closure and no complications. In three patients that underwent pre-procedure computed tomography, the balloon size matched the CT-derived measurements.

The balloon pull-through technique for PDA sizing is concluded to be a safe and accurate sizing modality in adults undergoing transcatheter PDA closure.

### Application of NPE in the assessment of a patent ductus arteriosus [^113SSYjq]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

In many preterm infants, the ductus arteriosus remains patent beyond the first few days of life. This prolonged patency is associated with numerous adverse outcomes, but the extent to which these adverse outcomes are attributable to the hemodynamic consequences of ductal patency, if at all, has not been established. Different treatment strategies have failed to improve short-term outcomes, with a paucity of data on the correct diagnostic and pathophysiological assessment of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in association with long-term outcomes. Echocardiography is the selected method of choice for detecting a PDA, assessing the impact on the preterm circulation, and monitoring treatment response.

PDA in a preterm infant can result in pulmonary overcirculation and systemic hypoperfusion. Therefore, echocardiographic assessment should include evaluation of PDA characteristics, indices of pulmonary overcirculation with left heart loading conditions, and indices of systemic hypoperfusion. In this review, we provide an evidence-based overview of the emerging ultrasound measurements available to identify and monitor a PDA in the preterm infant. We offer indications and limitations for using neonatologist performed echocardiography to optimize the management of a neonate with a PDA.

### Diagnosis of the preterm patent ductus arteriosus: clinical signs, biomarkers, or ultrasound [^1174pFh4]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

The uncertainty related to the treatment of the preterm patent ductus arteriosus reflects limitations in our understanding of the pathophysiology of ductal shunting, particularly concerning which ducts are significant to which babies and when they become important. Doppler ultrasound offers a pragmatic tool for assessing ductal patency and shunt significance, and it aids in predicting both spontaneous and therapeutic closure. Biomarkers, such as B-type natriuretic peptide, and clinical signs may have a diagnostic role where ultrasound is not available and possibly serve as an adjunct to echocardiography in determining the pathophysiological impact of a ductal shunt in an individual baby.

### The patent ductus arteriosus in term infants, children, and adults [^116xa2eD]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

During fetal life, the ductus arteriosus is a normal and essential structure that connects the pulmonary artery to the distal aortic arch, permitting right ventricular ejection into the aorta. After birth, with the commencement of pulmonary blood flow and a two-ventricle circulation, a variety of physiological and biochemical signals normally result in the complete closure of the ductus arteriosus.

Persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus may impair systemic cardiac output and result in deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system and lungs. Although surgery is still the treatment of choice for most premature infants with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), transcatheter techniques have largely supplanted surgery for the closure of PDA in children and adults. This article is a review of the PDA in term infants, children, and adults, focusing on the clinical manifestations and management.

### Transesophageal echocardiography-guided percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus closure without fluoroscopy [^116hiVvF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Currently, the main approaches for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) treatment in infants and children include open surgery, percutaneous closure under fluoroscopy guidance, thoracoscopic PDA closure, and transthoracic PDA closure via transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) guidance. Open surgery generally results in a large surgical incision, affecting the appearance and chest development in children. In 1967, Porstmann et al. were the first to consider using percutaneous interventional therapy and achieved success. To date, closure under fluoroscopy guidance has been widely performed; however, this method exposes physicians and children directly to radiation. Additionally, children may be prone to allergies from contrast agents. Thoracoscopic PDA closure carries relatively high risks, including bleeding and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.

In recent years, PDA closure through a small thoracic incision under transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guidance has been gradually reported. While this technique avoids radiation exposure and contrast agents, a surgical incision is still left on the chest. The possibility of minimally occluding PDA via the femoral vein under TEE guidance remains debatable. Successful animal experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this method through veins under TEE guidance. Currently, TEE-guided transcatheter femoral vein occlusion of PDA has shown certain clinical outcomes. This method successfully occludes PDA through the femoral vein without contrast agents and X-rays. Furthermore, there are no severe complications, indicating the safety and effectiveness of this technique. However, this technique…

### Patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^115ojGye]. Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Despite extensive research in basic science and clinical settings with thousands of infants over decades, uncertainty and controversy persist regarding the significance, assessment, and management of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants, resulting in substantial variability in clinical approach. This clinical report aims to succinctly review the available evidence to guide the evaluation and treatment of preterm infants with prolonged ductal patency.

Delayed closure of the PDA is common in preterm infants, particularly at more extreme immaturity. Echocardiography is essential for confirming the presence of a PDA and assessing hemodynamic significance. Medical closure of a PDA using ibuprofen or acetaminophen is an option for a hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA). Recent data from multiple clinical trials indicate the lack of benefits of prophylactic or early (before 2 weeks of age) medical closure of PDA compared with expectant management, and therefore, such early interventions are not recommended.

- **Management beyond 2 weeks of age**: There are insufficient data to support firm recommendations on the management of infants with an hsPDA beyond 2 weeks of age. The relative benefits and risks of expectant management with close monitoring, attempted pharmacologic closure, or procedural (transcatheter/surgical) closure have not been adequately defined. Many clinicians attempt medical closure of an hsPDA beyond 2 weeks of age. If the hsPDA persists despite medical therapy (or if medical therapy is contraindicated), such infants may be considered for either transcatheter closure or surgical ligation.

### Outcomes of primary ligation of patent ductus arteriosus compared with secondary ligation after pharmacologic failure in very-low-birth-weight infants [^115GfPdE]. Pediatric Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Persistent hemodynamically significant ductus arteriosus (HSDA) is considered to be closed, although routine treatment to close a persistently patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature infants is no longer recommended. However, HSDA leads to clinical complications such as pulmonary hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), renal impairment, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia, cerebral palsy, and death.

Moderate to large left-to-right PDA shunts alter pulmonary mechanics and decrease alveolarization, resulting in difficulty weaning the patient off a ventilator. NEC and acute renal failure (ARF) are frequently reported postnatal morbidities due to pulmonary overcirculation, caused by the "ductal steal" phenomenon.

The benefits of surgical ligation for the brain and kidneys and the resulting positive effects on NEC in HSDA patients have been reported. As a result, the morbidities associated with HSDA require clinicians to promptly close HSDA with either medication or surgical ligation.

Surgical ligation is frequently the treatment of choice for very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants vulnerable to the side effects of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, who are unlikely to experience successful closure with medication. Prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors have a 30–40% failure rate, and COX inhibitors cannot be prescribed for all patients. Therefore, surgical ligation often is performed after medical treatment failure but also can be performed as the first line of treatment.

### Transcriptional evaluation of the ductus arteriosus at the single-cell level uncovers a requirement for Vim (vimentin) for complete closure [^114r9GCC]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). High credibility.

Failure to close the ductus arteriosus, known as patent ductus arteriosus, accounts for 10% of all congenital heart defects. Despite significant advances in managing patent ductus arteriosus, including pharmacological treatment targeting the prostaglandin pathway, a proportion of patients fail to respond and must undergo surgical intervention. Thus, further refinement of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern vascular remodeling of this vessel is required.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of the ductus arteriosus in mouse embryos at E18.5 (embryonic day 18.5), P0.5 (postnatal day 0.5), and P5 to identify transcriptional alterations that might be associated with remodeling. We further confirmed our findings using transgenic mouse models coupled with immunohistochemistry analysis.

- **Results**: The intermediate filament vimentin emerged as a candidate that might contribute to the closure of the ductus arteriosus. Indeed, mice with genetic deletion of vimentin fail to complete vascular remodeling of the ductus arteriosus. To seek mechanisms, we turned to the RNA sequencing data that indicated changes in Jagged1 with a similar profile to vimentin and pointed to potential links with Notch. In fact, Notch3 signaling was impaired in vimentin-null mice, and vimentin-null mice phenocopy patent ductus arteriosus in Jagged1 endothelial and smooth muscle-deleted mice.

Through single-cell RNA sequencing and by tracking closure of the ductus arteriosus in mice, we uncovered the unexpected contribution of vimentin in driving complete closure of the ductus arteriosus.

### Adult patent ductus arteriosus closure with a pedicled pulmonary arterial patch [^116NfUdk]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The vascular wall of patent ductus arteriosus in adults is usually fragile due to atherosclerosis with calcification. In adults, surgical treatment, such as direct or patch closure, is sometimes required for a wide, short, or calcified patent ductus arteriosus. We present a novel technique for patent ductus arteriosus closure with a pedicled patch created from the wall of a dilated pulmonary artery. We believe that this technique, in which only autologous tissue is used, is safe and has excellent durability.

Therefore, echocardiographic assessment should include evaluation of PDA characteristics, indices of pulmonary overcirculation with left heart loading conditions, and indices of systemic hypoperfusion.

In this review, we provide an evidence-based overview of the emerging ultrasound measurements available to identify and monitor a PDA in the preterm infant. We offer indications and limitations for using neonatologist-performed echocardiography to optimize the management of a neonate with a PDA.

### Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder clinical trial for percutaneous closure of the patent ductus arteriosus in patients ≥ 700 grams [^117Pc8pa]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Low credibility.

Transcatheter device closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the standard of care in larger infants, children, and adults. Historically, transcatheter closure of PDA has not been performed routinely in very small infants (weight ≤ 2 kg). Recently, a growing body of clinical evidence has emerged suggesting that transcatheter closure of PDA can be performed safely and effectively in premature infants as small as 700 g or smaller. The Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder (Abbott Structural Heart, Plymouth, MN), previously called the Amplatzer Duct Occluder II Additional Sizes (ADO II AS), obtained CE-Mark in Europe in 2011 for PDA closure in patients ≥ 6 kg.

The PDA morphology in extremely premature infants resembles its fetal counterpart (so-called F-type PDA morphology). It is typically long and tubular with a hockey stick configuration such that the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder has favorable features (size, shape, delivery system) for closure of PDAs in premature neonates. A clinical study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder was conducted, leading to the approval of this device by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients ≥ 700 g.

### Interventional treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in 2004 [^113GvuMP]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2005). Low credibility.

In 2004, the interventional treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was definitive and curative. In practice, coils are used for smaller PDA, whereas devices are employed for larger PDA. Developing technologies offer small improvements in control and results but do not promise significant changes in practice. This review summarizes the emerging interventional technologies directed at PDA closures.

### Patent ductus arteriosus and short- and long-term respiratory outcomes [^114Ec75Q]. American Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

The patency of the ductus arteriosus is very common in extremely premature infants. The increased pulmonary blood flow that results from left-to-right ductal shunting can produce an acute deterioration in lung function, and some data suggest that it may increase the risk of chronic lung damage. However, there is no clear evidence that prophylactic or early closure of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) results in a clear reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. For this reason, and because of the side effects of the available therapies to close the ductus, there is a wide variation in the approach to the PDA in this population, and most clinicians will intervene to close the ductus only in cases of significant shunt with hemodynamic decompensation.

### Percutaneous closure of the patent ductus arteriosus in infants ≤ 2 kg: IMPACT registry insights [^114eDQpF]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure is becoming the standard of care for definitive closure in progressively smaller and younger neonates. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and feasibility of percutaneous PDA closure in patients ≤ 2 kg.

- **Methods**: This was a cohort study using the IMPACT Registry (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatments) from the American College of Cardiology Foundation's National Cardiovascular Data Registry. Patients who were ≤ 2 kg at the time of percutaneous PDA closure were included. The primary outcome was the composite of technical failure and/or major adverse events.

- **Results**: A total of 1587 attempted PDA closures were included, with a 3% incidence of technical failure and a 5.5% incidence of the composite outcome. Major adverse events were observed in 3.8% of the patients; the most common events were device embolization requiring retrieval and unplanned cardiac or vascular surgery in 1.3% and 1.3% of cases, respectively. The incidence of the composite outcome was associated with the need for arterial access (P < .001) as well as annual hospital volume of percutaneous PDA closures in infants ≤ 2 kg (P = .001). The incidence of the composite outcome has decreased over time, whereas the median weight at the time of the procedure has also diminished.

- **Conclusions**: Percutaneous PDA closure appears to be a safe and feasible procedure in infants ≤ 2 kg. The incidence of major adverse events has continued to decline over the years and seems to have a strong correlation with individual center case volumes and expertise.

### Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and pulmonary morbidity: Can early targeted pharmacologic PDA treatment decrease the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^111am97X]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Low credibility.

A persistent left-to-right shunt through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) increases the rate of pulmonary hydrostatic fluid filtration, impairs pulmonary mechanics, and prolongs the need for respiratory support. Infants with a moderate/large PDA shunt that persists for more than 7–14 days are at increased risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) if they also require invasive ventilation for more than 10 days. In contrast, infants who require invasive ventilation for less than 10 days have similar rates of BPD, no matter how long they are exposed to a moderate/large PDA shunt. Although pharmacologic PDA closure decreases the risk of abnormal early alveolar development in preterm baboons that are ventilated for 2 weeks, the findings from recent randomized controlled trials, as well as a quality improvement project, suggest that routine early targeted pharmacologic treatments, as currently employed, do not appear to alter the incidence of BPD in human infants.

### Catheter-based closure of the patent ductus arteriosus in lower weight infants [^114dZzdB]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Risks associated with drug therapy and surgical ligation have led health care providers to consider alternative strategies for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure. Catheter-based PDA closure is the procedure of choice for ductal closure in adults, children, and infants weighing ≥ 6 kg. Given evidence among older counterparts, interest in catheter-based closure of the PDA in lower weight (< 6 kg) infants is growing. Among these smaller infants, this review aims to provide an overview of the procedure, review the types of PDA closure devices, assess technical success (feasibility), evaluate the risks (safety profile), discuss the quality of evidence on procedural efficacy, and consider areas for future research.

The review suggests that catheter-based PDA closure is technically feasible, although the lack of comparative trials precludes determination of the optimal strategy for ductal closure in this subgroup of infants.

### Early prediction of spontaneous patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure and PDA-associated outcomes: a prospective cohort investigation [^116vt1yv]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

To estimate the probability of spontaneous PDA closure and predict the timing of ductal closure, echocardiographic, biomarker, and clinical predictors obtained within the first postnatal month will be used. Until documented PDA closure, echocardiograms will be conducted weekly for the first four weeks postnatal and biweekly thereafter, between study entry and 36-weeks PMA on all inpatient study participants.

Based on local pilot data, it is expected that 15% of PDAs (90% small, < 1.5 mm; 10% moderate, 1.5–2 mm) will remain patent at NICU discharge. All preterm infants with PDA at discharge will follow-up with the pediatric cardiologist at the dedicated neonatal-cardiology clinic within The Heart Center at NCH, which is the sole pediatric cardiology provider-site for central Ohio. Per local standard of care, these infants will receive echocardiograms at 2–3 month intervals until documented closure. Any infants with a persistent PDA at 22 to 26-months postnatal age (~5% of those discharged with a persistent ductus) will undergo catheter-based closure to prevent long-term complications of PDA.

This approach will facilitate precise documentation of ductal patency duration from 72-hours postnatal until neurodevelopmental follow-up at 22 to 26-months. Clinical measures, weekly biomarker measurements, and weekly echocardiography-derived predictors from the first four postnatal weeks will be modeled. This is the period when the decision to initiate pharmacologic treatment closure for PDA is most commonly made. The primary outcome for Aim 1 is documented PDA closure by 36-weeks PMA.

### Interventions for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews [^112MymwN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The need for subsequent open-label therapy, including definitive surgical PDA closure, highlights the fact that medical therapy, though better than placebo, is by no means a highly effective option for PDA closure. Therefore, most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of medical treatment were essentially trials of drug therapy, rather than the elimination of the PDA shunt. Despite growing calls for accepting the null hypothesis and abandoning further clinical trials on PDA management, the evidence underscores the need to clearly establish which PDA shunts, if any, are associated with worse clinical outcomes. It is crucial to pursue further clinical trials that include only those infants at the highest risk of PDA-attributable morbidities. These trials should explore highly effective and safe shunt elimination strategies for such clinically important PDA shunts.

### Treatment of persistent patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants: time to accept the null hypothesis [^112dqko6]. Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Medical and surgical interventions are widely used to close a persistently patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants. However, objective evidence to support these practices is lacking, causing some to question their usage. Emerging evidence suggests that treatments which close the patent ductus may be detrimental.

This review examines the history and evidence underlying these treatments. Neither individual trials, pooled data from groups of randomized-controlled trials, nor critical examination of the immediate consequences of treatment provide evidence that medical or surgical closure of the ductus is beneficial in preterm infants. These conclusions are supported by sufficient evidence. Neither the continued routine use of these treatments nor additional clinical trials using similar designs seems justified. A definitive trial, comparing standard management with novel strategies not primarily intended to achieve ductal closure, may be necessary to resolve doubts regarding the quality or conduct of prior studies.

### Study protocol: Baby-OSCAR trial: Outcome after selective early treatment for closure of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm babies, a multicentre, masked, randomised placebo-controlled parallel group trial [^115ihPHv]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

The question of whether to treat patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) early or wait until symptoms appear remains high on the research agenda for neonatal medicine. Around 7,000 extremely preterm babies under 29 weeks' gestation are born in the UK every year. In 40% of cases, the PDA will fail to close spontaneously, even by 4 months of age. Untreated PDA can be associated with several serious and life-threatening short- and long-term complications. Reliable data to support clinical decisions about PDA treatment are needed to prevent serious complications in high-risk babies while minimizing undue exposure of infants. With the availability of routine bedside echocardiography, babies with a large PDA can be diagnosed before they become symptomatic.

- **Methods**: This is a multicentre, masked, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel group trial to determine if early-targeted treatment of a large PDA with parenteral ibuprofen in extremely preterm babies (23 +0 to 26 weeks' gestation) improves short- and long-term health and economic outcomes. With parental informed consent, extremely preterm babies (born between 23 +0 to 26 weeks' gestation) admitted to tertiary neonatal units are screened using echocardiography. Babies with a large PDA on echocardiography, defined by diameter of at least 1.5 mm and unrestricted pulsatile PDA flow pattern, are randomly allocated to either ibuprofen or placebo within 72 hours of birth. The primary endpoint is the composite outcome of death by 36 weeks' postmenstrual age or moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: Are current neonatal treatment options better or worse than no treatment at all [^1128iNfc]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Although a moderate-sized patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) needs to be closed by the time a child is 1–2 years old, there is great uncertainty about whether it needs to be closed during the neonatal period. While 95% of neonatologists believe that a moderate-sized PDA should be closed if it persists in infants born before 28 weeks who still require mechanical ventilation, the number of neonatologists who treat a PDA when it occurs in infants who do not require mechanical ventilation varies widely. Both the high likelihood of spontaneous ductus closure and the absence of randomized controlled trials, specifically addressing the risks and benefits of neonatal ductus closure, add to the uncertainty. New information suggests that early pharmacologic treatment has several important short-term benefits for the preterm newborn. By contrast, ductus ligation, while eliminating the detrimental effects of a PDA on lung development, may create its own set of morbidities that counteract many of the benefits derived from ductus closure.

### Safety of percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus closure: An unselected multicenter population experience [^1112pWUY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

The technique and safety of transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure have evolved during the past 20 years. We sought to report a multicenter experience of PDA closure with a focus on the rate of adverse events (AE) and a review of institutional practice differences.

- **Methods and results**: Outcome data on transcatheter PDA closure were collected at 8 centers prospectively using a multicenter registry (Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Project on Outcome Registry). Between February 2007 and June 2010, 496 PDA closures were recorded using a device in 338 (68%) or coils in 158 (32%). Most patients had an isolated PDA (90%). Fifty percent of patients were between 6 months and 3 years old, with only 40 patients (8%) under 6 months or over 3 years of age. The median PDA size was 2 mm, with all patients having a minimum pulmonary artery pressure gradient of 1.5 mm. In 9% of cases (n = 46), an AE occurred; however, only 11 (2%) were classified as high severity. Younger age was associated with a higher AE rate. Coil-related AEs were more common than device-related AEs (10% versus 2%).

- **Conclusions**: PDA closure in the present era has a very low rate of complications, although these are higher in younger children. Technical intervention-related events were more common in coil procedures compared with device procedures.

### Congenital heart disease in aircrew [^113Lrwde]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is usually recognized early in life and is closed pharmacologically with ibuprofen or indomethacin, through surgical ligation, or using a percutaneous closure device. PDA can be associated with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), subaortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis (PS), and aortic root disease. It is essential to exclude these conditions before performing PDA closure. Occasionally, PDAs that have been closed early in childhood may recanalize as the individual grows; however, in adulthood, further recanalization is unlikely. If closed in childhood with appropriate follow-up, a closed PDA is compatible with unrestricted flying. However, if a percutaneous device closure has been used, it may preclude aircrew from engaging in high-performance flying due to concerns regarding device movement or embolization. Additionally, the risk of endocarditis may disqualify individuals from military service.

If the PDA is small and untreated, abnormal physiology is rarely seen in adults. Although rarely associated with an increased risk of endocarditis, it may infrequently result in pulmonary hypertension that can develop slowly over many years. This condition may manifest in aircrew as palpitations secondary to right atrial dilation, dyspnea on exertion, or hypoxia. Pulmonary hypertension serves as a barrier to initial flying certification and is typically associated with restrictions on flying privileges or grounding if diagnosed in existing aircrew.

Patent foramen ovale and atrial septal defects

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is present in 25–33% of the population. It is often an incidental finding in asymptomatic aircrew undergoing echocardiography for the investigation of other conditions.

### Path toward proactive therapy for patent ductus arteriosus [^113wWeCb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

Management of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in newborns is challenging, with options particularly restricted by risk–benefit considerations. Severe forms of ductus malfunction, leading to circulatory failure, require heart surgery or vascular intervention to correct the structural defect. Development of lower-risk alternatives is warranted. Deconvolution of the underlying pathobiology would inform proactive promotion of innate ductus closure, with the prospect of identifying druggable targets that address an unmet need in vulnerable populations.

### Ibuprofen for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm or low birth weight (or both) infants [^1122ETx8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Indomethacin is used as standard therapy to close a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) but is associated with reduced blood flow to several organs. Ibuprofen, another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, may be as effective as indomethacin with fewer adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared with indomethacin, other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, placebo, or no intervention for closing a patent ductus arteriosus in preterm, low-birth-weight, or preterm and low-birth-weight infants.

- **Search methods**: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 30 November 2017), Embase (1980 to 30 November 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 30 November 2017). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of ibuprofen for the treatment of a PDA in preterm, low birth weight, or both preterm and low-birth-weight newborn infants.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data collection and analysis conformed to the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

- **Main results**: We included 39 studies enrolling 2843 infants. Ibuprofen (IV) versus placebo: IV ibuprofen (3 doses) reduced the failure to close a PDA compared with placebo (typical relative risk (RR); 0.62 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.86).

### Application of NPE in the assessment of a patent ductus arteriosus [^114ccxbe]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

The application of NPE in the evaluation of a PDA (patent ductus arteriosus) involves understanding that a significant shunt through the PDA, which remains clinically "silent", may occur in the first days of life. The development of echocardiographic signs of hemodynamic significance typically precedes the development of clinical signs by an average of two days. Echocardiography is currently the preferred tool for predicting or diagnosing ductal patency and assessing hemodynamic significance. There is some evidence that serial echocardiography facilitates early identification of a hemodynamically significant PDA (HsPDA) and might reduce morbidity associated with the PDA.

There are important considerations when using echocardiography, as recently outlined by the European consensus statement on NPE. Firstly, measures should be taken to ensure the patient's comfort. Secondly, the initial scan should provide a comprehensive appraisal of cardiac anatomy to confirm the structural normality of the heart and avoid inadvertent PDA treatment in the presence of a duct-dependent lesion. Finally, clinicians must be aware that echocardiographic indices of hemodynamic significance have variable reproducibility between observers. It is crucial to strive for consistency between operators regarding where and how to measure the different variables involved in the assessment of the PDA.

- **Assessment of hemodynamic significance of the PDA**: The traditional view of the PDA as a dichotomous entity based on transductal dimension represents a physiologic oversimplification. Assessment of transductal diameter alone is confounded by image quality, vessel geometry, and the dynamic nature of the…

### Novel drug targets for ductus arteriosus manipulation: Looking beyond prostaglandins [^115dxge6]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Forty years ago, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were first reported to decrease systemic prostaglandin levels and promote ductus arteriosus (DA) closure. Yet, prolonged patency of the DA (PDA) remains a significant clinical problem, complicated by imperfect therapies and wide variations in treatment strategy. There are few pharmacology-based tools available for treating PDA, such as indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen, or for maintaining DA patency with PGE1, which is needed to facilitate corrective surgery for ductus-dependent congenital heart defects. Unfortunately, all of these treatments are inefficient and are associated with concerning adverse effects. This review highlights novel potential DA drug targets that may expand our therapeutic repertoire beyond the prostaglandin pathway.

### Application of NPE in the assessment of a patent ductus arteriosus [^113yxuqw]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

The significance of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and its impact on long-term cardiorespiratory health remain areas of ongoing debate in neonatology. Even the persistent patency of a PDA is a clinical conundrum, as most premature neonates in whom the PDA fails to close in the first week of age or even by the time of discharge will undergo spontaneous closure without experiencing significant cardiac morbidity. Although prolonged patency may be associated with numerous adverse outcomes, the extent to which these adverse outcomes are attributable to the hemodynamic consequences of ductal patency, if at all, has not been established.

Currently, echocardiography is the most clinically applicable modality for identifying a PDA, with Neonatologist Performed Echocardiography (NPE) potentially playing an essential role in devising treatment options and assessing their impact on the preterm circulation. Centers that develop NPE may greatly benefit from the "unfettered" access to echocardiography with a targeted approach that focuses on the high-risk patient population with specific hemodynamic characteristics receiving treatment.

The purpose of this review is not to advise on treatment options, but to provide a practice guideline on how to evaluate hemodynamic significance and characterize shunt volume using NPE. Specifically, in this review, we discuss the emerging ultrasound measurements available to identify and monitor a PDA in the preterm infant. We offer recommendations for using NPE to optimize the management of a neonate with a PDA and understand the implications of such management strategies.

### Consensus guidelines for the prevention and management of periprocedural complications of transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus closure with the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder in extremely low birth weight infants [^111z9KBj]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

For device embolization into the systemic circulation, prompt recognition and treatment are warranted because device embolization into the systemic circulation is unlikely to be tolerated by small infants (< 2 kg). It will result in acute symptoms characterized by abdominal distention to full-blown necrotizing enterocolitis, decreased lower extremity pulse and perfusion, oliguria, and renal failure. Device embolization into the aorta requires emergency intervention and potentially may be amenable to transcatheter retrieval depending on whether a retrieval sheath may be introduced safely across the ductus into the aorta, or from the carotid artery into the aorta.

- **Management considerations for device embolization into the descending aorta**:
	- For a device embolization in the systemic circulation, assess the feasibility of transcatheter retrieval via the ductus or carotid artery; or consult with a surgeon for retrieval via a surgical approach.
	- If the device embolizes into the descending aorta during the procedure, a long sheath may be introduced via the existing femoral venous access site, across the ductus, to snare and retrieve the device in a fashion similar to the techniques used in the pulmonary circulation.
	- For a device that embolizes post-procedure, two options exist for transcatheter retrieval depending on whether the ductus is patent. If the ductus is patent, then a long sheath may be introduced via the femoral vein, across the ductus to snare.

Ensure the healthcare team is prepared for these potential complications and has a plan for immediate intervention.

### Defining "haemodynamic significance" of the patent ductus arteriosus: Do we have all the answers [^115eu59B]. Neonatology (2020). Low credibility.

Optimum management of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants remains one of the most debated topics within the field of neonatology. Despite numerous observational studies and over 60 randomized control trials, consensus on PDA management remains elusive. In order to make meaningful progress on the controversial issue of PDA management, several key factors must be thoroughly addressed; namely:

- **Accurate identification**: Accurate identification of infants at greatest risk of long-term morbidities from PDA exposure.

- **Individualised approach**: Acceptance that the PDA is not a dichotomous entity and an individualised approach to its management is required for each neonate.

- **International consensus**: International consensus on what constitutes a haemodynamically significant PDA.

- **Multi-organ assessment**: Incorporation of multi-organ assessment when evaluating the impact a PDA may pose on overall neonatal physiology.

This review assesses the evidence base available supporting various therapeutic strategies for PDA, the deficits in our knowledge on the definition of haemodynamic significance, and future directions to pursue in order to more successfully address this contentious subject.
