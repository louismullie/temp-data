## Question

What is CMML

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what CMML is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease definition and classification. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria, including the updated monocyte thresholds and exclusions. Next, I will examine the molecular and cytogenetic landscape. After that, I need to review clinical heterogeneity and prognostic models. Finally, I will consider management principles and the evolving therapeutic landscape, making sure I reconcile any conflicting statements from the literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct. CMML is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder classified as a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm overlap syndrome, characterized by persistent peripheral blood monocytosis and a risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, with overlapping features of MDS and MPN that shape both presentation and outcomes [^3e0046bc] [^462dfc06] [^8d033273].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria because they changed in 2022. Historically, CMML required an absolute monocyte count ≥ 1.0 × 10⁹/L with monocytes ≥ 10% of leukocytes, but the WHO 2022 and ICC 2022 lowered the absolute threshold to ≥ 0.5 × 10⁹/L while keeping the relative threshold ≥ 10%, and they require persistence for at least 3 months, exclusion of reactive monocytosis, and < 20% blasts/promonocytes in blood and marrow, with clonal cytogenetic or molecular evidence supporting the diagnosis when dysplasia is absent or equivocal [^16234212] [^e70f3e70] [^8d033273].

> Hold on, I should verify the exclusions and special variants. I need to ensure we exclude BCR-ABL1–positive leukemia, myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and PDGFRA/B, FGFR1, or PCM1-JAK2 rearrangements, and classical MPNs; oligomonocytic CMML is now recognized within CMML when the absolute monocyte count is 0.5– < 1.0 × 10⁹/L but other CMML features are present, and CMML can coexist with systemic mastocytosis, which requires KIT D816V testing and has therapeutic implications with midostaurin [^16234212] [^e70f3e70] [^c518234e].

> Next, I should review the molecular landscape. Let me think about frequency and prognostic weight. More than 90–95% of patients harbor somatic mutations, with TET2, SRSF2, and ASXL1 being the most common, followed by RAS pathway genes and RUNX1; ASXL1 truncation, RUNX1, NRAS/KRAS/CBL, and SETBP1 mutations confer adverse prognosis, whereas TET2 mutations in the absence of ASXL1 predict better response to hypomethylating agents, and TP53 mutations are rare in CMML but portend poor outcomes when present [^8d033273] [^462dfc06] [^98765d58] [^8ba995c5].

> I will now examine clinical heterogeneity and classification. CMML is subclassified into dysplastic (MD-CMML) and proliferative (MP-CMML) variants by a white blood cell threshold of 13 × 10⁹/L, with MP-CMML associated with higher leukocyte counts, splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, and worse survival; blast-based grading into CMML-1 (< 10% blasts/promonocytes) and CMML-2 (10–19%) further refines risk, and molecularly integrated prognostic models such as CPSS-Mol, Mayo Molecular Model, and GFM incorporate clinical and mutational features to stratify patients into risk groups with markedly different survival [^8d033273] [^462dfc06] [^071e837a].

> But wait, what if I overstated the curative options earlier. I should double-check. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only potentially curative modality, yet eligibility is limited by age and comorbidity, and outcomes are hampered by relapse and non-relapse mortality; in non-transplant candidates, hypomethylating agents are the backbone, with overall response rates around 40–50% but low complete remission rates and no durable eradication of the clone, and ruxolitinib can palliate proliferative symptoms and splenomegaly in selected patients [^8d033273] [^462dfc06] [^1c91ddbd].

> Let me reconsider the evolving therapeutic landscape so I don't miss anything. Emerging strategies include GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab, LILRB4-targeted antibodies, and combinations such as HMAs with venetoclax or ruxolitinib, while trials are exploring agents like sotatercept, tagraxofusp, and onvansertib; nonetheless, disease-modifying therapy remains elusive, and enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged given the limited efficacy of current standards [^7279ace9] [^07bf66a7] [^1c91ddbd].

> In summary, CMML is a clonal MDS/MPN overlap neoplasm defined by persistent monocytosis with updated diagnostic thresholds, enriched for mutations in TET2, SRSF2, and ASXL1, and characterized by dysplastic versus proliferative phenotypes that inform prognosis; management is risk-adapted, with transplantation offering the only cure and HMAs providing symptom control, while novel combinations and targeted approaches are under active investigation to address the substantial unmet need [^8d033273] [^462dfc06] [^16234212].

CMML is a **clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder** with overlapping myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features, defined by persistent monocytosis (≥ 0.5×10⁹/L with ≥ 10% monocytes) and dysplasia, and a risk of transformation to AML [^16234212] [^8d033273]. Diagnosis requires exclusion of reactive monocytosis and other myeloid neoplasms, with molecular testing identifying frequent mutations in TET2, SRSF2, and ASXL1 [^8d033273] [^98765d58]. Prognosis is heterogeneous; **allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only curative option**, while hypomethylating agents provide symptom control but limited survival benefit [^8d033273] [^462dfc06].

---

## Clinical features and epidemiology

- **Incidence**: Approximately 0.3–0.4 per 100,000 per year, rising with aging populations [^9c69ea3e].
- **Demographics**: Median age at diagnosis is 70–75 years, with a male predominance [^97f0e79b].
- **Presentation**: Patients often present with fatigue, infection, bleeding, splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats) [^aaf121c6].
- **Autoimmune associations**: Up to 20% have concurrent autoimmune or inflammatory conditions [^3e0046bc].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and classification

The **2022 WHO classification** defines CMML with the following criteria:

| **Criterion** | **Requirement** |
|-|-|
| Monocytosis | Absolute monocyte count ≥ 0.5×10⁹/L with ≥ 10% monocytes |
| Blast count | < 20% blasts (including promonocytes) in blood and bone marrow |
| Dysplasia | Morphologic dysplasia in ≥ 1 myeloid lineage |
| Exclusions | Exclude reactive monocytosis, BCR-ABL1, and myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and TK fusions (PDGFRA/B, FGFR1, PCM1-JAK2) [^16234212] [^c518234e] |

---

CMML is subclassified into **myelodysplastic (MD-CMML)** and **myeloproliferative (MP-CMML)** variants based on a white blood cell count threshold of 13×10⁹/L, and into **CMML-1** (< 10% blasts) and **CMML-2** (10–19% blasts) by blast count [^16234212] [^22ebe869].

---

## Molecular and genetic abnormalities

- **Mutations**: > 95% harbor somatic mutations; frequent genes include TET2 (~60%), SRSF2 (~50%), ASXL1 (~40%), and RAS pathway genes (~30%) [^8d033273] [^98765d58].
- **Cytogenetics**: ~30% have clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, including trisomy 8, -Y, chromosome 7 abnormalities, and complex karyotypes [^e65cecfe].
- **Prognostic mutations**: ASXL1, RUNX1, SETBP1, and RAS pathway mutations are associated with adverse outcomes [^98765d58].

---

## Prognostic scoring systems

Several **CMML-specific prognostic models** incorporate clinical and molecular features:

- **CPSS-Mol**: Incorporates clinical variables and mutations (ASXL1, RUNX1, NRAS, SETBP1) to stratify patients into four risk groups [^071e837a].
- **Mayo Molecular Model (MMM)**: Includes ASXL1 mutation, absolute monocyte count > 10×10⁹/L, hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, platelets < 100×10⁹/L, and circulating immature myeloid cells [^462dfc06].
- **GFM model**: Incorporates age, WBC count, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and ASXL1 mutation status [^4f456ea1].

---

## Treatment strategies

- **Supportive care**: Transfusions, growth factors, and infection prophylaxis are essential [^notfound].
- **Hypomethylating agents (HMAs)**: Azacitidine and decitabine are first-line for symptomatic or higher-risk patients, with response rates ~40–50% but limited survival benefit [^462dfc06] [^410fe7b9].
- **Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT)**: The only curative option, recommended for eligible high-risk patients; however, only ~10% are eligible due to age and comorbidities [^8d033273] [^03e2c0cd].
- **Emerging therapies**: Ruxolitinib, venetoclax combinations, and novel agents targeting GM-CSF, LILRB4, and RAS pathways are under investigation [^7279ace9] [^07bf66a7].

---

## Prognosis and survival

Prognosis is heterogeneous: median overall survival ranges from ~97 months in low-risk to ~16 months in high-risk categories [^462dfc06]. Transformation to AML occurs in **15–30%** over 3–5 years, more often in proliferative CMML and with adverse mutations [^03e2c0cd] [^8d033273].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on **molecularly targeted therapies**, including agents targeting GM-CSF, LILRB4, and RAS pathways, and on **combination strategies** such as HMAs with venetoclax or ruxolitinib to improve outcomes [^7279ace9] [^07bf66a7]. Efforts also seek to refine prognostic models and identify biomarkers to guide therapy selection [^1a72d6f7].

---

CMML is a **clonal myeloid neoplasm** with overlapping dysplastic and proliferative features, defined by monocytosis and dysplasia, and driven by recurrent mutations. Management is risk-adapted, with HMAs for symptom control and ASCT for eligible patients, while novel targeted therapies are in development to address the limited efficacy of current treatments [^8d033273] [^462dfc06].

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myeloid neoplasm characterized by dysplasia, abnormal production and accumulation of monocytic cells and an elevated risk of transforming into acute leukemia. Over the past two decades, our knowledge about the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms in CMML has increased substantially. In parallel, better diagnostic criteria and therapeutic strategies have been developed. However, many questions remain regarding prognostication and optimal therapy. In addition, there is a need to define potential pre-phases of CMML and special CMML variants, and to separate these entities from each other and from conditions mimicking CMML. To address these unmet needs, an international consensus group met in a Working Conference in August 2018 and discussed open questions and issues around CMML, its variants, and pre-CMML conditions. The outcomes of this meeting are summarized herein and include diag nostic criteria and a proposed classification of pre-CMML conditions as well as refined minimal diagnostic criteria for classical CMML and special CMML variants, including oligomonocytic CMML and CMML associated with systemic mastocytosis. Moreover, we propose diagnostic standards and tools to distinguish between 'normal', pre-CMML and CMML entities. These criteria and standards should facilitate diagnostic and prognostic evaluations in daily practice and clinical studies in applied hematology.

### CD4CAR T cell therapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory CD4 positive CMML… [^45b1146a]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, best dose, and effectiveness of CD4CAR T cell therapy in treating patients with CD4 positive chronic myelomonocytic leukemia that has come back after a period of improvement or has not responded to previous treatment. CD4 positive CMML is a blood cancer that affects white blood cells that express the protein CD4. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein, such as CD4, on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a CAR. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers.

The CD4CAR T cell therapy is designed to bind to and eliminate cells, including cancer cells that have this protein. CD4CAR T cell therapy may be safe, tolerable and/or effective in treating patients with CD4 positive relapsed or refractory CMML.

### Importance of genetics in the clinical management of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia… [^e71dc245]. ASCO (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a clonal hematopoietic malignancy that is characterized by dysplasia, peripheral monocytosis, ineffective hematopoiesis, and an increased risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. 1Because the clinical phenotype of CMML displays features of both myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms, the classification of CMML has historically been a dynamic process. 2Before 2001, CMML was classified as a subtype of MDSs, as initially reported by the French-American-British Group, because of its characteristic dysplasia, cytopenias, and acute myeloid leukemia transformation rate. 3However, as it became increasingly clear that CMML is clinically distinct from MDS, CMML was placed in a provisional category within the World Health Organization classification of hematologic neoplasms known as MDS/MPN overlap diseases.

This classification schema was formalized by WHO in 2008 and defines CMML as having a persistent peripheral blood monocytosis greater than 1 × 10⁹/L, dysplasia in at least one hematopoietic lineage, and less than 20% myeloblasts and promonocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. 6–11Although recurrent mutations in CMML, such as those in ASXL1and SRSF2, are not disease-specific, it is the high frequency of these mutations that gives CMML its unique genomic identity. 7, 12This CMML genomic fingerprint now gives CMML researchers a platform to construct genomically based, CMML-specific therapeutics and prognostic tools. In the article by Itzykson et al 13that accompanies this editorial, this genomic fingerprint is leveraged to create a robust CMML-specific prognostic tool using the combined presence of recurrent mutations and clinical parameters. In addition to its impact as a prognostic tool, this study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of CMML.

First, it confirms that mutations in. This methodology revealed that initial mutations occur in the CD34 +/CD38 −hematopoietic stem-cell compartment and that these mutations create a state of early clonal dominance in which secondary mutations are acquired in a linear manner with minimal branching of clones from the main dominant clone. This early clonal dominance may distinguish CMML from other myeloid neoplasms with similar gene mutations.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematological malignancy characterized by both dysplastic and proliferative features, with an inherent risk for leukemic transformation. With the help of this review, we aim to summarize key concepts with regards to CMML biology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and therapeutics.

Recent Findings

Based on recent studies, CMML is hallmarked by a relatively low genetic complexity, which contrasts with a compelling phenotypical heterogeneity, largely driven by epigenetic mechanisms. Recent advances in the characterization of CMML biology has led to an improvement in risk-stratification, by means of incorporating prognostically relevant gene mutations. This, however, has not significantly impacted available therapies and outcomes continue to remain poor. Advances in CMML biology have better explained the phenotypic heterogeneity, while continuing to define the genetic and epigenetic landscape. In spite of recent advances, limited effective therapies exist and developing rationally derived therapeutic approaches is much needed.

Concluding remarks and future perspectives

CMML is a unique and rare hematopoietic neoplasm with a complex biology and pathology. In the past 10 years, several different pre-CMML conditions and sub-variants of CMML have been defined. In the current article, we propose minimal diagnostic criteria for classical CMML and for special CMML variants. These criteria should help in the diagnosis of pre-CMML conditions, classical CMML, special CMML variants, and conditions that mimick CMML. In addition, we propose standards and tools for the diagnosis, prognostication and management of CMML. Contemporary assays define all major histopathological, molecular, cytogenetic and flow cytometry-based features of neoplastic cells, and thereby cover all CMML variants, including oligomonocytic CMML and CMML associated with certain drivers or a concomitant myeloid neoplasm, such as mastocytosis. Different aberration profiles may also be found, resulting in a quite heterogeneous clinical picture and a variable clinical course. Although the course is often unpredictable, initial grading and consecutive application of CMML-directed prognostic scores are standard tools that support the prognostication of patients with CMML concerning survival and AML evolution. The application of criteria, tools and standards proposed herein should assist in the diagnosis, prognostication and management of patients with CMML.

Which genetic features suggest a need for treatment?

Clonal expansion and/or clonal evolution should be regarded as markers of disease progression, moving patients to a higher risk group. If clonal expansion and/or clonal evolution occurs without an increase in blasts, pre‐emptive treatment is justified to prevent progression to AML, using allogeneic stem cell transplantation. If allogeneic stem cell transplantation is not possible, HMAs can be tried. Usually, however, clonal expansion and/or clonal evolution may be accompanied by increasing blasts in the blood and marrow or dropping cell counts, triggering the same treatment decision. A standard monitoring of the variant allele frequency of mutated genes from blood or marrow is not well established in clinical routine practice outside academic centres, but can provide information on the evolution of the affected clone(s), and can indicate the necessity of treatment.

In summary, the choice of treatment for CMML patients must consider that (a) there are no approved compounds besides HMAs, (b) only a minority of CMML patients can be offered allogeneic stem cell transplantation, (c) there are no reliable predictive parameters for different types of treatment, (d) clinical trials are lacking and (e) the less favourable the CMML risk group, the greater the need for effective treatment but the poorer the results. Figure 1 could be helpful in structuring the therapeutic considerations.

Summary

Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemias (CMML) are myeloid neoplasms characterized by a sustained increase in monocyte counts in the peripheral blood, accompanied by dysplasia, abnormal proliferation, chromosomal anomalies and somatic mutations of haematopoietic cells. More than 95% of CMML patients harbour somatic mutations. CMML must be separated from other myeloid neoplasms and reactive monocytosis. The clinical presentation of CMML varies, but most frequently shows signs and symptoms of haematopoietic insufficiency or myeloproliferation. Robust instruments are available for assessing the prognosis of patients with CMML, such as the CMML‐specific prognostic scoring system molecular. Treatment options for patients with CMML are still inadequate and generally less effective than those for other myeloid neoplasms. The only curative approach is allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This article explains essential aspects of CMML pathophysiology and provides an overview of diagnostic considerations, prognostic assessment and therapeutic options.

CMML management — The management of CMML depends on the characteristics of the patient's disease and is typically focused on supportive care and cytoreductive therapy; in patients with CMML-1 and CMML-2, decitabine and azacitidine (AzaC) have demonstrated efficacy, and emerging data suggest utility of ruxolitinib in this context.

Definition of CMML and minimal diagnostic criteria

The diagnostic criteria of CMML, as defined by the WHO, are depicted in Online Supplementary Table S1. Our faculty is of the opinion that these criteria are valid in general for the classical form of CMML, but need adjustments for special variants of CMML. Based on consensus discussion, the following concept is proposed.

The classical form of CMML is defined by the following pre-requisite criteria: (i) persistent (at least 3 months) absolute PB monocytosis (≥ 1×10⁹ /L) and relative monocytosis (≥ 10% of PB leukocytes); (ii) exclusion of BCR-ABL1 + leukemia, classical MPN and all other hematologic neoplasms that may serve as a primary source of monocytosis; and (iii) a blast cell count of 0–19% in PB and/or BM smears and exclusion of all (other) histopathological, morphological, phenotypic, molecular and cytogenetic signs that qualify as evidence of AML. In addition, morphological and/or histopathological evidence for diagnostic dysplasia in one or more of the three major BM cell lineages (≥ 10% of megakaryocytes and/or erythroid precursor cells and/or neutrophilic cells) must be present. If dysplasia is absent or not diagnostic (< 10%), the presence of cytogenetic or molecular lesions (mutations) typically found in CMML and/or the presence of CMML-related flow cytometry abnormalities may be employed as co-criteria and may lead to the diagnosis of CMML, provided that the pre-requisite criteria listed above are fulfilled. Pre-requisite criteria and co-criteria of the classical form of CMML are presented in Table 1.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic innovations [^1b12326e]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is an aggressive clonal stem cell disorder categorized among myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative overlap neoplasms. While sharing features with both myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms, CMML has distinct molecular and clinical profiles. The presence of CMML-specific prognostic models, response criteria, and dedicated clinical trials underscores a unique and complex biology. Age-related changes affecting the bone marrow microenvironment, immune responses, and the intricate balance between epigenetic deregulation and proinflammatory signaling are characteristic of this disease, collectively posing significant scientific and clinical challenges in its management. CMML is an aging-related, clinically heterogeneous neoplasm with limited approved therapeutic options, representing an area of unmet medical need. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving CMML evolution and its clinical manifestations within the ever-evolving landscape of precision medicine. In light of the most recent molecular discoveries, we highlight the shortcomings of existing therapies and underscore promising investigational agents. Many of the biological findings discussed are shared across a spectrum of acute and chronic myeloid neoplasms, as well as clonal hematopoiesis, broadening the scope of this review.

Conclusions

CMML is a unique MDS/MPN overlap neoplasm with relative genetic homogeneity, but with marked clinical heterogeneity. The disease is seen in the elderly and frequently develops on the background of clonal hematopoiesis, with recurrent somatic mutations involving TET2, ASXL1, SRSF2 and the RAS pathway defining dysplastic and proliferative subtypes of CMML. For several years CMML was considered as a subtype of MDS, but from 2002 onwards, CMML has been rightfully recognized as a unique neoplasm with the development of CMML-specific prognostic models, response criteria, preclinical models and, most importantly, clinical trials; heralding a new future for this disease and affected patients. Several challenges remain, including the lack of uniform consensus on personalized prognostication and more importantly, the identification of disease-modifying targets and therapies that might ameliorate disease progression, improve quality of life, and potentially offer a cure.

DIAGNOSIS

CMML was first described in the early 1970sand has been reported as a preleukaemic state. The model of leukaemic transformation corresponds to that of myelodysplastic syndromes. However, CMML differs from myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) in the obligatory monocyte population that is detectable in the blood at diagnosis. Due to the similarity of CMML and MDS, the French American British classification (FAB) proposalsclassified CMML and MDS as close relatives, thus creating a problem because many people now believe that CMML is just a variant of MDS. However, it has become clear that CMML is more than MDS plus monocytosis, not only based on its clinical presentation but also with regard to genetic alterations and therapeutic problems. The FAB classification proposed an obligatory monocytosis of more than 1000/μL, which was retained over the years until the threshold was lowered to 500/μL in both the WHO classification of 2022and the International Consensus Classification (ICC) classification. In addition, signs of dysplasia in blood and marrow have always been included as characterizing features of CMML. Inspired by the concept of 'oligomonocytic leukaemia', the threshold of 500 monocytes/μL is now used as a defining event in CMML, together with evidence of clonality by the means of detection of somatic mutations or chromosomal aberrations. This proposal solves, at least in part, another problem in the diagnosis of CMML, namely the differentiation against various non‐myeloid diseases with reactive monocytosis, as well as distinction between CMML and some other myeloid malignancies. Table 1 presents a list of differential diagnoses that need to be excluded, especially in those rare cases without proof of clonality. The increasing availability and decreasing cost of DNA sequencing promote investigations of clonality, which either confirm the suspected diagnosis of CMML or, in case of negative findings, point to reactive monocytosis. There is evidence that molecular screening can be performed on peripheral blood cells.

In practice, any of the three molecularly integrated CMML prognostic models can be used for risk stratification. While these models have not been formally compared against each other, they share several overlapping prognostic features, especially anemia, elevated white blood cell counts and truncating ASXL1 mutations. I use both the MMM and the CPSS-Mol model for risk stratification at my institution.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^f5113326]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Clinical principles — MDS/MPN overlap neoplasms (CMML prognosis and management) — Prognostic classification systems have been developed for patients with CMML with features similar to those for MDS; proliferative CMML defined by white blood cell [WBC] count > 12,000/mm³ has a worse prognosis than the dysplastic subtype, and ASXL1 is indicated as an adverse prognostic feature. Therapeutic approaches in CMML include hypomethylating agent (HMA) ± venetoclax treatment for patients with intermediate- and higher-risk disease and use of these agents as a bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for transplant-eligible patients; the trajectory of disease progression may differ across entities, thus expectant clinical monitoring is needed to assess potential change in patient's clinical status. Transplant eligibility principles include patients having fit performance status, their age, and having a donor, and treatment response criteria for CMML have been developed by an international consortium of investigators. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

CATEGORIZATION

The diagnosis of CMML should eventually specify the following categories:
CMML proliferative versus dysplastic type
CMML type I versus II, according to peripheral and medullary blast counts

In addition, we recommend identifying and reporting the newly defined cases of oligomonocytic CMML, regardless of their diagnostic classification as proliferative or dysplastic type and CMML I or II respectively. In the future, this will enable us to investigate their haematological, morphological, flow cytometric, genetic and prognostic characteristics, and to find an adequate placement somewhere between classical CMML on the one hand and MDS on the other hand. It is still debatable whether a separate entity of 'oligomonocytic chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia' is justified. Similarly, there are pros and cons regarding the threshold of 5% or 10% medullary blasts as cut‐off value for CMML types. Regardless, it is important to assess the blast percentage as exact and reliable as possible, at least to enable comparison between different types of disease. In addition, attention should be given to marrow fibrosis in CMML, which is present in a non‐negligible proportion of cases. Fibrosis in CMML is associated with a worse prognosis and also with a more proliferative character of the disease, indicated by morphological and functional changes of blood cells, a more pronounced haematopoietic insufficiency, organomegaly and constitutional symptoms. The more we learn about the genetic underpinnings of myeloid neoplasms, the more genotype–phenotype correlations will be identified, obliging us to rethink classifications. There are CMML cases with AML‐type somatic mutations such as NPM1, CEBPα and FLT3. The question arises whether these cases should be classified as AML, regardless of blast and monocyte counts. About 5%–10% of patients with CMML belong to the group of post‐cytotoxic myeloid neoplasia, often characterized by a poor risk type due to chromosomal or molecular events therapy‐related CMML (t‐CMML).

### Should oligomonocytic CMML be classified as an independent disease entity? [^c29fcc25]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2022 WHO Classification revised the diagnostic criteria of CMML and included the variant, formerly known as oligomonocytic CMML (O-CMML), into the CMML disease. CMML is currently subtyped into MD-CMML and MP-CMML. In a recent study, Castaño-Díez et al. showed that the newly included O-CMML has unique clinical features and is an independent favourable risk factor, and proposed to view O-CMML as an independent subtype of CMML, parallel to MD-CMML and MP-CMML.

### An international data set for CMML validates prognostic scoring systems and demonstrates a need for novel prognostication strategies [^1a72d6f7]. Blood Cancer Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Since its reclassification as a distinct disease entity, clinical research efforts have attempted to establish baseline characteristics and prognostic scoring systems for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Although existing data for baseline characteristics and CMML prognostication have been robustly developed and externally validated, these results have been limited by the small size of single-institution cohorts. We developed an international CMML data set that included 1832 cases across eight centers to establish the frequency of key clinical characteristics. Of note, we found that the majority of CMML patients were classified as World Health Organization CMML-1 and that a 7.5% bone marrow blast cut-point may discriminate prognosis with higher resolution in comparison with the existing 10%. We additionally interrogated existing CMML prognostic models and found that they are all valid and have comparable performance but are vulnerable to upstaging. Using random forest survival analysis for variable discovery, we demonstrated that the prognostic power of clinical variables alone is limited. Last, we confirmed the independent prognostic relevance of ASXL1 gene mutations and identified the novel adverse prognostic impact imparted by CBL mutations. Our data suggest that combinations of clinical and molecular information may be required to improve the accuracy of current CMML prognostication.

THERAPY

Considerations regarding CMML treatment are complicated for several reasons:
All therapies used for diverse myeloid neoplasms are less effective in patients with CMML. This is true for palliative treatment, disease‐modifying therapies and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The probability of a treatment response and the duration of responses are worse than in AML or MDS. In CMML, there are no genetically favourable parameters that are associated with a better outcome, like t(8;21), inv(16) or NPM1 mutations in AML. Reliable predictive parameters for predicting a response or duration of response are largely missing.
There is no solid basis for decision‐making regarding therapeutic goals, in particular whether we should strive to achieve normalization of peripheral cell counts or can limit our endeavour to prevent excessive numbers of leucocytes and monocytes. Furthermore, it is unclear if achieving a complete remission (in blood and bone marrow) is necessary, or if the patients also benefit from a partial response, as it is the case in patients with MDS treated with hypomethylating agents (HMA).
Very few compounds have been investigated in clinical trials in patients with CMML. There are only two phase 3 studies that specifically focused on patients with CMML. Usually, patients with CMML were included in trials designed for patients with MDS. In most cases, the number of participating CMML patients was too small to be analysed separately. This was, for instance, the case in the pivotal phase 3 trial with 5‐azacitidine for patients with higher risk MDS (including CMML). Astonishingly, 5‐azacitidine was nevertheless approved for treatment of patients with high‐risk CMML of the dysplastic type.
5‐azacitidine is the only approved compound for patients with high‐risk CMML of the dysplastic type (WBC < 12 000/μL) in the European Union (in the US decitabine is also approved). This group comprises less than 25% of all CMML patients. Furthermore, the AZA01 studyinclusion criteria categorized CMML patients into risk groups using the IPSS, which, as discussed above, is poorly suited for the prognostic assessment of CMML. Meanwhile, It has been accepted that CMML should be separated from MDS when clinical trials are designed. Accordingly, virtually all MDS studies performed in recent years excluded CMML, and specific clinical trials for CMML patients are largely lacking. It is therefore not surprising that, besides 5‐azacitidine, no other compound is formally approved for patients with CMML.
Although we now have robust prognostic scoring systems such as the CPSSmol that enable risk assessment in terms of disease progression and life expectancy, we should be aware that treatment is often needed for patients categorized as low‐risk CMML, with a low risk of AML development. While prognostic scores help us to assess the natural course of the disease, simple allocation of patients to various risk groups is not sufficient as a basis for therapeutic decision‐making.

### Genetic complexity of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^888854a5]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2021). Medium credibility.

In recent years CMML has received increased attention as the most commonly observed MDS/MPN overlap syndrome. Renewed interest has occurred in part due to widespread adoption of next-generation sequencing panels that help render the diagnosis in the absence of morphologic dysplasia. Although most CMML patients exhibit somatic mutations in epigenetic modifiers, spliceosome components, transcription factors and signal transduction genes, it is increasingly clear that a small subset harbors an inherited predisposition to CMML and other myeloid neoplasms. More intriguing is the fact that the mutational spectrum observed in CMML is found in other types of myeloid leukemias, begging the question of how similar genetic backgrounds can lead to such divergent clinical phenotypes. In this review we present a contemporary snapshot of the genetic complexity inherent to CMML, explore the relationship between genotype-phenotype and present a stepwise model of CMML pathogenesis and progression.

Management strategies and therapeutic options in CMML

Several new treatment strategies for CMML have been developed during the past 15 years. A detailed description of therapeutic options is beyond the scope of this article. The reader is referred to a series of excellent published review articles. - A disappointing fact is that all drug therapies are still non-curative. The only curative therapy in CMML remains allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. For most young and eligible patients with acceptable transplant-related risk, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is therefore recommended. All other forms of treatment are cytoreductive, experimental or palliative in nature. Some of these drugs, such as the hypomethylating agents (5-azacytidine, decitabine) may induce long-term disease control in a subset of patients with classical CMML. - In general, cytoreductive and palliative drugs should be used according to available recommendations provided by major societies. Similarly, treatment response assessment should be performed in line with available (accepted) guidelines.

Specific therapy may work in those patients who suffer from a special variant of CMML. For example, in CMML patients with a transforming PDGFRA/B mutation, treatment with imatinib or other similar tyrosine kinase inhibitor usually induces major responses or even long-lasting remissions. -, In patients with SM-CMML, midostaurin may result in disease control, especially when the CMML portion of the disease exhibits KIT D816V. However, in many cases, relapses occur. Treatment options in CMML and its variants are summarized in Online Supplementary Table S10.

### Proposed diagnostic criteria for classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), CMML variants and pre-CMML conditions [^a14abab2]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

For many years, CMML was listed as a separate variant among the MDS in the classification of the French-American-British (FAB) working group. However, in 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO) reclassified CMML into a newly created MDS/MPN overlap group, defined by the presence of both MDS-related and MPN-related morphological and clinical features. Depending on the leukocyte count, CMML can be divided into a 'dysplastic' variant (leukocyte count ≤ 13×10⁹ /L) and a 'proliferative' variant (leukocyte count > 13×10⁹ /L). In 2001 and 2008, the WHO also proposed a split into CMML-1 and CMML-2, based on the percentage of blast cells in the blood and bone marrow (BM). In the most recent updates of the WHO 2016 classification, CMML is again listed amongst the MDS/MPN overlap disorders. Based on the percentage of blasts, CMML is now divided into CMML-0, CMML-1, and CMML-2. - Moreover, contrasting the 2008 WHO classification, the diagnosis of CMML now requires both an absolute monocytosis (≥ 1×10⁹ /L) and relative monocytosis (≥ 10% of leukocytes) in the peripheral blood (PB). - In the 2008 and 2016 update of the WHO classification, CMML can only be diagnosed per definition when rearrangements in PDGFRA, PDGFRB or FGFR1 genes have been excluded, and in the 2016 update, the PCM1-JAK2 fusion gene was added as an excluding criterion. -, These molecular aberrations are commonly found in eosinophilia-associated neoplasms such as chronic eosinophilic leukemia. However, CMML is also listed as an underlying variant in these molecular 'entities' in the WHO classification system.

Introduction

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a heterogeneous malignancy characterized by peripheral blood monocytosis and a propensity for acute myeloid leukemia transformation. Its clinical heterogeneity is broadly captured by the French–American–British group, which defines myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-CMML and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-CMML based on the latter having a white blood cell count > 13 × 10³ cells per dl. The World Health Organization (WHO) reclassified CMML as a distinct disease entity under the MDS/MPN designation in 2008. This reclassification has been substantiated by recent advances in the genetic and molecular pathogenesis of CMML, which has confirmed CMML to be biologically distinct from MDS. Since its reclassification, clinical research efforts have begun to delineate CMML-specific tools and therapeutics. Several prognostic models derived from smaller data sets have been developed to stratify CMML patients into groups that are predictive for overall survival (OS). However, the validity of these models in a large international data set has never been investigated, and a consensus is not yet present that would standardize risk stratification.

The incidence of CMML is estimated at 0.4 per 100 000 based on several large epidemiologic studies. Given the apparent low incidence of CMML and its broad range complexity, detailed baseline characteristics describing the clinical heterogeneity have not been reported in a large data set. To examine CMML baseline characteristics and test the prognostic significance of clinical and genetic variables, as well as the relative power of existing prognostic models with sufficient resolution, we constructed a large international CMML database that merged CMML registries from eight tertiary cancer centers across three different countries.

The aims of this study were to establish a large disease-specific data set capable of discerning independent covariates predictive of disease behavior. Using this data set, we explored and annotated the frequencies of clinically relevant disease characteristics. We additionally attempted to validate prognostic models used in CMML clinical practice and determined their relative statistical power within our data set, as well as explored the possibility of constructing a novel model that would increase prognostic capacity in CMML. Last, we examined the prognostic significance of the most frequent mutations in CMML to determine if their incorporation would better refine disease prognostication.

How I manage patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia

The first step in the management of CMML patients is establishing an accurate diagnosis, followed by personalized risk stratification. Using any one of the molecularly integrated prognostic models, CMML patients can be stratified into lower risk and higher risk groups (Figure 4). Management strategies for these two risk groups are described below.

Lower-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukemia

I define lower-risk CMML patients as those who fall into low and intermediate-1 risk categories based on the MMM and the CPSS-Mol, or the low-risk category of the GFM model. On average these patients have a median overall survival of 60–100 months, and the following treatment strategies can be adopted for their care:

Figure 4.
Management algorithm for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia based on risk stratification using the Mayo Molecular Model (Patnaik MM et al. Leukemia 2014). CMML: chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, DNMTi: DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, X: new clinical trial investigational agent.

Observation and supportive care. Several low-risk patients can be observed without any CMML-directed therapies, with serial blood count measurements and management of symptoms as needed. There are some data to suggest that in pCMML, permissive leukocytosis/monocytosis can be associated with increased lysozyme levels and a higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease (lysozyme nephropathy), and in select asymptomatic pCMML patients with white blood cell counts > 30×10⁹ /L, I do recommend hydroxyurea to control blood counts and proliferative features. Side effects associated with hydroxyurea include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, mouth sores, photosensitivity, myelosuppression, and chronic non-healing leg/ankle ulcers.

### A phase II, multicentre trial of decitabine in higher-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^96fa45ae]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Decitabine appears to be an effective treatment for patients with high-risk CMML, including those with proliferative disease. Further research is needed to determine whether there is a difference in response between low- and high-risk patients. Owing to the rarity of CMML, large, specific trials can be difficult to conduct. However, we are currently conducting (within the guidance of the European MDS Studies Coordination Office) an international, randomized, phase 3 trial comparing decitabine (± hydroxyurea) with hydroxyurea in patients with advanced proliferative CMML (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT 02214407). The results of this trial will provide further important insights into the efficacy of decitabine as a treatment for CMML, particularly in patients with proliferative disease, for whom treatment with HMAs is currently not a licensed option.

### Clinical management of CMML-state of the art [^8627ad7d]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Through assessing the above‐mentioned diagnostic parameters, important prognostic information is gathered in terms of overall survival (OS) and risk of progression to AML. In addition, at least in part, decision‐making may be alleviated regarding treatment initiation and type of therapy.

In the realm of CMML, there is another subtype of MDS/(MPN) myeloproliferative neoplasms overlap disease, namely a small group of CMML patients presenting with ring sideroblasts and/or SF3B1 mutation. These patients formally have a CMML diagnosis but resemble the MDS/MPN SF3B1 category with regard to clinical and haematological features and have a much better prognosis than their counterparts without SF3B1 mutation. Apparently, the favourable prognostic impact of an SF3B1 mutation and/or ring sideroblasts overrides the negative prognostic impact of monocytosis.

Special variants of CMML: overview

As mentioned before, the classical form of CMML meets all pre-requisite criteria, and no signs (including molecular features) of an additional, concomitant BM neoplasm are detected. The special variants of CMML form a heterogeneous group of neoplasms comprising distinct clinical and biological entities. In one group of patients, the relative monocyte count (≥ 10%) is fulfilled without resulting in an absolute count ≥ 1×10 9 /L, precluding the diagnosis of 'classical CMML'. Most of these patients are diagnosed as having MDS or MPN/MDS-unclassified by WHO criteria. In another group of patients, a molecular signature suggestive of a different type of myeloid neoplasm is detected but only the criteria for CMML (not those for the other neoplasm) are met. Such an example is CMML with JAK2 V617F (without definitive evidence of a concomitant MPN). In a third group, CMML co-exists with another BM neoplasm, such as MPN or mastocytosis. In these patients, additional blood count abnormalities (e.g. eosinophilia), an elevated serum tryptase level and/or BM fibrosis, may be detected.

All variants of CMML (classical and special) can occur as a primary CMML or as a secondary CMML following a 'mutagenic' event, such as chemotherapy (therapy-related CMML). In addition, our faculty is of the opinion, that the term secondary CMML may also be appropriate for those patients who develop CMML (months or years) after another indolent myeloid neoplasm, such as a MDS or systemic (indolent or aggressive) mastocytosis, had been diagnosed. In the following paragraphs, the clinical features and diagnostic criteria of special (atypical) variants of CMML are proposed and discussed. An overview of the special variants of CMML is provided in Table 2.

Treatment-related CMML and other secondary forms of CMML

Our faculty concluded that both the classical form of CMML and the special variants of CMML should be divided into primary (de novo) CMML and secondary CMML. The latter group includes patients who (i) received chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy in the past (therapy-related CMML) or (ii) have a history of a preceding MDS, MPN or another indolent myeloid or mast cell neoplasm prior to their diagnosis of CMML.,- Recent data suggest that patients with therapy-related secondary CMML may have shorter overall survival compared to that of patients with primary (de novo) CMML. Although progression-free survival may not be different in these patients compared to those with de novo CMML, some of these patients progress rapidly to secondary AML. It is also worth noting that patients with therapy-related secondary CMML have a higher frequency of karyotypic abnormalities compared to patients with de novo CMML. Eligible patients in this group should be offered allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Potential pre-phases of CMML

During the past few years evidence has accumulated suggesting that hematopoietic neoplasms, including MDS, MPN and MDS/MPN, develop in a step-wise manner. In the earliest phases of clonal development, patients present without overt signs or symptoms of a hematopoietic neoplasm but their leukocytes carry one or more somatic mutations, usually (early, passenger-type) mutations otherwise also found in overt myeloid neoplasms (for example TET2 mutations). - In the context of MDS and other myeloid neoplasms, these cases have been referred to as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), or, when accompanied by cytopenia, as clonal cytopenia of unknown significance (CCUS). - Since these mutations are frequently detected in older individuals, the condition is also called age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH). In a few healthy individuals, bona fide oncogenic drivers (such as BCR-ABL1) are detected in a small subset of leukocytes. Because of the oncogenic potential of these drivers, these conditions are termed clonal hematopoiesis with oncogenic potential (CHOP). CHIP, CCUS and CHOP may also be the earliest clonal conditions preceding CMML. For these cases, the definitions recently proposed for CHIP, CCUS and CHOP should apply.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic innovations [^fc83f764]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Epigenetic dysregulation in CMML leads to myeloid bias and clonal monocytosis. Subsequent acquisition of epigenetic/ transcription factor mutations typically results in dysplastic CMML, whereas signaling mutations are more commonly associated with the more aggressive proliferative CMML. Increased activation of pro-inflammatory pathways in clonal monocytes as well as accumulation of leukemia-derived plasmacytoid dendritic cells, causing suppression of the adaptive immune system, drive more severe clinical manifestations with inferior outcomes. Despite active research, there remains an unmet clinical need to improve outcomes for CMML patients. Single-agent therapy fails to alter disease biology and the complex pathophysiology of CMML highlights the need to explore combination strategies, with several clinical trials currently underway.

### How I treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^a0e80495]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic malignancy that may deserve specific management. Defined by a persistent peripheral blood monocytosis ≥ 1 × 10 9 /L and monocytes accounting for ≥ 10% of the white blood cells, this aging-associated disease combines cell proliferation as a consequence of myeloid progenitor hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor with myeloid cell dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis. The only curative option for CMML remains allogeneic stem cell transplantation. When transplantation is excluded, CMML is stratified into myelodysplastic (white blood cell count < 13 × 10⁹ /L) and proliferative (white blood cell count ≥ 13 × 10⁹ /L) CMML. In the absence of poor prognostic factors, the management of myelodysplastic CMML is largely inspired from myelodysplastic syndromes, relying on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to cope with anemia, and careful monitoring and supportive care, whereas the management of proliferative CMML usually relies on cytoreductive agents such as hydroxyurea, although ongoing studies will help delineate the role of hypomethylating agents in this patient population. In the presence of excessive blasts and other poor prognostic factors, hypomethylating agents are the preferred option, even though their impact on leukemic transformation and survival has not been proved. The therapeutic choice is illustrated by 4 clinical situations among the most commonly seen. Although current therapeutic options can improve patient's quality of life, they barely modify disease evolution. Improved understanding of CMML pathophysiology will hopefully lead to the exploration of novel targets that potentially would be curative.

### Increasing recognition and emerging therapies argue for dedicated clinical trials in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^7279ace9]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder with overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Median overall survival of this aggressive myeloid malignancy is only 2–3 years, with a 15–30% risk of acute leukemic transformation. The paucity of clinical trials specifically designed for CMML has made therapeutic management of CMML patients challenging. As a result, treatment paradigms for CMML patients are largely borrowed from MDS and MPN. The standard of care still relies on hydroxyurea, hypomethylating agents (HMA), and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, this latter option remaining the only potentially curative therapy. To date, approved drugs for CMML treatment are HMA, including azacitidine, decitabine, and more recently the oral combination of decitabine and cedazuridine. However, HMA treatment does not meaningfully alter the natural course of this disease. New treatment approaches for improving CMML-associated cytopenias or targeting the CMML malignant clone are emerging. More than 25 therapeutic agents are currently being evaluated in phase 1 or phase 2 clinical trials for CMML and other myeloid malignancies, often in combination with a HMA backbone. Several novel agents, such as sotatercept, ruxolitinib, lenzilumab, and tagraxofusp have shown promising clinical efficacy in CMML. Current evidence supports the idea that effective treatment in CMML will likely require combination therapy targeting multiple pathways, which emphasizes the need for additional new therapeutic options. This review focuses on recent therapeutic advances and innovative treatment strategies in CMML, including global and molecularly targeted approaches. We also discuss what may help to make progress in the design of rationally derived and disease-modifying therapies for CMML.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with NPM1 mutation or acute myeloid leukemia? [^e1906783]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2022 WHO revision and the ICC classification have recently modified the diagnostic criteria for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and acute myeloid leukemia. However, there is no consensus on whether CMML with NPM1 mutation (NPM1mut) should be diagnosed as AML. Nowadays, it is a subject of discussion because of its diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Therefore, we describe a case of a patient diagnosed with CMML NPM1mut and briefly review the literature to highlight the uncertainty about how to classify a CMML with NPM1 mutation. We emphasize the importance of a comprehensive molecular study, which is crucial to optimize the individualized treatment of patients, enabling them to access targeted therapies.

### Myelodysplastic / myeloproliferative neoplasms treatment… [^aaf121c6]. NCI (2003). Low credibility.

CMML is a clonal disorder of a bone marrow stem cell. Monocytosis is a major defining feature. CMML exhibits heterogenous clinical, hematological, and morphological features, varying from predominantly myelodysplastic to predominantly myeloproliferative. Evolution to acute myeloid leukemia portends a particularly poor prognosis. CMML is characterized pathologically by:

- Persistent monocytosis is greater than 1 × 10⁹/L in the peripheral blood.
- No Philadelphia chromosome or BCR:: ABL1gene fusion.
- No PDGFRAand PDGFRBrearrangement. Clinical features of CMML include:

- Fever, fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss. For more information, see Fatigue, Hot Flashes and Night Sweats, and Nutrition in Cancer Care.
- Infection.
- Bleeding caused by thrombocytopenia.
- Hepatomegaly.
- Splenomegaly. In CMML with eosinophilia, all criteria for CMML are present, and the eosinophil count in the peripheral blood is more than 1.

5 × 10⁹/L. Recurrent somatic pathogenic variants have been identified in most patients with CMML, resulting in altered signaling molecules (especially. Progression to acute leukemia occurs in approximately 15% to 20% of cases. CPSS-Mol is a CMML-specific prognostic scoring system that incorporates molecular genetic data, especially pathogenic variants in RUNX1, NRAS, SETBP1, and ASXL1. This system distinguishes low-risk disease with median survivals longer than 10 years from high-risk disease with median survivals of 2 to 4 years. Treatment Overview CMML is a diagnosis typically made after age 70 years. The clinical course of CMML ranges from indolent or smoldering disease to an aggressive disease progression culminating in severe cytopenias or evolution to acute leukemia.

Assessment of the risk factors and the pace of disease over time may help to distinguish patients who require therapy from those who would be best managed with a watchful waiting approach. Asymptomatic patients at low risk of progression may be best served by forgoing therapy.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia diagnosis and management [^3e0046bc]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a rare, heterogeneous myeloid malignancy classified as a myelodysplastic syndromes/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) overlap syndrome by the World Health Organization (WHO). Its initial presentation can be incidental or associated with myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative symptoms and up to 20% of patients harbor a concurrent inflammatory or autoimmune condition. Persistent monocytosis is the hallmark of CMML but diagnosis can be challenging. Increased understanding of human monocyte subsets, chromosomal abnormalities, and somatic gene mutations have led to more accurate diagnosis and improved prognostication. A number of risk stratification systems have been developed and validated but using those that incorporate molecular information such as CMML Prognostic Scoring System (CPSS)-Mol, Mayo Molecular, and Groupe Francophone des Myelodysplasies (GFM) are preferred. Symptom-directed approaches forms the basis of CMML management. Outcomes vary substantially depending on risk ranging from observation for a number of years to rapidly progressive disease and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation. Patients who are low risk but with symptoms from cytopenias or proliferative features such as splenomegaly may be treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) or cytoreductive therapy, respectively, with the goal of durable symptoms control. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation should be considered for intermediate to high risk patients. The lack of effective pharmaceutical options has generated interest in novel therapeutics for this disease, and early phase clinical trial results are promising.

Higher-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukemia

I define higher-risk CMML patients as those who fall into intermediate-2 and high-risk categories based on the MMM and the CPSS-Mol, or the high-risk category of the GFM model. On average these patients have a median overall survival < 2 years, and the following treatment strategies can be adopted for their care.

Allogeneic HSCT. Allogeneic HSCT remains the only potentially curative option for patients with CMML. However, given the older age at presentation and associated morbidities, most patients are not eligible. At our institution, CMML patients with higher-risk disease diagnosed < 75 years of age and with an acceptable HSCT-comorbidity index (deemed by an expert committee) are usually referred for allogeneic HSCT. A recent consensus document from an expert panel does recommend upfront allogeneic HSCT for intermediate-2 and high-risk CMML patients (CPSS risk stratification), with < 10% bone marrow blasts. For patients with > 10% bone marrow blasts, I usually cytoreduce with DNMT inhibition or AML-like induction therapy, especially in "younger and fit" patients. In the largest study to date, the European Group for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant reported outcomes of 513 patients (median age 53 years) of whom 249 received myeloablative conditioning and 228 received reduced intensity conditioning. The 4-year non-relapse mortality was 41% and relapse rate 32%, accounting for a 4-year relapse-free survival rate of 27% and an overall survival rate of 33%. In this study the only factor prognostic for favorable outcomes was the achievement of a complete remission prior to HSCT. Data with regard to the use of DNMT inhibitors prior to HSCT in CMML are largely retrospective and somewhat controversial, given their lack of disease-modifying efficacy and propensity to worsen existing cytopenias. In general, I try to avoid DNMT inhibition prior to HSCT, unless it is needed to cytoreduce a patient prior to conditioning therapy. A recent Mayo Clinic study confirmed the survival benefit offered by allogeneic HSCT in higher-risk CMML patients, with 5-year overall survival rates of 51% for patients with chronic phase CMML and 19% for those with blast transformed CMML. Soberingly the graft- versus -host disease relapse-free survival in the chronic phase cohort was only 7 months. With a greater availability of donor sources, alternative donor transplant strategies and an improving arsenal for management of graft- versus -host disease, we hope that allogeneic HSCT becomes a viable option for a greater number of patients. DNMT inhibitors. DNMT inhibitors such as 5-azacitidine, decitabine and the oral combination of decitabine with cedazuridine are the only drugs approved for the management of CMML by the U.S Food and Drug Administration. In Europe, 5-azacitidine remains the only drug approved for the management of CMML (> 10% blasts). The approval of these agents was largely based on MDS predominant trials that included a small number of CMML patients, all of whom had a white blood cell count < 12×10⁹ /L (dCMML). The overall response rates to DNMT inhibitors are approximately 40–50%, with true complete remission rates of < 20%. In a seminal study, elaborate sequencing data demonstrated that DNMT inhibitors induce responses in CMML patients by epigenetically restoring normal hematopoiesis, without impacting mutational allele burdens, with disease progression to AML remaining inevitable. The struggle with using DNMT inhibitors in CMML is the lack of predictors or biomarkers of response. In a large multi-institutional study, we identified the presence of TET2 mutations in the absence of ASXL1 mutations being the best markers of response to DNMT inhibitors (Figure 5), similarly to the situation in MDS. In a recent prospective randomized trial assessing the efficacy of decitabine versus hydroxyurea in higher-risk pCMML patients (n = 170), there was no difference in overall survival or event-free survival between the hydroxyurea and decitabine arms (NCT02214407; Itzykson et al. ASH 2020). Adverse effects of DNMT inhibitors include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and myelosuppression. I proactively educate my patients about these adverse effects and optimize supportive care for the preemptive management of the same.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only curative approach for CMML. However, the long‐term outcome is worse compared to myelodysplastic syndromes, primarily due to a higher relapse rate. Nevertheless, it is justified to perform allogeneic stem cell transplantation in selected patients. Comprehensive recommendations have been put together by an international expert group summing up what is known in the field. A careful 'holistic' assessment of patient fitness and prognosis is mandatory to select those patients who can tolerate the transplantation and to meet the challenges in the post‐transplantation period. Age and comorbidities reflected by different scores as well as the wish of the patient must be taken into account. Regarding disease biology, high‐risk disease according to CPSSmol should prompt transplantation planning without delay. Early transplantation should also be considered if a CPSSmol 'intermediate 2' risk is accompanied by additional risk factors such as high medullary and/or peripheral blast count, symptomatic haematopoietic insufficiency leading to transfusion need, constitutional symptoms, presence of high‐risk somatic mutations that are not included in the CPSSmol, a considerable number of somatic mutations and relapse after or refractoriness to prior therapy. CPSSmol 'intermediate 1' and 'low‐risk' disease should entail a regular reassessment of disease biology in order to detect progression as early as possible, potentially considering transplantation during the course of the disease. It is debatable if pretransplantation debulking using induction chemotherapy or HMA can improve the outcome. Debulking may be necessary if the malignant cells are highly proliferative, and in patients for whom a donor is not easily available. If a timely transplantation with a suitable donor is possible, pretransplant treatment is not recommended, in order to avoid selection of therapy‐resistant CMML clones. The type of donor (matched related, matched unrelated, haploidentical donor or unrelated cord blood) bears no detectable impact on treatment success, neither is the stem cell source. The choice of conditioning intensity should be based on individual circumstances, taking into account disease biology, patient fitness and donor availability. Predictive factors on OS and leukaemia‐free survival after allogeneic stem cell transplantation have been investigated in a multicentre study by Zhou et al. The authors discovered high marrow blast count (> 10%), higher age (> 60 years), low haemoglobin (< 10 g/dL) and non‐ TET2 mutations as being independently associated with poor outcome. These results are not surprising as they represent CMML2, haematopoietic insufficiency, poor genetics and older age as universal high‐risk parameters in the context of myeloid malignancies. This means that exactly those parameters that identify a patient to be at high risk are the same that identify the patient to have a worse chance of cure.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in the light of the WHO proposals [^36ab51d7]. Haematologica (2007). Low credibility.

The WHO classification moved CMML to myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorders, and defined CMML I and CMML II according to medullary and peripheral blast count. To confirm these proposals, we analyzed 266 patients with CMML I and 73 patients with CMML II. Median survival time was 20 months for CMML I, and 15 months for CMML II (p < 0.005). The cumulative risk of AML evolution differed between patient groups (p = 0,001). No conclusive differences in clinical, morphologic, hematologic or cytogenetic parameters were found. These data support the WHO proposals for the classifi-cation of CMML.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia: a concise clinical and pathophysiological review [^a11f3115]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is a clonal haematopoietic stem cell disorder with myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative overlap features, and an inherent tendency to transform to acute myeloid leukaemia. Approximately 30% of patients present with clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, while almost 90% have molecular aberrations involving epigenetic regulation, the spliceosome component machinery, tumour suppressor genes and transcription factors/regulators. Numerous prognostic models exist for CMML, with more recent models incorporating prognostic mutations, such as those involving ASXL1. Other variables that seem to consistently affect outcomes include the degree of leucocytosis/monocytosis, anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Allogeneic stem cell transplant remains the only curative option for CMML, while hypomethylating agents can be used for transplant-ineligible patients or those without suitable stem cell sources. Targeting biological pathways activated in CMML offers potential hope for more effective and less toxic therapies.

PROGNOSIS

Prognostic assessment should go beyond the prognostic information provided by disease classifications. Table 5 lists prognostic parameters for CMML (Table 5). Neither the International Prognostic Scoring System‐revised (IPSS‐R)nor the International Prognostic Scoring System‐molecular (IPSS‐M)are well suited to identify high‐ and low‐risk CMML patients. This is because most of the parameters used in these scores are either not applicable in CMML or have a different prognostic influence in CMML versus MDS. About 80% of CMML patients present with a normal karyotype, and the majority have less than 10% blasts, a haemoglobin of more than 10 g/dL, a normal neutrophil count and platelets above 50 000/μL. Accordingly, the IPSS‐R is not particularly suitable as a prognostic tool. Regarding karyotypes, trisomy 8 is associated with a high risk in CMML but not in MDS. In summary, there was a need for CMML‐specific prognostic instruments.

TABLE 5
Prognostic parameters in CMML.

and

Nowadays, the CMML‐specific prognostic scoring system molecular (CPSSmol)or at least the CPSSshould be applied whenever possible. The CPSS differentiates between dysplastic CMML and proliferative CMML based on WBC < vs ≥ 12 000/μL, separates CMML I and II by medullary blasts of < / ≥ 10%, and further considers the presence of haematopoietic insufficiency (need of regular red blood cell transfusions) and chromosomal aberrations according to three cytogenetic risk categories. The score delineates four risk categories with significantly different OS and risk of progression to AML. It was developed and validated by a Spanish–Italian–German CMML working group. A further step forward was the development and validation of the CPSSmolfrom the same group (Table 6). The CPSSmol in turn was a precursor to the IPSS‐M. The CPSSmol added four somatic mutations (RUNX1, NRAS, ASXL1 and SETBP1) to the model, replaced the 10% cut‐off for medullary blasts with a 5% cut‐off and also defined four risk groups. The main strength of this score is the identification of a greater proportion of high‐risk patients by consideration of somatic mutations. Up to now, the prognostic influence of the variant allele frequency of somatic mutations has not been examined systematically in CMML. This task should be tackled soon.

### How I diagnose and treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^97f0e79b]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myeloid neoplasm characterized by sustained peripheral blood monocytosis (absolute monocyte count ≥ 1×10⁹ /L, with monocytes accounting for ≥ 10% of the white blood cells), predominantly arising in the context of age-related clonal hematopoiesis, with overlapping features of myelodys-plastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). The exact incidence and prevalence rates for CMML are hard to define, with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry data demonstrating an incidence of 0.4 cases per 100,000, with most studies showing a clear male preponderance. The median age of presentation for CMML patients is between 70–75 years, with "young CMML" patients being operationally defined as those who present at < 65 years of age.

At the genome level CMML is relatively homogeneous, demonstrating approximately 10–12 somatic variants per kilobase of coding region, with most pathogenic variants involving TET2 (60%), ASXL1 (40%), SRSF2 (50%) and RAS pathway (30%) genes. However, clinically the disease is very heterogenous in presentation and outcomes, making diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic decision-making challenging. Broadly, CMML can be classified into dys-plastic CMML (dCMML), presenting with cytopenias and clinical signs and symptoms related to the same (fatigue, bruising and transfusion dependence) and proliferative CMML (pCMML), presenting with significant myeloproliferation, extramedullary hematopoiesis and associated constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats, anorexia, pruritus, bone pain and cachexia). From a classification perspective, for several years CMML was classified as a subtype of MDS, with the World Health Organization (WHO) rightfully and formally classifying CMML as an MDS/MPN overlap neoplasm, from 2002 onwards. In 2015, the International Working Group for MDS/MPN overlap neoplasms proposed CMML-specific disease response criteria, providing support for the recognition of CMML as a specific disease entity and providing impetus for CMML-specific clinical trials. These changes have clearly incentivized the development of disease-specific diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies for patients with CMML. In this review, I discuss my approach to the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of patients with CMML.

### Proposed diagnostic criteria for classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), CMML variants and pre-CMML conditions [^295dfff2]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myeloid stem cell disease characterized by an abnormal production and accumulation of monocytic cells, often in association with other signs of myeloproliferation, substantial dysplasia in one or more hematopoietic cell lineages, and an increased risk of transformation into secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). - As per definition, the Philadelphia chromosome and its related BCR-ABL1 fusion gene are absent in CMML. Other disease-related drivers, such as the JAK2 mutation V617F or the KIT mutation D816V, may be detected and may indicate a special variant of CMML, such as CMML associated with systemic mastocytosis (SM-CMML). - However, most somatic mutations identified in CMML patients, such as mutations in SRSF2, TET2, or RAS, are not disease-specific, but are also detected in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), or AML. -

CMML with JAK2 V617F

In these patients the situation is different. First, JAK2 V617F itself may be considered as a criterion of myeloproliferation in MDS/MPN, e.g. in cases with MDS/MPN with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis. In the context of CMML, the JAK2 mutation is also typically associated with other signs of myeloproliferation (including BM fibrosis) and with the 'myeloproliferative variant' of CMML. Therefore, our faculty concludes that JAK2 V617F should also count as a molecular co-criterion of MDS/MPN and thus for CMML. Second, the presence of a JAK2 -mutated MPN does not exclude the presence of a concomitant CMML if diagnostic criteria for both neoplasms are fulfilled. If this is not the case because the size of the MPN-like clone carrying JAK2 V617F is too small and/or other MPN features are clearly missing, the final diagnosis will be CMML with JAK2 V617F. On the other hand, in patients in whom the JAK2 allelic burden is high and clinical and laboratory features argue for an overt MPN rather than CMML (e.g. polycythemia and/or BM fibrosis without dysplasia and without molecular or flow cytometry-based signs of CMML) the final diagnosis will be JAK2 V617F + MPN with monocytosis. In a third group of patients, diagnostic criteria for both a distinct MPN and CMML are fulfilled and the mutation status confirms the presence of an overt JAK2 -mutated MPN (usually with high allelic burden). These patients are suffering from both MPN and CMML or from a gray zone disease displaying hybrid features between MPN and CMML. Our faculty concludes that it is therefore important to measure the JAK2 V617F allele burden in all patients with CMML. Other drivers, such as BCR-ABL1, are rarely found in patients with CMML. However, although in classical CMML, the presence of BCR-ABL1 must be excluded, it may be detected in rare patients, suggesting the existence of a special variant of CMML (defined by a co-existing chronic myeloid leukemia). In some of these cases, the chronic myeloid leukemia clone may be small. In other patients, however, the chronic myeloid leukemia may even mask the CMML at the initial diagnosis.

### Contemporary risk stratification and treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^1216b7cd]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by absolute monocytosis, one or more lineage dysplasia, and proliferative features including myeloid hyperplasia, splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms. Because of vast clinical heterogeneity in presentation and course, risk stratification is used for a risk-adapted treatment strategy. Numerous prognostic scoring systems exist, some of which incorporate mutational information. Treatment ranges from observation to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Therapies include hydroxyurea for cytoreduction, hypomethylating agents, and the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib to address splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms. Recently, oral decitabine with cedazuridine was approved and represents a convenient treatment option for CMML patients. Although novel therapeutics are in development for CMML, further work is needed to elucidate possible targets unique to the CMML clone. In this review, we will detail the pathophysiology, risk stratification, available treatment modalities, and novel therapies for CMML, and propose a modern treatment algorithm. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clinically heterogenous disease, which poses significant management challenges. The diagnosis of CMML requires bone marrow biopsy and aspirate with thorough evaluation. Risk stratification and symptom assessment are essential to designing an effective treatment plan, which may include hypomethylating agents (HMAs) in intermediate or high-risk patients. The recently approved oral decitabine/cedazuridine provides a convenient alternative to parenteral HMAs. Ruxolitinib may be effective in ameliorating proliferative symptoms and splenomegaly. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only treatment with curative potential; however, novel therapies are in clinical development which may significantly alter the therapeutic landscape of CMML.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is a morphological hybrid between myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative neoplasms and is characterized by clonal monocytosis. Myeloid neoplasm-associated somatic mutations are present in > 90% of patients with CMML but are not diagnostically specific but a subset are prognostically relevant. Current drug therapy in CMML is mostly palliative and not disease-modifying. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative treatment modality in CMML and its timing is determined by formal prognostic models including the recently developed BLAST and BLAST-molecular risk models.

### Comparing malignant monocytosis across the updated WHO and ICC classifications of 2022 [^e70f3e70]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past half century, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) was defined as a myelodysplastic (MD)/myeloproliferative (MP) neoplasm with the hallmark characteristic of peripheral blood (PB) monocytosis ≥ 1 × 10⁹ /L, in conjunction with MD and/or MP bone marrow (BM) features.

Because of constant technological advancement and a rapidly evolving knowledge base, preexisting conceptions are being challenged, making the continuous adaptation of disease definitions necessary. In this regard, the fifth edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification and the International Consensus Classification (ICC) introduced major common changes to the diagnostic criteria of CMML. First, in the presence of additional CMML features, the cutoff for absolute monocytosis was lowered to ≥ 0.5 × 10⁹ /L absolute monocyte count in both classifications, thereby incorporating cases formerly referred to as oligomonocytic (OM)-CMML into the diagnosis of CMML. Second, the CMML-0 subgroup was eliminated because of its limited clinical relevance. Finally, in the current classifications, the diagnostic focus is shifted onto recurrent molecular aberrations, thus replacing solely clinical criteria such as persisting monocytosis for ≥ 3 months in the absence of alternative diagnoses.

Table 6.
Commonly mutated genes detectable in patients with classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.

Our faculty recommends that next-generation sequencing studies should be regarded as a standard approach in all patients with suspected or known CMML as well as in patients with idiopathic monocytosis of unknown significance and in those with persistent reactive monocytosis (in order to exclude an additional clonal component). When a CMML-related mutation is found in an individual with idiopathic monocytosis of unknown significance or reactive monocytosis, the diagnosis may change to clonal monocytosis of unknown significance or oligomonocytic CMML, depending on additional findings.

Our faculty also recommends that the next-generation sequencing assay should have sufficient sensitivity (to detect 2–5% clonal cells) and should cover all relevant lesions shown in Table 6. In the context of CHIP/ARCH, a cutoff variant allele frequency of 2% is considered diagnostic, whereas in the context of CMML, we propose 10% as the variant allele frequency diagnostic cut off and thus marker to count as a co-criterion of CMML when, for example, no diagnostic morphological dysplasia can be documented (Tables 1 and 3), similar to the definition in MDS. Determining the variant allele frequency is also useful for documenting the clinical impact of certain driver lesions in special CMML variants (e.g. with JAK2 V617F or KIT D816V) and clone expansion during follow-up. Therefore, our faculty recommends that molecular studies in CMML should report variant allele frequencies with sufficient precision and sufficient sensitivity – in the same way as in MDS. Finally, our faculty recommends that molecular markers should increasingly be used to optimize prognostic scoring systems in CMML. -

CMML with rearranged PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1 or PCM1-JAK2

In these patients, persistent substantial monocytosis (≥ 1.0×10⁹ /L) is detected and all other consensus criteria for classical CMML (see previous paragraphs) are also met, except the following specific exclusion criteria: CMML to be excluded in the presence of a well-characterized diagnosis of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm with rearranged PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1 or PCM1-JAK2 (Table 2). Except for neglecting the above-mentioned criteria, our proposal is otherwise fully in agreement with all of the other tenets postulated by the WHO classification. In relation to neoplasms with rearranged PDGFRA/B, FGFR1 or PCM1-JAK2, the WHO's definition of 'myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms' is too generic and there is a clinical need to know whether the underlying myeloid neoplasm is an aggressive disease, like AML, or a chronic neoplasm such as CMML or chronic eosinophilic leukemia. Our faculty is of the opinion that (unlike in previous times) the presence of one criterion-confirmed myeloid neoplasm should not a priori exclude the presence of another (second concomitant) myeloid or lymphoid neoplasm. Hence, when CMML is encountered in the context of another molecularly defined myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm (as a final diagnosis), it should be delineated as a specific subtype of the myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm with eosinophilia along with the specific associated gene rearrangement (PDGFRA/B or FGFR1 or PCM1-JAK2).

According to WHO criteria, systemic mastocytosis (SM) can be divided into: (i) indolent SM (ISM), which is assocaiated with a normal life expectancy; (ii) smoldering SM (SSM), in which signs of BM dysplasia, myeloproliferation and/or splenomegaly are found but survival and prognosis are still favorable; and (iii) advanced SM, defined by a poor prognosis. - Advanced SM is further divided into aggressive SM (ASM), SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN) and mast cell leukemia (MCL). - The most frequent AHN detected in patients with SM-AHN is CMML. -, In these patients the SM component of the diseases may present as ISM, ASM or, rarely, as MCL. Our faculty concludes that diagnostic WHO criteria for SM and diagnostic criteria for classical CMML (except exclusion of SM) must be fulfilled to diagnose SM-CMML.

Disease Overview

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder that is classified as a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm by the 2008 World Health Organization classification of hematopoietic tumors. It is characterized by absolute monocytosis (> 1×10⁹/L) in the peripheral blood that persists for at least 3 months.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of CMML rests on a combination of morphologic, histopathologic and chromosomal abnormalities in the bone marrow. It is important to exclude other myeloproliferative neoplasms and infectious/autoimmune conditions that can cause monocytosis.

Risk Stratification

Several CMML-specific prognostic models incorporating novel mutations have been recently reported. The Mayo prognostic model classified CMML patients into three risk groups based on: increased absolute monocyte count, presence of circulating blasts, hemoglobin < 10 gm/dL and platelets < 100×10⁹/L. The median survival was 32 months, 18.5 months and 10 months in the low, intermediate, and high-risk groups, respectively. The Groupe Francophone des (GFM) score segregated CMML patients into three risk groups based on: age > 65 years, WBC > 15×10⁹/L, anemia, platelets < 100×10⁹/L, and ASXL1 mutation status. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, survival ranged from not reached in the low-risk group to 14.4 months in the high-risk group.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

The Food and Drug Administration has approved azacitidine and decitabine for the treatment of patients with CMML. An allogeneic stem cell transplant can potentially offer a curative option to a subset of CMML patients. It is hoped that with the discovery of several novel mutations, targeted therapies will become available in the near future.

### Mutational status affects myelodysplastic syndrome evolution to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^7c92790c]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent evolution of myeloid disease classification integrates so-called oligomonocytic CMML, which exhibits characteristic CMML featuresby decreasing the cut-off value that defines an absolute monocytosis to 0.5×10⁹ /L. The present study demonstrates that flow cytometry analysis of monocyte subsets in the PB, typically showing an accumulation of cMO ≥ 94% of total monocytes, together with typical combinations of somatic gene mutations, detects an additional number of CMML whose initial features are those of an MDS. Their genetic and epigenetic features already point to a CMML, while the characteristic increase in absolute and relative monocyte count will be observed several months or years later. While early identification of an overlap myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) may currently have a limited therapeutic impact, these entities deserve to be identified as they may indicate higher risk evolution with decreased survival. In the present study, the MDS to CMML evolution was evaluated in patients that didn't receive hypomethylating agents or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the future, revisiting the boundaries between MDS and CMML may guide therapeutic approaches targeting the proliferative and highly inflammatory component of CMML to slow down its clinical progression.

### Comparing malignant monocytosis across the updated WHO and ICC classifications of 2022 [^b76187dc]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

However, the updated classification systems rely on partly different diagnostic criteria, thus introducing 2 discordant definitions of CMML. Specifically, the main differences lie in the requirements for PB cytopenia, BM, and flow cytometric features, as well as variant allele frequency (VAF) cutoff values to define clonality through mutations (Figure 1 A).

Figure 1.

(B) Diagnosis update of 1279 established CMML cases from the WHO17 to the ICC22 and the WHO22 classifications. "No CMML" stands for alternative diagnosis due to CMML criteria not being fulfilled. Notably, when evaluating all cases with absolute monocyte count (AMC) ≥ 1 × 10 9 /L and ≥ 10% PB monocytes irrespective of their original diagnosis, only 69 cases (< 0.01%) were not diagnosed as CMML at the time of workup. Of these 69 cases, 62 either had a concurrent diagnosis of lymphoma or non-CMML leukemia (n = 12) or received a CMML diagnosis during follow-up (n = 50). (C) Diagnosis update of 1054 monocytosis cases (AMC, 0.5 × 10⁹ /L-1 × 10⁹ /L and > 10%; no prior CMML diagnosis) from the WHO17 to the ICC22, and the WHO22 classifications. AL, acute leukemia; CCUS, clonal cytopenia of unknown significance; CHIP, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential; LYM, lymphoma; MPN, myeloproliferative neoplasia; NM, nonmalignant.

Currently, clinical implications resulting from the updated, albeit discordant CMML definitions remain widely unexplored. In this work, through the use case of 2 well-characterized routine diagnostic data sets from the Munich Leukemia Laboratory (MLL), we examined the specific changes and differences introduced by the fifth edition of the WHO (WHO22) and ICC 2022 (ICC22) classifications for CMML and their resulting real-world implications for patients, clinicians, and researchers.

### Proposed diagnostic criteria for classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), CMML variants and pre-CMML conditions [^d17a35e4]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Oligomonocytic CMML

Over the past few years, more and more cases of cytopenic patients exhibiting relative monocytosis (≥ 10%) and moderately increased absolute blood monocytes not reaching the required threshold to diagnose classical CMML (1.0x10 9 /L) have been described. These cases have recently been referred to as oligomonocytic CMML. According to the WHO classification most of these patients would be classified as having MDS (with monocytosis) or perhaps MPN/MDS-unclassifiable. However, most of these patients exhibit typical features of CMML, including a typical morphology of PB and BM cells, splenomegaly, and CMML-related molecular features (e.g. mutations in TET2 and SRSF2). - Some of these patients have prominent BM monocytosis without diagnostic PB monocytosis at diagnosis.

Whereas several of these cases remain stable without progression, the majority will develop 'overt' CMML or, eventually, secondary AML during follow-up. Therefore, oligomonocytic CMML may also be regarded as a potential pre-phase of classical CMML. Our faculty is of the opinion that the term oligomonocytic CMML should be used in clinical practice. Diagnostic pre-requisite criteria for oligomonocytic CMML are: (i) persistent (lasting at least 3 months) absolute peripheral monocytosis of 0.5–0.9×10⁹ /L and relative blood monocytosis (≥ 10% of blood leukocytes); (ii) exclusion of BCR-ABL1 + leukemia, classical MPN and all other myeloid neoplasms that can explain monocytosis; and (iii) a blast cell count of 0–19% in PB and/or BM smears and exclusion of all histopathological, morphological, phenotypic, molecular and cytogenetic signs that count as proof of AML. Diagnostic dysplasia in one or more of the three major BM lineages (≥ 10%) must also be documented. If dysplasia is lacking or 'sub-diagnostic' (< 10%), the presence of cytogenetic or molecular lesions (mutations) typically found in CMML and/or the presence of CMML-related flow cytometry abnormalities, may also lead to the conclusion that the patient has oligomonocytic CMML provided that the other diagnostic criteria described above are fulfilled and all other myeloid neoplasms have been excluded. The proposed criteria for oligomonocytic CMML are listed in Table 3. Patients with oligomonocytic CMML should be managed and followed clinically in the same way as patients with classical CMML.

How I approach chronic myelomonocytic leukemia variants and molecularly defined entities with monocytosis

The diagnosis and management of CMML variants and molecularly defined entities presenting with monocytosis, mimicking CMML, require special attention. These variants can broadly be divided into three categories: (i) oligomonocytic CMML; (ii) CMML associated with a concomitant myeloid neoplasm; and (iii) molecularly defined entities with monocytosis.

Oligomonocytic CMML. This category encompasses patients who present with sustained relative monocytosis (≥ 10% of white blood cells) and absolute monocytosis not meeting current diagnostic criteria for CMML (absolute monocyte count 0.5- < 1.0×10⁹ /L). Based on the 2016 WHO classification, these patients would be classified as having either MDS or MDS/MPN-Unclassifiable. Except for an absolute monocyte count of ≥ 1x10 9 /L, if these patients meet other CMML diagnostic criteria, along with a M01 fraction > 94% on monocyte repartitioning flow cytometry, and a molecular signature consistent with CMML (TET2, SRSF2, and ASXL1), I consider them as having oligomonocytic CMML and follow and manage them as such. Over time, several of these patients will have clonal evolution to either CMML or secondary AML.

### Proposed diagnostic criteria for classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), CMML variants and pre-CMML conditions [^6de8a6de]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

There are also patients in whom a certain driver of another BM neoplasm is present, such as a mutated JAK2, PDGFRA/B, or FGFR1, but only the diagnostic criteria for CMML (not those of the other BM neoplasm) are fulfilled. Our faculty concludes that these cases should also be regarded and diagnosed as special variants of CMML. This strategy is in line with the current WHO classification. In fact, whereas the primary molecular diagnosis is often based on a mutated form of JAK2, PDGFRA/B or other classical driver, the underlying or additional diagnosis may well be CMML.

Grading of CMML

The grading system of CMML proposed by the WHO is regarded as standard in clinical hematology. Our faculty recommends the use of this grading system as the initial prognostic tool in classical CMML. In fact, classical CMML should be split into CMML-0, CMML-1 and CMML-2 based on the blast cell count (Online Supplementary Table S2). - In addition, CMML can be divided into a dysplastic variant and a proliferative variant based on leukocyte counts (threshold: 13×10⁹ /L) (Online Supplementary Table S2). The resulting grading system defines six distinct CMML variants with variable clinical outcome. However, grading may sometimes be challenging. For example, blast cell counts obtained from BM smears may differ from those obtained in the PB so that the grade is questionable. Our faculty recommends that in patients in whom results from BM and PB smears would not fit into one distinct grade of CMML (e.g. BM blasts 4% and PB blasts 6%) grading should be based on the higher blast cell percentage (Online Supplementary Table S2). It is worth noting that initial prognostication by grading does not include all essential prognostic parameters. We therefore recommend that in each case, deeper (full) prognostication should follow using multiparametric scoring systems (see later). It should be noted, however, that grading of CMML has only been validated in the classical form of CMML, not in special CMML variants. Therefore, although grading is also recommended for special CMML entities, it is not regarded standard and the result must be interpreted with caution in these patients.

### Outcomes and molecular profile of oligomonocytic CMML support its consideration as the first stage in the CMML continuum [^4f44e0be]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oligomonocytic chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (OM-CMML) is defined as those myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) or unclassifiable myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms with relative monocytosis (≥ 10% monocytes) and a monocyte count of 0.5 × 10 9 /L to < 1 × 10 9 /L. Recent data support the consideration of OM-CMML as a specific subtype of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), because the clinical, morphological, cytogenetic, molecular, and immunophenotypic profiles are similar to those of patients with overt CMML. Given the overall good prognosis described in OM-CMML, it could be inferred that this group of patients represents a precondition in the early spectrum of dysplastic CMML (D-CMML). Although the disease progresses to overt CMML in a high percentage of patients, globally reinforcing the precondition concept, some patients die of evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or of bone marrow (BM) failure before progression to overt CMML. This fact is different from that observed in other well-accepted preconditions (eg, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential). Otherwise, it is important to assess whether the specific CMML prognostic factorsapplied to OM-CMML provide better predictive accuracy of outcome than classic MDS prognostic variables, given that most patients are currently categorized as having MDS according to the World health Organization (WHO) 2017 classification. Although most of the prognostic factors described in MDS are also consistent prognostic determinants in CMML, there are some that are specific to the latter (eg, trisomy 8 as a high-risk cytogenetic abnormality, and blast cell count defined as the sum of blasts and promonocytes). Of note, leukocytosis is a well-recognized independent prognostic factor in CMML, but it is not applicable to OM-CMML prognostic stratification, because the presence of ≥ 10 × 10 9 /L leukocytes implies having at least 1 × 10 9 /L monocytes and therefore meeting CMML diagnostic criteria. As previously reported, mutations in genes of the RAS pathway (eg, CBL, NRAS, and KRAS) are almost absent in OM-CMML, because they have been associated with proliferative features. Moreover, if present, these genes are more likely to constitute small clones in patients with OM-CMML. In this sense, CBL is the only gene mutated in a significantly lower proportion of OM-CMML vs CMML cases. Likewise, although there are no differences in the proportion of patients with OM-CMML carrying an ASXL1 mutation, when compared with those with D-CMML, this mutation is significantly overrepresented in proliferative CMML (P-CMML). Given the poor prognosis associated with RAS-pathway mutations, ASXL1 mutations, and leukocytosis, OM-CMML is expected to present a better outcome than the next steps in the proliferative continuum of CMML (ie, D-CMML and P-CMML). Regardless, OM-CMML may present other well-known adverse prognostic variables, such as an excess of blasts, because its presence does not invalidate the diagnosis. In light of all of these facts, the purpose of this study was to provide survival data from a well-annotated series of 42 patients with OM-CMML, to compare with the survival data from 162 patients with CMML: 120 with D-CMML and 42 with P-CMML.

### Prognostic and therapeutic implications of TP53 expression in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^8ba995c5]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

An intriguing question remains: why are TP53 mutations so infrequent in CMML? Speculatively, TP53 mutations might induce unknown synthetic lethalities in CMML cells; or they may promote alternative lineage specification pathways, re-directing the expressed phenotype and resultant disease classification. Supporting the latter, most studied TP53 MUT hematopoietic models report enhanced stemness or propagation of megakaryocytic/erythroid lineage, rather than the myelomonocytic expansions that define the CMML phenotype. For example, TP53 knockout synergized with NRAS G12D to specifically transform MEPs, but not other HSPC types, in an AML murine model. Accordingly, we observed significant under-representation of myelomonocytic/blastic M4/M5 FAB subtypes associated with TP53 mutations amongst 1511 AML cases at NTUH, and re-analyzing 577 cases from TCGA and BeatAML datasets (odds ratio 0.48 and 0.49, respectively; Table S20). Thus, acquisition of TP53 mutations onto the canonical CMML mutation background might alter the resultant phenotype away from clinicopathological features compatible with CMML diagnostic criteria.

When present, TP53 mutations confer adverse prognosis in CMML as in other cancers. However, our study identifies prognostic implications of mutation-independent TP53 dysregulation in CMML relevant to a much larger minority of patients (~15%). Prior TCGA analysis revealed substantial variation in TP53 expression in both TP53 MUT and TP53 WT tumors, with TP53 WT expression lower than in missense but higher than in truncating mutations. Furthermore, the relationship between expression and prognosis differed across cancers. Our data suggest that in CMML TP53 expression level plays a role in dictating disease aggressiveness and therapeutic response, of relatively greater importance than TP53 mutation status in this disease.

In conclusion, ours is the first study to link low TP53 expression with distinct features and outcomes in CMML. We confirm the rarity of TP53 mutations, whilst identifying a novel subgroup with aberrantly low TP53 expression, associated with higher HMA resistance, distinctive biology, and inferior prognosis. We highlight potential for combining HMA and MDMX/MDM2 inhibition to restore HMA sensitivity, as an attractive candidate therapeutic approach for clinical study to address this unmet clinical need.

### Recent advances in diagnosis, molecular pathology and therapy of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia [^7f59549c]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical, morphological, and genetic heterogeneity of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), has made it difficult to clearly assign this entity to a distinct haematological category. In 2001, the World Health Organization transferred CMML to a new category of mixed myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorders, which was maintained in the last revision in 2008. Considering the rare occurrence of CMML, most pharmacotherapeutic and transplant studies combined CMML with myelodysplastic syndrome cases, but some clinical trials specifically investigated the use of demethylating agents in CMML and demonstrated stabilization of the haematological situation or even complete remission in subsets of patients. Information on the significance of other drugs is very limited. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative option for patients with CMML. Molecular studies revealed various novel genetic alterations in CMML - notably of the JAK2, TET2, CBL, IDH, or RUNX1 and RAS genes. This review summarizes the current status of pharmacotherapy and transplantation in CMML and outlines recent results of molecular research for diagnosis of this heterogeneous entity.

Mutation profiles in CMML: current standards and limitations

Somatic mutations are detectable in the vast majority of patients with CMML.- The clonal architecture, clone sizes and clonal evolution patterns vary from patient to patient. - In some cases, initially small clones expand over time. It is, therefore, standard to apply next-generation sequencing assays with sufficient sensitivity to identify bona fide somatic mutations associated with CMML. The most frequently detected somatic mutations in CMML are mutations in TET2 (60%), SRSF2 (50%), and ASXL1 (40%) (Table 6).- The presence of a SRSF2 mutation, particularly in combination with mutated TET2, correlates strongly with a CMML phenotype. It is also worth noting that two of these mutations (TET2, ASXL1) are also known as CHIP/ARCH-related mutations. However, only mutated ASXL1 has been associated with a poor prognosis in CMML. An overview of somatic mutations recurrently detected in CMML is provided in Table 6. Somatic mutations with independent prognostic impact include several RAS-pathway mutations as well as mutations in ASXL1, RUNX1 and SETBP1 (Table 6).- RAS-pathway mutations trigger cell signaling and proliferation and have been associated with cytokine-independent growth of CMML progenitor cells, the proliferative variant of CMML, AML transformation and poor survival.,- Other driver mutations involved in cell signaling, such as JAK2 V617F or KIT D816V, are also major triggers of cellular differentiation (Online Supplementary Table S7). These drivers alone cannot induce transformation, but they may act together with other (e.g. 'RAS pathway') mutations to cause disease progression. Whereas JAK2 V617F is a strong indicator of MPN-like differentiation, the presence of KIT D816V is almost always associated with concomitant mast cell differentiation and mastocytosis (SM-CMML). -,-, The other mutations found in CMML act as modulators of epigenetic events and transcription (e.g. ASXL1) or DNA methylation (e.g. TET2), as regulators of the spliceosome machinery (e.g. SRSF2), or as modulators of the DNA damage response, such as TP53 (Table 6). During progression of CMML to secondary AML and especially during therapy, the mutational landscape(s) and clonal architecture(s) may change. - For example initially small clones may expand and may be selected because of resistance-mediating molecular features. It is worth noting that several mutated gene products also serve as potential targets of therapy (Table 6).

### Comparing malignant monocytosis across the updated WHO and ICC classifications of 2022 [^73bfe401]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The recently published WHO22 and ICC22 classifications introduced major changes to the diagnostic criteria for CMML, including the reduction of the PB monocyte threshold to include cases previously defined as OM-CMML. In this study, we systematically assessed their impact on CMML diagnosis. After updating the diagnosis of 1279 established CMML cases to both new classifications, approximately half of the cohort was reclassified. Importantly, due to diverging diagnostic criteria, 21 cases would have been classified as AML according to the WHO22 while still being considered CMML cases according to the ICC22 classification, leaving an open question regarding the different therapeutical implications. It should be noted, however, that in the current WHO-HAEM5 BetaBlueBook version, AML-defining genetics apply "in the presence of increased blasts", implying a minimum BM blast cutoff of ≥ 5% (or ≥ 2% in the PB), which was not mentioned in the publication of the fifth edition of the WHO criteria. This discrepancy resulted from an absence of a minimum blast threshold in the presence of AML-defining molecular aberrations in the preliminary WHO22 classification, which, however, may be subject to change in the final classification. Furthermore, a significant proportion of prior OM cases was now classified as CMML, mainly affecting previous MDS cases according to WHO17 and consistent with previous reports of OM-CMML deriving largely from a MD background.

### Clinical management of CMML-state of the art [^4bcfbc40]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

CLASSIFICATION

For good reason, both the WHO 2022 and the ICC maintain the subclassification of CMML into a dysplastic variant (CMML dysplastic) and a proliferative variant (CMML proliferative). Patients presenting with the proliferative variant have fewer cytopenias, higher white blood cell counts (WBCs), higher absolute monocyte counts, greater organomegaly, more pronounced lymphadenopathy, more extramedullary manifestations including skin and kidney, more frequent autoimmune phenomena including thrombocytopenia, neuropathies and, above all, more severe constitutional symptoms such as night sweats, subfebrile temperatures and signs of catabolism, findings that are typical of proliferative neoplasia such as primary myelofibrosis. Patients with the dysplastic type of CMML generally suffer from haematopoietic insufficiency and are thus more reminiscent of a myelodysplastic syndrome. Table 2 presents the WHO 2022 classification criteria for the diagnosis of CMML (Table 2). The diagnostic parameters listed in Tables 3 and 4 are obligatory for establishing a diagnosis of CMML. The diagnosis is based on cytomorphological assessment of peripheral blood as well as cytomorphological (Figures 1 and 2) examination of the bone marrow aspirate and histopathological examination of a bone marrow threphine biopsy using immunhistochemistry. The percentage of blasts, including promonocytes, must be assessed in both blood and marrow cytology. Esterase staining in cytology may allow a better identification of monocytes, particularly it may help to distinguish monocytes from degranulated myelocytes. Signs of dysplasia should be described primarily by cytomorphology. Iron staining is used to detect ring sideroblasts. The assessment of cellularity, fibrosis and mastocytosis requires histopathological review. Although increased monocytic cells in the marrow can be detected in virtually all cases by cytomorphology and histopathology, the percentage of monocytic cells in the marrow is not a CMML‐defining feature.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^22ebe869]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms — chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) classification and prognostic markers are defined as follows: in the ICC, CMML is subdivided into CMML-myelodysplastic with WBC count ≤ 13 × 10⁹/L and CMML-myeloproliferative with WBC count > 13 × 10⁹/L. Two blast-based WHO 2022 groups are CMML-1 for patients with < 10% bone marrow blasts or blasts equivalents and CMML-2 for patients with 10 to < 20% bone marrow blasts or blasts equivalents. In addition to WBC count, the percentage of blasts plus monocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow has demonstrated prognostic significance, and mutations frequently associated with CMML include TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, RUNX1, NRAS, and CBL.

### An international data set for CMML validates prognostic scoring systems and demonstrates a need for novel prognostication strategies [^4fe72511]. Blood Cancer Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Therefore, we attempted to create a novel model using the random survival forest approach. We reasoned that a novel method for variable discovery may uncover uniquely prognostic variables missed by traditional Cox proportional hazard regression. However, our new model generated with this approach had comparable performance when statistically analyzed in the context of existing prognostic tools. Taken together, our data suggest that the prognostic power of clinical variables may have reached an asymptote and that novel prognostication strategies are needed to accurately estimate the OS of patients with CMML. To address this, we explored the prognostic impact of genetic data retrospectively annotated in our database. Although this genetic information was not centrally collected, we were able to demonstrate that frequencies, mutual exclusivities and the expected prognostic relevance of ASXL1 were maintained, supporting the use of this data set for future study. We were also able to identify the independent prognostic significance of CBL mutations in CMML, which had not previously been demonstrated. This is relevant given that our analysis exploring the relative prognostic power of models containing ASXL1 mutations identified no difference in prognostic power compared with other models, perhaps suggesting that combinations of mutations such as CBL and interrogation of RNA expression signatures may yield a more powerful molecular prognostic model. This strategy has been fruitful in other related hematologic malignancies.

It is important to note that this data set was retrospective, included hypomethylating agent-treated cases and did not uniformly capture cases at diagnosis secondary to differing referral patterns. Although the majority of cases had one gene molecularly profiled, 298 annotated cases were used to test the prognostic power of ASXL1 models. A larger molecularly annotated data set is required to validate our findings. However, the current data set reflects a 'real-world' collection of CMML cases that could be reliably used to validate future biomarkers. Efforts are now ongoing to further populate this data set with molecular data and operationalize a Web-based portal by which the CMML community can leverage this resource.

Future developments in the treatment of

Proposals have been put forward on how to design future clinical trials addressing the clinical heterogeneity of CMML patients. Factors to be considered are the disease biology, as reflected by the CPSSmol risk groups, the prolonged periods without treatment indication between diagnosis and development of clinical problems and the marked heterogeneity regarding patients' suitability for intensive treatment. As the myeloproliferative type of CMML is also characterized by hypersensitivity of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to Granulocyte‐macrophage colony‐stimulating factor (GM‐CSF), it has been considered to use this receptor as a therapeutic target. Lenzilumab has been shown to neutralize GM‐CSF and thereby hindering an expansion of monocytes in peripheral blood and marrow. This compound has been tested in combination with hypomethylating agents and could be beneficial for the patients. Ruxolitinib could address this pathway, too.

Another promising compound is IO‐202, an anti‐(LILRB4) Leukocyte immunoglobulin‐like receptor subfamily B member 4 monoclonal antibody, binding to the leucocyte immunoglobulin‐like receptor subfamily B member 4 encoded by the LILRB4 gene at the long arm of chromosome 19q. LILRB4 is expressed on monocytic cells and supports cell infiltration. Neutralizing this effect could be beneficial for patients. A purely oral treatment, namely the combination of oral decitabine and venetoclax has been studied in patients with MDS or CMML and could potentially established as an easy‐to use treatment in outpatient settings. Targeting IDH1, IDH2 and FLT3 in principle could be helpful in CMML, but these molecular characteristics are very unfrequent and studies have not been carried out. Treatment options to be evaluated include farnesyltransferase inhibitors like tipifarnib, compounds addressing the RAS signalling pathway such as onvansertib, HDAC inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, JAK1 and 2 inhibitors and CDA inhibitors. There is a large unmet medical need, especially for patients who cannot benefit from allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

### How I diagnose and treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^03e2c0cd]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative overlap neoplasm characterized by sustained peripheral blood monocytosis and an inherent risk for transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (15–30% over 3–5 years). While CMML is morphologically classified into CMML-0, 1 and 2 based on peripheral blood and bone marrow promonocyte/blast counts, a more clinically relevant classification into dysplastic and proliferative subtypes, based on the presenting white blood cell count, is helpful in prognostication and therapeutics. CMML is a neoplasm associated with aging, occurring on the background of clonal hematopoiesis, with TET2 and SRSF2 mutations being early initiating events. The subsequent acquisitions of ASXL1, RUNX1, SF3B1 and DNMT3A mutations usually give rise to dysplastic CMML, while ASXL1, JAK2V617F and RAS pathway mutations give rise to proliferative CMML. Patients with proliferative CMML have a more aggressive course with higher rates of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. Allogeneic stem cell transplant remains the only potential cure for CMML; however, given the advanced median age at presentation (73 years) and comorbidities, it is an option for only a few affected patients (10%). While DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are approved for the management of CMML, the overall response rates are 40–50%, with true complete remission rates of < 20%. These agents seem to be particularly ineffective in proliferative CMML subtypes with RAS mutations, while the TET2mutant/ASXL1wildtype genotype seems to be the best predictor for responses. These agents epigenetically restore hematopoiesis in responding patients without altering mutational allele burdens and progression remains inevitable. Rationally derived personalized/targeted therapies with disease-modifying capabilities are much needed.

### Myelodysplastic syndrome / myeloproliferative neoplasm overlap syndromes: a practical guide to diagnosis and management [^8327a17c]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) overlap syndromes are a rare group of biologically and clinically connected hematologic malignancies that includes chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), the most common subtype, as well as atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, MDS/MPN with SF3B1 and thrombocytosis, and MDS/MPN, not otherwise specified. Given their rarity and overlapping clinical features, accurate diagnosis and risk stratification presents a significant challenge. Therapeutic approaches are largely borrowed from either MDS or MPN and the only curative option for appropriate patients is allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Recent advances have started to uncover the pathobiologic basis for these diseases, leading to novel clinical trials for MDS/MPN overlap syndromes, in particular CMML. This review is a practical guide for the diagnosis and management of MDS/MPN overlap syndromes and presents novel therapeutics being specifically designed for these diseases to improve their historically poor outcomes.

### Cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^e65cecfe]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

CMML is a myeloid neoplasm with overlapping features of MDS and MPN, enriched with cytogenetic (~30%) and molecular abnormalities (> 90%). Common cytogenetic abnormalities include: trisomy 8, -Y, abnormalities of chromosome 7 (monosomy 7 and del7q), trisomy 21, del(20q) and complex karyotypes. The Mayo–French cytogenetic risk stratification system effectively risk stratifies CMML patients based on cytogenetic abnormalities. The advent of next-generation sequencing has identified multiple gene mutations in most CMML patients. These mutations tend to involve epigenetic regulator genes (TET2, ASXL1), splicing components (SRSF2), signal pathways (RAS, CBL) and transcription factors (RUNX1). Among these, thus far, only nonsense and frameshift ASXL1 mutations have been shown to negatively impact OS. Expanding molecular insights into pathways altered by the above-mentioned genetic and epigenetic changes are slowly but surely translating into pharmacological interventions. A prime example is the availability of IDH inhibitors for IDH1/2 -mutated myeloid neoplasms. Hopefully with time, molecular testing at diagnosis will not only help with disease prognostication but will also help offer better therapeutic approaches. The need of the hour is to develop a CMML prognostic model that incorporates cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities.

### When clinical heterogeneity exceeds genetic heterogeneity: thinking outside the genomic box in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^3afee90e]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Exome sequencing studies in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) illustrate a mutational landscape characterized by few somatic mutations involving a subset of recurrent gene mutations in ASXL1, SRSF2, and TET2, each approaching 40% in incidence. This has led to the clinical implementation of next-generation sequencing panels that effectively identify clonal monocytosis and complement clinical prognostic scoring systems in most patients. However, most murine models based on single gene mutations fail to recapitulate the CMML phenotype, and many gene mutations are loss of function, making the identification of traditional therapeutic vulnerabilities challenging. Further, as a subtype of the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, CMML has a complex clinical heterogeneity not reflected by the mutational landscape. In this review, we will discuss the discordance between mutational homogeneity and clinical complexity and highlight novel genomic and nongenomic approaches that offer insight into the underlying clinical characteristics of CMML.

### A phase 1b / 2b multicenter study of oral panobinostat plus azacitidine in adults with MDS, CMML or AML with ≤ 30% blasts [^f657bdb9]. Leukemia (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent a heterogeneous group of myeloid disorders characterized by severe cytopenias and dysplasias in one or more myeloid lineages. Subclassification of MDS according to several prognostic systems identifies patients at substantial risk for transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is generally refractory to standard treatment.MDS remains incurable without stem cell transplant, but eligibility is restricted by the advanced age of patients. Azacitidine (AZA), the current standard frontline therapy for higher-risk MDS, significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) in these patients and has shown clinical benefit in those with AML. However, response rates with AZA therapy are generally < 30%, and of limited durability, with all nontransplanted patients eventually progressing or dying, highlighting the significant need for novel agents that improve both response rates and duration of responses.

### Validation of the 2017 revision of the WHO chronic myelomonocytic leukemia categories [^6a693fa3]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification includes substantial changes to the subclassification of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML): (1) a 3-tiered blast-based scheme including a novel "CMML-0" category replacing a 2-tiered system in place since 2001 and (2) 2 CMML subtypes, myelodysplastic (MDS-CMML) and myeloproliferative (MP-CMML), based on a white blood cell count cutoff of 13 × 10⁹ /L. The clinical utility of this subclassification scheme, particularly the expansion of blast-based subgroups, has not been validated. In this study, a large single-institution CMML patient cohort (n = 629) was used to assess the prognostic impact of the newly proposed categories. Patients were risk stratified according to the CMML-specific Prognostic Scoring System (CPSS) and the MD Anderson Prognostic Scoring System. MP-CMML patients had significantly shorter overall survival (OS; P < .0001; hazard ratio: 0.53, 95% confidence interval: 0.42–0.65) and median duration to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation (P < .0001; 15.2 vs 22.0 months) compared with MDS-CMML patients. The CMML-0 group included 36.4% patients with higher risk CPSS categories and 11.2% of patients with high-risk cytogenetics. Among treatment-naïve patients (n = 499), there was a marginal difference in OS between the CMML-0 and CMML-1 2017 subgroups (P = 0.0552). The WHO 2017 blast-based categories were not associated with AML-free survival. Incorporation of the WHO 2017 blast-based subgroups in a modified CPSS scheme had a neutral effect and did not improve its prognostic strength. Our data support the inclusion of MP-CMML and MDS-CMML subtypes in the WHO 2017 revision. Although of some utility in MP-CMML, the 3-tiered blast-based system is not well supported in this study.

### Predicting which subsets of patients with myelodysplastic neoplasms are more likely to progress to overt chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^27f1a4b2]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2024). Medium credibility.

The boundary between myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) has been revised in the latest World Health Organization classification of myeloid malignancies. These changes were motivated by the description of a subgroup of MDS patients identified as oligomonocytic chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (OM-CMML) at risk of evolving into overt CMML. Various studies will be reviewed describing the clinical and biological features of MDS patients evolving to CMML. The efforts to discover biomarkers enabling the identification of these patients at the time of MDS diagnosis will be discussed. Finally, the molecular landscape of these patients will be presented with a specific focus on the biallelic inactivation of TET2 in light of its functional impact on hematopoietic stem cells, granule-monocytic differentiation, and its tight interplay with inflammation.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder, with overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms, and is associated with an inherent risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. The median age of presentation ranges between 71–74 years, with a male predilection. In fact, age > 65 years has been shown to be an adverse prognosticator, impacting over-all survival (OS). There, however, are a fair number of patients that present earlier than the seventh decade of life. In two large studies the age ranges of disease presentation were; 20–93 years for the Mayo Clinic study, and 40–91 years for the Groupe Francophone des Myelodysplasies (GFM) study.

Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia:

CMML is a neoplasm associated with aging, often arising in the background of clonal hematopoiesis (bi-allelic TET2, or TET2/SRSF2 mutations), with the subsequent acquisition of mutations involving signaling (RAS pathway or JAK2 V617F), epigenetic regulation (SETBP1, DNMT3A and EZH2), transcription factors (RUNX1) and pre mRNA splicing (SF3B1 and U2AF1), shaping clinical phenotypes (Figure 1). There are pCMML subtypes in which oncogenic RAS pathway mutations (NRAS, CBL, KRAS and PTPN11) are clear initiating driver mutations, occurring early in the course of disease, associated with poor outcomes (decreased survival and higher rates of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) (Figure 1). Unlike in MDS, MPN or AML, TP53 mutations are extremely infrequent in CMML (< 1%), and are only really encountered at the time of CMML to AML transformation, or in the context of therapy-related CMML.

The 2016 iteration of the WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms has outlined diagnostic criteria for CMML which include the presence of sustained peripheral blood monocytosis, absence of reactive causes, the presence of < 20% blasts and promonocytes (blast equivalents) in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, and exclusion of molecularly defined myeloid neoplasms that can present with monocytosis (BCR-ABL1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1 and PCM1-JAK2 rearrangements), with or without dysplasia (Table 1). In the absence of dysplasia, a diagnosis of CMML can be made if the monocytosis has persisted for ≥ 3 months, reactive causes have been excluded, or somatic cytogenetic or molecular markers frequent in CMML (e.g. ASXL1, TET2, SRSF2 and SETBP1) can be documented. While this approach is very reasonable, there are limitations and important nuances associated with these criteria.

### Clinical management of CMML-state of the art [^2c402845]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

The following things should be taken into account when considering a treatment with hypomethylating agents:
Before HMA treatment starts, it should be discussed with the patient if an allogeneic stem cell transplantation is possible and is the wish of the patient. It is not a good idea to treat with HMA for a long period and decide to perform an allogeneic stem cell transplantation in case of relapse or non‐response.
In cases with a proliferative type of high‐risk CMML, a cytoreduction could be necessary before HMA treatment. Decitabine has a higher potential to lead to normalization of WBC and can, if necessary, be combined with HU.

Unfortunately, increased medullary blasts and high WBCs are not only poor prognostic factors for untreated CMML but also predict an unfavourable outcome after treatment with 5‐azacytidine. In other words, the neediest patients benefit the least. Nevertheless, treatment with a hypomethylating agent is worth trying in CMML patients. In patients who fail to respond to first line HMA, it is justify to add the bcl2 inhibitor venetoclax to HMA, trying to achieve a remission, taking into account prolonged and intensified aplasia.

In patients who transformed to acute leukaemia, the therapeutic dilemma is even higher. Not only the probability of response to HMA or HMA plus venetoclax is lower but also the probability of a long‐lasting remission after allogeneic transplantation is poorer.

Induction chemotherapy

Induction chemotherapy, regardless of which combination (7 + 3 ± x or CPX351) was used, cannot be recommended for the treatment of CMML. In case of urgent need of treatment induction, it might be considered as bridging to allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms

This category of myeloid neoplasms is defined by overlapping pathologic and molecular features of MDS and MPN, often manifesting clinically with various combinations of cytopenias and cytoses. The definition of cytopenias is the same as that for MDS. The classification includes major revisions in the diagnostic criteria of CMML and terminology changes for other MDS/MPN types. (Table 5)

Table 5
Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia diagnostic criteria, subtypes, and blast-based subgrouping criteria reflect diagnostic refinement and emphasize unifying characteristics

The prototype and most common MDS/MPN is chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), which is characterized by sustained peripheral blood monocytosis and various combinations of somatic mutations involving epigenetic regulation, spliceosome, and signal transduction genes. Diagnostic criteria are revised to include prerequisite and supporting criteria. (Table 6) The first prerequisite criterion is persistent absolute (≥ 0.5 × 10 9 / L) and relative (≥ 10%) peripheral blood monocytosis. Namely, the cutoff for absolute monocytosis is lowered from 1.0 ×10 9 /L to 0.5 ×10 9 /L to incorporate cases formerly referred to as oligomonocytic CMML. To enhance diagnostic accuracy when absolute monocytosis is ≥ 0.5 ×10 9 /L but < 1.0 ×10 9 /L, detection of one of more clonal cytogenetic or molecular abnormality and documentation of dysplasia in at least one lineage are required. Abnormal partitioning of peripheral blood monocyte subsets is introduced as a new supporting criterion. Additional studies are needed to determine the optimal approach to classifying individuals with unexplained clonal monocytosis who do not fit the new diagnostic criteria of CMML.

Table 6
Diagnostic criteria of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia.

a Blasts and blast equivalents include myeloblasts, monoblasts and promonocytes.

b Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) can be associated with monocytosis at presentation or during the course of the disease; such cases can mimic CMML. In these instances, a documented history of MPN excludes CMML. The presence of MPN features in the bone marrow and/or high burden of MPN-associated mutations (JAK2, CALR or MPL) tends to support MPN with monocytosis rather than CMML.

c Criteria for myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with tyrosine kinase fusions should be specifically excluded in cases with eosinophilia.

d Morphologic dysplasia should be present in ≥ 10% of cells of a haematopoietic lineage in the bone marrow.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: 2022 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and management [^462dfc06]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder with overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms, with an inherent risk for leukemic transformation (~15% over 3-5years).

Diagnosis

Diagnosis is based on the presence of sustained (> 3 months) peripheral blood monocytosis (≥ 1 ×10⁹ /L; monocytes ≥ 10%), usually with accompanying bone marrow dysplasia. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities occur in ~30% of patients, while > 90% have somatic gene mutations. Mutations involving TET2 (~60%), SRSF2 (~50%), ASXL1 (~40%), and the oncogenic RAS pathway (~30%) are frequent, while the presence of ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations and the absence of TET2 mutations negatively impact overall survival.

Risk-Stratification

Molecularly integrated prognostic models include the Groupe Français des Myélodysplasies, Mayo Molecular Model (MMM), and the CMML specific prognostic model. Risk factors incorporated into the MMM include presence of truncating ASXL1 mutations, absolute monocyte count > 10 ×10⁹ /L, hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, platelet count < 100×10⁹ /L, and the presence of circulating immature myeloid cells. The MMM stratifies CMML patients into four groups: high (≥ 3 risk factors), intermediate-2 (2 risk factors), intermediate-1 (1 risk factor), and low (no risk factors), with median survivals of 16, 31, 59, and 97months, respectively.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

Hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine are commonly used, with overall response rates of ~40%-50% and complete remission rates of ~7%-17%; with no impact on mutational allele burdens. Allogeneic stem cell transplant is the only potentially curative option but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in younger patients: molecular and cytogenetic predictors of survival and treatment outcome [^52f5eb3e]. Blood Cancer Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment options for CMML are limited, and include therapy with hypomethylating agents (HMA) or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT). There is no phase III data supporting the use of HMA in CMML, however, several phase II studies have been completed with overall response rates ranging from 25–70%, and median OS ranging from 12 to 37 months. Unfortunately, the retrospective nature of the vast majority of the studies along with the lack of a comparator arm makes it difficult to draw cross-study conclusions. While AHSCT is a curative strategy, it is currently not widely utilized given issues with donor eligibility (advanced age), limited donor pools and the risk of complications such as graft rejection, acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) and non-relapse mortality (NRM). Most AHSCT studies have been retrospective, with a mix of myeloablative (MA) and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens, with NRM ranging from 12–40% and relapse rates ranging from 25–40%, making it very difficult to draw concrete conclusions.

While there is a modest pool of clinical, prognostic and therapeutic information on patients with CMML, not much is known about those that present prior to the seventh decade of life. In a large study on primary myelofibrosis (n = 1000), patients with age < 60 years (n = 299) had a dynamic international prognostic scoring system (DIPSS-plus) stratified survival that was better than that of the overall cohort, with median OS of 20.0 years, 14.3 years, 5.3 years and 1.7 years for low, intermediate-1/2 and high risk disease, respectively, compared with 15.6 years, 5.6 years, 2.5 years and 1.4 years for the entire cohort. Similarly, the clinical characteristics, karyotypic and molecular abnormalities, and outcomes of 'young' adults with CMML are not well-defined. These patients are more likely to be offered therapies impacting survival, such as, HMA and AHSCT. Given that the median age of presentation for CMML is in the seventh decade of life and since age > 65 years was found to be an adverse prognosticator, for the purposes of this study, we defined 'young' CMML as age ≤ 65 years. We carried out this international collaborative effort to define the molecular and cytogenetic predictors of survival and treatment outcomes in 'young' adults with CMML.

### CSF3R-mutant chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a distinct clinically subset with abysmal prognosis: a case report and systematic review of the literature [^ec060b79]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) chacaterized by persistent peripheral blood monocytosis, hypercellular bone marrow and dysplasia at least in one myeloid lineage. CMML shares much of its molecular landscape with other myeloid neoplasms, while differs from others such as chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL), given the high frequency of CSF3R mutations in the latter. In this article, we report a case of CSF3R-mutated CMML and dissect this rare entity by reviewing the medical literature, with the intent to understand how this rare mutation shapes CMML's clinical and morphological phenotype. CSF3R-mutated CMML emerges as a rare entity meeting the ICC/WHO diagnostic criteria for CMML and simultaneously showing clinical-pathological and molecular traits of CNL and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, rising an important and difficult diagnostic and therapeutical issue.

REVIEW

Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) comprises a heterogeneous group of clonal bone marrow diseases that are comparatively rare: The incidence of CMML is less than 1/100 000/year but is constantly rising due to the demographic effect of the ageing of society. Precise epidemiological data are not really available, since epidemiological studies have mostly recorded CMML as a myelodysplastic syndrome, creating uncertainty regarding the exact incidence and prevalence. Williams et al. provided a thoughtful discussion of this problem when they published the first well‐designed epidemiological study of CMMLin this journal. Assessing the incidence of this myeloid malignancy becomes even more difficult when we consider that CMML may be preceded by a clonal monocytosis of unclear significance.

The development of CMML is driven by somatic mutations in haematopoietic stem cells that can alter DNA methylation (TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2), RNA splicing (SRSF2, SF3B1, U2AF1, ZRSR2), histone modification (ASXL1, EZH2), cell signalling (NRAS, KRAS, CBL, NF1, PTPN11, JAK2) and transcription factors (RUNX1, SETBP1, GATA2). NPM1 and FLT3 are rarely mutated but indicate potential rapid progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). About 95% of patients with CMML harbour one or more somatic mutations. TET2 is mutated in about 60%, SRSF2 in 50%, ASXL1 in 40% and other genes in less than 15%. Combinations of mutated genes are frequent. This is in line with age‐related accumulation of somatic mutations and clonal evolution. Genes with an epigenetic function are often affected early, followed by genes involved in RNA splicing, and, later on, by genes participating in signalling pathways. CMML mutations that alter the RAS pathway are associated with myeloproliferation and transformation into acute leukaemia, NRAS being the most frequent. About 80% of patients with CMML show a normal karyotype, but trisomy 8, aberrations of chromosome 7 and complex karyotypes are associated with an increased risk of transformation to acute leukaemia. Deletion of 5q is a rare finding in CMML.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: 2024 update on diagnosis, risk stratification and management [^8d033273]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder with overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms, characterized by prominent monocytosis and an inherent risk for leukemic transformation (~15%-20% over 3-5years).

Diagnosis

Newly revised diagnostic criteria include sustained (> 3months) peripheral blood (PB) monocytosis (≥ 0.5×10⁹ /L; monocytes ≥ 10% of leukocyte count), consistent bone marrow (BM) morphology, < 20% BM or PB blasts (including promonocytes), and cytogenetic or molecular evidence of clonality. Cytogenetic abnormalities occur in ~30% of patients, while > 95% harbor somatic mutations: TET2 (~60%), SRSF2 (~50%), ASXL1 (~40%), RAS pathway (~30%), and others. The presence of ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations and absence of TET2 mutations negatively impact overall survival (ASXL1 WT /TET2 MT genotype being favorable).

Risk Stratification

Several risk models serve similar purposes in identifying high-risk patients that are considered for allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) earlier than later. Risk factors in the Mayo Molecular Model (MMM) include presence of truncating ASXL1 mutations, absolute monocyte count > 10×10⁹ /L, hemoglobin < 10g/dL, platelet count < 100×10⁹ /L, and the presence of circulating immature myeloid cells; the resulting 4-tiered risk categorization includes high (≥ 3 risk factors), intermediate-2 (2 risk factors), intermediate-1 (1 risk factor), and low (no risk factors); the corresponding median survivals were 16, 31, 59, and 97months. CMML is also classified as being "myeloproliferative (MP-CMML)" or "myelodysplastic (MD-CMML)", based on the presence or absence of leukocyte count of ≥ 13×10⁹ /L.

Treatment

ASCT is the only treatment modality that secures cure or long-term survival and is appropriate for MMM high/intermediate-2 risk disease. Drug therapy is currently not disease-modifying and includes hydroxyurea and hypomethylating agents; a recent phase-3 study (DACOTA) comparing hydroxyurea and decitabine, in high-risk MP-CMML, showed similar overall survival at 23.1 versus 18.4months, respectively, despite response rates being higher for decitabine (56% vs. 31%).

Unique Disease Associations

These include systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases, leukemia cutis and lysozyme-induced nephropathy; the latter requires close monitoring of renal function during leukocytosis and is a potential indication for cytoreductive therapy.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) — diagnostic exclusions and treatment options include excluding myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions (PDGFRA/PDGFRB-, FGFR1-, or PCM1::JAK2) using FISH or RNA sequencing to establish CMML; patients with a t(5;12) ETV6::PDGFRB fusion may respond to imatinib mesylate, and CMML with systemic mastocytosis and KIT D816V is responsive to midostaurin with high-sensitivity polymerase chain reaction required to detect KIT D816V. Patients with CMML may have disease that responds to ruxolitinib for symptomatic disease. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) or hydroxyurea may be considered for CMML-1, whereas HMAs, with or without venetoclax, and/or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), is recommended for CMML-2; in non-transplant candidates, the risk of cytopenias with the addition of venetoclax should be carefully considered. Ruxolitinib may be added to HMAs for symptom management or splenomegaly for CMML-2, and patients with profound cytopenias and high transfusion burden are candidates for HCT.

### Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes: the classic and the novel [^d1f39957]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogenous group of clonal myeloid neoplasms originating in hematopoietic stem cells. They are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis resulting in dysplasia in hematopoietic cells, and are associated with peripheral blood (PB) cytopenias, especially anemia, and a propensity to leukemic transformation. The incidence of MDS increases with age and in the general population is approximately 5 cases per 100,000 people per year. The median age of onset is above the age of 70 years. Patients with MDS are classified using one of several scoring systems. Most patients are assigned to the lower-risk or higher-risk groups. While these classifications may assist in diagnosis, they mainly serve for prognostication and to direct management.

In this work, we focus on the diagnosis of MDS and emphasize some of the more modern modalities currently under study. The entities of MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) are beyond the scope of this paper.

As MDS encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders, the diagnostic process is based on a combination of clinical and laboratory features and the exclusion of other diseases. As such, there is no single specific diagnostic test, and there are no definitive diagnostic criteria for MDS.

### Development and validation of a prognostic scoring system for patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^d0417f8b]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

The natural course of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is highly variable but a widely accepted prognostic scoring system for patients with CMML is not available. The main aim of this study was to develop a new CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS) in a large series of 558 patients with CMML (training cohort, Spanish Group of Myelodysplastic Syndromes) and to validate it in an independent series of 274 patients (validation cohort, Heinrich Heine University Hospital, Düsseldorf, Germany, and San Matteo Hospital, Pavia, Italy). The most relevant variables for overall survival (OS) and evolution to acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) were FAB and WHO CMML subtypes, CMML-specific cytogenetic risk classification, and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependency. CPSS was able to segregate patients into 4 clearly different risk groups for OS (P < .001) and risk of AML evolution (P < .001) and its predictive capability was confirmed in the validation cohort. An alternative CPSS with hemoglobin instead of RBC transfusion dependency offered almost identical prognostic capability. This study confirms the prognostic impact of FAB and WHO subtypes, recognizes the importance of RBC transfusion dependency and cytogenetics, and offers a simple and powerful CPSS for accurately assessing prognosis and planning therapy in patients with CMML.

### Genomic determinants of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^e8b00f07]. Leukemia (2017). Low credibility.

The biology, clinical phenotype and progression rate of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) are highly variable due to diverse initiating and secondary clonal genetic events. To determine the effects of molecular features including clonal hierarchy in CMML, we studied whole-exome and targeted next-generation sequencing data from 150 patients with robust clinical and molecular annotation assessed cross-sectionally and at serial time points of disease evolution. To identify molecular lesions unique to CMML, we compared it to the related myeloid neoplasms (N = 586), including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and primary monocytic acute myeloid leukemia and discerned distinct molecular profiles despite similar pathomorphological features. Within CMML, mutations in certain pathways correlated with clinical classification, for example, proliferative vs dysplastic features. While most CMML patients (59%) had ancestral (dominant/co-dominant) mutations involving TET2, SRSF2 or ASXL1 genes, secondary subclonal hierarchy correlated with clinical phenotypes or outcomes. For example, progression was associated with acquisition of new expanding clones carrying biallelic TET2 mutations or RAS family, or spliceosomal gene mutations. In contrast, dysplastic features correlated with mutations usually encountered in MDS (for example, SF3B1 and U2AF1). Classification of CMML based on hierarchies of ancestral and subclonal mutational events may correlate strongly with clinical features and prognosis.

### A phase II, multicentre trial of decitabine in higher-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^e4410e03]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a complex clonal hematological disorder classified among myelodysplastic (MDS)/myeloproliferative neoplasms. Prognosis is poor and there is a lack of effective treatments. The hypomethylating agent decitabine has shown activity against MDS and elderly acute myeloid leukemia, but there is little data focusing specifically on its efficacy in CMML. In this prospective, phase 2 Italian study, CMML patients received intravenous decitabine 20 mg/m 2 per day on Days 1–5 of a 28-day treatment cycle. Response was evaluated after four and six cycles; patients responding at the end of six cycles could continue treatment with decitabine. Forty-three patients were enrolled; > 50% were high-risk according to four CMML-specific scoring systems. In the intent-to-treat population (n = 42), the overall response rate after six cycles was 47.6%, with seven complete responses (16.6%), eight marrow responses (19%), one partial response (2.4%) and four hematological improvements (9.5%). After a median follow-up of 51.5 months (range: 44.4–57.2), median overall survival was 17 months, with responders having a significantly longer survival than non-responders (P = 0.02). Grade 3/4 anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 28.6%, 50% and 38% of patients, respectively. Decitabine appears to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with high-risk CMML.

### Gene mutations differently impact the prognosis of the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative classes of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^31826174]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Initially classified in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is currently considered as a MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm. Two classes-myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative-have been distinguished upon the level of the white blood cell count (threshold 13 G/L). We analyzed mutations in 19 genes reported in CMML to determine if and how these mutations impacted the respective prognosis of the two classes. We defined four major mutated pathways (DNA methylation, ASXL1, splicing, and signaling) and determined their prognostic impact. The number of mutated pathways impacted overall survival in the myelodysplastic class but not in the myeloproliferative class. The myeloproliferative class had a worse prognosis than the myelodysplastic class and was impacted by RUNX1 mutations only. Our results argue for a reclassification of CMML based on the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative status.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic innovations [^b49b1dcb]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Contemporary therapeutic approaches for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only potential cure for CMML; however, due to older age and comorbidities, this approach is unfeasible for the majority of patients. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors, also referred to as hypomethylating agents, remain the only Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment options for CMML, but overall response rates are < 50%, with true remissions being achieved in < 20% patients. In a large multicenter study, we showed that the best predictor of response to DNMT inhibitors is the presence of TET2 mutations in the absence of ASXL1 mutations. Although use of DNMT inhibitors can lead to demethylation at promoters and CpG islands, response to these inhibitors occurs in the absence of significant variation in the clonal structure. Several studies have shown a lack of correlation between differences in promoter methylation and transcriptional changes in CMML, a phenomenon that might explain why, despite an epigenetic effect, DNMT inhibitors do not affect the mutant allelic burdens, nor alter the natural history of the disease. Ascorbic acid is an important cofactor for TET dioxygenase activity, prompting the use of parenteral ascorbic acid in combination with DNMT inhibitors in TET2 -mutant CMML. In this setting, ascorbic acid has been postulated to enhance TET2 activity generated from the unmutated allele and/or exploit functional redundancies with TET3 in the hematopoietic system.

### A phase II, multicentre trial of decitabine in higher-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^8a9a1c8d]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

The only potentially curative treatment option for CMML is hematopoietic stem cell transplant, but this is not suitable for many patients because of their age and comorbidities. There are currently no prospective data on the benefits and risks of hematopoietic stem cell transplant in CMML. Management usually focuses on supportive care and cytoreductive therapy, depending on whether the disease is dysplastic or myeloproliferative. Hydroxyurea is currently a mainstay therapy for proliferative disease.

The hypomethylating agents (HMAs) azacitidine and decitabine have been shown to be active in MDS patients in randomized phase 3 trials. However, the numbers of CMML patients in these trials were limited and their results were not reported separately. In two retrospective analyses of decitabine, overall response rates (ORRs) ranged from 26 to 68% and 2-year survival from 25 to 48%. In a prospective phase 2 study in which 39 CMML patients received 20 mg/m 2 decitabine per day on days 1–5 of 28-day cycles, the ORR was 38% and 2-year survival was 48%.

The European Medicines Agency has approved azacitidine for the treatment of non-proliferative CMML (white blood cell (WBC) count < 12 000), but HMAs are not currently a licensed option for treating proliferative forms. In Italy, several national societies recommend that patients with myelodysplastic-type CMML and ⩾10% bone marrow blasts should be managed with supportive therapy in combination with HMAs. Alongside the lack of specific treatment options, CMML-specific response criteria were not used in any clinical trials, having only been recently developed by Savona et al.

Here we report the results of a prospective phase 2 study that assessed the efficacy and safety of decitabine in Italian CMML patients.

### Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: 2020 update on diagnosis, risk stratification and management [^d2aae33d]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder with overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms, with an inherent risk for leukemic transformation (~15% over 3-5years).

Diagnosis

Diagnosis is based on the presence of sustained (> 3 months) peripheral blood monocytosis (≥ 1×10⁹ /L; monocytes ≥ 10%), along with bone marrow dysplasia. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities occur in ~30% of patients, while > 90% have gene mutations. Mutations involving TET2 (~60%), SRSF2 (~50%), ASXL1 (~40%) and the oncogenic RAS pathway (~30%) are frequent; while the presence of ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations and the absence of TET2 mutations negatively impact over-all survival.

Risk Stratification

Molecularly integrated prognostic models include; the Groupe Français des Myélodysplasies (GFM), Mayo Molecular Model (MMM) and the CMML specific prognostic model (CPSS-Mol). Risk factors incorporated into the MMM include presence of nonsense or frameshift ASXL1 mutations, absolute monocyte count > 10 ×10 9 /L, hemoglobin < 10g/dL, platelet count < 100×10 9 /L and the presence of circulating immature myeloid cells. The MMM stratifies CMML patients into four groups; high (≥ 3 risk factors), intermediate-2 (2 risk factors), intermediate-1 (1 risk factor) and low (no risk factors), with median survivals of 16, 31, 59 and 97months, respectively.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

Hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine are commonly used, with overall response rates of ~40%-50% and complete remission rates of ~7%-17%; with no impact on mutational allele burdens. Allogeneic stem cell transplant is the only potentially curative option, but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
