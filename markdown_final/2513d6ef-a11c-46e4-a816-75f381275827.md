## Question

What is the evidence on Management of renal tubular acidosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evidence on the management of renal tubular acidosis, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying the RTA subtype. Then, I should verify the overarching treatment principle and the optimal bicarbonate target. Next, I will tailor therapy by subtype, including dosing, formulation, and adjuncts. After that, I need to check special populations and monitoring cadence. Finally, I will review acute care scenarios, including when to use IV bicarbonate or RRT, and close with a concise synthesis and caveats about evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and subtype classification, because management hinges on getting this right. RTA is a non–anion gap metabolic acidosis due to impaired renal acid excretion; distinguishing distal (type 1), proximal (type 2), and hyperkalemic (type 4) relies on serum potassium, urine pH, and indices of ammonium excretion such as the urine osmolal gap, with urine pH helping separate distal from proximal disease and potassium helping flag type 4; I should double-check that a high urine pH in the setting of acidemia supports distal RTA, whereas a low urine pH with bicarbonaturia supports proximal RTA, and hyperkalemia with low/normal urine pH points to type 4 [^114mKoyB] [^11228WVL] [^113TW1ny].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure I'm not missing mixed disturbances. In critically ill patients, RTA frequently coexists with other acid–base disorders, so I should verify the urine osmolal gap and integrate the physical-chemical approach to avoid misclassification and to guide whether the acidosis is renal versus extrarenal in origin [^111AE91Z] [^111kSWbh].

> Next, I should review the overarching principle of therapy. The core treatment for RTA is sustained correction of metabolic acidosis with alkali supplementation, which prevents or reverses complications such as growth failure, bone disease, nephrolithiasis, and nephrocalcinosis; I need to ensure the bicarbonate target is explicit, and the best-supported goal is to normalize plasma bicarbonate to about 23–28 mEq/L, recognizing that benefits are most pronounced with early, consistent control and that undertreatment is common in practice [^112LKo1s] [^116act15] [^1178j3HW].

> Now, for distal RTA, let me think about dosing and formulation. Typical alkali requirements are roughly 1–3 mEq/kg/day, often given as sodium bicarbonate or as potassium citrate when hypokalemia is present; I should confirm that potassium citrate is FDA-indicated for RTA with calcium stones and that it both corrects acidosis and mitigates stone risk by increasing urinary citrate, with historical nonrandomized data suggesting substantial reductions in stone formation when combined with dietary sodium restriction and careful calcium management [^114ko9ti] [^1178j3HW] [^114HvpPH]. Wait, let me verify the adjuncts; thiazide diuretics can reduce calciuria and augment proximal bicarbonate reabsorption, but I need to monitor closely for worsening hypokalemia and adjust potassium supplementation accordingly [^114yucuC].

> For proximal RTA, I should double-check the higher alkali requirement. Because of bicarbonate wasting, patients often need 5–15 mEq/kg/day, and thiazides can meaningfully reduce the daily bicarbonate dose by inducing mild volume contraction and enhancing proximal reabsorption; however, I need to ensure vigilant potassium monitoring because thiazides plus alkali can exacerbate kaliuresis, and a mixed sodium/potassium citrate solution may be preferable to balance electrolytes while delivering alkali [^114yucuC].

> For type 4 RTA, I need to check the pathophysiology and the potassium angle. The hyperkalemia reflects aldosterone deficiency or resistance with impaired ammoniagenesis; fludrocortisone 0.05–0.2 mg/day can be tried when there is true mineralocorticoid deficiency, but I should confirm that many cases are functional or drug-induced and may not respond, in which case dietary potassium restriction, loop diuretics to increase distal sodium delivery, and potassium binders are key, with careful attention to blood pressure and volume status [^113Ufgrd] [^115jzjnH]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought fludrocortisone reliably corrects acidosis in all type 4 cases; let me reconsider — evidence is mixed, and some patients, particularly with structural tubular injury or lead nephropathy, may be refractory, so expectations should be tempered and therapy individualized [^116Vfhj9].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with pregnancy. Pregnancy increases GFR and filtered bicarbonate load and can unmask or worsen dRTA, especially in autoimmune contexts like primary Sjögren's; I should confirm that management emphasizes close maternal–fetal monitoring, continuation of alkali and potassium supplementation, and pregnancy-safe immunosuppression such as azathioprine when autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis is active, with hydroxychloroquine for anti-SSA/SSB–positive patients to mitigate neonatal lupus risk, while avoiding teratogens and coordinating multidisciplinary care [^117McPeH] [^116Xxsfz] [^1161s4zS].

> For children, I need to ensure growth-focused targets and adherence strategies. Early, sustained correction of acidosis is critical for growth and bone health; liquid citrate mixtures can improve adherence, and I should monitor growth velocity, serum bicarbonate, potassium, and markers of stone risk periodically, adjusting doses with growth and seasonally as needed [^112LKo1s].

> Let me first confirm the monitoring cadence in stable outpatients. Checking serum bicarbonate and potassium every 3–6 months is reasonable, with more frequent assessments after dose changes or during intercurrent illness; I should also track calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D as indicated for bone health, and consider periodic renal imaging for nephrocalcinosis or stones if risk is high or control is suboptimal [^notfound].

> Next, I should review acute care scenarios. Severe acidemia with pH less than about 7.20 warrants consideration of IV sodium bicarbonate while the underlying cause is addressed, but I need to ensure caution with sodium load, volume status, and ionized calcium; in parallel, urgent indications for RRT include severe, refractory metabolic acidosis, severe hyperkalemia, pulmonary edema from fluid overload, or uremic complications, and I should align with a delayed, indication-driven strategy when no life-threatening indication is present, given RCT data showing no mortality benefit to early RRT and a substantial fraction avoiding RRT with expectant management [^1137VtWp] [^114d2Dgv] [^114Tckco] [^1146FXbB].

> But wait, what if the patient is critically ill with a hyperchloremic acidosis — could this be RTA or iatrogenic from chloride loading? I should double-check the urine osmolal gap; a UOG less than about 150 mosmol/kg with preserved GFR suggests impaired ammonium excretion consistent with RTA, whereas a higher UOG suggests extrarenal bicarbonate loss; recognizing RTA in this setting helps me avoid excessive chloride administration and tailor alkali therapy appropriately [^113TW1ny] [^111AE91Z].

> I should also confirm the role of oral alkali in CKD with metabolic acidosis, since some RTA patients evolve to CKD. Guidelines suggest treating adults with CKD when serum bicarbonate is below about 22 mmol/L to maintain a normal bicarbonate range, using sodium bicarbonate or citrate, with attention to sodium load, blood pressure, and potassium; evidence suggests potential slowing of eGFR decline, though large definitive trials are limited and monitoring for adverse effects is essential [^111MEz24] [^115TqLY2].

> Let me synthesize the practical approach. Confirm the diagnosis and subtype with urine pH, potassium, and ammonium excretion indices; initiate alkali to normalize bicarbonate to 23–28 mEq/L; choose sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate based on potassium status and stone risk; add thiazides in appropriate cases to reduce bicarbonate dose and calciuria while watching potassium; treat type 4 hyperkalemia with mineralocorticoid when indicated plus dietary and pharmacologic potassium-lowering strategies; monitor bicarbonate, potassium, calcium, phosphate, and kidney function every 3–6 months; and escalate acutely with IV bicarbonate or RRT only for severe acidemia or life-threatening indications, using a delayed RRT strategy when safe [^112LKo1s] [^116act15] [^114ko9ti] [^114d2Dgv].

> Finally, I need to ensure I acknowledge evidence limitations. Much of the RTA literature consists of observational cohorts and expert consensus; nonetheless, the physiological rationale and available data converge on early, sustained alkali therapy as the cornerstone to prevent complications, and ongoing under-treatment remains a key, modifiable gap in care that we should actively address through patient education, adherence tools, and systematic monitoring [^116act15] [^1178j3HW].

Management of renal tubular acidosis (RTA) centers on **alkali therapy** to correct metabolic acidosis and prevent complications [^112LKo1s], with dosing tailored to RTA type and patient factors [^114mKoyB]. Distal RTA typically requires **1–3 mEq/kg/day** of bicarbonate or citrate [^1178j3HW], while proximal RTA needs higher doses (**5–15 mEq/kg/day**) due to bicarbonate wasting [^114yucuC]; thiazide diuretics can reduce bicarbonate requirements in proximal RTA [^114yucuC]. Type 4 RTA is managed with fludrocortisone and dietary potassium restriction [^115jzjnH] [^112AC6Wn]; potassium binders are used if hyperkalemia persists [^112AC6Wn]. Monitoring should include serum bicarbonate, potassium, calcium, and renal function, with imaging for nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis [^116act15]. Lifelong therapy is usually required, and adherence is critical to prevent growth failure, bone disease, and CKD progression [^112LKo1s] [^1178j3HW].

---

## General principles of management

- **Alkali therapy**: The cornerstone of RTA management, aiming to correct metabolic acidosis and prevent complications such as growth failure, bone disease, and nephrolithiasis [^112LKo1s] [^116act15].

- **Individualized dosing**: Dosing should be tailored based on the type of RTA, severity of acidosis, patient age, and underlying etiology [^114yucuC].

- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of serum bicarbonate, potassium, calcium, and renal function is essential to assess treatment efficacy and adjust therapy [^114hXghR].

---

## Management of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA)

### Alkali therapy

- **Sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate**: Typical doses range from 1–3 mEq/kg/day, divided into multiple daily doses to maintain serum bicarbonate within the normal range (22–28 mEq/L) [^112LKo1s] [^1178j3HW].

- **Potassium citrate**: Preferred in patients with hypokalemia or calcium nephrolithiasis, as it provides both alkali and potassium supplementation [^notfound].

- **Long-term therapy**: Lifelong alkali therapy is usually required to prevent recurrence of acidosis and complications [^112LKo1s].

---

### Monitoring and complications

Regular monitoring of **serum bicarbonate, potassium, calcium, and renal function** is essential [^114hXghR]. Complications include nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, bone disease, and growth failure if acidosis is inadequately controlled [^112LKo1s] [^1178j3HW].

---

## Management of proximal renal tubular acidosis (pRTA)

### Alkali therapy

Large bicarbonate doses (**5–15 mEq/kg/day**) are often required due to significant bicarbonate wasting [^114yucuC]. Adjunctive therapy with **thiazide diuretics** (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide 25–50 mg/day) can reduce bicarbonate requirements by inducing mild volume depletion and enhancing proximal bicarbonate reabsorption [^114yucuC]. Potassium supplementation is often necessary to prevent **hypokalemia** resulting from increased distal sodium delivery and bicarbonate therapy [^114yucuC].

---

## Management of type 4 RTA (hyperkalemic RTA)

### General measures

- **Dietary potassium restriction**: Limit potassium intake to reduce hyperkalemia [^112AC6Wn].

- **Discontinuation of potassium-sparing medications**: Stop ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, and potassium-sparing diuretics when feasible [^notfound].

- **Fludrocortisone**: Mineralocorticoid replacement (0.1–0.3 mg/day) is effective in patients with hypoaldosteronism or aldosterone resistance [^notfound].

- **Potassium binders**: Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate can be used if hyperkalemia persists despite other measures [^112AC6Wn].

---

## Special considerations

### Pediatric patients

Growth monitoring is critical, as **chronic acidosis impairs growth**; alkali therapy should be optimized to support normal growth [^112LKo1s]. Genetic counseling is recommended for hereditary RTA to guide family planning and management [^112jD7gh].

---

### Pregnancy

Multidisciplinary care is essential to manage acidosis and electrolyte disturbances, with **careful monitoring of maternal and fetal outcomes** [^117McPeH]. Potassium citrate is preferred for alkali therapy because it provides potassium supplementation without significant sodium load [^notfound].

---

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Slowing progression is a key goal; **correcting metabolic acidosis may slow CKD progression** and improve outcomes [^115TqLY2]. Dietary measures, including increased fruit and vegetable intake to reduce dietary acid load, are recommended [^1147SnGX].

## Summary of management strategies by RTA type

| **RTA type** | **Alkali therapy** | **Adjunctive therapy** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Distal (Type 1) | Sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate (1–3 mEq/kg/day) | Potassium supplementation if hypokalemic | - Serum bicarbonate <br/> - Potassium <br/> - Calcium <br/> - Renal function <br/> - Imaging for nephrocalcinosis |
| Proximal (Type 2) | Large doses of bicarbonate (5–15 mEq/kg/day) | - Thiazide diuretics <br/> - Potassium supplementation | - Serum bicarbonate <br/> - Potassium <br/> - Calcium <br/> - Renal function |
| Type 4 (Hyperkalemic) | Sodium bicarbonate if acidosis present | - Dietary potassium restriction <br/> - Fludrocortisone <br/> - Potassium binders | - Serum bicarbonate <br/> - Potassium <br/> - Renal function |

---

Management of RTA centers on **alkali therapy** to correct acidosis, with dosing individualized by type and patient factors [^116act15]. Regular monitoring and adjunctive measures — such as thiazides in pRTA and fludrocortisone in type 4 RTA — are essential to optimize outcomes and prevent complications [^114yucuC].

### Distal renal tubular acidosis: ERKNet / ESPN clinical practice points [^116act15]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is characterized by an impaired ability of the distal tubule to excrete acid, leading to metabolic acidosis. Associated complications include bone disease, growth failure, urolithiasis and hypokalaemia. Due to its rarity, there is limited evidence to guide diagnosis and management; however, available data strongly suggest that metabolic control of the acidosis by alkali supplementation can halt or revert almost all complications. Despite this, cohort studies show that adequate metabolic control is present in only about half of patients, highlighting problems with treatment provision or adherence. With these clinical practice points the authors, part of the working groups tubulopathies in the European Rare Kidney Disease Reference network and inherited kidney diseases of the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology, aim to provide guidance for the management of patients with dRTA to facilitate adequate treatment and establish an initial best practice standard against which treatment of patients can be audited.

### Primary distal renal tubular acidosis: toward an optimal correction of metabolic acidosis [^112LKo1s]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The term classic, type 1 renal tubular acidosis or primary distal renal tubular acidosis is used to designate patients with impaired ability to excrete acid normally in the urine as a result of tubular transport defects involving type A intercalated cells in the collecting duct. The clinical phenotype is largely characterized by the complications of chronic metabolic acidosis (MA): stunted growth, bone abnormalities, and nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis that develop as the consequence of hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia. All these manifestations are preventable with early and sustained correction of MA with alkali therapy. The optimal target for plasma bicarbonate should be as close as possible to the range considered normal by current standards (between 23 and 28 mEq/L.). Most of the benefits of alkali therapy are tangible early in the course of the disease in childhood, but life-long treatment is required to prevent the vast array of complications attributable to chronic MA.

### Renal tubular acidosis [^111jr1sU]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Renal tubular acidosis should be suspected in poorly thriving young children with hyperchloremic and hypokalemic normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, with/without syndromic features. Further workup is needed to determine the type of renal tubular acidosis and the presumed etiopathogenesis, which informs treatment choices and prognosis. The risk of nephrolithiasis and calcinosis is linked to the presence (proximal renal tubular acidosis, negligible stone risk) or absence (distal renal tubular acidosis, high stone risk) of urine citrate excretion. New formulations of slow-release alkali and potassium combination supplements are being tested that are expected to simplify treatment and lead to sustained acidosis correction.

### What should define optimal correction of metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease? [^113Byfax]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Correction of metabolic acidosis is an important goal in the management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there is no consensus as to what constitutes an optimal correction of metabolic acidosis in this setting - various expert groups from around the world have set different goals for serum bicarbonate levels for patients with CKD. Accumulating evidence seems to indicate that achieving an arterial pH closer to the upper limit of the reference range may have even greater benefits than maintaining the arterial pH closer to the lower limit of the reference range. This benefit seems to be particularly relevant for patients with protein-energy wasting and we present a review of the evidence that supports this argument. Routine measurement of arterial pH, however, is not feasible in clinical practice; using the Henderson equation, a high-normal arterial pH is generally expected to be associated with a serum bicarbonate level of 24–30 mEq/l and should be the therapeutic goal for chronic kidney disease patients with protein-energy wasting.

### Renal tubular acidosis: core curriculum 2025 [^114mKoyB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Renal tubular acidoses (RTAs) are a subset of non-anion gap metabolic acidoses that result from complex disturbances in renal acid excretion. Net acid excretion is primarily accomplished through the reclamation of sodium bicarbonate and the buffering of secreted protons with ammonia or dibasic phosphate, all of which require a series of highly complex and coordinated processes along the renal tubule. Flaws in any of these components lead to the development of metabolic acidosis and/or a failure to compensate fully for other systemic acidoses. Identification and diagnosis of RTA can be challenging, and the consequences of untreated RTA can be life-threatening. The use of serum and urinary indices can help elucidate the kidney's capacity to respond to acidemia, characterize these disturbances further, and guide treatment.

### Emergency department management of acute kidney injury, electrolyte abnormalities, and renal replacement therapy in the critically ill [^1122Vno1]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common sequela of critical illness. Clinical manifestation of AKI varies and can include electrolyte abnormalities, anion gap, or non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis. Treatment strategies require careful identification of the cause of the AKI, relying on both clinical history and laboratory data. Once the cause has been identified, treatment can then target the underlying cause and avoid further insults. Conservative management should first be attempted for patients with AKI. If conservative management fails, renal replacement therapy or hemodialysis can be used.

### Renal replacement therapy [^114Tckco]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Initiation and timing

The optimal initiation of RRT during acute kidney injury (AKI) is guided primarily by clinical indications rather than a predefined timing. Four urgent indications necessitate immediate RRT to treat life-threatening complications: severe hyperkalemia unresponsive to standard medical treatment, severe metabolic acidosis not correctable by bicarbonate infusion (or by ventilatory compensation), refractory fluid overload unresponsive to diuretics leading to pulmonary edema, and specific uremic complications, such as encephalopathy or pericarditis. In the absence of these emergencies, a delayed RRT initiation strategy based on close clinical and biological monitoring should be preferred. Indeed, large RCTs (AKIKI, IDEAL-ICU, and STARRT-AKI) have demonstrated that an early RRT initiation strategy (i.e. starting RRT before the occurrence of life-threatening complication) does not improve survival and may impair renal recovery. Notably, around 40% of patients managed with a delayed strategy never required RRT. However, excessive delays (more than 3 days of oligo-anuria or a serum urea concentration above 40 mmol/L) are associated with increased mortality, as highlighted in the AKIKI-2 study. Therefore, the current standard of care supports a prudent, indication-driven initiation of RRT, balancing the need to avoid both unnecessary procedures and harmful delays. Personalized approaches are under investigation.

Although the definition of renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is simple, understanding the physiologic basis underlying the various types of this clinical entity is much more difficult. The pathophysiology of this disorder is reviewed using the normal acid-base functions of the involved segments of the nephron as a guide to understanding. Clinical and laboratory features of the subtypes of RTA are addressed, and diagnosis and treatment discussed. New developments in the knowledge and understanding of the associated growth disturbances, mineral metabolism, and molecular biology of RTA are also reviewed to provide the most current view of this relatively common pediatric entity.

### The challenges of managing distal renal tubular acidosis in pregnant patients with primary Sjögren's disease [^117McPeH]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Given the growing awareness of renal involvement in pSjD, further research is needed to define optimal treatment strategies, especially in pregnant patients, improve maternal-fetal outcomes and inform future clinical guidelines for this complex and understudied population.

Learning points

Primary Sjögren's disease (pSjD) can first present during pregnancy, sometimes with distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) and electrolyte disturbances. This case is unique in the fact that pSjD was diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy with sicca symptoms, low HCO3, and low K suggestive of hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis/dRTA.
Management of pSjD with dRTA in a pregnant patient may require potassium/bicarbonate supplementation and immunosuppression, with azathioprine as a steroid-sparing option when renal function worsens on prednisone taper. However, there is an overall lack of evidence-based recommendations on management and data on pregnancy outcomes in this population. Further research is needed to guide monitoring and management of dRTA in pregnant patients with pSjD.
Pregnancy worsens dRTA given physiological changes to renal perfusion.
With timely recognition and multidisciplinary care, favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes are possible even in complicated pregnancies.
Hydroxychloroquine is recommended in all pregnant women with anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB antibodies, with strongest evidence for reducing recurrence of cardiac neonatal lupus in those with a previously affected pregnancy.

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^11494PBZ]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have reviewed the recent clinical data on epidemiology and management of metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis is common in the ICU, and even moderate metabolic acidosis carries higher mortality than severe sepsis. Sodium bicarbonate or RRT is used occasionally to normalize acid–base imbalance due to metabolic acidosis in the ICU; however, high-quality evidence is still limited. Patients with severe metabolic acidosis and stage 2 or 3 AKI might be a possible target population for sodium bicarbonate administration. Further clinical trials are required to provide more robust information in a clinically relevant patient population.

Agenda for future research

Recent clinical research, including large RCTs, has provided new evidence and advanced our understanding of the management of metabolic acidosis. However, high-quality data from rigorous clinical research to guide standard practice are still lacking. Research priorities include the following:
The benefits and harms of sodium bicarbonate on cardiovascular function
Sodium bicarbonate not only for severe metabolic acidosis but for moderate metabolic acidosis
Sodium bicarbonate for severe metabolic acidosis with stage 2 or 3 AKI (BICARICU-2, identifier NCT04010630, in progress).

KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) guideline states that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are "appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials", but concludes "there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States". The panel "generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI", while emphasizing "the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations" and "the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI". For clinical context, AKI "represents the sudden loss of kidney function, generally occurring over the course of hours to days and resulting in the retention of metabolic waste products and the development of volume overload and electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities".

### Indications and timing of renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury [^116gfQtN]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The optimal timing for initiation of renal replacement therapy in patients with acute kidney injury remains uncertain. Conventionally accepted indications include volume overload, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, overt uremia, and even progressive azotemia in the absence of specific symptoms; however, precise definitions for these indications are lacking. Data from recent observational trials have suggested that early initiation of renal replacement therapy may be associated with decreased mortality; however, the results of these studies are inconclusive. Existing data on timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury that guide current clinical practice are summarized and issues that need to be addressed in future clinical trials are discussed.

### Does correction of metabolic acidosis slow chronic kidney disease progression? [^116h875H]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Most patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), despite current treatment practices. Recent studies support that dietary acid reduction with oral sodium based alkali or base-inducing food types add kidney protection to that provided by current kidney-protective interventions. Related studies also support that correction of metabolic acidosis with dietary acid reduction slows CKD progression. We reviewed these recent studies that show improvement in CKD parameters and slower CKD progression in response to improvement of CKD-associated metabolic acidosis with these interventions.

Recent Findings

Animal as well as human models of CKD show that alkali treatment ameliorates indices of kidney injury and also might slow GFR decline in patients with or without metabolic acidosis. These benefits have been similar with oral sodium-based alkali and base-inducing fruits and vegetables, supporting dietary acid reduction as an effective adjunct to conventional kidney-protective interventions.

Summary

Recent studies suggest that metabolic acidosis mediates nephropathy progression, and its treatment with the comparatively inexpensive and well tolerated intervention of dietary acid reduction holds promise to be an additional kidney-protective strategy in CKD management.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 2. causes and treatment [^114iHNUk]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The correct identification of the cause, and ideally the individual acid, responsible for metabolic acidosis in the critically ill ensures rational management. In Part 2 of this review, we examine the elevated (corrected) anion gap acidoses (lactic, ketones, uraemic and toxin ingestion) and contrast them with nonelevated conditions (bicarbonate wasting, renal tubular acidoses and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia) using readily available base excess and anion gap techniques. The potentially erroneous interpretation of elevated lactate signifying cell ischaemia is highlighted. We provide diagnostic and therapeutic guidance when faced with a high anion gap acidosis, for example pyroglutamate, in the common clinical scenario 'I can't identify the acid — but I know it's there'. The evidence that metabolic acidosis affects outcomes and thus warrants correction is considered and we provide management guidance including extracorporeal removal and fomepizole therapy.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^1163pb5q]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendation

Urinary alkalinization with bicarbonate does not improve patient-centered outcomes in patients with rhabdomyolysis and is not recommended based on the available evidence (Level of evidence: A). It is uncertain whether patients with severe metabolic acidosis from rhabdomyolysis would benefit from a resuscitation strategy including sodium bicarbonate as a resuscitation fluid based on the available evidence.

NAGMA

NAGMA occurs by direct loss of bicarbonate in the gastrointestinal or urinary systems, direct or indirect chloride administration, or impaired ammonia excretion with chronic kidney disease. The role of bicarbonate therapy in NAGMA depends largely on the mechanism by which the acidosis occurred. Renal tubular acidosis may cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate concentration by inadequate proton excretion in the distal tubules (type 1), inadequate bicarbonate resorption in the proximal tubules (type 2), or reduced sodium resorption in the collecting ducts (type 4), which causes hyperkalemia and hyponatremia in addition to NAGMA. Direct loss of bicarbonate in the gastrointestinal or urinary systems most often occurs through secretory diarrhea, enteric fistulae, or ureteroileostomy. Concomitant hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and volume depletion may occur. Hyponatremia and decreased extracellular fluid volume stimulate the renal retention of both Na + and Cl −. Retained Cl − replaces the lost HCO 3 −, generating a relative excess of chloride. Chloride administration may occur directly, through volume resuscitation with Cl − -rich normal saline, or indirectly, through administration of total parenteral nutrition, which contains metabolic precursors to hydrochloric acid. Importantly, mortality rates associated with NAGMA, particularly those from administration of chloride-rich solutions, are lower than those with AGMA. In addition, there are no available randomized controlled studies to direct the initiation and dosing of bicarbonate therapy in critical NAGMA. However, there is a strong physiologic rationale to replace the lost bicarbonate, which is why this is often recommended and likely why RCTs do not exist.

Recommendation

Sodium bicarbonate supplementation is indicated in cases with severe NAGMA (Level of evidence: B).

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^1147SnGX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Metabolic acidosis in CKD — practice points, treatment thresholds, and dietary guidance are as follows: Practice Point 3.10.1 states to consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary intervention to prevent development of acidosis with potential clinical implications (e.g., bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l in adults). Practice Point 3.10.2 advises monitoring to ensure therapy does not result in serum bicarbonate concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal and does not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, or fluid status. The KDOQI Work Group agrees that acidosis in adults should only be treated with pharmacologic agents when bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l or if there is a clear indication to do so, and notes a large clinical trial of veverimer did not demonstrate a decline in a composite CKD progression outcome. Pediatric clinicians may choose to treat milder acidosis more aggressively to help optimize growth and bone health.

### Optimising the timing of renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury [^115iSeg4]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Initiation of organ support therapy is a complex decision integral to practice in the intensive care unit (ICU). Such decisions extend beyond whether these therapies simply normalise relevant physiological parameters and include triage, prognostication and resource allocation, as well as an assessment of the potential for the intervention to cause more harm than benefit in individual patients. When considering renal replacement therapy (RRT) for acute kidney injury (AKI), critical care physicians are required to balance the hazards of starting too early, risking patient exposure to an unnecessary therapy with its attendant complications and costs, against the potential life-threatening harm of initiating too late.

In certain circumstances, decision making is relatively clear. There is little doubt RRT should be started promptly in the presence of life-threatening indications (hyperkalaemia, severe metabolic acidosis, pulmonary oedema, certain drug toxicities), and it is equally clear that RRT is not necessary when these indications are absent and there is evidence of recovery from AKI. RRT is also inappropriate when it is incompatible with patient preferences and treatment goals. However, many critically ill patients continue to meet AKI criteria without developing either an indication for urgent dialysis or evidence of imminent recovery. For these patients, clinicians face a difficult question. Should RRT be initiated early, risking over-treatment, or should it be delayed as long as possible, potentially prolonging exposure to fluid overload and solute imbalance? Five important studies over the past 5 years have attempted to address this question.

### Fludrocortisone therapy for persistent hyperkalaemia [^115jzjnH]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Type 4 renal tubular acidosis causes hyperkalaemia, for which diabetes and medications commonly used in this patient group are aetiological factors. Here we describe the novel use of fludrocortisone in this difficult condition.

Case Report

A 55-year-old woman with complex co-morbidities, including Type 2 diabetes (HbA 1c 37 mmol/mol 5.5%), was admitted with renal failure. Bloods on admission: eGFR 25 ml/min, creatinine 184 ?mol/L, urea 35.9 mmol/L, sodium 128 mmol/L, potassium 5.6 mmol/L, bicarbonate 15 mmol/L, and albumin 30 g/L. Her admission was prolonged, complicated by hospital-acquired sepsis (lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, and infected leg ulcers), poor venous access and severe depression. She had recurrent hyperkalaemia and deteriorating renal function, from presumed Type 4 renal tubular acidosis and excessive fluid losses from leg ulcers. Her renal function recurrently deteriorated, despite conventional treatment methods. After 69 days, she was commenced on fludrocortisone 50 mcg/day. Her renal function and serum potassium stabilized and she was discharged with potassium 4.3 mmol/L, eGFR 42 ml/min, and bicarbonate 23 mmol/L. She has remained stable on this treatment, without requiring further hospital admission for over 6 months, with eGFR 40 ml/min, and potassium 5.5 mmol/L, and albumin 26 g/L.

Conclusion

This woman was presumed to have Type 4 renal tubular acidosis and recurrent hyperkalaemia due to renal insufficiency, in the context of underlying diabetes and chronic kidney disease, which was poorly responsive to conventional management. There is limited evidence for using fludrocortisone in this setting. Our case suggests that fludrocortisone might offer a novel therapeutic strategy when conventional management is not working.

### Chronic kidney disease-part 2: management and its complications [^114kP1bb]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to the multifaceted aspects of kidney function, the management of CKD not only requires knowledge of kidney physiology and pathophysiology but also a keen understanding of how to diagnose, treat, and monitor the metabolic derangements and complications of reduced kidney function. In this article, we provide questions that cover a broad range of clinical scenarios that may test the clinical acumen of a kidney health professional. Each question starts with a brief clinical scenario to guide the reader. Questions are followed by a selection of answers. As in most clinical situations, a variety of tests and/or interventions may be appropriate. As knowledge on the management of kidney diseases and associated complications evolve, the optimal choice for these questions may also evolve.

### Chronic kidney disease and dietary measures to improve outcomes [^112kiRbt]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is an ongoing deterioration of renal function that often progresses to end-stage renal disease. Management goals in children include slowing disease progression, prevention and treatment of complications, and optimizing growth, development, and quality of life. Nutritional management is critically important to achieve these goals. Control of blood pressure, proteinuria, and metabolic acidosis with dietary and pharmacologic measures may slow progression of chronic kidney disease. Although significant progress in management has been made, further research is required to resolve many outstanding controversies. We review recent developments in pediatric chronic kidney disease, focusing on dietary measures to improve outcomes.

### The challenges of managing distal renal tubular acidosis in pregnant patients with primary Sjögren's disease [^116Xxsfz]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosing dRTA during pregnancy presents unique challenges due to physiological alterations in renal function, which can obscure traditional markers of disease activity. Serum creatinine is often unreliable as a marker of renal function in pregnancy, given the normal increase in GFR that may mask early renal dysfunction. Alternative approaches to monitoring disease activity include serial assessment of bicarbonate and potassium levels, urinary acidification tests to evaluate the ability of the kidneys to acidify urine and fetal growth monitoring through ultrasound, given the established link between maternal metabolic acidosis and intrauterine growth restriction. Renal biopsy remains the gold standard for confirming TIN in pSjD but poses unique challenges in pregnancy due to maternal and fetal physiologic changes, increasing the risk of retroperitoneal and perirenal haematoma requiring transfusion, placental abruption or preterm delivery (after 20 weeks' gestation) and difficulty positioning the patient in later stages of pregnancy. When performed, histopathologic findings in pSjD-associated TIN typically reveal marked interstitial lymphocytic infiltration, with predominant CD4+ T cells and lesser populations of CD8+ T cells.

There is currently no robust, evidence-based consensus on the management of pSjD, particularly in the setting of dRTA during pregnancy. Most existing recommendations are based on expert opinion, small randomised trials or extrapolated data from other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Symptomatic therapies for sicca symptoms, such as muscarinic agonists and topical cyclosporine, are supported by randomised controlled trials. However, the role of systemic immunosuppressants and biologics remains unclear, with trials of hydroxychloroquine and rituximab showing limited efficacy in alleviating sicca symptoms or fatigue. Despite this, hydroxychloroquine is well established for reducing the risk of neonatal lupus, particularly congenital heart block, and is recommended during pregnancy. The 2020 EULAR guidelines advise tailoring systemic treatment based on organ involvement and EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) scores. For renal involvement, recommendations include correction of electrolyte imbalances and immunosuppression with agents such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or cyclosporine, though comparative data are lacking. No specific guidelines exist for managing dRTA in pregnant patients with pSjD, and treatment decisions must weigh maternal disease activity against fetal safety. In our case, management followed the 2020 American College of Rheumatology Reproductive Health Guidelines, which support the use of hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine as safe options in pregnancy. Azathioprine was selected as a steroid-sparing agent for its efficacy in controlling disease activity while minimising the risks associated with prolonged glucocorticoid use.

### Renal tubular acidosis with hyperchloremic acidosis: harmless with a sting? [^111jJw2J]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Brunner et al. showed a higher than previously described prevalence of renal tubular acidosis (RTA) in critically ill patients with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (HMA). They elegantly demonstrated that this condition often remains unrecognized owing to the simultaneous presence of metabolic alkalosis, mainly attributed to low plasma albumin levels, and was not associated with increased morbidity or mortality. HMA was thought to result from altered renal chloride handling as seen in RTA and was considered a nonharmful physiological response.

In contrast with the study of Brunner et al. HMA is most often exogenously induced by too liberal infusion of chloride-containing intravenous fluids for hydration and resuscitation purposes. HMA indeed has no proven impact on ICU and hospital mortality but may precipitate acute kidney injury. It could be assumed that a combination of HMA and RTA only guarantees a relatively stable but fragile acid–base equilibrium with preserved renal function provided the external chloride load remains limited. Excess or overzealous administration of chloride may well precipitate or exacerbate acute kidney injury in these patients. Conversely, early identification of the HMA/RTA combination strongly pleads against a liberal chloride infusion policy and may eventually offer kidney protection!

### Metabolic alkalosis treatment standard [^114J8fm2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The kidney is poised to defend against development of metabolic alkalosis through non-adaptive mechanisms in the proximal nephron and adaptive processes in the distal nephron. Despite a prodigious capacity to excrete base, metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disturbance in hospitalized patients. Development of this disorder requires pathophysiologic changes leading to generation of new HCO3- combined with an augmentation in the capacity of the kidney to reclaim filtered HCO3-. The initial approach to these patients is careful assessment of effective arterial blood volume focusing on the physical examination and urine electrolytes. Identifying the mechanisms by which the kidney's ability to correct alkalosis are perturbed provides an understanding of the clinical approach to differential diagnosis and appropriate treatment. While metabolic alkalosis is frequently not dangerous, in certain settings, metabolic alkalosis may contribute to mortality and should be aggressively managed.

### Renal tubular acidosis in the neonate [^113s7jPo]. NeoReviews (2024). Medium credibility.

See Bonus NeoBriefs videos and downloadable teaching slides Metabolic acidosis can manifest in the neonatal period and cause significant morbidity and mortality in neonates. Preterm infants are at an even higher risk of developing metabolic acidosis. If the acidosis results from a dysfunction of acid-base homeostasis by the renal system, the disorder is known as renal tubular acidosis (RTA). In this review, we will describe renal development and normal acid-base homeostasis by the renal system. We will also discuss the pathophysiology of the different types of RTA, laboratory findings to aid in diagnosis, and treatment considerations. Understanding RTA will help neonatal clinicians recognize and diagnose an infant affected by RTA and initiate treatment in a timely manner.

### Optimal management of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients with invasive fungal infections being treated with liposomal amphotericin B [^113zbdpx]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

There is a long-standing recognition of the high risk of AKI in patients treated with conventional amphotericin B. In a large retrospective analysis carried out in 494 adult inpatients, 28% developed nephrotoxicity, defined as either a ≥ 50% increase from baseline or doubling of serum creatinine levels. Liposomal amphotericin B is substantially less nephrotoxic than conventional amphotericin B; a meta-analysis reported nephrotoxicity incidence rates of 14.5% and 32.5%, respectively. These differences in nephrotoxicity may reflect both the distribution and structure of the drugs; for example, liposomal amphotericin B does not contain deoxycholate, which can cause direct renal tubular toxicity. Additionally, liposomal amphotericin B has been successfully used to treat IFIs in critically ill patients with impaired renal function at treatment initiation without adverse impact on renal function, as measured by serum creatinine levels.

Patients with AKI who are receiving liposomal amphotericin B, or indeed any other drug with a potential effect on renal tubular function, should receive high-quality supportive care to maintain or restore the function of the distal tubular cells of the kidney. Optimal management of fluid balance and electrolytes and acid – base status is required. All electrolytes that are regulated by the renal tubules should be monitored and replaced if below the normal range. It is important to replace all depleted electrolytes as, for example, replacement of potassium in a patient who is hypomagnesaemic and/or hypophosphataemic (or vice versa) without replacing magnesium and/or phosphate will not help the underlying tubular deficit. Metabolic acidosis can be corrected through the administration of bicarbonate, which is best given as an isotonic solution. With accurate monitoring and supplementation, the majority of patients should be able to continue on their course of liposomal amphotericin B.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^1164os86]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline suggested initiating RRT emergently in the presence of life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base balance. Since 2012, data from several RCTs and observational studies have become available. However, the optimal timing for acute RRT remains unknown. It has been proposed that initiation of RRT should be considered when metabolic and fluid demands exceed the kidney's capacity to meet them. – This concept acknowledges the dynamic nature of acute illness and stresses the importance of regular evaluation of the demand and renal capacity relationship. However, the exact methods for determining demand and capacity are unknown. Existing evidence does not support using biomarkers when deciding whether to initiate RRT. Use of a standardized FST can be considered in AKI, to further quantify the likelihood of AKI progression, and integrated into the spectrum of clinical information available when planning for and deciding to initiate RRT. In determining whether or not to start RRT, risk of complications, global prognosis, potential for recovery, and patient preferences should be considered (Figure 3). Although some regions of the globe have challenges and constraints in providing universal access to RRT, we recommend a similar approach be undertaken for considering for whom and when to start RRT in all regions. – Additionally, a similar approach should be undertaken in both intensive care unit and non–intensive care unit settings.

### Metabolic acidosis in CKD: core curriculum 2019 [^111hy9Zi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Maintenance of normal acid-base homeostasis is one of the most important kidney functions. In chronic kidney disease, the capacity of the kidneys to excrete the daily acid load as ammonium and titratable acid is impaired, resulting in acid retention and metabolic acidosis. The prevalence of metabolic acidosis increases with declining glomerular filtration rate. Metabolic acidosis is associated with several clinically important complications, including chronic kidney disease progression, bone demineralization, skeletal muscle catabolism, and mortality. To mitigate these adverse consequences, clinical practice guidelines suggest treating metabolic acidosis with oral alkali in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, large clinical trials to determine the efficacy and safety of correcting metabolic acidosis with oral alkali in patients with chronic kidney disease have yet to be conducted. In this Core Curriculum article, established and emerging concepts regarding kidney acid-base regulation and the pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnosis, and management of metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease are discussed.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^112TJxzN]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical evidence supporting the use of loop diuretics in this setting is sparse and composed primarily of case reports. As such, it cannot be interpreted with any confidence. Although loop diuretics have been shown to reduce metabolic demand and oxygen consumption by the proximal tubular cells, they have also been shown to worsen renal afferent arteriole vasoconstriction, acidify urine, and promote aggregation of the Tamm-Horsfall protein within the tubular lumen. Taken together, the pathophysiologic consequences of loop diuretics may potentiate precipitation of myoglobin and worsen the distal tubular obstruction. Additionally, hypokalemia due to loop diuretic use has been reported to result in hypokalemic myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.

What electrolyte abnormalities should be expected and what are the optimal methods for management?

Recommendation

Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia are electrolyte abnormalities most commonly encountered when treating rhabdomyolysis. Correcting biochemical equilibrium and electrolytes during rhabdomyolysis should proceed meticulously to avoid complications from treatment. Hyperkalemia is the electrolyte abnormality that requires timely correction to reduce risk of cardiac arrhythmia.

### Optimising the timing of renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury [^1146FXbB]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Incorporating all these studies into clinical practice, we conclude that RRT can be safely deferred for up to 72 h in patients with KDIGO stage 3 AKI, provided the clinician is still uncertain as to whether RRT is inevitable, no life-threatening indication develops, and BUN remains < 112 mg/dL (Urea < 40 mmol/L). During this 72-h period of watchful waiting, management decisions should focus on enhancing the opportunity of AKI recovery. Cardiac output should be optimised, taking care to avoid excessive fluid resuscitation and hyperchloraemia. Venous congestion may decrease the pressure gradient across the glomerulus, while chloride-rich fluids may decrease renal perfusion and worsen acidosis. Vasopressors should be used if mean arterial pressure (MAP) is consistently less than 65 mmHg, and thoughtful consideration should be given to higher MAP targets (80–85 mmHg) in patients with chronic hypertension, although recent evidence did not show improved renal outcomes with higher MAP targets in this cohort unless they were treated with angiotensin II receptor blockers prior to ICU admission. More studies to inform, define and personalise ICU MAP targets are still required. Drug choices should avoid classes frequently associated with nephrotoxic side effects unless the therapeutic benefit outweighs the potential for harm, and drug dosing should consider the impact of impaired renal clearance, particularly for antibiotics.

Despite these studies, critical care physicians are still called to exercise good clinical judgement when determining the best timing of RRT initiation in any given patient. Incipient renal failure cannot be seen in isolation and an assessment of organ dysfunction in other systems must be factored into decisions surrounding the initiation of RRT. For example, fluid overload will be less well tolerated in patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome, as will metabolic acidosis contributing to ventilator dysynchrony. When deferring RRT, clinicians should remain vigilant for the development of urgent indications. In the expectant arm of STARRT-AKI, over 60% of patients were commenced on RRT because of metabolic acidosis or hypoxemia due to fluid overload, perhaps partly explaining why the median time to dialysis was only 31 h, despite the protocol to wait for 72 h.

### Mechanistic insights into the primary and secondary alterations of renal ion and water transport in the distal nephron [^114r5kNT]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic section

Advances in the understanding of these transport alterations have helped inform optimal management of patients. This is well illustrated by the specific blocking of ENaC by amiloride, for instance, in the treatment of Liddle syndrome — due to primary hyperactivation of ENaC — or lithium‐induced NDI — due to lithium entry in the PC via ENaC. Conversely, in mutations of 11βHSD2, management is based on MR antagonism, as excessive cortisol activates MR in PC. Experimental data have also opened potential therapeutic avenues, for example, in nephrotic syndrome. As stated above, salt retention is not exclusively driven by aldosterone‐mediated MR activation, or downstream by direct activation of ENaC. As a matter of fact, MR antagonists and amiloride have shown inconsistent efficacy in the treatment of edema during nephrotic syndrome. In this view, the identification of ASIC2a as a key contributor paves the way to new therapeutic targets. Finally, blocking vasopressin signaling has not only proven to be efficient in reducing cyst growth in PKD, but might also be a promising strategy in the prevention of renal function decline in chronic kidney disease.

Deciphering the lines of communication between PC and IC has helped unravel the common association of water, electrolyte, and acid–base imbalances (summarized in Table 1). These findings also contribute to improvement in therapeutic strategies in patients with these disorders. As such, salt management (restriction or supplementation) is often mandatory to treat potassium defects and hypokalemia should be treated to restore urine concentrating ability. Although not fully established, previous reports have suggested that alkalinization per se should reverse hypokalemia during dRTA, as acidosis increases distal delivery of Na +, further aggravating hypokalemia. Taken together, the understanding of the pathophysiological processes resulting in water, electrolyte, or acid–base disorders should be considered as a prerequisite to their management and treatment.

### Sodium bicarbonate supplements for treating acute kidney injury [^111ev3et]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, serious, but potentially treatable condition. Because AKI is often associated with acidosis, it has become common practice to recommend administration of sodium bicarbonate to correct acid imbalance.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of the use of sodium bicarbonate for people with AKI. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcome measures were patients' need for renal replacement therapy; return to baseline kidney function; and overall survival.

Search Methods

In November 2011 we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register using keywords relevant to this review. The register is populated using searches of Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE and handsearching records from renal-related journals and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the use of sodium bicarbonate supplements, administered by any route, for the treatment of adults with AKI were to be included. The search strategy did not restrict inclusion based on an upper age limit or publication language. We did not consider inclusion of studies that investigated use of sodium bicarbonate for AKI prevention.

Data Collection and Analysis

All authors planned to independently assess and extracted information. Information was to be collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes. Results were to be expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or as mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Although our literature search identified four studies, none of these met our predetermined selection criteria. Hence, no suitable studies were identified for inclusion in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no RCT evidence - supportive or otherwise - for the use of sodium bicarbonate for people with AKI. We concluded that there is an urgent need for well conducted RCTs in this area.

### Initiation strategies for renal-replacement therapy in the intensive care unit [^114d2Dgv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

The timing of renal-replacement therapy in critically ill patients who have acute kidney injury but no potentially life-threatening complication directly related to renal failure is a subject of debate.

Methods

In this multicenter randomized trial, we assigned patients with severe acute kidney injury (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] classification, stage 3 [stages range from 1 to 3, with higher stages indicating more severe kidney injury]) who required mechanical ventilation, catecholamine infusion, or both and did not have a potentially life-threatening complication directly related to renal failure to either an early or a delayed strategy of renal-replacement therapy. With the early strategy, renal-replacement therapy was started immediately after randomization. With the delayed strategy, renal-replacement therapy was initiated if at least one of the following criteria was met: severe hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, blood urea nitrogen level higher than 112 mg per deciliter, or oliguria for more than 72 hours after randomization. The primary outcome was overall survival at day 60.

Results

A total of 620 patients underwent randomization. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality at day 60 did not differ significantly between the early and delayed strategies; 150 deaths occurred among 311 patients in the early-strategy group (48.5%; 95% confidence interval, 42.6 to 53.8), and 153 deaths occurred among 308 patients in the delayed-strategy group (49.7%, 95% CI, 43.8 to 55.0; P = 0.79). A total of 151 patients (49%) in the delayed-strategy group did not receive renal-replacement therapy. The rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections was higher in the early-strategy group than in the delayed-strategy group (10% vs. 5%, P = 0.03). Diuresis, a marker of improved kidney function, occurred earlier in the delayed-strategy group (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In a trial involving critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury, we found no significant difference with regard to mortality between an early and a delayed strategy for the initiation of renal-replacement therapy. A delayed strategy averted the need for renal-replacement therapy in an appreciable number of patients. (Funded by the French Ministry of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01932190.).

### Metabolic acidosis [^115VvaKe]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common disorder that occurs in a variety of clinical settings. The kidney maintains acid-base homeostasis through the elimination of protons and reabsorption/generation of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis develops when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or impaired, in situations such as rapid production of nonvolatile acids, abnormally high bicarbonate losses, and impaired acid excretion by the kidney. Determining the presence or absence of an anion gap is the first step in ascertaining the etiology of metabolic acidosis. The presence or absence of an osmolal gap, urine pH, and serum potassium levels may be useful in certain settings. We discuss a comprehensive approach to metabolic acidosis and present important clinical scenarios.

### Management of urolithiasis with chronic renal failure [^112f4qFz]. Current Opinion in Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Epidemiological trends of urolithiasis and the prevalence of renal failure in patients with stones have changed. This is the era of minimally invasive therapy for stone disease. We review the impact of minimally invasive therapy on the management of urolithiasis in patients with renal failure and its outcome.

Recent Findings

The prevalence of urolithiasis has reached its peak and plateaued in Europe and North America while it is still rising in the underdeveloped countries. The prevalence of renal failure in patients with chronic renal failure has reduced by half over the last decade. Minimally invasive therapy like percutaneous nephrolithotripsy has fared better than open stone surgery in all respects. Patients with kidney stones do not have normal renal function. Recently, cystine stones, and stones in patients with renal tubular acidosis and bowel disease were shown to affect renal function significantly.

Summary

Management of stones in chronic renal failure is challenging. Efforts should be made to minimize renal injury. Once a 'stone-free' kidney is achieved, steps should be taken to conserve renal function and address the issue of recurrence.

Treatments for hyperkalaemia include dietary restriction, correction of acidosis, increasing distal sodium load, and loop diuretics, and in the case of hypokalaemia, potassium-sparing diuretics and potassium supplements could be used. It may be possible to reduce the dose or stop drugs that interfere with potassium homeostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, calcineurin inhibitors, and non-selective beta blockers. Pharmacologic treatments for managing hyperkalaemia include the cation-exchange resin kayaexalate, calcium-resin resonium, the potassium-binding polymer patiromer, and the potassium trap ZS-9. Beyond the treatment of hyperkalaemia, these agents might also enable more patients with concomitant CKD to be started on or maintained on guideline-recommended renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, and this possibility is currently being investigated. In addition to reducing serum potassium, patiromer has been shown to reduce serum aldosterone levels in patients with CKD and hyperkalaemia taking RAAS inhibitors. Other important questions regarding potassium binders relate to their safety and efficacy in post-kidney transplant patients, patients with Type IV renal tubular acidosis, or patients taking calcineurin inhibitors.

Data from three clinical trials have indicated that dual RAAS blockade therapy increases the risk of hyperkalaemia in patients with CKD. Meta-analysis data have indicated that mineralocorticoids can mediate hyperkalaemia in patients undergoing dialysis, but large trials are needed to better evaluate this process and its clinical significance. In patients with Type 2 diabetes, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor has been associated with small mean changes in serum electrolytes and less hyperkalaemia compared to placebo, especially in patients taking anti-hypertensives that interfere with potassium excretion.

Timing of initiation

Early CRRT initiation may not improve outcomes, and the definition of "early" varies between studies. Therefore, clinical judgement guides CRRT initiation. We aim to prevent or rapidly treat life-threatening derangements in fluid status, electrolytes, and/or acid–base balance and to meet metabolic and fluid needs that residual kidney function cannot address.

The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) has been much debated. Over the past five years several studies have provided new guidance for evidence-based decision-making. High-quality evidence now supports an approach of expectant management in critically ill patients with AKI, where RRT may be deferred up to 72 h unless a life-threatening indication develops. Nevertheless, physicians' judgment still plays a central role in identifying appropriate patients for expectant management.

### Clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease [^112naoeF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Metabolic acidosis arises from a fundamental disturbance of acid–base balance and is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Optimal cell, tissue and organ function requires the maintenance of hydrogen ion (H +) concentration within a physiologic range, which for serum is 35–45 nM (pH 7.46–7.35). The dynamic process leading to a net gain of H + in body fluids is called acidosis. When acidosis is due to a gain of 'fixed acid' H + (as opposed to the gain of 'volatile' H + because of accumulation of carbon dioxide gas, causing respiratory acidosis) and this H + gain decreases the metabolic component of the acid–base equilibrium, bicarbonate (HCO 3), it is called metabolic acidosis. If the amount or rate of added H + exceeds normal excretory capacity or if H + excretory capacity is reduced as in CKD with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), metabolic acidosis becomes chronic. Epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of metabolic acidosis is approximately 15–19% in CKD stage 3–5 patients, with metabolic acidosis affecting approximately 3 million patients with CKD in the United States.

### The challenges of managing distal renal tubular acidosis in pregnant patients with primary Sjögren's disease [^114hsCcu]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

We present a case of a pregnant woman in her 40 s diagnosed with primary Sjögren's disease (pSjD) complicated by distal type I renal tubular acidosis. At 12 weeks' gestation, she exhibited dry eyes, dry mouth and renal dysfunction for the first time. Electrolyte studies confirmed hyperchloraemic normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with elevated urine pH. Positive serologies included +ANA, +SSA and +RF. Schirmer's test was positive. Renal biopsy indicated chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with 40% interstitial fibrosis. Hydroxychloroquine and prednisone (60 mg daily) improved renal function, but rapid tapering led to mild worsening in renal function, sicca symptoms and fetal growth restriction. Steroid dose escalation and azathioprine initiation led to clinical improvements. At 35 weeks' gestation, she delivered preterm due to pre-eclampsia and intrahepatic cholestasis. The neonate had cutaneous neonatal lupus but was otherwise healthy. This case highlights the clinical complexity of managing distal renal tubular acidosis in pregnant patients with pSjD and the need for evidence-based treatment guidelines.

Renal tubular acidosis is a group of disorders in which there is metabolic acidosis due to defect in renal tubular acidification mechanism to maintain normal plasma bicarbonate and blood pH. Irrespective of organ system involved, oral cavity often reflects the disease occurring anywhere in the body. Thus congenital chronic renal diseases, causing acid-base disturbances affects development and structure of the teeth. Chronic renal tubular acidosis causes enamel defects, dental caries, oral candidiasis, angular cheilitis, etc. We hereby present an unusual case report of a 4-year-old boy suffering from renal tubular acidosis associated with rampant caries, whose full mouth rehabilitation has been done.

### Treatment and long-term outcome in primary distal renal tubular acidosis [^1178j3HW]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a rare disorder, and we aimed to gather data on treatment and long-term outcome.

Methods

We contacted paediatric and adult nephrologists through European professional organizations. Responding clinicians entered demographic, biochemical, genetic and clinical data in an online form.

Results

Adequate data were collected on 340 patients (29 countries, female 52%). Mutation testing had been performed on 206 patients (61%); pathogenic mutations were identified in 170 patients (83%). The median (range) presentation age was 0.5 (0–54) years and age at last follow-up was 11.0 (0–70.0) years. Adult height was slightly below average with a mean (SD score) of -0.57 (± 1.16). There was an increased prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage ≥ 2 in children (35%) and adults (82%). Nephrocalcinosis was reported in 88%. Nephrolithiasis was more common with SLC4A1 mutations (42% versus 21%). Thirty-six percent had hearing loss, particularly in ATP6V1B1 (88%). The median (interquartile range) prescribed dose of alkali (mEq/kg/day) was 1.9 (1.2–3.3). Adequate metabolic control (normal plasma bicarbonate and normocalciuria) was achieved in 158 patients (51%), more commonly in countries with higher gross domestic product (67% versus 23%), and was associated with higher height and estimated glomerular filtration rate.

Conclusion

Long-term follow-up from this large dRTA cohort shows an overall favourable outcome with normal adult height for most and no patient with CKD Stage 5. However, 82% of adult patients have CKD Stages 2–4. Importance of adequate metabolic control was highlighted by better growth and renal function but was achieved in only half of patients.

Future Directions

Although preservation of renal perfusion is fundamental to AKI prevention and management, the optimal strategy to ensure this remains unresolved. Ongoing research will provide insight into optimal (1) choice of vasopressors or inotropes, (2) fluid management, and (3) hemodynamic or oxygenation goals for targeted management, and will likely require a personalized or precision-medicine approach. In addition to understanding interventions to optimize renal perfusion, more research on the temporal relationship between each of these exposures and renal injury is necessary. For example, intraoperative hypotension has traditionally been evaluated over the entire course of the procedure. Future studies that employ a more nuanced definition for hypotension could overcome such limitations while providing insight into the specific mechanism and timing between perfusion and AKI. Furthermore, the risk–benefit balance between nephrotoxic exposures, like NSAIDs and intravascular contrast, remains an area of active research. The incidence of contrast-associated AKI and effective interventions in high-risk patients remain areas of controversy and active research. Advances in analytical and predictive algorithms, including machine-learning and clinical decision support, will enable more accurate prediction and stratification of patients at risk for AKI.

Many studies have focused on the serum creatinine–based diagnostic criteria, while less attention has been paid to prognostic implications and management of oliguria. Despite key limitations, serum creatinine remains the standard biomarker for AKI in perioperative practice. Advances in biomarkers may enable improved sensitivity, earlier detection, prognostic insight, and more precise classification. The management of AKI is largely supportive (prevent ongoing renal insult and optimize renal perfusion), with the optimal timing and indications for renal replacement therapy unresolved. Proposed treatments for AKI, including dopamine, fenoldopam, aspirin, steroids, and ischemic preconditioning, have not been found to alter the course of disease; however, prevention and treatment modalities remain key areas for future research.

ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS RELATING SERUM BICARBONATE INCREASE AND REDUCTION OF ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE DECLINE IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH ORAL BICARBONATE SUPPLEMENTATION

The findings of the above prospective studies and the association of better kidney outcomes with treatment of metabolic acidosis in CKD suggest a promising new approach to slowing disease progression, apart from current renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition therapy. There is a clear medical need for new therapies for CKD. In view of this need, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has considered new recommendations for kidney outcome measures used in the evaluation of new therapies. The FDA accepts a 57% decline in eGFR, corresponding to a doubling of serum creatinine, as an endpoint for clinical trials of kidney disease progression because it represents a marked loss of kidney function that is predictive of eventual kidney failure. Recent initiatives coordinated by the National Kidney Foundation and the FDA are evaluating alternative endpoints to shorten the duration of clinical trials, reduce sample size, and include patients with earlier stages of CKD. Based on a series of meta-analyses of cohorts and clinical trials, as well as simulations of trial designs and analytic methods, these efforts have shown that an eGFR decline of 40% is an acceptable surrogate endpoint to assess treatment effects of new therapies designed to slow CKD progression. It is instructive then to see how this endpoint might be used in light of the prospective studies reported above.

### Critical care nephrology: management of acid-base disorders with CRRT [^115LpL1Y]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Normal acid-base homeostasis is severely challenged in the intensive care setting. In this review, we address acid-base disturbances, with a special focus on the use of continuous (rather than intermittent) extracorporeal technologies in critical ill patients with acute kidney injury. We consider hypercapnic acidosis and lactic acidosis as examples in which continuous modalities may have different roles and indications than the traditional intermittent approaches to renal replacement therapy. Hypercapnic acidosis develops as a consequence of alveolar hypoventilation. In this condition, correction of pH above 7.2 is not currently recommended, and may even abrogate the beneficial effects of hypercapnic acidosis on overall outcomes. Extracorporeal technologies support lung protection while maintaining overall patient homeostasis. Similarly, in lactic acidosis, current evidence does not support bicarbonate infusions to correct acidosis. The management of lactic acidosis should correct the underlying causative disturbances. Most often, lactic acidosis is a biomarker denoting unfavorable outcomes, rather than an intrinsic pathogenetic mechanism. Extracorporeal procedures may assist in the removal of pathogenic drugs or toxins, as well as partially correcting acidemia. Whether or not these approaches will permit normalization of systemic pH, and the impact of these approaches on patient outcomes, needs to be addressed with prospective controlled trials.

### The challenges of managing distal renal tubular acidosis in pregnant patients with primary Sjögren's disease [^1161s4zS]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

While cardiac neonatal lupus was not observed in our patient, maternal anti-Ro/SSA antibodies in pSjD are well-known to confer fetal risk, reinforcing the importance of multidisciplinary care with fetal echocardiography and serial monitoring. The ACR conditionally recommends hydroxychloroquine for all pregnant women with anti-Ro/SSA antibodies and/or anti-La/SSB antibodies to reduce the risk of congenital heart block. Evidence is strongest for its use in secondary prevention, where hydroxychloroquine has been shown to lower the risk of recurrence of congenital heart block in pregnant women with a previously affected pregnancy.

This case underscores the unique challenges of managing dRTA in pregnant patients with pSjD, particularly given the paucity of literature on this subject. Pregnancy exacerbates dRTA due to physiological renal adaptations, necessitating careful monitoring and individualized treatment strategies. The absence of standardised treatment guidelines necessitates a case-by-case approach, integrating maternal disease severity, fetal health considerations and available safety data on immunosuppressive therapy. This case highlights the successful use of azathioprine as a steroid-sparing agent in pregnancy, demonstrating its potential role in mitigating renal inflammation. Our case highlights the successful use of azathioprine as a steroid-sparing agent during pregnancy to initially mitigate renal inflammation. However, azathioprine has been associated with increased risk of ICP, a complication also observed in our patient. Whether this was directly attributable to azathioprine or a consequence of pregnancy alone remains uncertain. Nevertheless, its association with ICP emphasizes the pressing need for safe and effective immunosuppressive options in pregnant patients with pSjD.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^1114idjz]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

We recommend that non-selective renal tubular phosphate wasting (which suggests renal Fanconi syndrome) should be excluded by looking for abnormal bicarbonate, amino acid, glucose and/or uric acid losses in urines and low molecular mass proteinuria (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We recommend confirming the clinical diagnosis of XLH by genetic analysis of the PHEX gene in children and adults if feasible (grade B, moderate recommendation)
If genetic analysis is not available, elevated plasma levels of intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and/or a positive family history for XLH support the diagnosis (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We recommend other causes of hereditary or acquired hypophosphataemia be considered if analysis of the PHEX gene yield a negative result for XLH (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We recommend genetic counselling be offered to patients with XLH, especially at the transition from child to adult care and to families planning pregnancies (grade C, moderate recommendation)
Methods for detecting PHEX mutations can be applied to preimplantation genetic diagnosis or prenatal diagnosis. However, recommendations should be adapted to country-specific ethical and legal standards and communicated using appropriate genetic counselling (grade D, weak recommendation)
We recommend a further work-up after diagnosis including investigations aimed at diagnosing the presence and severity of common and rare complications of the disease summarized in Table 1 (grade C, moderate recommendation)

### Gitelman syndrome: consensus and guidance from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^113mScTR]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

Gitelman syndrome (GS) is a rare, salt-losing tubulopathy characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. The disease is recessively inherited, caused by inactivating mutations in the SLC12A3 gene that encodes the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC). GS is usually detected during adolescence or adulthood, either fortuitously or in association with mild or nonspecific symptoms or both. The disease is characterized by high phenotypic variability and a significant reduction in the quality of life, and it may be associated with severe manifestations. GS is usually managed by a liberal salt intake together with oral magnesium and potassium supplements. A general problem in rare diseases is the lack of high quality evidence to inform diagnosis, prognosis, and management. We report here on the current state of knowledge related to the diagnostic evaluation, follow-up, management, and treatment of GS; identify knowledge gaps; and propose a research agenda to substantiate a number of issues related to GS. This expert consensus statement aims to establish an initial framework to enable clinical auditing and thus improve quality control of care.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^113TW1ny]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The major renal response to metabolic acidosis is increased NH4 + excretion. Therefore, a UOG of less than 150 mosmol/kg in combination with a preserved renal function (glomerular filtration rate > 25 ml/min) represents an inadequate renal response and is characteristic for RTA, while a UOG of more than 150 mosmol/kg suggests extrarenal bicarbonate loss.

Subtypes of RTA were determined as follows:

RTA type I (distal): hyperchloremic acidosis with a minimum urine pH ≥ 5.3 and low/normal plasma potassium (< 5.5 mmol/L), based on reduced H + secretion in the distal tubule.

RTA type II (proximal): hyperchloremic acidosis with a minimum urine pH < 5.3 and low/normal plasma potassium (< 5.5 mmol/L), based on reduced HCO 3− reabsorption in the proximal tubule.

RTA type IV: hyperchloremic acidosis with a minimum urine pH < 5.3 and high plasma potassium (≥ 5.5 mmol/L), based on reduced H + and K + excretion in the distal tubule.

Transient RTA was defined as RTA on a single study day, while persistent RTA was defined as RTA on two or more days.

Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate the prevalence of RTA in critically ill patients during the first week after intensive care unit (ICU) admission, defined as hyperchloremic acidosis (BE Chloride) ≤ −5 mmol/L), a UOG of less than 150 mosmol/kg, and a preserved renal function. Secondary outcome measures were to evaluate the risk factors for RTA.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^113Ufgrd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Renal tubular acidosis

The combination of hyperkalemia and impaired renal acid excretion is termed type IV renal tubular acidosis. In 1970s–1990s, experiments in cultured cells, intact rodents, dogs and humans demonstrated that hyperkalemia can impair ammoniagenesis in the proximal renal tubule. Because net renal acid excretion is the sum of ammonium and titratable acid excretion minus bicarbonate excretion, this suggests that hyperkalemia per se could cause renal tubular acidosis. However, with otherwise normal renal and adrenal function, acid–base homoeostasis is maintained in hyperkalemia by compensatory mechanisms (largely driven by increased aldosterone production). Consequently, type IV RTA is invariably encountered clinically in the context of hypoaldosteronism, either true or functional.

Compelling evidence that hyperkalemia can cause renal tubular acidosis was recently obtained from a mouse model of PHAII. These mice carry a mutation that drives constitutive activation of the thiazide-sensitive co-transporter, NCC. They exhibited hyperkalemia, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and reduced urinary ammonia excretion, phenomena that were all corrected by dietary potassium restriction or thiazide administration. Furthermore, this model was exploited to determine the molecular mechanisms whereby hyperkalemia impairs renal ammonium excretion. Mice had reduced expression of ammoniagenic enzymes (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and phosphate-dependent glutaminase) and increased expression of an ammonia-recycling enzyme (glutamine synthetase) in the proximal tubule, changes that would be expected to result in reduced ammonia production. Expression of transport proteins in the collecting duct (Rhcg and H + -ATPase) was altered in a manner expected to reduce ammonia secretion into the urine. These molecular changes were also corrected when plasma [K +] was normalized with thiazide treatment.

### Potential benefits of alkali therapy to prevent GFR loss: time for a palatable' solution' for the management of CKD [^113EqQYN]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that alkali therapy can retard progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We summarize recent studies and discuss a mechanism whereby alkali therapy may neutralize acid production associated with typical Western diets, which generate acid. We emphasize the rationale for using alkali therapy early in the course of CKD, even in the absence of overt metabolic acidosis, and we urge the pharmaceutical industry to develop palatable alkali-containing solutions.

### Euglycemic ketoacidosis as a complication of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy [^1177Zei9]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are drugs designed to lower plasma glucose concentration by inhibiting Na + -glucose-coupled transport in the proximal tubule. Clinical trials demonstrate these drugs have favorable effects on cardiovascular outcomes to include slowing the progression of CKD. Although most patients tolerate these drugs, a potential complication is development of ketoacidosis, often with a normal or only a minimally elevated plasma glucose concentration. Inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 in the proximal tubule alters kidney ATP turnover so that filtered ketoacids are preferentially excreted as Na + or K + salts, leading to indirect loss of bicarbonate from the body and systemic acidosis under conditions of increased ketogenesis. Risk factors include reductions in insulin dose, increased insulin demand, metabolic stress, low carbohydrate intake, women, and latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood. The lack of hyperglycemia and nonspecific symptoms of ketoacidosis can lead to delays in diagnosis. Treatment strategies and various precautions are discussed that can decrease the likelihood of this complication.

### Protein-restricted diets plus keto / amino acids – a valid therapeutic approach for chronic kidney disease patients [^115jWfxS]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly common, and there is an increasing awareness that every strategy should be used to avoid complications of CKD. Restriction of dietary protein intake has been a relevant part of the management of CKD for more than 100 years, but even today, the principal goal of protein-restricted regimens is to decrease the accumulation of nitrogen waste products, hydrogen ions, phosphates, and inorganic ions while maintaining an adequate nutritional status to avoid secondary problems such as metabolic acidosis, bone disease, and insulin resistance, as well as proteinuria and deterioration of renal function. This supplement focuses on recent experimental and clinical findings related to an optimized dietary management of predialysis, dialysis, and transplanted patients as an important aspect of patient care. Nutritional treatment strategies are linked toward ameliorating metabolic and endocrine disturbances, improving/maintaining nutritional status, as well as delaying the renal replacement initiation and improving outcomes in CKD patients. A final consensus states that dietary manipulations should be considered as one of the main approaches in the management program of CKD patients and that a reasonable number of patients with moderate or severe CKD benefit from dietary protein/phosphorus restriction.

Proximal tubular dysfunction — serum and nonspecific indicators include electrolyte and acid–base patterns and limited-specificity urinary findings. Hypokalemia is defined as serum potassium concentration below laboratory reference range and trends are of more clinical relevance than single abnormal value, but it is neither sensitive nor specific. Low serum bicarbonate is defined as serum bicarbonate concentration below laboratory reference range and is nonspecific in the setting of reduced glomerular filtration rate. Hypophosphatemia is defined as serum phosphorous concentration below laboratory reference range, and normal value does not exclude urinary phosphorous wasting; however, hypophosphatemia combined with urinary wasting is diagnostic of renal tubular injury. Other laboratory indicators listed as nonspecific include proteinuria/albuminuria and hematuria.

Discussion

pSjD is an autoimmune condition characterised by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of epithelial tissues, primarily affecting the lacrimal and salivary glands. However, extraglandular involvement is common, including the lungs, biliary tract, pancreas, nervous system and kidneys. Among renal complications, dRTA is the most frequently observed manifestation. dRTA results from impaired acid secretion within the distal nephron, leading to chronic metabolic acidosis, hypokalaemia and hyperchloraemia with a normal anion gap. In pSjD, the predominant mechanism underlying dRTA is believed to be autoimmune-mediated dysfunction of H+-ATPase in intercalated cells of the distal tubule and collecting ducts. Autoantibodies targeting H+-ATPase impair proton secretion, preventing urinary acidification. Immunofluorescence studies of renal tissues in pSjD patients with dRTA have demonstrated an absence of H+-ATPase staining with diffuse interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, whereas normal control tissues exhibit preserved H+-ATPase expression. The prevalence of dRTA in pSjD varies widely, ranging from 6.8% to 70%, depending on diagnostic criteria and study populations.

Pregnancy is known to exacerbate renal tubular dysfunction, which may explain why the diagnosis of dRTA in our patient became evident during pregnancy despite the absence of significant renal involvement in prior pregnancies. Physiological changes in renal function during pregnancy include a substantial increase in renal plasma flow by approximately 80% and a rise in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by approximately 50%. This increase in GFR leads to enhanced bicarbonate filtration and subsequent excretion, which, in healthy individuals, results in a compensatory mild respiratory alkalosis. However, in patients with impaired tubular acidification, this adaptation is insufficient, predisposing them to worsening metabolic acidosis. Additionally, pregnancy promotes increased potassium losses due to hormonal influences on renal sodium and potassium handling. These physiological changes, when superimposed on pre-existing renal tubular dysfunction, contribute to the worsening of acidosis and hypokalaemia, which can have significant maternal and fetal consequences. Uncorrected metabolic acidosis in pregnancy is associated with adverse fetal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction, preterm labour and neonatal distress. Given these risks, early recognition and intervention are imperative.

### Renal tubular acidosis type 4 in pregnancy [^113V28q1]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

We describe the clinical course of renal tubular acidosis (RTA) type 4 in pregnancy, which has not been previously published. Renal tubular acidosis type 4 is a condition associated with increased urinary ammonia secondary to hypoaldosteronism or pseudohypoaldosteronism. Pregnancy may worsen the hyperkalaemia and acidosis of renal tubular acidosis type 4, possibly through an antialdosterone effect. We advise regular monitoring of potassium and pH throughout pregnancy to ensure safe levels are maintained.

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^115tb9kd]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) after surgery has been consistently associated with long-term morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Furthermore, the relationship persists even among patients with complete renal recovery, or patients with minor perturbations in renal function not reaching the threshold for AKI. The mechanism, pathogenesis, and risk factors for postoperative AKI vary significantly by surgical type and corresponding perioperative stressors.

Because treatment options for postoperative AKI are limited, perioperative management has traditionally focused on prevention and diagnosis. Identifying prerenal (hypoperfusion), postrenal (outflow obstruction), and intrinsic renal (ischemic or nephrotoxic injury) causes are crucial first steps in the management of AKI. Additionally, the 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines emphasize severity-based management of AKI. In patients with normal kidney function and mild AKI, management focuses on rapid identification and avoidance of nephrotoxic insults plus attention to volume status and renal perfusion pressure. As the severity of AKI increases, the accompanying disruption to acid–base status and electrolyte balance may necessitate focused medical and supportive therapies, with renal replacement therapy and/or intensive care admission for the most severe cases.

In this review, we define AKI in the perioperative setting, describe the epidemiologic burden, discuss procedure-specific risk factors, detail principles of management, and highlight areas of ongoing controversy and research.

### Genetic testing in the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease: recommendations for clinical practice [^112jD7gh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical benefit of genetic testing

In patients with a clinical diagnosis of tubulopathy, genetic testing establishes a precise diagnosis, which has high relevance for clinical management and prognosis and in some cases can end diagnostic odysseys. The importance in clinical management is particularly true for diseases with a perinatal presentation with life-threatening situations (antenatal Bartter syndrome, type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and recessive distal renal tubular acidosis) in which an adapted treatment is necessary. Specific therapies can be proposed, such as thiazides in pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 or amiloride in Liddle syndrome.

A precise diagnosis allows focused screening for extrarenal manifestations in some tubulopathies (Supplementary data, Table S2); important examples are sensorineural hearing loss (antenatal Bartter type 4, renal tubular acidosis, East syndrome); ocular abnormalities (FHHNC type 2, Lowe syndrome, proximal tubular acidosis); dental abnormalities (FHHNC, enamel renal syndrome); neurological manifestations (Lowe syndrome, proximal tubular acidosis, mixed tubular acidosis and East syndrome); or cutaneous and exocrine gland abnormalities (HELIX syndrome).

There are also some long-term benefits in having a definite genetic diagnosis: most of the tubulopathies affect the quality of life (e.g. failure to thrive and severe polyuria in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) and close follow-up is important, particularly in children. For diseases with an evolution towards CKD (e.g. Dent disease and FHHNC), the introduction of nephroprotective therapy is crucial. Even for diseases with a relatively good prognosis, such as Gitelman syndrome, genetic confirmation could be helpful to guide care and to survey and prevent specific chronic complications such as chondrocalcinosis.

Genetic counselling

For families with hereditary tubulopathies, genetic counselling is important to evaluate the risk for future pregnancies and support decision making concerning prenatal or pre-implantation testing when indicated. For X-linked diseases, genetic counselling and screening allow the identification of female carriers, which can provide information for reproductive decision making and neonatal management (e.g. nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and Dent disease).

In some genetic diseases, such as FHHNC and infantile hypercalcaemia or hypophosphataemic rickets with hypercalciuria, heterozygous relatives could develop hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis. Finally, a reliable diagnosis is crucial to evaluate the eligibility of living kidney donors.

14.1 Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA) with Calcium Stones

The effect of oral potassium citrate therapy in a non-randomized, non-placebo controlled clinical study of five men and four women with calcium oxalate/calcium phosphate nephrolithiasis and documented incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis was examined. The main inclusion criterion was a history of stone passage or surgical removal of stones during the 3 years prior to initiation of potassium citrate therapy. All patients began alkali treatment with 60–80 mEq potassium citrate daily in 3 or 4 divided doses. Throughout treatment, patients were instructed to stay on a sodium restricted diet (100 mEq/day) and to reduce oxalate intake (limited intake of nuts, dark roughage, chocolate and tea). A moderate calcium restriction (400–800 mg/day) was imposed on patients with hypercalciuria.

X-rays of the urinary tract, available in all patients, were reviewed carefully to determine presence of pre-existing stones, appearance of new stones, or change in the number of stones.

Potassium citrate therapy was associated with inhibition of new stone formation in patients with distal tubular acidosis. Three of the nine patients continued to pass stones during the on-treatment phase. While it is likely that these patients passed pre-existing stones during therapy, the most conservative assumption is that the passed stones were newly formed. Using this assumption, the stone-passage remission rate was 67%. All patients had a reduced stone formation rate. Over the first 2 years of treatment, the on-treatment stone formation rate was reduced from 13 ± 27 to 1 ± 2 per year.

### Renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury: controversy and consensus [^113Hx5eg]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Renal replacement therapies (RRTs) represent a cornerstone in the management of severe acute kidney injury. This area of intensive care and nephrology has undergone significant improvement and evolution in recent years. Continuous RRTs have been a major focus of new technological and treatment strategies. RRT is being used increasingly in the intensive care unit, not only for renal indications but also for other organ-supportive strategies. Several aspects related to RRT are now well established, but others remain controversial. In this review, we review the available RRT modalities, covering technical and clinical aspects. We discuss several controversial issues, provide some practical recommendations, and where possible suggest a research agenda for the future.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^1169KSqt]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Adult guidelines for dialysate composition (sections 5.1–5.3) are generally applicable to children, though there are a number of additional considerations.

In children with residual kidney function, tubular dysfunction is not uncommon, leading to electrolyte wasting and hypokalaemia or acidosis. Calcium balance is also more complex in children: the normal range for calcium is age-dependent and growing children require a positive calcium balance, so that hypocalcaemia may be both more common and more harmful, and yet vascular calcification is sometimes seen even in children and adolescents, in whom calcium-phosphate product is an important risk factor. Similarly, dietary protein intake is often proportionately greater than that of adults, and pre-dialysis acidosis therefore more common. The complexity and clinical heterogeneity of these issues therefore argues strongly for a more individualized approach to dialysate composition in children.

Thermal exchanges during dialysis may also be more significant particularly in neonates and younger children, due to the proportionately greater blood flow, and sometimes a reduced capacity for compensation due to body size. Hypothermia should therefore be avoided by individualising dialysate temperature, with intradialytic monitoring in those most at risk. Control of thermal exchanges is available on some modern dialysis machines.

Anticoagulation

We recommend that patients without increased bleeding risk should be given unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin during dialysis to reduce clotting of the extracorporeal system. [1A]

We recommend that systemic anticoagulation should be omitted or minimised in patients with increased bleeding risk. [1C]

We recommend that patients with heparin allergies should be prescribed a non-heparin form of anticoagulation. [1A]

### Proximal renal tubular acidosis: a not so rare disorder of multiple etiologies [^114yucuC]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Therapy of proximal RTA

Drug-induced proximal RTA caused by CA inhibitors is usually mild and readily reversible. One has to be very careful in patients with compromised kidney function because in this setting, metabolic acidosis can be severe with the use of CA inhibitors. Drug-induced proximal RTA associated with Fanconi syndrome usually reflects severe proximal tubular nephrotoxicity. In some cases, there are profound defects in bicarbonate and phosphate transport, such that the degree of metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia is severe requiring drug discontinuation. Discontinuation of the offending drugs such as antiretrovirals usually leads to recovery, but the defect can be persistent after discontinuation with some agents such as ifosfamide.

Patients with inherited and acquired proximal RTA should be given HCO 3 − supplements. In children, in particular, HCO 3 − replacement therapy is critical for the prevention of growth retardation due to acidosis. The magnitude of the bicarbonaturia that occurs when serum HCO 3 − is normalized requires that large amounts of HCO 3 − be administered (5–15 mEq / kg body weight). By adding a thiazide diuretic (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide 25–50 mg daily), the amount of bicarbonate can be reduced. Thiazides enhance proximal tubule and loop HCO 3 − reabsorption by reducing the extracellular volume. A reduction in extracellular volume is sensed by the kidneys as a stimulus for tubular reabsorption of Na + and HCO 3 −. This way the use of thiazide diuretics by producing mild volume depletion allows for a reduction in the amount of bicarbonate to be given daily.

The combination of sodium bicarbonate and thiazide administration can unfortunately aggravate hypokalemia by promoting K + secretion in the cortical collecting tubule (CCT) as a result of enhanced distal HCO 3 − delivery. By being relatively poorly reabsorbed in the CCT, the presence of bicarbonate in large amounts generates a negative transepithelial voltage that promotes K + secretion and urinary potassium wastage. Therefore, plasma K + must be carefully monitored when these therapies are used. A mixture of sodium and potassium salts is usually needed. We recommend Polycitra (K-Shohl solution, a mixture of sodium and potassium citrate). This oral solution contains 1 mEq of K + and 1 mEq of Na + per mL, and the citrate, when metabolized, is equivalent to 2 mEq of HCO 3 − per mL.

### Acute kidney injury in the critically ill: an updated review on pathophysiology and management [^112cs4jN]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The availability of a consensus definition of acute kidney injury (AKI) has been an important step in establishing AKI epidemiology. AKI affects 30–60% of critically ill patients and is associated with acute morbidity and mortality. Evidence is also accumulating that the burden of AKI extends beyond the acute phase with progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD), increased risk of cardiovascular complications, recurrent episodes of AKI and long-term mortality. Prevention of development and/or progression is currently limited to hemodynamic and fluid status optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins. Search for a specific pharmacologic treatment is hampered by the late diagnosis and the complex and incompletely elucidated pathophysiology. Progress in the management of AKI is to be expected from the recognition that AKI is a very heterogeneous syndrome with variable etiology, pathophysiology and clinical presentation.

In this narrative review, we discuss methods for early diagnosis of AKI, clinical phenotypes, pathophysiology, nephrotoxicity, optimal supportive management, as well as the importance of recovery and long-term follow-up. A discussion of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is outside the scope of this review.

### Metabolic acidosis and subclinical metabolic acidosis in CKD [^116qSfvZ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is not uncommon in CKD and is linked with bone demineralization, muscle catabolism, and higher risks of CKD progression and mortality. Clinical practice guidelines recommend maintaining serum total CO 2 at ≥ 22 mEq/L to help prevent these complications. Although a definitive trial testing whether correcting metabolic acidosis improves clinical outcomes has not been conducted, results from small, single-center studies support this notion. Furthermore, biologic plausibility supports the notion that a subset of patients with CKD have acid-mediated organ injury despite having a normal serum total CO 2 and might benefit from oral alkali before overt acidosis develops. Identifying these individuals with subclinical metabolic acidosis is challenging, but recent results suggest that urinary acid excretion measurements may be helpful. The dose of alkali to provide in this setting is unknown as well. The review discusses these topics and the prevalence and risk factors of metabolic acidosis, mechanisms of acid-mediated organ injury, results from interventional studies, and potential harms of alkali therapy in CKD.

### Critical analysis of the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal tubular sodium, water and chloride homeostasis and their role in influencing heart failure outcomes [^116WkAhe]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Activation of Counterbalancing Renal Tubular Mechanisms

If the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors were determined entirely by their actions on SGLT2 and NHE3 in the proximal renal tubule, their administration would result in a massive loss of sodium, water, and bicarbonate, leading to intravascular and extracellular volume depletion and marked acidosis. Although hypovolemic euglycemic acidosis can occur in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, it is typically associated with ketosis resulting from calorie restriction or insulinopenia. In most circumstances, the lack of hypovolemia and acidosis is related to compensatory nephron mechanisms that counteract the effects of SGLT2 and NHE3 inhibition.

Specifically, SGLT2 inhibition is followed by marked enhancement of sodium reabsorption in downstream nephron segments, including the S3 segment of the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle, and the distal nephron (Figure 1). Clinical trial proteomic analyses suggest that SGLT2 inhibition is accompanied by upregulation of carbonic anhydrase and uromodulin. Activation of carbonic anhydrase promotes sodium and bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule and in the cortical collecting duct, and uromodulin activates the Na +, K +,2Cl – cotransporter in the loop of Henle.SGLT2 inhibition elevates circulating levels of aldosterone in some studies, and increased glucose delivery to the distal convoluted tubule activates sodium reabsorption by the Na-Cl cotransporter. In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors increase the proximal tubular levels of α-ketoglutarate, which promotes sodium and chloride reabsorption by facilitating chloride-bicarbonate exchanger–related reabsorption pathways, while enhancing ammoniagenesis to achieve renal acid excretion. These compensatory mechanisms, acting in concert, enhance sodium chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle and more distal segments of the nephron, while simultaneously preventing the development of severe metabolic acidosis.

The mild osmotic diuresis that occurs with the tubular glucose load induced by SGLT2 inhibitors is easily compensated for by normal osmoregulatory mechanisms, primarily vasopressin. – The magnitude of the reactive antiaquaretic effect can be sufficiently marked to paradoxically cause a decrease in free water clearance in clinical studies of SGLT2 inhibitors, explaining why plasma osmolarity increases only slightly during the water diuresis induced by glycosuria, and why serum sodium concentration can decline after initiation of treatment. An increase in electrolyte-free water clearance becomes apparent if vasopressin is suppressed by water loading. Vasopressin also increases sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle and distal segments.

### Timing of initiation and discontinuation of renal replacement therapy in AKI: unanswered key questions [^111shZB1]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) often require initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Currently, there is wide variation worldwide on the indications for and timing of initiation and discontinuation of RRT for AKI. Various parameters for metabolic, solute, and fluid control are generally used to guide the initiation and discontinuation of therapy; however, there are currently no standards in this field. Members of the recently established Acute Kidney Injury Network, representing key societies in critical care and nephrology along with additional experts in adult and pediatric AKI, participated in a 3-d conference in Vancouver in September 2006 to evaluate the available literature on this topic and draft consensus recommendations for research studies in this area. Key questions included the following: what are the indications for RRT, when should acute RRT support be initiated, and when should RRT be stopped? This report summarizes the available evidence and describes in detail the key questions, and some of the methods of answering them that will need to be addressed with the goal of standardizing the care of patients with AKI and improving outcomes.

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^115z8HhV]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients who progress to stage 2 AKI, adjusting drug dosages to account for glomerular filtration and careful attention to volume input or output become important. Stage 3 AKI is associated with acid–base imbalance, altered electrolyte levels, and accumulation of uremic toxins. Decisions on the need for intensive care and initiation of kidney replacement therapy require expertise in nephrology or critical care medicine and should be considered early in disease progression.

Phase of care, monitoring, and follow-up can vary greatly depending on the severity of disease. The KDIGO clinical practice guidelines recommend that all patients diagnosed with AKI are evaluated at 3 months to screen for new or progressive chronic kidney disease, while the Acute Disease Quality Initiative and PeriOperative Quality Initiative recommend all postoperative patients with AKI or acute kidney disease have a kidney health assessment within 30 days of hospital discharge. As morbidity and mortality increase with severity of AKI (and in patients without renal recovery), these factors should inform the frequency and nature of follow-up. Management of AKI during the period of inpatient hospitalization provides an opportunity to prevent or delay progression of AKI to chronic kidney disease. Patients requiring acute renal replacement therapy (or necessitate continuous renal replacement therapy due to hemodynamic instability) should be managed in the ICU. Furthermore, a variety of critical conditions associated with AKI including shock, sepsis, acid–base imbalance, and respiratory failure secondary to fluid overload require intensive care. The KDIGO management guidelines recommend considering ICU admission beginning at stage 2 AKI.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^111kSWbh]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Imbalances of the acid-base state and particularly metabolic acidosis are common problems in critically ill patients. To further investigate the underlying causes, analysis of the acid-base state and determination of plasma and urine electrolytes are crucial. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided in conditions with either high serum anion gap (SAG) or normal SAG according to the classic model of metabolic acid-base disorders. The SAG is the difference in the measured cations (Na +, K +) and anions (Cl −, HCO 3−) in serum.

High SAG is typical for the occurrence of unmeasured anions (for example ketones, lactate, metabolites of methanol and ethylene glycol, phosphate) where HCO 3− is consumed via its action as a buffer. High SAG metabolic acidosis is seen in ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, intoxication and acute renal failure.

Metabolic acidosis with normal SAG - hyperchloremic acidosis - is characterized by the replacement of bicarbonate with chloride caused by extrarenal or renal bicarbonate disposal or a dysfunction in renal H + secretion. Hyperchloremic acidosis is typically seen in bicarbonate wasting due to diarrhea, urine-gut diversions, intestinal or pancreatic fistulae, surgical drains or renal tubular acidosis (RTA).

The analysis of the urine osmolal gap (UOG) is necessary to further differentiate these conditions. The UOG represents the difference of the directly measured urine osmolality to an estimate of the urine osmolality derived from the urine concentrations of sodium, potassium, urea nitrogen, and glucose concentrations.

A UOG - as an approximate measure of unmeasured urine ammonium salts - of less than 150 mosmol/kg in combination with a preserved renal function is characteristic for altered urine acidification typical for RTA, while a UOG of more than 150 mosmol/kg suggests extrarenal bicarbonate loss.

CONCLUSION

The importance of normalizing serum HCO 3 in CKD patients with metabolic acidosis is reflected in the leading treatment guidelines for CKD. The US-based National Kidney Foundation's KDOQI guidelines state that serum HCO 3 levels should be maintained at 22 mEq/l or greater and recommend the use of oral alkali supplements to attain this goal, whereas maintaining an awareness of the complications related to the use of such supplements. Similarly, guidelines from KDIGO suggest that in patients with CKD and serum bicarbonate less than 22 mEq/l treatment with oral bicarbonate supplementation can be given to maintain serum bicarbonate within the normal range unless contraindicated. Several large retrospective database analyses show that clinical outcomes for CKD patients with serum HCO 3 levels that are below normal (i.e. < 22 mEq/l) are significantly worse compared with patients with normal serum HCO 3 (i.e. 22–29 mEq/l). In addition, several single-center, prospective studies examining the effects of sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, or dietary interventions have also elucidated the beneficial effects of treating chronic metabolic acidosis. In four of the seven key interventional studies discussed here, the provision of oral bicarbonate supplementation increased serum HCO 3 in enrolled CKD patients with baseline serum HCO 3 less than 22 mEq/l, often within 6 months of treatment initiation. Further, long-term treatment of metabolic acidosis (1–3 years) or treatment of hypertension-associated nephropathy patients with normal serum HCO 3 belying an increased acid load (5 years), showed direct benefit on reducing eGFR decline and improving kidney outcomes. Importantly, these improvements were accompanied by a reduction in the expression of urine biomarkers that reflect continued injury to kidneys exposed to chronic acid loading. A post hoc analysis of data from the Phisitkul et al. study showed that the provision of oral alkali to CKD patients with metabolic acidosis reduced the number of patients who experienced at least 40% decline in eGFR, an accepted surrogate endpoint of kidney disease progression to ESKD. Although 27.6% of control patients in this study showed at least 40% decline in eGFR over the 2-year treatment interval, no patients in the sodium citrate treatment group experienced eGFR declines of this magnitude (Table 3; Fig. 2). A limitation of the studies reviewed here is in the enrollment of patients who did not have severe comorbidities commonly found in CKD (e.g. edema, heart failure, poorly-controlled hypertension), as treatment with sodium-based oral alkali might aggravate fluid homeostasis in such patients. Based on these findings, it seems likely that nutritional and pharmacologic management of metabolic acidosis preserves kidney function, and larger scale, multicenter testing of this hypothesis is warranted.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^111AE91Z]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyperchloremic acidosis is frequent in critically ill patients. Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) may contribute to acidemia in the state of hyperchloremic acidosis, but the prevalence of RTA has never been studied in critically ill patients. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the prevalence, type, and possible risk factors of RTA in critically ill patients using a physical-chemical approach.

Methods

This prospective, observational trial was conducted in a medical ICU of a university hospital. One hundred consecutive critically ill patients at the age ≥ 18, expected to stay in the ICU for ≥ 24 h, with the clinical necessity for a urinary catheter and the absence of anuria were included. Base excess (BE) subset calculation based on a physical-chemical approach on the first 7 days after ICU admission was used to compare the effects of free water, chloride, albumin, and unmeasured anions on the standard base excess. Calculation of the urine osmolal gap (UOG) — as an approximate measure of the unmeasured urine cation NH4(+) — served as determinate between renal and extrarenal bicarbonate loss in the state of hyperchloremic acidosis.

Results

During the first week of ICU stay 43 of the patients presented with hyperchloremic acidosis on one or more days represented as pronounced negative BEChloride. In 31 patients hyperchloremic acidosis was associated with RTA characterized by a UOG ≤ 150 mosmol/kg in combination with preserved renal function. However, in 26 of the 31 patients with RTA metabolic acidosis was neutralized by other acid-base disturbances leading to a normal arterial pH.

Conclusions

RTA is highly prevalent in critically ill patients with hyperchloremic acidosis, whereas it is often neutralized by the simultaneous occurrence of other acid-base disturbances.

### Renal tubular acidosis… [^11228WVL]. JAMA Network (1996). Excellent credibility.

The pathophysiology of renal tubular acidosis is slowly being unraveled, which has implications for the traditional classification of the condition. Nonetheless, the diagnosis of renal tubular acidosis is still easy to establish, and identification of the specific pathophysiological subtype is relatively straightforward. The diagnostic information required usually includes only urinary pH and sodium, potassium, and chloride concentrations and serum potassium level. The urinary pH is not a diagnostic test for renal tubular acidosis, but it serves to distinguish between the various subtypes.
