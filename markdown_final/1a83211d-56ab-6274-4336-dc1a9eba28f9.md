## Question

A 38-year-old man is diagnosed with early-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) after presenting with mildly abnormal liver function tests and undergoing MRCP, which shows characteristic biliary changes. He is asymptomatic, has no evidence of cirrhosis or dominant strictures, and his inflammatory bowel disease is well controlled. He asks about how his care will be managed going forward and whether he will need to attend specialist hepatology clinics for all follow-up.

Based on current BSG guideline recommendations, how should the ongoing care of this patient with early stable PSC be organised, and what factors should be considered in determining the setting for his follow-up?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to organize ongoing care for a 38-year-old man with early, asymptomatic, non-cirrhotic PSC without dominant strictures, including whether he needs specialist hepatology follow-up for all visits and what surveillance and triggers for escalation are appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and baseline disease stage. Then, I should verify the principle of shared care and when general clinics suffice. Next, I will outline the core surveillance elements and their frequencies. After that, I need to define clear triggers for specialist referral. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified follow-up plan and address the patient's question directly with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and baseline staging, because I need to ensure we truly have early, stable PSC without cirrhosis or dominant strictures. The diagnosis is supported by cholestatic liver tests with typical cholangiographic features on MRCP and exclusion of secondary causes, and in this case there is no evidence of cirrhosis or dominant strictures, which aligns with early-stage disease; I should also remember that liver biopsy is not routinely required unless small-duct disease is suspected or the diagnosis is uncertain, so I should avoid over-ordering invasive tests here [^1167kFb5] [^114GqHA4] [^117Aewjk].

> Next, I should review the overarching principle of care delivery. The BSG/UK-PSC guideline explicitly recommends a partnership model between primary care, hospital-led specialty, and the patient, with care individualized to risk, symptoms, and local service configuration; importantly, patients with early, stable PSC can be managed in general clinics, whereas symptomatic, evolving, or complex disease warrants specialist referral, so I need to ensure we are not over-medicalizing low-risk patients [^113BDccJ] [^111aQ1cC] [^116y4avM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surveillance. I should double-check the malignancy surveillance strategy. For cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, expert guidance supports interval imaging every 6–12 months with MRI/MRCP preferred by many experts, with heightened vigilance in the first year after diagnosis and in those with ulcerative colitis; routine CA 19–9 is not recommended for surveillance due to poor diagnostic accuracy, so I should avoid ordering it reflexively [^116v2JLm] [^114gGwjv] [^1122MUyL]. For HCC, surveillance is indicated only if cirrhosis develops, typically with ultrasound, CT, or MRI every 6 months, so in this non-cirrhotic patient HCC surveillance is not currently indicated; I should confirm fibrosis stage periodically to reassess this need [^113H1oP7] [^115q6cJ6].

> I will now examine disease monitoring and triggers for escalation. Annual clinical review with liver biochemistry is the minimum, with more frequent visits if symptoms or labs worsen; noninvasive fibrosis assessment with transient elastography can be considered periodically to detect progression, and rising ALP, new jaundice, or evolving strictures should prompt expedited imaging and specialist input; I should also remember that persistent ALP elevation and liver stiffness above about 9.9 kPa are flags for referral to a liver center, so I need to plan periodic elastography and track trends [^114CCb1m] [^113fQDMu] [^113WEuML].

> Let me consider IBD-related surveillance, since coexisting colitis drives colorectal cancer risk. With well-controlled IBD, annual colonoscopic surveillance is still recommended from the time of colitis diagnosis given the elevated CRC risk in PSC-IBD; if PSC is present without IBD, colonoscopy every 5 years is reasonable, with earlier if symptoms arise, so I should confirm IBD status and schedule accordingly [^116M1sfy] [^111swKQh].

> But wait, what about gallbladder polyps and bone health? I should confirm that we are not missing these. Annual gallbladder ultrasound is suggested in PSC to detect polyps, with cholecystectomy considered for polyps larger than about 8 mm due to malignancy risk; osteoporosis risk assessment is recommended, and if osteoporosis is found, management should follow national guidance, so I should incorporate these into the annual review [^116M1sfy] [^116YScnF].

> Next, I should review medication and lifestyle counseling, because I need to ensure we are not recommending ineffective or harmful therapies. Routine UDCA is not recommended for newly diagnosed PSC, though low-to-moderate dose UDCA may be considered selectively in patients with persistently elevated cholestatic enzymes if there is a biochemical response and no harm signal; patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials when available, and I should avoid high-dose UDCA given potential harm [^116M1sfy] [^117TvEEX] [^115ALMFn]. For pruritus, cholestyramine is first-line, with rifampin or naltrexone as second-line if needed; I should also counsel on nutrition and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency risk in advanced disease, even though this patient is currently early stage [^116M1sfy].

> I should confirm the triggers for specialist referral so we have a safety net. Indications include symptomatic disease, evolving or complex disease, suspected or confirmed dominant strictures, rising liver disease severity scores such as MELD above about 11 or UKELD above about 46, liver stiffness above about 9.9 kPa, or suspicion of cholangiocarcinoma; any of these should prompt referral to a hepatology center with PSC expertise and access to MDT review and trials [^113WEuML] [^116y4avM] [^1162qYCo].

> Let me synthesize a practical plan and answer the patient's question directly. For this 38-year-old with early, asymptomatic, non-cirrhotic PSC and well-controlled IBD, shared care with annual reviews in a general gastroenterology or hepatology clinic is appropriate, with primary care coordinating routine labs and patient education; surveillance should include MRI/MRCP every 6–12 months for CCA/gallbladder cancer in the first year and annually thereafter, annual colonoscopy for IBD, annual gallbladder ultrasound, periodic liver stiffness assessment, and annual osteoporosis risk review; he does not need to attend a specialist hepatology clinic for every visit, but he should have a named specialist contact and a low threshold for escalation if symptoms, cholestasis, or imaging evolve [^113BDccJ] [^116v2JLm] [^116M1sfy] [^114CCb1m].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have addressed uncertainties and provided a clear safety net. I emphasized that lifelong follow-up is required given PSC's unpredictable course, that CA 19–9 is not for routine surveillance, and that any new jaundice, pruritus, cholangitis, or rising cholestatic enzymes should trigger urgent reassessment and possible ERCP with tissue sampling if a dominant stricture is suspected; this balances minimizing unnecessary interventions while preserving early detection of complications [^113QXfUr] [^1122MUyL] [^116M1sfy].

---

For early stable PSC without cirrhosis or dominant strictures, **annual follow-up in general clinics** is appropriate, with liver biochemistry, clinical review, and patient education on red flags [^111aQ1cC] [^114CCb1m]. Specialist referral is indicated for **symptomatic disease**, rising liver tests, new strictures, or if MELD/UKELD rise or elastography suggests advanced fibrosis [^113WEuML] [^116y4avM]. Surveillance for cholangiocarcinoma with MRI/MRCP every 6–12 months is reasonable, though evidence is limited and should be individualized [^116v2JLm] [^114gGwjv]. Lifelong follow-up is essential given PSC's unpredictable course, and patients should be offered trial participation when available [^113QXfUr] [^113GLSb6].

---

## Recommended follow-up frequency and setting

- **Annual follow-up**: For early, asymptomatic, stable PSC without cirrhosis or dominant strictures, annual follow-up in general clinics is appropriate [^111aQ1cC] [^116y4avM].

- **Liver biochemistry**: Monitor liver tests at least annually; increase frequency if abnormalities develop [^114CCb1m].

- **Clinical review**: Annual clinical assessment to detect new symptoms or complications [^114CCb1m].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize red flags (jaundice, pruritus, fever, RUQ pain, weight loss) and prompt reporting [^notfound].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Specialist referral is indicated for the following scenarios:

| **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic disease (jaundice, pruritus, cholangitis) | Requires expert management and possible intervention [^113WEuML] [^116y4avM] |
| Rising liver biochemistry or new strictures | Suspect cholangiocarcinoma or dominant stricture [^113WEuML] [^116y4avM] |
| Advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (elastography > 9.9 kPa, MELD > 11, UKELD > 46) | Risk of decompensation and need for transplant evaluation [^113WEuML] [^116y4avM] |
| Persistent ALP elevation | May indicate disease progression [^113WEuML] |
| Interest in clinical trials | Access to novel therapies [^113GLSb6] |

---

## Surveillance for complications

- **Cholangiocarcinoma**: MRI/MRCP every 6–12 months is reasonable, especially in the first year after diagnosis and in older patients or those with UC; evidence is limited and should be individualized [^116v2JLm] [^114gGwjv].

- **Gallbladder cancer**: Annual ultrasound for gallbladder polyps; consider cholecystectomy if polyps > 8 mm [^116M1sfy].

- **Colorectal cancer**: Annual colonoscopy if IBD is present; every 5 years if no IBD [^116M1sfy] [^111swKQh].

- **Hepatocellular carcinoma**: Surveillance only if cirrhosis develops, per standard cirrhosis protocols [^113H1oP7] [^115FzLa9].

---

## Role of primary care

Primary care should coordinate **annual biochemistry**, vaccination, bone health, and lifestyle counseling, and maintain a low threshold to escalate care if red flags emerge [^113BDccJ] [^114CCb1m].

---

## Patient education and self-management

Patients should be educated to recognize **red flags** and report them promptly, adhere to scheduled follow-up and surveillance, and maintain a healthy lifestyle with alcohol moderation and weight control [^116M1sfy].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Annual follow-up**: General clinic with liver biochemistry and clinical review [^111aQ1cC] [^114CCb1m].

- **Surveillance**: MRI/MRCP every 6–12 months for cholangiocarcinoma; annual gallbladder ultrasound; colonoscopy per IBD status [^116v2JLm] [^116M1sfy].

- **Referral**: Symptomatic disease, rising liver tests, new strictures, advanced fibrosis, or trial interest [^113WEuML] [^116y4avM].

- **Primary care**: Coordinate labs, vaccinations, bone health, and lifestyle counseling [^113BDccJ] [^114CCb1m].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize red flags, adherence, and healthy lifestyle [^116M1sfy].

---

Early stable PSC can be managed with **annual general-clinic follow-up**, with specialist referral for symptoms, rising labs, new strictures, or advanced fibrosis; surveillance is individualized and lifelong follow-up is essential.

Specialist referral

We suggest that care provision should involve a partnership between patients, primary care and hospital-led specialty medicine. Care delivery for an individual patient should encompass patient risk assessment, symptom burden and how local services are configured. All patients should have at least an annual review, which should become more frequent as required if symptoms or complications develop. The timing of referral to specialist regional HPB units will vary and depend on physicians' experience in caring for patients with PSC, and in biliary intervention. In practice, referral will be at the point where a patient's clinical management is beyond both the local expertise and knowledge of their responsible physician and team. As a general rule, all symptomatic patients should be under the care of a specialist clinician or HPB centre with an interest and experience in managing PSC. In the absence of effective medical treatment and with the unpredictable natural history of PSC, it is important that patients are referred early for consideration of liver transplantation. Patients with jaundice from suspected parenchymal disease, rising liver disease scores (MELD > 11, UKELD > 46) or complicated biliary strictures, require discussion with specialist units for consideration of endoscopic, radiological and/or surgical biliary intervention or liver transplantation. Other reasons to consider referral include persistently raised ALP levels, transient elastography of > 9.9 kPaor an enhanced liver fibrosis test result of > 10.6. Patients with early, asymptomatic, stable disease can usually be managed by non-specialist gastroenterologists or other clinicians with adherence to management guidelines. Centres with a particular interest in PSC may be undertaking clinical trials, and patients should be offered the chance to enter into such trials. All patients with suspected CCA or other malignancies should be referred to the appropriate regional multidisciplinary cancer meeting for review.

Recommendation 15: We suggest that provision of care should involve a partnership between patients, primary care and hospital-led specialty medicine with consideration made with regard to patient risk assessment, symptom burden and how local services are configured (strength of recommendation: WEAK; quality of evidence: LOW).

Recommendation 16: We recommend that patients with symptomatic, evolving or complex disease should be referred for expert multidisciplinary assessment. Patients with early, stable disease can be managed in general clinics (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: LOW).

Recommendation 17: We suggest that patients with PSC meeting inclusion criteria should be offered referral to a centre participating in clinical trials (strength of recommendation: WEAK; quality of evidence: LOW).

New British Society of Gastroenterology/UK-PSC guidelines have recently discussed the current state-of-the-art on primary sclerosing cholangitis and outlined key elements for the management of this disease. The current lack of effective pharmacological treatments to prevent progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis limits our ability to modify the natural history of the disease. However, a personalised approach and structured follow-up could allow earlier diagnosis and management of complications and favour access to liver transplantation, which remains the only available treatment. Our commentary overviews the updates and summarises the key recommendations of the recent guidelines for the management of primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare disorder characterised by multi-focal bile duct strictures and progressive liver disease. Inflammatory bowel disease is usually present and there is a high risk of cholangiocarcinoma and colorectal cancer. Most patients ultimately require liver transplantation, after which disease recurrence may occur. With limited therapeutic options and a lack of proven surveillance strategies, patients currently have significant unmet needs. In the present seminar, we provide a comprehensive review of the status of the field. We emphasise developments related to patient stratification and disease behaviour, and provide an overview of management options from a practical, patient-centered perspective. We survey advances made in the understanding of PSC pathogenesis and summarise the ongoing efforts to develop an effective therapy based on these insights.

Conclusions

PSC is a complex disease with a wide variation in prognosis. No drug treatments alter the outcome of classic PSC, but patients with evidence of overlap syndromes, including AIH and IgG4-SC, may respond to treatment with corticosteroids. Complications include development of dominant strictures, which may respond to endoscopic therapy, and a high risk (up to 1% a year) of developing CCA. Those with coexistent colitis should undergo annual surveillance colonoscopy. Patients with troublesome symptoms, evidence of advanced liver disease (or deemed to be at risk of this), jaundice with dominant stenoses, evidence of CCA or who express an interest in participating in clinical trials should be referred to specialist centres.

Service standards and audit

PSC can be difficult to manage. Key service standards may assist in developing good clinical practice. Clinicians who are uncertain about managing patients with, or complications of, PSC should refer them to a specialist clinician or centre for review. Key markers of appropriate service standards include:
Patients with PSC should have at least an annual clinical assessment. Those with more advanced disease require more frequent evaluation and follow-up.
Annual blood tests are the minimum baseline investigation, with additional tests done as clinically indicated.
All patients are screened for the presence of IBD at diagnosis.
Clear documentation of the need for surveillance colonoscopy (depending on presence of IBD) and screening for gallbladder pathology and cancer with ultrasound.
All patients should have multidisciplinary review before they undergo ERCP to minimise unnecessary intervention and risk.
All patients with suspicion of malignancy should be referred to the appropriate MDM. This includes patients with new, suspicious or evolving dominant biliary strictures being reviewed at the regional specialist HPB MDM to direct appropriate investigations and interventions.
Patients with evidence of advanced cirrhosis or complications from complex strictures should be referred to the local expert/liver centre.

Cholangitis-specific considerations — "Endoscopic treatment of dominant strictures in PSC may be considered specifically for cholangitis". "Cholangitis can be the initial presentation of PSC and occurs frequently during the course of disease", and "Recurrent cholangitis can contribute to progression of the disease". Because "Dominant strictures are associated with biliary bacterial colonization and antibiotic therapy alone may not be sufficient to eradicate the bacteria", endoscopic treatment "may allow more effective treatment of cholangitis", though "The increased risk of cholangitis as a complication of ERCP, however, does reduce the potential benefit of endoscopic therapy for this indication".

Dominant strictures are defined by stenoses with a diameter of 1.5 mm or less in the common bile duct and/or 1.0 mm or less in a hepatic duct within 2 cm of the main hepatic confluence by ERCP. Among PSC patients with a dominant stricture, 6.2% to 26.3% will be diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma over a 6.2- to 9.8-year follow-up period. Because benign and malignant strictures can appear similar on imaging, a high index of suspicion is warranted and direct sampling of the stricture should be considered to rule out underlying cholangiocarcinoma.

These guidelines on the management of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) were commissioned by the British Society of Gastroenterology liver section. The guideline writing committee included medical representatives from hepatology and gastroenterology groups as well as patient representatives from PSC Support. The guidelines aim to support general physicians, gastroenterologists and surgeons in managing adults with PSC or those presenting with similar cholangiopathies which may mimic PSC, such as IgG4 sclerosing cholangitis. It also acts as a reference for patients with PSC to help them understand their own management. Quality of evidence is presented using the AGREE II format. Guidance is meant to be used as a reference rather than for rigid protocol-based care as we understand that management of patients often requires individual patient-centred considerations.

### Effect of scheduled endoscopic dilatation of dominant strictures on outcome in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115PfGma]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver and biliary tract disease with a variable natural history. Clinical symptoms and complications of the disease result from fibrosis and strictures involving extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts.PSC may have a progressive course, leading to recurrent biliary tract obstruction, recurrent episodes of cholangitis and, ultimately, end-stage liver disease. Biliary obstruction may develop at all levels of the biliary tree, but endoscopic therapy is possible only for large bile ducts and is recommended for strictures described as dominant strictures (DS). At cholangiography, DS are defined as stenoses measuring < 1.5 mm in the common bile duct or < 1.0 mm in the hepatic ducts.DS are detected at the initial clinical presentation of PSC in up to one-half of patients and frequently will develop over the course of the disease. Reported benefits following endoscopic treatment of DS include short-term improvement of symptoms and liver biochemical test results, as well as a longer transplantation-free survival than that predicted using the Mayo clinical risk model. Thus, in different guidelines, endoscopic treatment is recommended for suspected DS in patients with PSC who present with symptoms likely to improve following endoscopic treatment.

The impact on actual long-term survival, rather than predicted survival, of scheduled endoscopic treatment independent of symptoms, up to resolution of DS at cholangiography, has not been evaluated thus far. In the present trial, we compared clinical outcome and long-term survival of patients with PSC adhering to a scheduled endoscopic surveillance and treatment programme versus patients with PSC receiving endoscopic diagnosis and therapy on clinical demand only.

### AASLD practice guidance on primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma [^117TvEEX]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) management: All patients with PSC should be considered for participation in clinical trials. In patients not eligible or interested in clinical trials with persistently elevated ALP or GGT, UDCA 13–23 mg/kg/day can be considered for treatment and continued if there is a meaningful reduction or normalization in ALP (GGT in children) and/or symptoms improve with 12 months of treatment. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of oral vancomycin for the treatment of PSC. Patients with PSC with a diagnosis of concurrent AIH should be treated according to the AASLD AIH guidelines. Antibiotics should be used for bacterial cholangitis with consideration for MRCP to rule out relevant strictures. ERCP should be preferred for the treatment of dominant strictures with careful patient selection and assessment of risks versus benefits and alternatives. Antibiotics should be administered periprocedurally. Upper endoscopy to screen for varices should be performed if the LS is > 20 kPa by TE or the platelet count is ≤ 150,000/mm³.

Future studies

Research into PSC has been mostly through small case series and uncontrolled trials in specialist units. Most centres will have an insufficient number of patients to affect their clinical service, for audit purposes or to undertake independent clinical trials. A recent consensus on endpoints for future studies was reported by an international PSC working group.

Studies in progress include investigations into the role of norUDCA, farnesoid X receptor agonists, bile salt transporter protein inhibitors, antibiotics and monoclonal antibody blockade of receptors thought to be activated in the pathogenesis of PSC.

Gastroenterology units should be encouraged to link patient databases in order to improve knowledge of the natural history of PSC and response to treatments, and to improve future clinical trials. These efforts should be coordinated by UK-PSC, BSG and/or the British Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) rare diseases initiative. Studies should include a prospective national repository of clinical samples. Future clinical trials should be registered with the NIHR.

Research and clinical audit questions that may require more clarity include:
What constitutes a diagnosis of PSC in UK practice?
How should patients with unexplained abnormal liver biochemistry and IBD be evaluated, labelled and diagnosed, particularly when MRCP is normal?
How can we improve stratification for risk of (a) liver disease, (b) disease progression and (c) cancer?
What is the optimal timing and type of intervention for patients with dominant strictures?
Are there any other existing and/or new drugs which may be useful in the medical management of PSC?
Can we develop a robust database to map the epidemiology, progression and management of PSC in the UK as well as to assess causes of death?
What is the optimal approach to surgical management in patients with PSC requiring colectomy and/or liver transplantation?
Can we report patient perceptions of problems and risks of living with PSC with the aim of improving wellbeing for patients and carers.

Executive summary and recommendations

There are many causes of cholangiopathy and these should be considered in the assessment of all patients presenting with biliary strictures. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) has a wide spectrum of symptomatology and stages of disease. Diagnosis is based on the cholangiographic (or histological) features of sclerosing cholangitis in the absence of identifiable causes of secondary sclerosing cholangitis. The diagnosis and management of PSC can be difficult and requires specialist referral for advanced disease or patients experiencing significant clinical events. Few randomised controlled trials have been carried out to define best management. Most recommendations derive from small case –control studies, retrospective series and expert opinion. There is little evidence for the use of medical therapy to prevent progression of disease. Ursodeoxycholic acid is not recommended for routine use in newly diagnosed PSC. Non-invasive investigations such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), dynamic liver MRI and/or contrast CT should be performed in patients who have new or changing symptoms or evolving abnormalities in laboratory investigations. Worsening liver biochemistry and/or new high grade or evolving strictures should prompt further investigation for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Patients with PSC should ordinarily not undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) until there has been expert multidisciplinary assessment to justify endoscopic intervention. Colitis should be sought in all patients with PSC using colonoscopy and colonic biopsies. Patients with colitis should then have annual surveillance colonoscopy because of the increased risk of colorectal cancer. In these guidelines, we also review the management of PSC overlap syndromes and IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC).

Primary sclerosing cholangitis — liver transplantation indications and outcomes are outlined with formal recommendations: Liver transplantation, when possible, is recommended over medical therapy or surgical drainage in PSC patients with decompensated cirrhosis, to prolong survival (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and patients should be referred for liver transplantation when their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score exceeds 14 (Conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In the absence of effective medical therapy, the median time for progression from diagnosis until death or liver transplantation is 10–12 years, and deceased donor transplantation offers 5-year survival of 80–85%. Liver transplantation offers survival benefit for patients with MELD score > 15, and MELD exception points may be approved for recurrent episodes of cholangitis with > 2 episodes of bacteremia or > 1 episode of sepsis, for cholangiocarcinoma < 3 cm in diameter without metastasis undergoing treatment through an institutional review board–approved clinical trial, or for intractable pruritus.

The presence of biliary strictures, in the absence of secondary causes of sclerosing cholangitis, is considered diagnostic. Equivocal MRI findings should prompt evaluation at an experienced center with consideration for repeat imaging in a year or liver biopsy.

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis [^117QxuzM]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is the classic hepatobiliary manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease and is generally chronic and progressive. Patients frequently present with asymptomatic, anicteric cholestasis, but many develop progressive biliary strictures with time, leading to recurrent cholangitis, biliary cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease. Medical treatment does not slow the progression of disease, and many patients need liver transplantation, after which recurrent disease is a risk. The increased incidence of hepatobiliary cancer, which is not related to the underlying severity of biliary fibrosis, is of particular concern. Risk of colorectal cancer is also increased in patients with coexistent inflammatory bowel disease. Mechanistic insights have arisen from studies of secondary sclerosing cholangitis, in which a similar clinical profile is associated with a specific cause, and genomic studies have elucidated potential disease-initiating pathways in the primary form. The close association between inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis underscores the need to further understand the role of environmental factors in generation of lymphocytes that are postulated to be retargeted, deleteriously, to the biliary tree. Treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis is confined to supportive measures, but advances in pathobiology suggest that new stratified approaches will soon be available.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^112Kni8w]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune cholestatic liver disease, which when untreated will culminate in end-stage biliary cirrhosis. Diagnosis is usually based on the presence of serum liver tests indicative of a cholestatic hepatitis in association with circulating antimitochondrial antibodies. Patient presentation and course can be diverse and risk stratification is important to ensure all patients receive a personalised approach to their care. The goals of treatment and management are the prevention of end-stage liver disease, and the amelioration of associated symptoms. Pharmacologic approaches in practice, to reduce the impact of the progressive nature of disease, currently include licensed therapies (ursodeoxycholic acid and obeticholic acid) and off-label therapies (fibric acid derivatives, budesonide). These clinical practice guidelines summarise the evidence for the importance of a structured, life-long and individualised, approach to the care of patients with PBC, providing a framework to help clinicians diagnose and effectively manage patients.

### AGA clinical practice update on surveillance for hepatobiliary cancers in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis: expert review [^116rwii4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this clinical practice update is to define key principles in the surveillance of hepatobiliary cancers including cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).

Methods

The recommendations outlined in this expert review are based on available published evidence including observational studies and systematic reviews, and incorporates expert opinion where applicable. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Surveillance for cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer should be considered in all adult patients with PSC regardless of disease stage, especially in the first year after diagnosis and in patients with ulcerative colitis and those diagnosed at an older age. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Surveillance for cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer should include imaging by ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging, with or without serum carbohydrate antigen 19–9, every 6 to 12 months BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology should not be used routinely for surveillance of cholangiocarcinomas in PSC. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Cholangiocarcinomas should be investigated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology with or without fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis and/or cholangioscopy in PSC patients with worsening clinical symptoms, worsening cholestasis, or a dominant stricture. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Fine-needle aspiration of perihilar biliary strictures should be used with caution in PSC patients considered to be liver transplant candidates because of concerns for tumor seeding if the lesion is a cholangiocarcinoma. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Surveillance for cholangiocarcinoma should not be performed in PSC patients with small-duct PSCs or those younger than age 20. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: The decision to perform a cholecystectomy in PSC patients with a gallbladder polyp should be based on the size and growth of the polyp, as well as the clinical status of the patient, with the knowledge of the increased risk of gallbladder cancer in polyps greater than 8 mm. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in PSC patients with cirrhosis should include ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging, with or without α-fetoprotein every 6 months.

INTRODUCTION

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic liver disease represented by progressive fibrosis of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. The concentric biliary fibrosis is not specific to PSC and can also arise from chronic bile duct injury from diverse and identifiable causes (secondary sclerosing cholangitis), which must be excluded as part of making the diagnosis. The cause of PSC is unknown, but chronic cholangitis often occurs in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and there is also an increased frequency of other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Pathophysiology likely involves an interplay between cholangiocytes, infiltrating immune cells, and cells involved in maintaining the extracellular matrix (stellate cells and portal myofibroblasts in particular), with possible contributions from bile acid toxicity and a range of proposed factors related to the gut microbiota.

The natural history of PSC is inherently progressive, with most people in published PSC cohorts at some point reaching definite endpoints of liver transplantation or death. Progression is nevertheless slow, with a median time until these endpoints of more than 20 years in population-based cohorts, and highly variable with fluctuating disease severity (Figure 1). Cholestasis, bacterial cholangitis, and malignancies are common clinical events, in addition to those related to end-stage liver disease. The lifetime risk of hepatobiliary malignancies is up to 20% in some geographic areas, and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) represents an important cause of death in people with PSC due to lack of reliable surveillance strategies for early-stage neoplasia and CCA therapies. Symptom burden and medical costs related to bile duct strictures or comorbidities are considerable, particularly for advanced disease stages, making PSC proportionally important despite its rarity.

List of recommendations

There are multiple causes of cholangiopathy. We recommend that cholestatic liver biochemistry with typical cholangiographic features in the absence of other identifiable causes of secondary sclerosing cholangitis is usually sufficient for a diagnosis of PSC (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).
We recommend that MRCP should be the principal imaging modality for the investigation of suspected PSC. ERCP should be reserved for patients with biliary strictures requiring tissue acquisition (eg, cytological brushings) or where therapeutic intervention is indicated (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: HIGH).
We recommend that liver biopsy is normally reserved for possible small duct PSC, assessment of suspected possible overlap variants or instances where the diagnosis is unclear (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).
We recommend risk stratification based on non-invasive assessment. Clinical scores are an emerging theme but no single method can be recommended at present to predict individual patient prognosis. Given the unpredictable disease course and the serious nature of the complications of PSC, patients should receive lifelong follow-up (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: VERY LOW).
We recommend that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is not used for the routine treatment of newly diagnosed PSC (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: GOOD). For patients already established on UDCA therapy, there may be evidence of harm in patients taking high dose UDCA 28–30 mg/kg/day (strength of recommendation: WEAK; quality of evidence: LOW).
We recommend that UDCA is not used for the prevention of colorectal cancer or cholangiocarcinoma (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: HIGH).
We recommend that corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are not indicated for the treatment of classic PSC (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: HIGH). In those patients with additional features of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) or IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC), corticosteroids may be indicated (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).
We recommend that endoscopic screening for oesophageal varices should be done in line with international guidelines where there is evidence of cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: HIGH).
We recommend that colitis should be sought in all patients with PSC using colonoscopy and colonic biopsies (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).
We recommend that patients with suspected PSC undergoing ERCP should receive prophylactic antibiotics (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).
We recommend that non-invasive investigations such as MRCP, dynamic liver MRI and/or contrast CT should be performed in patients who have new or changing symptoms or evolving abnormalities in laboratory investigations (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).
We recommend that patients with PSC should ordinarily not undergo ERCP until there has been expert multidisciplinary assessment to justify endoscopic intervention (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).
We recommend that in patients undergoing ERCP for dominant strictures, pathological sampling of suspicious strictures is mandatory (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: STRONG).
We recommend that in patients undergoing ERCP for dominant strictures, biliary dilatation is preferred to the insertion of biliary stents (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).
We suggest that provision of care should involve a partnership between patients, primary care and hospital-led specialty medicine with consideration made with regard to patient risk assessment, symptom burden and how local services are configured (strength of recommendation: WEAK; quality of evidence: LOW).
We recommend that patients with symptomatic, evolving or complex disease should be referred for expert multidisciplinary assessment. Patients with early, stable disease can be managed in general clinics (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: LOW).
We suggest that patients with PSC meeting inclusion criteria should be offered referral to a centre participating in clinical trials (strength of recommendation: WEAK; quality of evidence: LOW).
PSC is a well-recognised indication for liver transplantation. We recommend that eligibility and referral should be assessed in line with the national guidelines (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: HIGH).
We recommend that all patients with PSC should have a risk assessment for osteoporosis. Once osteoporosis is detected, treatment and follow-up should be in accordance with national guidelines (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).
Poor nutrition and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency are relatively common in advanced PSC and we suggest that clinicians should have a low threshold for empirical replacement (strength of recommendation: WEAK; quality of evidence: MODERATE).
We recommend that in patients with fatigue, alternative causes should be actively sought and treated (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: LOW).
We suggest that cholestyramine (or similar) is first-line medical treatment for pruritus. Rifampicin and naltrexone are second-line treatments (strength of recommendation: WEAK; quality of evidence: LOW).
We suggest that an elevated CA19.9 may support a diagnosis of suspected cholangiocarcinoma but has a low diagnostic accuracy. Routine measurement of serum CA19.9 is not recommended for surveillance for cholangiocarcinoma in PSC (strength of recommendation: WEAK; quality of evidence: MODERATE).
We recommend that when a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma is clinically suspected, referral for specialist multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) review is essential (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).
We recommend that where cholangiocarcinoma is suspected, contrast-enhanced, cross-sectional imaging remains the initial preferred investigation for diagnosis and staging (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: HIGH). Confirmatory diagnosis relies on histology with the approach to tissue sampling guided by MDM review. Options include ERCP-guided biliary brush cytology/fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH)/endobiliary biopsy/cholangioscopy/endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided biopsy and/or percutaneous biopsy (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: HIGH).
We suggest that an annual ultrasound scan of the gallbladder should be performed in patients with PSC. If polyps are identified, treatment should be directed by specialist hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) MDM (strength of recommendation: WEAK; quality of evidence: LOW).
We recommend that patients with PSC who have coexistent colonic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) should have annual colonoscopic surveillance from the time of diagnosis of colitis in line with the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: HIGH). We suggest that those without IBD may benefit from less frequent 5-year colonoscopy or earlier in the advent of new symptoms (strength of recommendation: WEAK; quality of evidence: VERY LOW).
We suggest that in the presence of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance should be carried out in accordance with international guidelines (strength of recommendation: WEAK; quality of evidence: LOW).
We recommend that because pregnancy in cirrhotic patients carries a higher risk of maternal and fetal complications, patients should have preconception counselling and specialist monitoring (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: LOW).
We recommend that patients with PSC should be encouraged to participate in patient support groups (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: VERY LOW).

### Management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^116Qodam]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines for clinical practice are intended to indicate preferred approaches to medical problems as established by scientifically valid research. Double blind, placebo-controlled studies are preferable, but reports and expert review articles are also utilized in a thorough review of the literature conducted through the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE. When only data that will not withstand objective scrutiny are available, a recommendation is identified as a consensus of experts. Guidelines are applicable to all physicians who address the subject, without regard to specialty training or interests, and are intended to indicate the preferable but not necessarily the only acceptable approach to a specific problem. Guidelines are intended to be flexible and must be distinguished from standards of care that are inflexible and rarely violated. Given the wide range of specifics in any health care problem, the physician must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient and the variables in existence at the moment of decision. Guidelines are developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee and approved by the Board of Trustees. Each has been intensely reviewed and revised by the Committee, other experts in the field, physicians who will use them, and specialists in the science of decision of analysis. The recommendations of each guideline are therefore considered valid at the time of their production based on the data available. New developments in medical research and practice pertinent to each guideline will be reviewed at an established time and indicated at publication to assure continued validity.

### AGA clinical practice update on surveillance for hepatobiliary cancers in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis: expert review [^116v2JLm]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) — surveillance strategy (Best Practice Advice 2 and 3): A rational approach for screening is interval radiologic assessment using imaging of the biliary tree with either ultrasound (US) or magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) in combination with carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19-9) every 6 to 12 months. Because of the superior sensitivity of MRI compared with US, MRI is the imaging mode preferred by many experts for cholangiocarcinoma surveillance. ERCP should not be used for routine surveillance because of its procedural risks. Abnormalities found on surveillance, particularly within the first year (dominant strictures, mass lesions, or increasing CA19-9 levels), should include ERCP with brush cytology, biopsy specimens, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for further evaluation of cholangiocarcinoma.

### Endoscopic treatment of dominant stenoses in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1176E9Vf]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is characterized by progressive fibrosing inflammation of the bile ducts, leading to their obliteration, which results in cholestasis and, finally, cirrhosis of the liver. Over time, the majority of patients with advanced disease develop dominant stenoses of major bile ducts. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment does not prevent the development of such stenoses. Endoscopic measures allow the opening of short- and long-segment stenoses of the common bile duct and also of short segment stenoses of the hepatic ducts. Inpatients treated by early endoscopic dilatation of dominant stenoses, as well as with UDCA, survival may be significantly improved (compared with the predicted survival).

Benefits of endoscopic therapy for dominant strictures — Endoscopic treatment of dominant strictures "offers clinical benefit with diminished symptoms of pruritus or cholangitis, reduced cholestasis, and measureable improvement of strictures radiologically", with reports that "their results have been generally favorable and reflect the experience of multiple academic centers managing almost 500 patients over several decades". Examples include a 1991 series in which "35 patients with dominant strictures were treated by dilation with or without stent placement, and showed improvement in jaundice, reduced rates of hospitalization, and radiologic improvement of the strictures", a 1995 series where "77% of patients had benefit based on improvement in liver-related tests, symptoms, or cholestasis and jaundice after dilation without stenting and stone extraction", and a 2001 report of "71 patients with dominant strictures treated endoscopically" showing "a statistically significant lessening of jaundice in both treatment groups, and reduced fevers for those without stent placement".

Introduction

The diagnosis of a chronic disease such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and its management bring about unique challenges to the lives of patients. Chronic disease not only affects the physical body, but also interferes with mental and social functioning. Thus, investigating the psychosocial impact of PSC on affected individuals is considered essential to ensure high-quality patient-centred care over the long term.

PSC is a rare liver disease characterised by inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts, resulting in their abnormal narrowing (strictures), impaired bile flow and eventually liver cirrhosis. Its progression remains largely unpredictable and can lead to an end-stage liver disease requiring transplantation. While some individuals may be asymptomatic at first, the course of disease is associated with debilitating symptoms such as itching (pruritus), fatigue, yellow discoloration of the eyes and skin (jaundice) or abdominal pain. Recent estimates suggest a prevalence of up to 16.2 cases per every 100,000 persons. PSC is diagnosed more commonly in men (65–70%) between 30 and 40 years, yet it may occur at any age. Approximately 70% of patients have a concurrent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Possible complications include bacterial cholangitis, clinically relevant high grade bile duct strictures, vitamin deficiencies and the development of hepatobiliary and colorectal cancer. There exists no effective treatment or definite cure for PSC yet, hence disease management currently focuses on symptom alleviation and addressing complications.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary biliary cholangitis: a patient-friendly summary of the 2018 AASLD practice guidance [^114f7JWu]. Clinical Liver Disease (2021). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — definition, course, and care needs: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system harms the liver by mistakenly attacking bile ducts, and in PBC it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed, leading to substances accumulating in the liver and blood that cause itching, fatigue, and issues with the body's metabolism; in late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. The direct cause is not completely known and is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers, and people with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment; however, most people respond very well to medical treatment. As a chronic condition, individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care.

Prognostic scoring systems

It is difficult to predict the rate of progression or outcome for individual patients with PSC. Asymptomatic patients are likely to have a better prognosis than those with symptoms. Multivariate analyses in a number of series demonstrate clinically predictable parameters as being markers of poor prognosis. Some groups have devised prognostic models (summarised in table 1) using a variety of parameters, including age, blood results, liver biopsy staging, cholangiographic findings and complications such as a history of variceal bleeding. The most widely used is the revised Mayo natural history model for PSC. As with other models it has a complex formula reflecting the variability and complexity of the natural history of PSC. These models probably have little role for ordinary patient care and are rarely used in clinical practice in the UK. Their main roles are to assist in the timing of liver transplantation and for research studies. Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and UK Model for End Stage Liver Disease (UKELD) scores may be applied to patients with PSC as for patients with other causes of liver disease, but both may fluctuate highly and overestimate the stage of liver disease in view of the impact of biliary obstruction on the bilirubin component of the scores. The Child-Pugh score has been applied specifically to PSC, with 7-year survival rates of 90%, 68% and 25% for scores A, B and C, respectively. Prognostic models using clinical and laboratory parameters for established PSC do not vary widely from data using the simple Child-Pugh score.

Recommendation 4: We recommend risk stratification based on non-invasive assessment. Clinical scores are an emerging theme but no single method can be recommended at present to predict individual patient prognosis.

### Recent advances in the management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^114Rn5eV]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by fibroinflammatory damage to the biliary tree, typically in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease, with an increased risk of liver failure and cholangiocarcinoma. A complex pathophysiology, heterogeneity in clinical features, and the rare nature of the disease have contributed to the lack of effective therapy to date. However, recent innovations in the characterization and prognostication of patients with PSC, in addition to new tools for medical management and emerging pharmacologic agents, give rise to the potential for meaningful progress in the next several years. This review summarizes current concepts in PSC and highlights particular areas in need of further study.
