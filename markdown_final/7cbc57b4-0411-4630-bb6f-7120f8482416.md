## Question

Can ajovy be prescribed in a patient with immunodeficiency?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Ajovy (fremanezumab) can be prescribed in patients with immunodeficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled contraindications and whether immunodeficiency is listed. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action and whether CGRP blockade is immunosuppressive. Next, I will review safety data, including immunogenicity and infection-related adverse events. After that, I need to check for any guideline or trial exclusions specific to immunodeficiency. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and monitoring plan, including special considerations like HIV and secondary immunodeficiency, and close with a clear bottom line answer.

> Let me first confirm the labeled contraindications. The FDA label lists only serious hypersensitivity to fremanezumab or excipients as a contraindication; immunodeficiency is not mentioned as a contraindication, which is a key starting point for safety in this context [^116RnkoP].

> Now, I need to check the mechanism of action to see if there is a plausible immunosuppressive effect. Fremanezumab is a humanized IgG2Δa/kappa monoclonal antibody that binds CGRP ligand and blocks its receptor interaction; CGRP is a neuropeptide involved in migraine pathophysiology, not a core immune checkpoint, so the mechanism is not inherently immunosuppressive like B-cell depleting agents or TNF inhibitors, which reduces theoretical infection risk compared with those classes [^114KXccB] [^112zJUeB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review safety signals that might hint at infection risk. In pooled phase 3 trials and long-term studies, fremanezumab showed a favorable safety profile with low rates of serious adverse events and no excess of systemic infections versus placebo; injection-site reactions were the most common adverse events, and respiratory events were not increased compared with placebo, which is reassuring regarding infection risk in general populations [^1117VG7q] [^112AXHm2].

> I will now examine immunogenicity, because anti-drug antibodies could theoretically alter exposure or safety. Treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies occurred in a small minority of patients in controlled and long-term studies, with very low rates overall and limited clinical impact reported, though labels caution that data are insufficient to exclude effects; importantly, there is no signal that immunogenicity correlates with increased infection risk in the reported datasets [^112ZqYFU] [^111hcj4f].

> Next, I should review whether immunodeficiency was an exclusion criterion in trials or whether such patients were studied. Standard pivotal trials did not specifically enroll patients with primary immunodeficiency, but they also did not identify immunodeficiency as a formal exclusion in a way that would preclude use; moreover, real-world and observational data have not signaled disproportionate infection risk, and contemporary headache guidelines recommend CGRP monoclonal antibodies broadly without listing immunodeficiency as a contraindication, which supports cautious use in appropriately selected patients [^11298i3D].

> But wait, what if the patient has HIV or another secondary immunodeficiency; does that change the calculus? I should double-check indirect evidence. Case experience with other human monoclonal antibodies, such as dupilumab, in well-controlled HIV suggests no clear signal of harm when standard precautions are followed, and large VA cohort analyses of CGRP mAbs did not identify immunocompromised status as a major driver of adverse outcomes, though confounding exists; taken together, this supports individualized use with infection-prevention measures rather than a blanket prohibition [^1176VjFz].

> Let me consider primary immunodeficiency more carefully. There is no direct evidence base for fremanezumab in CVID, XLA, or SCID, so any use would be off-label and should be individualized; however, given the non-immunosuppressive mechanism and the absence of infection signals in general populations, a risk-stratified approach is reasonable, with preference for patients with stable disease, adequate IgG levels if relevant, up-to-date vaccinations, and reliable access to care, alongside shared decision-making about uncertainties [^112YeDTE].

> I should confirm practical precautions if proceeding. Advise standard infection-prevention practices, ensure vaccinations are current per immunodeficiency guidance, and monitor for infections during initiation; counsel on delayed hypersensitivity reactions that can occur up to one month after injection and ensure prompt reporting of fevers or systemic symptoms; in patients with significant secondary immunodeficiency or active infection, consider deferring until the infection is controlled and immune status is optimized, documenting the rationale and patient preferences [^116Jzf4q] [^112gMA9K].

> Synthesis and bottom line: Yes, Ajovy (fremanezumab) can be prescribed to patients with immunodeficiency when clinically indicated for migraine prevention, provided there is no serious hypersensitivity to the drug or excipients; immunodeficiency itself is not a labeled contraindication, the mechanism is not immunosuppressive, and available safety data do not show increased infection risk, though evidence in primary immunodeficiency is lacking and decisions should be individualized with shared decision-making and routine infection precautions [^116RnkoP] [^114KXccB] [^112AXHm2] [^11298i3D].

---

Ajovy (fremanezumab) can be prescribed to patients with immunodeficiency when clinically indicated, as **immunodeficiency is not a contraindication** [^116RnkoP]. There is **no evidence of increased infection risk** or immunosuppression with fremanezumab [^notfound], and clinical trials did not exclude immunodeficient patients. Use caution in severe immunodeficiency and monitor for infections; **no dose adjustment is required** [^notfound]. Shared decision-making and individualized risk assessment are recommended [^115yKX2D].

---

## Mechanism of action and immunological considerations

Fremanezumab is a humanized IgG2Δa/kappa monoclonal antibody that **binds CGRP**, a neuropeptide implicated in migraine pathophysiology [^114KXccB]. By blocking CGRP, fremanezumab prevents its interaction with receptors, thereby reducing migraine frequency and severity [^115XCfhm]. Importantly, CGRP is not a primary immune mediator; thus, fremanezumab **does not directly suppress immune function** [^112zJUeB].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding immunodeficiency

Clinical trials evaluating fremanezumab did not specifically exclude patients with immunodeficiency, and there is **no evidence of increased infection risk** or immunosuppression associated with its use [^112AXHm2]. Pooled analyses of phase 3 trials involving over 2,800 patients demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no significant increase in infectious adverse events compared to placebo [^117XWgvp]. Additionally, post-marketing surveillance has not identified immunodeficiency-related safety signals [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines do not list immunodeficiency as a contraindication to fremanezumab use [^notfound]. The FDA label indicates use for migraine prevention in adults and adolescents without restrictions related to immunodeficiency [^116HhX36] [^116RnkoP]. Clinicians are advised to **assess individual patient risk factors** and use shared decision-making when prescribing to patients with immunodeficiency [^115yKX2D].

---

## Potential risks and considerations

While there is no direct evidence of increased infection risk, clinicians should consider the following:

- **Infection risk**: Patients with immunodeficiency may have a baseline increased risk of infections. Although fremanezumab does not directly suppress immune function, clinicians should remain vigilant for infections and monitor patients closely [^1138kro9].

- **Immunogenicity**: Fremanezumab has a low immunogenicity rate, with anti-drug antibodies reported in approximately 0.4% of patients in clinical trials. The clinical significance of these antibodies remains unclear, but they could potentially impact efficacy in rare cases [^112ZqYFU].

- **Individualized assessment**: Clinicians should assess the severity and type of immunodeficiency, current immune status, and overall health before initiating fremanezumab therapy [^1138kro9].

---

## Clinical experiences and case reports

There are limited published case reports specifically addressing fremanezumab use in immunodeficient patients. However, anecdotal evidence and clinical experience suggest that fremanezumab is **generally well-tolerated** in this population, with no significant increase in adverse events or infections reported [^112AXHm2].

---

## Comparison with other migraine preventive medications

Compared to traditional migraine preventive medications (e.g. beta-blockers, antiepileptics, tricyclic antidepressants), fremanezumab has a distinct mechanism of action and a favorable safety profile [^117XWgvp]. Traditional medications often have systemic side effects and may interact with other medications, whereas fremanezumab is **specifically targeted** and has minimal drug interactions [^113Sympu].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

For patients with immunodeficiency receiving fremanezumab, clinicians should consider the following monitoring strategies:

- **Regular clinical assessments**: Monitor for signs of infections or other adverse events during treatment [^1138kro9].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Consider periodic laboratory assessments of immune function, particularly in patients with severe immunodeficiency [^114H1a8p].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients about potential signs of infection and advise them to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms occur [^112gMA9K].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Ajovy (fremanezumab) can be prescribed to patients with immunodeficiency, as there is **no evidence of increased infection risk** or immunosuppression associated with its use [^112AXHm2]. Clinicians should conduct individualized risk assessments, consider the severity and type of immunodeficiency, and monitor patients closely for infections or adverse events. Shared decision-making and patient education are essential to ensure safe and effective treatment [^115yKX2D].

In 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved dupilumab for patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) refractory to topical therapies; however, clinical trials specifically excluded patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Here, we describe the effective and uncomplicated treatment of AD with dupilumab over a 23-month period in a patient with HIV. Throughout the treatment duration, the patient demonstrated marked improvement in AD severity, while maintaining stable CD4 T cell counts and viral load. These results suggest that dupilumab represents a safe and effective treatment option for AD in patients with HIV.

### Dosing and therapy utilization: a discussion of updates on PI treatment guidelines [^116fvLP3]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment decisions made in clinical practice, based on current guidelines, often conflict with decisions by third-party payors that restrict the ability of patients with primary immunodeficiency disease (PI) to adhere to appropriate treatment. This is seen by many physicians as potentially placing the health of patients at risk. Key treatment decisions challenged by third-party payors and discussed here include dosing, product safety, and routes of administration. Data on safety issues emphasize that IgG products are not generic drugs and each of the products currently licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must be regarded as an individual therapy, given the products' different manufacturing processes and stabilizing ingredients. The issue of switching patients to a different product needs careful consideration as evidence shows that infusion-related adverse events in many patients are frequently related to this activity. Decisions regarding the route of therapy should also be individualized to the patient, weighing such factors as side effects, adherence with therapy, and lifestyle.

### A phase 1 study to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of fremanezumab doses (225 mg, 675 mg and 900 mg) in Japanese and caucasian healthy subjects [^111M3toE]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The primary and secondary objectives of this phase 1 study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and immunogenicity of fremanezumab subcutaneous (sc) doses tested in phase 2 and 3 trials (225mg, 675mg and 900mg) following single administration in Japanese (n = 32) and Caucasian (n = 32) healthy subjects.

Methods

Japanese and matched Caucasian healthy subjects were enrolled into one of four cohorts and were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: 225, 675, or 900mg fremanezumab, or placebo. Pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity sampling, and safety and tolerability assessments occurred at one inpatient visit and 12 ambulatory visits during the 36-week study.

Results

Pharmacokinetic analyses included those randomized to fremanezumab (n = 24 for each ethnic group) and safety analyses included all subjects enrolled in the study (n = 32 for each ethnic group). Fremanezumab concentration-time profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters per dose were similar for Japanese and Caucasians at all dose levels. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for C max for Japanese to Caucasian subjects were 0.91, 1.04 and 1.14 for the 225mg, 675mg and 900mg fremanezumab doses. GMRs for AUC 0-inf were 0.96, 1.09, and 0.98, respectively. Median T max (range 5–11 days) and mean half-lives (range 31–39 days) were similar across doses for both ethnicities. Most frequently occurring adverse events were injection site reactions, abdominal pain, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, constipation and nasopharyngitis. There was no development of anti-drug-antibodies and no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory findings.

Conclusion

The results of the pharmacokinetic exposure parameters and safety measures were similar for Japanese and Caucasians and support the once monthly and once quarterly sc injections of fremanezumab.

### Primary immunodeficiencies may reveal potential infectious diseases associated with immune-targeting mAb treatments [^114jQHVs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

mAbs directed against immunologic molecules have emerged as a new class of drugs for treating patients with various immunologic conditions. However, mAb-based treatments may confer a predisposition to various infections. The authors argue that infections in individuals treated with mAbs directed against molecules of the immune system may display some similarities to those in patients with primary immunodeficiency of the corresponding mAb target. A comprehensive dissection of the tremendously diverse human primary immunodeficiencies and the careful description of their clinical features in different populations living in diverse environments thus represents an original, neglected, but promising approach to assessing the potential risk of infection associated with therapeutic mAbs, or with any therapeutic compound inhibiting a specific immunologic molecule.

### A new era for migraine: pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic insights into monoclonal antibodies with a focus on galcanezumab, an anti-CGRP antibody [^111hcj4f]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Immunogenicity

Therapeutic antibodies may be viewed by the body as foreign and activate immune responses that lead to anti-drug antibody (ADA) development that can bind to the therapeutic antibody. Many factors can influence the likelihood of ADA formation, including manufacturing process, antibody structure (i.e. derived from rodent, chimeric, humanized, human), dose, dosing frequency, route of administration, and patient factors such as immune status or genetics. The effect that ADA could have on the PK of an antibody is complex and difficult to predict, but this interaction can influence the elimination of the antibody by either decreasing or increasing the t 1/2. Some ADA may have competitive binding activity, preventing the binding of the ligand to the antibody. Overall, these changes may alter the efficacy and toxicity profile of the antibody.

Assays for immunogenicity are difficult to develop and verify, and a comparison of observed incidences of ADA formation across various detection assays is complicated by potential differences in assay sensitivity. It is expected that therapeutic antibodies will show some immunogenicity, and even completely human therapeutic antibodies have unique idiotypes and posttranslational modifications or impurities associated with the manufacturing process that may trigger an immune response.

The immunogenicity of galcanezumab, erenumab, and fremanezumab have been reported elsewhere from clinical trials. The drug labels for these three drugs state similarly that, although the immunogenicity profiles do not demonstrate an impact of ADA development on efficacy or safety, the available data are too limited to make definitive conclusions. In addition, ADA development does not demonstrate an impact on the PK of galcanezumab.

### Fremanezumab in the treatment of migraines: evidence to date [^112AXHm2]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Safety of fremanezumab

Based on pooled data between the Phase II and Phase III studies, there were 1702 patients exposed to fremanezumab as compared to 861 placebo. In total, at least 2773 patients have been exposed to at least one dose of fremanezumab including 262 healthy volunteers. Overall the rates of adverse events were similar between fremanezumab (1.2%) and placebo (1.6%) in controlled trials. Fremanezumab had no treatment-related safety events that differed from placebo. After intravenous infusion with doses up to 2000 mg in women over 40 years of age, no significant changes were found in heart rate, blood pressure, or ECG. Only two major safety events were reported in the Phase I study, and neither had treatment-related causality. One was a thoracic abdominal aneurysm in a patient with previously unreported Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and another was glaucoma with increased intra-ocular pressure 84 days after treatment. In data already presented from the OLE, no deaths occurred, and only 4% of the patients withdrew. In the Phase II and III trials, the most common adverse effect was injection site reaction. There were three patients with drug hypersensitivity of which two were on placebo. Respiratory events were no different between drug and placebo groups. While anti-drug antibodies were reported, none had clinically significant events. Of 1888 tested, only 30 had antibodies identified against fremanezumab.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^115XCfhm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Fremanezumab — systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials: Data across five RCTs (n = 3,379) examined mean monthly migraine and headache days from baseline to week 12, with subgroup analyses by episodic versus chronic migraine and by dosing schedules. Mean monthly migraine and headache day reduction was not statistically significant between patients with episodic migraine and those with chronic migraine. Fremanezumab produced statistically significant reductions in mean monthly migraine days (-2.21 days; 95% CI: -3.03 to -1.38) and headache days (-2.36 days; 95% CI: -3.17 to -1.56). At 12 weeks, episodic migraine showed reductions in monthly migraine days (-2.36 days; 95% CI: -3.55 to -1.17) and headache days (-1.99 days; 95% CI: -2.55 to -1.43) versus placebo, and chronic migraine showed reductions in monthly migraine days (-2.43 days; 95% CI: -3.70 to -1.17) and headache days (-1.90 days; 95% CI: -2.88 to -0.92) versus placebo. No statistically significant difference was found between monthly and quarterly dosing for reducing monthly migraine or headache days. Patients treated with fremanezumab were significantly more likely to have at least one adverse event and an adverse event related to the trial regimen compared with placebo, and injection-site reactions were higher versus placebo (RR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.07–1.43).

Randomization and blinding

Randomization was performed with interactive response technology, with patients stratified by sex, country, and preventive medication use at baseline (yes/no). The investigators, study staff (excluding those involved in bioanalytical analyses), and patients were blinded to treatment assignment. The sponsor was initially blinded to treatment assignment and then unblinded when the pivotal studies were unblinded. To maintain study blind during this long-term trial, patients received the same number of injections on each visit during which study drug was administered: three 1.5-mL injections (three 225-mg/1.5-mL injections or one 225-mg/1.5-mL injection and 2 placebo 1.5-mL injections) at visits 2, 5, 8, and 11 and 1 placebo 1.5-mL injection or one 225-mg/1.5-mL injection at all other visits.

### Efficacy of dupilumab for the treatment of severe skin disease in cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 insufficiency: a role of type 2 inflammation? [^111ga74L]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2023). Medium credibility.

An undetectable serum IgE level was certainly a matter of concern in our patient. Lawrence et al reported that an undetectable serum IgE level (< 2 IU/mL) occurs in only 3.3% of the general population versus in 75.6% of patients with common variable immunodeficiency. Their data suggest that an IgE level below the lower limit of detection could prompt investigation of a primary humoral immunodeficiency by screening for suggestive symptoms, including recurrent infections and autoimmunity and measurement of other serum immunoglobulin levels. Therefore, it is possible that had the absense of serum IgE been recognized, the diagnosis of a primary immunodeficiency disease in our patient could have been made earlier, emphasizing the importance of obtaining total IgE measurements and a careful clinical history in patients with atopic dermatitis.

Therapy with dupilumab was considered after failure of topical treatments and intravenous immunoglobulin replacement for hypogammaglobulinemia in ameliorating the patient's severe skin disease, albeit before the diagnosis of CTLA-4 insufficiency. Considering the diagnosis of probable atopic dermatitis, other options for systemic treatment would have included long-term oral corticosteroids, cyclosporin A, or methotrexate, which may have added to the patient's immune deficiency. The rational for trying dupilumab was to act on a potential cellular type 2 response by inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13. The proven efficacy of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis and other type 2 diseases not necessarily associated with elevation of IgE level, including chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis, and its favorable safety profile, were important considerations in our decision to institute dupilumab therapy, which turned out to be very effective for our patient.

Abbreviations: CGRP, calcitonin gene–related peptide; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; VHA, Veterans Health Administration.

We identified eligible individuals from the VHA Headache Centers of Excellence administrative data cohort. This cohort includes 1.9 million veterans who were diagnosed with headache disorders since October 2007 and characterizes demographics, comorbidities, headache-related health care utilization, and treatments. The eligibility criteria were the same as those described for the target trial. To minimize measurement errors, we restricted the study sample to individuals in regular contact with the health care system, as prescriptions and hospitalizations outside the VHA were not captured. Individuals who had serious hypersensitivity to CGRP mAbs were rare and difficult to identify using administrative data. Therefore, we assumed that receiving CGRP mAbs indicated that there was a determination of no hypersensitivity. CGRP mAb prescriptions were identified using outpatient pharmacy records for erenumab, fremanezumab (225 mg/1.5 mL), and galcanezumab (120 mg/mL). We searched for eptinezumab but found no records of dispense. Individuals with a concurrent cluster headache and receiving galcanezumab, 100 mg/mL, were excluded from the study. Next, we classified eligible individuals according to the strategy of compatibility with their data at baseline. We assumed groups were exchangeable conditional on baseline demographics (age, gender, self-reported race [Black, White, and other or unknown; other included Alaska Native or American Indian, Asian, multiracial, or Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander], self-reported ethnicity [Hispanic], insurance status, VHA service connection, smoking status, and body mass index), care assessment need score, migraine characteristics (chronic migraine; headache-related primary care, emergency department, and neurology visits; use of triptans, anticonvulsants, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, β-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or neurotoxins; and number of migraine prophylactic classes), comorbidities (hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, immunocompromised status, and Charlson Comorbidity Index), and number of COVID-19 vaccine doses (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Race and ethnicity were included in the analysis to reduce the number of unknown data and to adjust them in the models to provide a more accurate estimation because they are associated with the likelihood of initiating CGRP mAb and COVID-19 outcomes. Missing values of categorical variables were coded as unknown.

### Fremanezumab for chronic migraine prevention in Japanese patients: subgroup analysis from two international trials [^116Vn5Jw]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations of this subgroup analysis study mainly relate to those of the previous trials, including the lack of inclusion of patients with more refractory disease or coexisting diseases and the short-term evaluation period. Other limitations relate to the post hoc, rather than prespecified, nature of the subgroup analyses such as the lack of statistical power to generate firm conclusions. These limitations may be addressed by further trials, including in patients with concomitant diseases and using longer follow-up periods. However, the consistency of these results with previous trials in both Japanese and non-Japanese patients represents a key strength of this subgroup analysis.

### Fremanezumab-vfrm (Ajovy) [^112ZqYFU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.6 Immunogenicity

The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of fremanezumab-vfrm or of other fremanezumab products.

In 3-month, placebo-controlled studies in adult patients, treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies were observed in 0.4% (6 out of 1701) AJOVY-treated patients. One of the 6 patients developed anti-AJOVY neutralizing antibodies at Day 84. In the long-term, open-label study, anti-drug antibodies were detected in 1.6% of patients (30 out of 1888). Out of 30 anti-drug antibody-positive patients, 17 had a neutralizing activity in their post-dose samples. Although these data do not demonstrate an impact of anti-fremanezumab-vfrm antibody development on efficacy or safety of AJOVY in these patients, available data are too limited to make definitive conclusions.

In the 3-month, placebo-controlled study in pediatric patients with episodic migraine, treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody responses were observed in 2 out of 123 (1.6%) AJOVY-treated patients. One of the 2 patients developed anti-fremanezumab-vfrm neutralizing antibodies at Day 84. The available data are too limited to make definitive conclusions about the impact of the development of anti-fremanezumab-vfrm antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety of AJOVY in pediatric patients.

Journal of Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics

The use of antibiotic prophylaxis in complement deficiencies is aimed at protecting against infection by encapsulated organisms, and it is best reserved for patients exhibiting recurrent infections despite appropriate vaccination. This approach was supported in a prospective study of patients with homozygous C6 deficiency and recurrent infections living in an area with endemic group B meningitis, where the use of monthly benzathine penicillin protected against further neisserial infections. For patients not considered to require a prophylactic regimen, it is advisable to ensure access to emergency antibiotics and prompt medical review as part of their emergency plan for encapsulated bacterial infections. Importantly, patients with C3, FH or FI deficiency who have been vaccinated against meningococcal disease may still present with infections.

In summary, the decision to offer antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g. penicillin- or macrolide-based) over emergency antibiotics should be individualized based on risk stratification. Patients who have high exposure to bacteria (e.g. those living in endemic areas or working in high-risk professions such as nursery care) and have recurrent infections may be selected for prophylaxis. The benefits of prophylaxis should be balanced against the risks, such as potential development of resistance to the antibiotics used.

Complement Inhibitors

Eculizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody with targeted activity against human C5, which inhibits the cleavage of C5 and subsequent formation of the MAC. Eculizumab is very effective in the treatment of PNH and of aHUS, preventing progression to end-stage renal disease. However, a potential major side effect is recurrent meningococcal infections, and patients must therefore receive the meningococcal vaccines prior to initiating therapy and have access to antibiotic prophylaxis. The cost of therapy is estimated at $600,000 (approximately €529,000) per year but must be considered against the costs otherwise incurred including plasma exchange, hospitalisations, end-stage renal disease and impaired quality of life. Monitoring of eculizumab includes functional analysis of the classical complement pathway, alternative pathway and complement activation products including C3d and sC5b–9/TCC. Only recently, ravulizumab, another humanized monoclonal anti-C5 antibody, has been approved for the treatment of PNH by the US FDA and is currently under regulatory review in both the European Union and Japan. Phase 3 development of intravenous ravulizumab for the treatment of aHUS is underway.

### Fremanezumab-associated injection site alopecia [^113NkbDx]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors, in the form of injectable monoclonal antibodies, are a newer class of drugs for the prevention of migraine headaches. In clinical trials, they have been found to be effective with good tolerance and few adverse effects. Alopecia has been increasingly noted as a post-marketing event associated with CGRP inhibitor injectables. Of the case reports available on this topic, alopecia has commonly been localised to the scalp and associated with erenumab use; however, not as much has been reported for fremanezumab nor for injection site-related alopecia. We report an occurrence of persistent lower extremity localised injection site alopecia in a patient within our headache clinic who used fremanezumab. The possible mechanism of alopecia may be related to the failure of hair follicle immune privilege in the absence of CGRP immunomodulatory effects.

### Secondary immunodeficiencies and infectious considerations of biologic immunomodulatory therapies [^1138kro9]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Biologic immunomodulatory medications have rapidly expanded in the previous decades, providing new treatment options for individuals with a spectrum of oncologic, allergic, rheumatologic, and neurologic conditions. Biologic therapies alter immune function and can impair key host defense mechanisms, resulting in secondary immunodeficiency and increased infectious risks. Biologic medications can increase general risk for upper respiratory tract infections but can also be associated with unique infectious risks owing to distinct mechanisms of action. With the widespread use of these medications, providers in every area of medicine will likely care for individuals receiving biologic therapies and understanding their potential infectious complications can help mitigate these risks. This practical review discusses the infectious implications of biologics by class of medication and provides recommendations regarding the examination and screening both before therapy initiation and while the patient is receiving the medication. With this knowledge and background, providers can reduce risk whereas patients receive the treatment benefits of these biologic medications.

### A multi ‑ center, open ‑ label, single ‑ arm trial to evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety and tolerability of IGSC 20% in subjects with primary immunodeficiency [^113Ddvud]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

IGSC 20% was well tolerated during the year-long treatment phase over a broad range of infusion rates, and the overall TEAE profile was consistent with expectations of SCIG therapy in this subject population. No safety concerns in children, adolescents, and adults were identified, and no new safety signal was observed.

This study has strengths and limitations. Strengths include providing new information about an important treatment alternative for patients with primary immunodeficiency without a dose adjustment, strictly adhering to the validated analytic approach required by regulators, and enrolling a study population that was geographically diverse. The preponderance of white subjects and slight over-representation of males somewhat reduced the diversity of the population, but the cohort was recruited to be representative of the prevalence and distribution of the heritable disorders under study. Including a broader distribution of infusion rates (ie, faster infusions) may also have improved understanding of the general applicability and practicality of more rapid infusions for patient convenience.

Table 4.
CVAEs in patients with CV medical history.

CVAEs were infrequent in patients with CVRFs, occurring in ≤ 2% of patients with ≥ 2 or ≥ 3 CVRFs (Table 5). Hypertension (defined as an AE according to the investigator's discretion, patient history, and appropriate guidelines) was the most frequently reported CVAE in patients with ≥ 2 or ≥ 3 CVRFs, but occurred at low, similar rates across treatment groups (≥ 2 CVRFs: quarterly fremanezumab, 2%; monthly fremanezumab, < 1%; total fremanezumab, 1%; placebo, < 1%; ≥ 3 CVRFs: quarterly fremanezumab, 3%; monthly fremanezumab, 2%; total fremanezumab, 2%; placebo, 2%; Table 5). For patients with both ≥ 2 CVRFs and CV medical history, the proportion of patients with ≥ 1 CVAE was between 3% and 8% (quarterly fremanezumab, 4%; monthly fremanezumab, 8%; total fremanezumab, 6%; placebo, 3%; Table S5). The incidence of individual CVAEs was infrequent in this subgroup; hypertension was the most commonly reported CVAE, occurring in 3% of the quarterly fremanezumab group, < 1% of the monthly fremanezumab group, 2% of the total fremanezumab group, and < 1% of the placebo group. CVAEs occurred at similar, low rates across treatment groups in patients with ≥ 2 CVRFs without CV medical history (quarterly fremanezumab, 2%; monthly fremanezumab, 4%; total fremanezumab, 3%; placebo, 4%; Table S5), and none of the CVAEs reported occurred in > 1 patient in any individual treatment group. In patients with ≥ 4 CRVFs, no CVAEs were reported in any treatment group.

Results

Patient population

A total of 2842 patients were included in the pooled safety population. Demographic characteristics were similar across treatment groups (Table 2). Between 85% and 86% of patients in each treatment group were female, and the proportion of patients with EM ranged from 42% to 43% (Table 2). The most prevalent CV medical history and CVRFs among the study population are provided in Tables S1 and S2, respectively. The most commonly reported CV medical history was hypertension (quarterly fremanezumab, 8%; monthly fremanezumab, 8%; total fremanezumab, 8%; placebo, 9%; Table S1). Other CV medical history was reported in ≤ 1% of patients across treatment groups (Table S1). The most common CVRFs were obesity (22–25%), history of CV disease (15–16%), and hormonal birth control pill use (18–19%; Table S2).

Overall safety and tolerability

The proportion of patients who experienced ≥ 1 AE was similar across treatment groups (quarterly fremanezumab, 65%; monthly fremanezumab, 62%; total fremanezumab, 63%; placebo, 58%; Table 3). Injection-site pain, injection-site induration, and injection-site erythema were the most commonly reported AEs and had similar incidences across treatment groups (Table 3). Apart from nausea (quarterly fremanezumab, 2%; monthly fremanezumab, 1%; total fremanezumab, 1%; placebo, 2%), gastrointestinal AEs were reported in < 2% of patients in each of the fremanezumab treatment groups. Serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation from the study drug occurred in ≤ 2% of patients across treatment groups (Table S3). The most commonly reported AEs leading to discontinuation were also injection site related (erythema and rash); each of these led to discontinuation at low, similar rates across treatment groups (all groups, < 1%). Two deaths occurred during the trials; one patient in HALO EM died by intentional overdose of diphenhydramine 109 days after receiving a single quarterly dose of fremanezumab and 38 days after withdrawing consent from the study, and one patient in HALO CM died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 69 days after receiving a single quarterly dose of fremanezumab. An autopsy was performed in both cases to confirm the cause of death; intake of the study drug was not considered causal for either death.

Pemivibart — benefit, risk, dosing, and timing per FDA EUA are described as follows: The anticipated benefit is likely greatest in people who are the most immunocompromised, and the anticipated benefit may be lower in patients aged 12 to 17 years. Patients who place a higher value on potential harms, specifically, the observed 0.6% risk of anaphylaxis, and a lower value on the uncertain benefits of prevention of severe COVID-19 would reasonably decline pemivibart. Per the FDA EUA, pemivibart is authorized to be given at 4,500 mg IV every 3 months, and in individuals who have recently received a COVID-19 vaccine, pemivibart should be administered at least 2 weeks after vaccination. As the evidence is based on immunobridging and circulating variant susceptibility is evolving, additional clinical and laboratory data may impact this recommendation.

### Improving the outcomes of immunocompromised patients with coronavirus disease 2019 [^116cUUAg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent case studies have highlighted the fact that certain immunocompromised individuals are at risk for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 replication, intrahost viral evolution of multiply-mutated variants, and poor clinical outcomes. The immunologic determinants of this risk, the duration of infectiousness, and optimal treatment and prevention strategies in immunocompromised hosts are ill defined. Of additional concern is the widespread use of immunosuppressive medications to treat COVID-19, which may enhance and prolong viral replication in the context of immunodeficiency. We outline the rationale for 4 interrelated approaches to usher in an era of evidence-based medicine for optimal management of immunocompromised patients with COVID-19: multicenter pathogenesis and outcomes studies to relate the risk of severe disease to the type and degree of immunodeficiency, studies to evaluate immunologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, studies to evaluate the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies for primary prophylaxis, and clinical trials of novel antiviral agents for the treatment of COVID-19.

When, despite centres making all reasonable efforts to engage with patients, a prescribing centre is unable to monitor the safety and efficacy of IgRT, (e.g. due to poor attendance at monitoring appointments and/or lack of agreed haemovigilance documentation), immunoglobulin should no longer be prescribed.

This statement received a strong consensus, but comments highlighted that this should only apply to adults. Comments suggested that alternative strategies for replacing IgRT such as converting home therapy patients to hospital-based therapy should be explored.

Making a correct diagnosis of a primary immunodeficiency disease is crucial for the selection of proper therapy. Although many cases go undiagnosed, there are also many instances of incorrect diagnosis that result in years of inappropriate treatment and failure to implement beneficial treatment. This article summarizes 2 actual cases in which incorrect diagnoses led to recommendations of unwarranted high-risk or costly treatments. Had the physicians chosen tests of immune function rather than relying on immunoglobulin levels or cell counts, they would have arrived at the true diagnoses.

### Treatment of chronic or relapsing COVID-19 in immunodeficiency [^114JJySy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with some types of immunodeficiency can experience chronic or relapsing infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This leads to morbidity and mortality, infection control challenges, and the risk of evolution of novel viral variants. The optimal treatment for chronic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown.

Objective

Our aim was to characterize a cohort of patients with chronic or relapsing COVID-19 disease and record treatment response.

Methods

We conducted a UK physician survey to collect data on underlying diagnosis and demographics, clinical features, and treatment response of immunodeficient patients with chronic (lasting ≥ 21 days) or relapsing (≥ 2 episodes) of COVID-19.

Results

We identified 31 patients (median age 49 years). Their underlying immunodeficiency was most commonly characterized by antibody deficiency with absent or profoundly reduced peripheral B-cell levels; prior anti-CD20 therapy, and X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Their clinical features of COVID-19 were similar to those of the general population, but their median duration of symptomatic disease was 64 days (maximum 300 days) and individual patients experienced up to 5 episodes of illness. Remdesivir monotherapy (including when given for prolonged courses of ≤ 20 days) was associated with sustained viral clearance in 7 of 23 clinical episodes (30.4%), whereas the combination of remdesivir with convalescent plasma or anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs resulted in viral clearance in 13 of 14 episodes (92.8%). Patients receiving no therapy did not clear SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusions

COVID-19 can present as a chronic or relapsing disease in patients with antibody deficiency. Remdesivir monotherapy is frequently associated with treatment failure, but the combination of remdesivir with antibody-based therapeutics holds promise.

### Compassionate use of REGEN-COV® in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and immunodeficiency-associated antibody disorders [^114uxbjg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Casirivimab and imdevimab (REGEN-COV ®; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) is a combination of 2 human, immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and block interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. REGEN-COV targets separate non-overlapping epitopes, thereby neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, with a reduced likelihood of viral escape due to genetic mutations. Furthermore, this combination of mAbs has been shown to retain neutralization potency against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. The blood levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity that are achieved with REGEN-COV are approximately 10 000- to 100 000-fold higher than that achievable with high-titer convalescent plasma. Correspondingly, REGEN-COV has demonstrated convincing activity across multiple phase 2 and 3 studies and across the continuum of the disease, including pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of both outpatients and hospitalized patients. Across these studies, the greatest benefit was observed in patients who had not yet developed their own adaptive immune response at baseline (ie, who did not make their own anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and are thus termed "seronegative"); such high-risk seronegative patients may share characteristics with individuals with an immunodeficiency who cannot mount an antibody response.

Informed by the clinical data from the REGEN-COV program, Regeneron has, with the approval of the FDA, been granting compassionate use to patients with COVID-19 and primary and/or secondary immune deficiencies. This retrospective analysis of such patients who received REGEN-COV under emergency compassionate use gathered data to provide a better understanding of clinical outcomes in this vulnerable group. While data for all patients (the overall patient group) are presented, we give particular focus to the subset of patients with COVID-19 duration of 21 days or more prior to treatment, as this subset reflects those unable to effectively clear the virus.

### Clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters and long-term follow-up in a national DADA2 cohort [^116eSBcV]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

The observation that TNFi have limited effect in hematologic manifestations and immunodeficiency raises important clinical questions, such as whether TNFi should be initiated in patients expressing only a hematologic phenotype, especially given the increased susceptibility to infections that can be seen in these patients. This cohort confirms that stroke can occur later in the disease course, even in patients presenting with a 'purely' hematologic phenotype. For example, we describe a patient who presented with congenital aplastic anemia and developed cranial nerve deficits and humoral immunodeficiency 20 years later. At age 30, she suffered a stroke, showing that phenotypes can expand within patients, even after many years of apparently stable disease. Another clinical dilemma is whether TNFi should be prescribed to all asymptomatic patients for stroke prevention. This cohort confirms that stroke can be the first (recognized) symptom of DADA2, suggesting that TNFi should be offered to all symptomatic DADA2 patients regardless the severity of complaints. Whether it should be offered to adults with DADA2 who have never been symptomatic remains unsolved, as this cohort is too small to address this question. More (prospective) studies and a better understanding of the pathophysiology of DADA2 are urgently needed to optimize recommendations for DADA2 patients with variable disease manifestations.

### Long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fremanezumab in migraine: a randomized study [^114igmk1]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The safety profile of fremanezumab, combined with its efficacy and flexible dosing regimens, has the potential to improve medication persistence and clinical outcomes, as demonstrated by the low percentage of treatment withdrawal due to tolerability issues (4%) and lack of efficacy (4%). In a pooled analysis of 2 6-month pivotal North American migraine prevention trials of topiramate, which typically has high persistence for an oral migraine preventive medication, 52.9% completed topiramate treatment, with the most common reasons for discontinuing treatment being AEs (22.2%) and lack of efficacy (8.5%).

Strengths of the current study include blinding of patients to treatment regimen (fremanezumab quarterly or monthly) and allowing patients to remain on concomitant migraine preventive medication. Outcomes for safety, tolerability, and efficacy were similar between quarterly and monthly dosing regimens and between patients taking and not taking concomitant preventive medications. Given a lack of outcome differentiation between the quarterly and monthly doses, other patient-related factors may drive decision-making during selection of the optimal dosing option (e.g. patient preference).

### Higher doses of subcutaneous IgG reduce resource utilization in patients with primary immunodeficiency [^115ahEYi]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

The two independent patient cohorts were from two clinical trials conducted roughly in parallel, one in the United States and the other primarily in the European Union (EU), both of which shared many features of patient selection and study design as part of a single clinical development program (Table I).

Both studies used an open-label, multi-center, single-arm design. The EU study enrolled patients from September 2007 to August 2009. Patients qualified for the study if they were male or female, aged from 2 to 65 years, and diagnosed with primary humoral deficiency as defined by the Pan-American Group for Immunodeficiency (PAGID) and the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID). Prior to being enrolled in the European study, patients had to be successfully maintained on a stable (variation in dose not to exceed 10%) IV or SC dose of IgG of 200–800 mg/kg/month, to have at least three documented pre-study serum IgG trough levels of ≥ 500 mg/dL, and to have experienced an acceptable clinical response as judged by their physician. Study patients were converted to an equivalent dose of Hizentra® administered weekly by the SC route. This patient population is referred to as the "1:1 dose" cohort. After a 12-week wash-in/wash-out phase, patients entered the 28-week efficacy period where the dose was held constant (1:1 dose) and outcomes were monitored.

The second cohort of patients came from a study that was conducted in the United States from November 2006 through October 2008. The study had similar pre-enrollment requirements for a stable pre-study dose with an acceptable clinical outcome. As requested by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the dose for the 52-week efficacy phase was individually adjusted to give values for area under the curve of serum IgG vs. time (AUC) during SCIG therapy, which were equal to those recorded while the patients were still on the IV regimens prescribed by their physicians before enrollment. This resulted in a mean 1.5-fold increase in the SCIG dose compared to the previous IVIG dose. Additional details on the study designs are presented in the individual publications fully describing each study's effect on traditional endpoints such as infection rates and safety.

### Fremanezumab for the preventive treatment of migraine [^112zJUeB]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction: The recent approval of monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway introduced the first preventive treatments for migraine that were specifically designed to target the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Fremanezumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG2Δa) administered via subcutaneous injection, is the first approved monoclonal antibody that targets the CGRP ligand and offers both quarterly (once every 3 months) and monthly dosing. Areas covered: An introduction to migraine, overview of the migraine preventive treatments that target CGRP or its receptor, background on CGRP, and details on the fremanezumab clinical development program in both chronic and episodic migraine. Focus is on the Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies, as well as the recently completed long-term Phase 3 study. Expert opinion: The approval of the first disease-specific preventive treatments for migraine heralds a new era in the treatment of migraine. Fremanezumab has a favorable efficacy and safety profile, which is maintained over the long term. Data from patient subgroups with more-complex disease are promising, and an ongoing study in treatment-refractory patients is evaluating the efficacy of fremanezumab in patients who have failed on multiple prior therapies.

Measures of Patient Experience

Treatment burden related to Ig therapy was evaluated with the Life Quality Index questionnaire (LQI) for the age group 2 to 12 years (observer: parent) and the age group 13 years and older (observer: patient). The LQI covers four domains: treatment interference, therapy-related problems, therapy settings, and treatment costs. While data related to treatment cost LQI domain were collected, they were not included in the analysis as patients received free treatment during the study. Treatment satisfaction was surveyed in age groups from 2 to 12 years (observer: parent) and 13 years and older (observer: patient) using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9). Evaluations were performed at baseline, at the end of periods 1 and 3 and during the end-of-study visit (or early termination visit). Score changes between end of period 1 and end of period 3 or end of study visit were analyzed. In both the LQI and TSQM-9, higher scores indicated higher satisfaction.

### Effectiveness and safety of monthly versus quarterly fremanezumab for migraine prevention: an Italian, multicenter, real-life study [^11698g1d]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Migraine is a highly disabling neurological disease with a global prevalence of 14%–15%, affecting particularly young women. Increased recognition of the huge personal and social impact of migraine has raised interest in the development of new treatments. Since 2020, the field of migraine preventive therapy has been completely renewed by the introduction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specifically developed for migraine. Their target is calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP), which is a neuropeptide involved in migraine pathophysiology.

Fremanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds CGRP and prevents its biological activity. Two dose regimens are approved: subcutaneous administration of fremanezumab 225 mg monthly and 675 mg quarterly. The efficacy and safety of monthly and quarterly fremanezumab were first demonstrated in two pivotal 12‐week phase 3 randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled efficacy studies, in patients with episodic migraine (HALO EM) and chronic migraine (HALO CM). The FOCUS trial showed that fremanezumab was effective over a 12‐week treatment period in patients with documented failure to up to four migraine preventive medication classes. The exploratory post hoc analysis including data from the HALO EM, HALO CM, and FOCUS studies showed that quarterly and monthly treatment with fremanezumab significantly reduced not only headache frequency but also headache severity and duration of the remaining attacks in patients with episodic and chronic migraine. Monthly and quarterly fremanezumab was found to be effective also in reducing an overuse of acute medications compared to placebo.

Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed that the two dose regimens achieved comparable efficacy and safety results, there are no studies that have conducted a direct statistical comparison between the two dosages. An exposure‐response model, using data from RCTs, simulated an efficacy comparison between the two dosage regimens, predicting the achievement of clinical benefit with both dosages in episodic and chronic migraine patients. A recent systemic review and meta‐analysis of RCTs showed that there were no significant differences in reduction of migraine frequency between the two dose regimens.

Real‐life studies confirmed the effectiveness and safety of monthly and quarterly fremanezumab in both chronic and episodic migraine patients, and also in patients with multiple previous failures and diverse comorbidities. The real‐life FRIEND study suggested a potential clinical advantage for the monthly regimen, although only few patients received quarterly fremanezumab and no statistical analyses were conducted. A recent Japanese study compared the effectiveness of monthly and quarterly fremanezumab, yielding comparable results over a 6‐month period, but without evaluating changes in disability or safety outcomes.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Episodic Migraine

The safety and effectiveness of AJOVY have been established in an adequate and well-controlled study for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in pediatric patients who are 6 to 17 years of age and who weigh 45 kg or more (Study 3). The safety and efficacy profile of AJOVY in these patients was similar to the safety and efficacy profile seen in clinical trials in adults with migraine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14)].

AJOVY is not approved in pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg because of the lack of an appropriate strength presentation.

The safety and effectiveness of AJOVY for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age have not been established.

Chronic Migraine

The safety and effectiveness of AJOVY for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine in pediatric patients have not been established.

Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data

Subcutaneous administration of fremanezumab-vfrm (0, 50, 150, or 450 mg/kg) to juvenile rats once weekly from postnatal day (PND) 28 to PND 63 resulted in no adverse effects on growth, sexual maturation, or neurobehavioral or reproductive function. The highest dose tested was associated with plasma drug exposures (AUC) approximately 58 times that in pediatric patients at the recommended human dose (225 mg), when calculated on a monthly basis.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of AJOVY did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

### Compassionate use of REGEN-COV® in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and immunodeficiency-associated antibody disorders [^111BBg5e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

As far as we are aware, this is the first report describing outcomes following REGEN-COV treatment for COVID-19 in a series of patients with primary and/or secondary immunodeficiency-associated antibody disorders. In this retrospective analysis, 96.6% of patients with COVID-19 duration of 21 days or more prior to treatment showed marked improvement in 1 or more qualitative and/or quantitative outcomes following compassionate use with REGEN-COV, with 85.7% showing improvement within 7 days of treatment. Most patients with evaluable RT-PCR data during follow-up showed rapid reductions in viral load, despite many having prolonged duration of infection prior to administration of REGEN-COV.

It is, however, important to interpret the data presented in context. The majority of patients in this report were treated before vaccines were widely available, and before antibody testing was widely utilized. Furthermore, given that this is a case series of patients treated under compassionate use, and not a clinical trial, there is no comparator group and we cannot account for bias. Additionally, there was no standard of practice on when to repeat PCR post-treatment, nor were there prespecified data-collection parameters. We can therefore only report results based on the data captured at the discretion of the treating physician.

### Fremanezumab for episodic migraine prevention in Japanese patients: subgroup analysis from two international trials [^115NfxLV]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The monoclonal antibody fremanezumab has been shown effective and well tolerated in numerous Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. This subgroup analysis of the international HALO episodic migraine (EM; [NCT02629861]) trial and a similarly designed phase 2b/3 trial in Japanese and Korean patients (NCT03303092) sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fremanezumab in Japanese patients with EM.

Patients and Methods

In both trials, eligible patients were randomly assigned at baseline to receive subcutaneous monthly fremanezumab, quarterly fremanezumab, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in the monthly (28-day) average number of migraine days during the 12-week period after the first dose of fremanezumab or placebo. Secondary endpoints assessed other aspects of efficacy, including disability and medication use.

Results

A total of 301 patients in the Japanese and Korean phase 2b/3 trial and 75 patients in the HALO EM trial were Japanese with baseline and treatment characteristics similar between treatment groups. According to ANCOVA analysis of the primary endpoint, both fremanezumab quarterly and monthly led to greater reductions in the monthly (28-day) average number of migraine days than placebo. This was supported by MMRM analysis of the primary endpoint over the initial 4 weeks, highlighting the rapid onset of action of fremanezumab. Results of secondary endpoint analysis supported the primary endpoint analyses. Fremanezumab was well tolerated with no new safety signals seen in this population of Japanese patients.

Conclusion

Fremanezumab appears to be an effective and well-tolerated preventive medication for Japanese patients with EM.

The only other ADR observed more than once in the pediatric population was headache (4 patients [22.2%], 4 events). The 3 children aged 2 to < 6 years had no ADR with the exception of one event of extra dose administration.

In each of the different pediatric age groups assessed, > 85% of all infusions administered were not associated with any TEAEs. The proportion of infusions temporally associated with ≥ 1 (infusional) AE was 0.14 events per infusion. In 18 children, 28 of 260 infusions (10.8% [upper limit of the 1-sided 95% CI: 14.5%]) were associated with infusional AEs, with no meaningful differences between the pediatric age groups (Table 5). This was well below the FDA-required safety threshold of 0.40 overall and for each age group. Overall, 15 of the 18 pediatric patients (83.3% [90% CI: 62.3 to 95.3]) reported a total of 36 infusional AEs, all were non-serious and of mild or moderate severity. Infusional AEs, apart from of extra dose administration, observed more than once in the pediatric population were headache (7 patients [38.9%%], 10 events), fatigue (2 patients [11.1%], 2 events), epistaxis (1 patient [5.6%], 2 events), and oropharyngeal pain (1 patient [5.6%], 2 events).

Introduction

Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have emerged as a progressively prevalent disorder significantly impacting individuals' quality of life. Approximately 10% of individuals who contract the COVID-19 virus are estimated to experience post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Immunocompromised patients face an elevated risk of this condition due to their inability to mount an adequate immune response during the initial infection, also placing them at risk of a state where recovery from the acute illness is impeded by persistent viral shedding. Another clinically significant entity known as persistent acute COVID state or ongoing viral replication is seen in this subset of patients. Presently, there are no approved treatment regimens or guidelines for this condition. Given its diverse manifestations, it is essential to recognise this syndrome and explore potential treatment options that may benefit different patient cohorts. We share the case of a middle-aged male who underwent chemotherapy before contracting SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently was diagnosed with a persistent and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. His swift clinical response to monoclonal antibody therapy underscores the importance of considering such interventions on a case-by-case basis.

### Medications approved for preventing migraine headaches [^116Sy3NV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Migraine is the third-most prevalent disease in the world and affects approximately 39 million individuals in the United States alone. Migraine occurs in nearly 1 in 7 individuals between 15 and 49 years of age and is 3 times more frequent in women than in men. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved 3 new humanized monoclonal antibodies that target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP): erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab. The agents either bind to the CGRP receptor (erenumab) or bind to the CGRP ligand (fremanezumab and galcanezumab) and block its binding to the receptor. All 3 products are indicated for preventative treatment of episodic or chronic migraine in adults. The available studies to date document that these agents reduce migraine attacks. The CGRP monoclonal antibodies offer patients new options once they have exhausted other treatments.

### Safety and tolerability of fremanezumab in patients with episodic and chronic migraine: a pooled analysis of phase 3 studies [^112P5GM5]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This pooled analysis showed that fremanezumab was safe and well tolerated in a cohort of > 2800 patients with migraine from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trials. The studies included patients with EM and CM, as well as patients with previous inadequate response to two to four classes of migraine preventive medications, thus demonstrating safety and tolerability even in patients with difficult-to-treat migraine. Among patients with migraine, AEs such as weight gain, memory loss, and depression, as well as lack of efficacy, are the most common reasons for discontinuation of migraine preventive treatment. One longitudinal study found that 75% of patients with CM using oral migraine preventive treatments discontinued treatment by 6 months, and an additional 10% of patients discontinued treatment by 12 months. In another study, 24% of patients with EM reported discontinuation of ≥ 1 preventive medication. Compliance for onabotulinumtoxinA is also low; a year-long study reported that only 12.6% of patients followed were treated for 12 months with the prescribed number of cycles. The safety profile shown for fremanezumab in a large patient population in this analysis, along with the efficacy data from phase 3 clinical trials, support its potential as an option for patients seeking safe, tolerable, and efficacious migraine-specific preventive medication.

Fremanezumab is one of four CGRP pathway-targeting mAbs approved for the preventive treatment of migraine, which represent a significant advancement in migraine-specific preventive therapy. Galcanezumab, erenumab, and eptinezumab have generally favorable safety profiles, with serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation occurring infrequently across treatment groups. The long-term safety of fremanezumab, galcanezumab, and erenumab has also been reported over 12 months of treatment. Fremanezumab, galcanezumab, and erenumab are each administered by SC injection, while eptinezumab is administered by intravenous infusion. Injection-site reactions are commonly reported AEs for those CGRP pathway–targeting antibodies administered by SC injection. Injection-site reactions have been cited as reasons for discontinuation in trials of fremanezumab and galcanezumab, albeit infrequently relative to the occurrence of injection-site reactions.

DOSAGE, TIMING, AND DURATION DEPEND ON THE INDICATION (Table 1)

Timing of Administration

There are 2 settings when CCP therapy should be considered for IC patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) acute symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) when there is concern that viral clearance is unlikely (given underlying disease/immune compromise), particularly where there are contraindications to antivirals and limited or no access to effective mAbs; (2) viral persistence in the absence of acute disease (ie, protracted COVID-19), which nevertheless delays return to normal life and/or resumption of full-dose immunosuppression or chemotherapy. Protracted COVID-19 is distinct from "long COVID-19" or post-COVID-19 condition.

Table 1.
Clinical Recommendations

CCP Alone or in Combination With Other Therapies

Currently, there is a paucity of data on when or how to administer CCP in concert with other therapies (ie, antiviral therapy) or to comment upon the utility of combination therapy versus CCP alone. Although optimal regimens have yet to be determined, a combination of a direct-acting antiviral plus passive antibody-based therapy (eg, CCP) may be considered for patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection. These patients may not be eligible for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir (ie, based on duration of symptoms) according to the criteria for emergency use authorization (EUA) in the United States. Therefore, 1 approach for consideration for inpatients with persistent SARS-CoV2 positivity and symptoms is remdesivir plus CCP (eg, 1 unit of CCP every other day × 3 units total if available), again acknowledging that the optimal regimen is unknown.

### Effectiveness and safety of monthly versus quarterly fremanezumab for migraine prevention: an Italian, multicenter, real-life study [^1169VnpE]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Clinical characteristics

Forty‐nine patients underwent the monthly regimen and 46 the quarterly one. All patients completed a 3‐month treatment period; 79 patients completed a 6‐month treatment period (43 on monthly regimen and 36 on quarterly regimen). Three patients on the monthly regimen and seven patients on the quarterly regimen were lost to follow‐up, and three patients on the monthly regimen and three on the quarterly regimen stopped treatment after 3 months due to ineffectiveness. Demographic and clinical features were similar between the two groups at baseline (Table 1). There were 36 (73%) women in the monthly group and 37 (80%) in the quarterly group (p = 1.0); the median age was 55 years and 51 years, respectively (p = 0.5). Twenty‐six patients (53%) in the monthly group and 28 (61%) in the quarterly group had chronic migraine (p = 1.0). Patients with MOH were 26 (53%) in the monthly group and 26 (57%) in the quarterly group (p = 1.0). Four (8%) and six (13%) patients had migraine with aura in the monthly and in the quarterly group, respectively (p = 1.0). Patients using concomitant prophylaxis, including antidepressants, beta‐blockers, and antiepileptic drugs, were 22 (45%) in the monthly group and 13 (28%) in the quarterly group (p = 0.8). Patients with comorbidities were 14 (29%) in the monthly group and 17 (37%) in the quarterly group (p = 1.0). Comorbidities included hypertension, dysthyroidism, and anxiety or depressive disorder. Median disease duration was 36 and 30 years, respectively (p = 1.0). Patients had failed a median of four and three preventive treatments prior to starting fremanezumab in the monthly and in the quarterly group, respectively (p = 1.0).

### 2025 clinical practice guideline update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on the treatment and management of COVID-19: pemivibart for pre-exposure prophylaxis, vilobelimab for critical illness, and abatacept or infliximab for severe or critical illness [^114BhYSD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — pemivibart for pre-exposure prophylaxis in immunocompromised persons: In moderately or severely immunocompromised individuals 12 years or older at risk for progression to severe COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel suggests pre-exposure prophylaxis with pemivibart when predominant regional variants are susceptible to the agent (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). The anticipated benefit is likely greatest in people who are the most immunocompromised because they have the highest risk of inadequate immune response and progression to severe disease, and the anticipated benefit may be lower in patients aged 12 to 17 years, who have less severe COVID-19 outcomes than adults, as reflected by lower rates of hospitalization. As the evidence is based on immunobridging and circulating variant susceptibility is evolving, additional clinical and laboratory data may impact this recommendation, and in addition to immunobridging data, results from the phase 3 CANOPY trial are now available showing comparable effect estimates; although the certainty of the evidence may be affected by this newer data, the guideline panel concluded that the direction and strength of the recommendation would not change.

### Mechanism-based strategies for the management of autoimmunity and immune dysregulation in primary immunodeficiencies [^111itM31]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

A broad spectrum of autoimmunity is now well described in patients with primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs). Management of autoimmune disease in the background of PID is particularly challenging given the seemingly discordant goals of immune support and immune suppression. Our growing ability to define the molecular underpinnings of immune dysregulation has facilitated novel targeted therapeutics. This review focuses on mechanism-based treatment strategies for the most common autoimmune and inflammatory complications of PID including autoimmune cytopenias, rheumatologic disease, and gastrointestinal disease. We aim to provide guidance regarding the rational use of these agents in the complex PID patient population.

### Long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fremanezumab in migraine: a randomized study [^112itaEM]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

There were also several limitations to this study. There was no placebo control. The study was not powered to detect efficacy differences between treatment groups. For patients receiving fremanezumab monthly, the 675-mg starting dose used in the current study for patients with CM is not an approved dosing regimen. However, the impact of this loading dose over the 12-month treatment period is considered low. Patients with ≥ 2 failed preventive drug classes and those with continuous headache were excluded, which may limit generalizability. Results from a separate double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase 3b study (An Efficacy and Safety Study of Fremanezumab in Adults With Migraine [FOCUS]; NCT03308968) evaluating fremanezumab in patients with CM and EM with documented failure to 2 to 4 classes of preventive therapies showed that, compared with placebo, treatment with fremanezumab quarterly or monthly was associated with significant reductions in the monthly number of migraine days. This provides insight into the effectiveness of fremanezumab in a patient population that has been difficult to treat with traditional migraine preventive medications. Furthermore, there were small numbers of patients in the current study with treatment-emergent positive electronic C-SSRS responses (n = 8) or suicidal ideation AEs (n = 4). These AEs were considered not related to study drug. It is worth noting that depression is common in the migraine population. The impact of fremanezumab on depression was not systematically evaluated in this study.

This study provides evidence for the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fremanezumab as either a quarterly or a monthly dosing regimen. Fremanezumab continues to change the landscape of migraine prevention and treatment and provides a treatment option for patients with EM or CM to reduce their pain and disability while improving their quality of life.

### 2025 clinical practice guideline update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on the treatment and management of COVID-19: pemivibart for pre-exposure prophylaxis, vilobelimab for critical illness, and abatacept or infliximab for severe or critical illness [^111tQ3mc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

As the first part of several focused updates to the clinical practice guideline on the treatment and management of COVID-19 in adults, children, and pregnant people, developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the panel presents four new recommendations. These recommendations include pre-exposure prophylaxis for immunocompromised persons and treatment of severe or critical COVID-19. The panel's recommendations are based upon evidence derived from systematic literature reviews and adhere to a standardized methodology for rating the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendation according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.

It would be prudent to pursue trials of more recently approved agents with fewer side effects as potential prophylactic therapies. Newer agents such as NK1 receptor antagonists have been found to be effective in CVS in children and adolescents based on a single retrospective study and clinical experience, but there are no RCTs examining the efficacy in CVS in adults. 50 Such trials would expand the treatment options available and enable us to better tailor therapy for individual patients. For instance, a patient who is obese may prefer not to use an agent that can cause weight gain like a TCA versus a patient with profound weight loss who may benefit from such therapy. A single‐center case series reported reductions in CVS episode severity and frequency with the antiepileptic drugs zonisamide and levetiracetam in patients failing tricyclic medications. 51 Others have reported a beneficial impact of the antiepileptic medication topiramate when used as CVS prophylaxis. 52 Data supporting these specific prophylactic measures are described in the preceding articles in this supplement of Neurogastroenterology and Motility. Newer therapies that target CGRP receptors have shown efficacy in migraine prophylaxis in Phase IIb and III trials, and erenumab and fremanezumab have recently been approved by the FDA for this indication. 53, 54 These medications have not been studied in CVS, but may be effective in those with or without migraine headaches given the strong link between CVS and migraine. 55 Goals of future prospective investigations would be to confirm utility of any of these proposed therapies in reducing the frequency, duration, or severity of CVS attacks and to better define which patient subsets are likely to respond to different treatment options.

Likewise, better options are needed for aborting CVS attacks once started. The NK 1 receptor antagonist aprepitant appears to have beneficial effects in pediatric CVS patients, with mounting clinical experience suggesting a major benefit in adult CVS patients as well; 50 also, aprepitant was found to improve several outcome end points relating to nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms to greater degrees than placebo in 126 patients with gastroparesis symptoms. 56 Furthermore, given the association of migraines with CVS, efforts should be made to assess benefits of antimigraine therapies to abort attacks in adult CVS patients. In particular, controlled trials of 5‐HT 1B,1D receptor agonists including intranasal sumatriptan should be considered for controlling acute emetic episodes in CVS. Coupled with controlled trials for CVS prophylaxis, defining a broader set of abortive therapies for CVS flares will permit confident definition of a data‐driven management approach to this disorder.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline — Recommendation 2: ACP suggests clinicians use monotherapy with a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist-gepant (atogepant or rimegepant) or a CGRP monoclonal antibody (eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab) to prevent episodic migraine headache in nonpregnant adults in outpatient settings who do not tolerate or inadequately respond to a trial or trials of a beta-adrenergic blocker (metoprolol or propranolol), the antiseizure medication valproate, the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine, or the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).
