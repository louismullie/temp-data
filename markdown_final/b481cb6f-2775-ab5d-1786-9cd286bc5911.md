## Question

What are the most common causes of increased bilirubin production?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most common causes of increased bilirubin production. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core biochemistry of bilirubin generation from heme. Then, I should verify which clinical scenarios meaningfully increase production beyond the liver's handling capacity. Next, I will prioritize by prevalence and clinical impact, distinguishing neonatal from adult contexts. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, reference-supported answer and double-check for any exceptions or modifiers I might miss.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical basis so I don't jump to conclusions: bilirubin is produced when heme oxygenase degrades heme to biliverdin, which is then reduced to unconjugated bilirubin, with carbon monoxide generated in equimolar amounts. This means increased bilirubin production is mirrored by increased CO production, which becomes clinically relevant for detection of hemolysis in newborns [^b00f005a] [^104cf229].

> Now, I need to identify the principal drivers of increased production. Hemolysis is the dominant cause across ages, with both intravascular and extravascular destruction of red cells increasing the heme load. Ineffective erythropoiesis also contributes, and large hematoma resorption can transiently raise bilirubin load, all yielding unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia when production outpaces hepatic conjugation and excretion [^964a73ce] [^6a130be4] [^d1ad438d].

> Hold on, let's not conflate mechanism with prevalence. I should verify which hemolytic etiologies are most common in adults versus neonates. In adults, autoimmune hemolysis, microangiopathic processes, infections like malaria, and hereditary disorders such as G6PD deficiency and hereditary spherocytosis are frequent, while in neonates, isoimmune hemolysis from ABO or Rh incompatibility and G6PD deficiency are particularly important and often severe, with G6PD deficiency now recognized as a major global cause of hazardous hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus risk [^a518eb93] [^dbb7d99b] [^f0043987].

> Next, I should review neonatal-specific physiology because it shifts the threshold for "excess production". Newborns have a higher red cell mass and shorter RBC lifespan with fetal hemoglobin, plus immature hepatic conjugation, so even modest increases in bilirubin production can overwhelm clearance. End-tidal CO correlates with production, and studies show many infants with higher bilirubin levels are indeed producing more bilirubin, underscoring hemolysis as a key modifiable driver in this period [^ed172a72] [^c6b77297] [^7aca9b3e].

> Wait, let me verify the role of ineffective erythropoiesis so I don't over-attribute everything to hemolysis. Ineffective erythropoiesis, as seen in megaloblastic anemias and thalassemias, increases heme turnover and bilirubin production even without frank hemolysis, contributing to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia when the marrow produces defective RBC precursors that are destroyed before release [^964a73ce].

> I should also consider resorption of large hematomas. Significant internal bleeding with breakdown of extravasated RBCs can transiently increase bilirubin load, sometimes enough to cause jaundice, so I need to keep this in mind when evaluating adults with recent trauma or surgery who have unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without other liver disease [^964a73ce] [^d1ad438d].

> But wait, what if the bilirubin is conjugated? Does that still reflect increased production? I need to ensure I separate production from clearance. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia points to hepatocellular injury or cholestasis rather than overproduction; thus, when bilirubin is mostly direct, I should not ascribe it to increased production and should pivot to obstruction or hepatocellular disease in the differential [^8201f123] [^6a130be4].

> Let me synthesize and prioritize. The most common cause of increased bilirubin production is hemolysis, with clinically important subsets including autoimmune hemolysis, microangiopathic hemolysis, infection-related hemolysis, and hereditary hemolytic disorders such as G6PD deficiency and hereditary spherocytosis. In neonates, isoimmune hemolysis and G6PD deficiency are particularly prominent, and ineffective erythropoiesis and hematoma resorption are additional contributors depending on context [^964a73ce] [^a518eb93] [^dbb7d99b] [^f0043987].

> I should double-check that I'm not overstating any single cause without nuance. While hemolysis dominates, the relative frequency varies by population and age, and neonatal risk is amplified by developmental immaturity of hepatic conjugation, which is why detection of increased production with ETCOc and targeted screening for G6PD and DAT are standard in newborn pathways to mitigate bilirubin neurotoxicity risk [^c6b77297] [^f0043987] [^8ffbe0f2].

---

Increased bilirubin production most often results from **hemolysis** (autoimmune, hereditary, or acquired) [^964a73ce], **ineffective erythropoiesis** (megaloblastic anemia, thalassemia, myelodysplasia) [^notfound], and **neonatal physiologic jaundice** (short RBC lifespan, high RBC mass, immature hepatic conjugation) [^ed172a72] [^71fd3360]. Less common causes include **large hematoma resorption** [^964a73ce] and **exogenous heme loads** (transfusions, hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers) [^notfound]. Hemolysis is the **most common cause** in adults, while neonatal jaundice is the **most common cause** in newborns [^notfound].

---

## Hemolysis

Hemolysis is the **most common cause of increased bilirubin production** in adults, characterized by premature RBC destruction and release of heme, which is rapidly converted to unconjugated bilirubin [^964a73ce]. Hemolysis can be classified as **intravascular or extravascular** and may be hereditary or acquired [^a518eb93].

- **Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)**: Immune-mediated destruction of RBCs, often associated with systemic autoimmune diseases or drug exposure [^a518eb93].
- **Hereditary hemolytic disorders**: Include hereditary spherocytosis, G6PD deficiency, and sickle cell disease, characterized by intrinsic RBC defects leading to chronic hemolysis [^a518eb93].
- **Acquired hemolytic disorders**: Include microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), infections (e.g. malaria, babesiosis), and drug-induced hemolysis [^a518eb93].

---

## Ineffective erythropoiesis

Ineffective erythropoiesis refers to **premature death of erythroid precursors** in the bone marrow, resulting in increased bilirubin production without significant peripheral hemolysis [^notfound]. Common causes include:

- **Megaloblastic anemia**: Due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, characterized by abnormal nuclear-cytoplasmic maturation and premature cell death [^notfound].
- **Thalassemia syndromes**: Genetic disorders of globin chain synthesis, leading to ineffective erythropoiesis and chronic hemolysis [^notfound].
- **Myelodysplastic syndromes**: Clonal hematopoietic disorders with ineffective erythropoiesis and dysplastic features [^notfound].

---

## Neonatal physiologic jaundice

Neonatal jaundice is the **most common cause of increased bilirubin production** in newborns, resulting from a combination of increased bilirubin production and immature hepatic conjugation [^ed172a72]. Factors contributing to increased bilirubin production in neonates include:

- **Short RBC lifespan**: Neonatal RBCs have a shorter lifespan (approximately 70–90 days) compared to adults, leading to increased bilirubin production [^notfound].
- **High RBC mass**: Neonates have a higher RBC mass relative to body weight, further increasing bilirubin load [^3b69474d].
- **Immature hepatic conjugation**: Neonatal hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) activity is low, impairing bilirubin conjugation and excretion [^ed172a72].

---

## Resorption of large hematomas

Resorption of large hematomas can cause a **transient increase in bilirubin production** due to the breakdown of extravasated RBCs. This is typically seen in trauma patients or those undergoing surgical procedures with significant tissue injury [^964a73ce].

---

## Exogenous heme load

Exogenous administration of heme-containing compounds, such as blood transfusions or hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers, can transiently increase bilirubin production. This is usually **self-limited** and resolves with clearance of the exogenous heme load [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Increased bilirubin production can lead to **unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia**, which, if severe, may cause bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus) in neonates or exacerbate underlying liver disease in adults [^657beb30]. Management focuses on identifying and treating the underlying cause, supportive care, and, in severe cases, interventions such as phototherapy or exchange transfusion in neonates [^3158eb70].

---

Increased bilirubin production most commonly results from **hemolysis**, **ineffective erythropoiesis**, and **neonatal physiologic jaundice**. Other causes include resorption of large hematomas and exogenous heme load. Identifying the underlying cause is essential for appropriate management and prevention of complications.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^3158eb70]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The majority of newborns is affected by jaundice after birth. While most jaundice is physiologic, severe hyperbilirubinemia can lead to serious complications, such as chronic bilirubin encephalopathy. Hyperbilirubinemia typically results from increased bilirubin production, impaired clearance, excessive reabsorption, or a combination of these factors. Systematic risk assessment and screening are recommended for all infants to prevent neurologic injury from hyperbilirubinemia. Infants born prematurely and those with risk factors for bilirubin neurotoxicity warrant closer monitoring. Phototherapy is usually effective in lowering bilirubin levels, and exchange transfusion is rarely performed.

Purpose Of Review

Jaundice, the physical finding associated with hyperbilirubinemia, results when the liver is unable to properly metabolize or excrete bilirubin. The purpose of this review is to examine some of the most common causes of jaundice in adults, provide insight into the diagnostic evaluation of jaundice, and review information on the outcomes of patients with jaundice.

Recent Findings

An elevated level of bilirubin almost always indicates the presence of an underlying disease state. The best approach to evaluating a patient with jaundice is to start with a careful history and physical examination, followed by imaging assessment of the biliary tree and liver. There are algorithm models that incorporate bilirubin levels in their predictor models for outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease (i.e., the model for end-stage liver disease). However, there are few studies that have examined the outcomes of patients with jaundice.

Summary

Evaluation of patients with jaundice starts with a careful history and physical examination, followed by directed imaging of the biliary tree and liver. Although jaundice is generally believed to be a serious medical condition, there is little literature that addresses outcomes in patients with jaundice.

### Inherited disorders of bilirubin clearance [^c51bde7a]. Pediatric Research (2016). Low credibility.

Inherited disorders of hyperbilirubinemia may be caused by increased bilirubin production or decreased bilirubin clearance. Reduced hepatic bilirubin clearance can be due to defective (i) unconjugated bilirubin uptake and intrahepatic storage, (ii) conjugation of glucuronic acid to bilirubin (e.g. Gilbert syndrome, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, Lucey-Driscoll syndrome, breast milk jaundice), (iii) bilirubin excretion into bile (Dubin-Johnson syndrome), or (iv) conjugated bilirubin re-uptake (Rotor syndrome). In this review, the molecular mechanisms and clinical manifestations of these conditions are described, as well as current approaches to diagnosis and therapy.

### The patient presenting with isolated hyperbilirubinemia [^86a0ebb7]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common laboratory finding in clinical practice, being found in several haematological and liver diseases as well as in familial conditions (5–10% in Western countries). Although most of the familial forms of hyperbilirubinemia are classically viewed as benign conditions, they have gained an increased interest in the last few years since recent data have indicated that subjects with an impaired bilirubin metabolism may have an increased susceptibility to drug toxicity. The authors briefly review the main steps of bilirubin metabolism, with a special emphasis on the emerging concepts on the molecular mechanisms of regulation by nuclear receptors (NRs) and genetic factors. Then the different forms of isolated hyperbilirubinemia occurring in both adults and paediatrics are systematically analysed, and a new categorisation is also proposed in light of the recent advances in bilirubin research. Finally, a diagnostic algorithm is discussed, along with a correct approach to its management, in order to avoid unnecessary medical investigations.

### Bilirubin production and the risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity [^20beac41]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Neonatal jaundice usually occurs in the transitional period after birth, presenting as an elevation of circulating bilirubin. Bilirubin neurotoxicity can occur if the levels of bilirubin become excessive (hyperbilirubinemia). This pathologic phenotype of newborn jaundice can develop because of excessive bilirubin production or impaired conjugation, with the risk for developing bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction, depending on the degree of the resultant bilirubin load. The plasma bilirubin level thus can be used to assess an infant's risk for developing bilirubin neurotoxicity relative to an infant's age in hours. Because all infants have an impaired conjugation ability, infants at greatest risk are those who have increased bilirubin production rates, because of hemolysis, for example. Therefore, developing potential preventive strategies as well as noninvasive technologies to treat and to identify infants with increased bilirubin production rates, respectively, are tantamount to reducing the incidence of bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is an emerging literature suggesting that the current reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions. Elevations of either fraction will therefore lead to a rise in the measured bilirubin concentration. The most common cause of an isolated elevated bilirubin concentration is Gilbert's syndrome, which is an inherited disorder of metabolism and leads to impaired conjugation via reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase.

### An emergency medicine approach to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^7f566db9]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Jaundice (also known as hyperbilirubinemia) is a yellowish-greenish pigmentation of the sclera and skin caused by an increase in bilirubin production or a defect in bilirubin elimination. Management of hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most common reasons for readmission of a newborn. Prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can result in acute bilirubin encephalopathy and eventually develop into chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus). Kernicterus, the feared complication of hyperbilirubinemia, was considered almost extinct but has recently re-emerged despite virtual elimination of Rh disease. This review provides a systematic approach to the presentation, evaluation, and management of the jaundiced newborn.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia management: clinical assessment of bilirubin production [^c6b77297]. Seminars in Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The predominant cause of elevated total/plasma bilirubin (TB) levels is from an increase in bilirubin production primarily because of ongoing hemolysis. If undiagnosed or untreated, the risk for developing extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and possibly bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND) is increased. Since carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin are produced in equimolar amounts during the heme catabolic process, measurements of end-tidal CO levels, corrected for ambient CO (ETCOc) can be used as a direct indicator of ongoing hemolysis. A newly developed point-of-care ETCOc device has been shown to be a useful for identifying hemolysis-associated hyperbilirubinemia in newborns. This review summarizes the biology of bilirubin production, the clinical utility of a novel device to identify neonates undergoing hemolysis, and a brief introduction on the use of ETCOc measurements in a cohort of neonates in China.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^5794d13f]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice in adults can be an indicator of significant underlying disease. It is caused by elevated serum bilirubin levels in the unconjugated or conjugated form. The evaluation of jaundice relies on the history and physical examination. The initial laboratory evaluation should include fractionated bilirubin, a complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, ?-glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time and/or international normalized ratio, albumin, and protein. Imaging with ultrasonography or computed tomography can differentiate between extrahepatic obstructive and intrahepatic parenchymal disorders. Ultrasonography is the least invasive and least expensive imaging method. A more extensive evaluation may include additional cancer screening, biliary imaging, autoimmune antibody assays, and liver biopsy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with increased bilirubin production caused by red blood cell destruction, such as hemolytic disorders, and disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs in disorders of hepatocellular damage, such as viral and alcoholic hepatitis, and cholestatic disorders, such as choledocholithiasis and neoplastic obstruction of the biliary tree.

### Jaundice in the intensive care unit [^c87bdb09]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia, or jaundice, is common in the ICU, with incidence up to 40% among critically ill patients. Unfortunately, it is poorly understood in the critically ill, and too often presents a diagnostic dilemma to the ICU physician. Causes of jaundice in the ICU are multiple; the etiology in any given patient, multifactorial. Acute jaundice can be a harbinger or marker of sepsis, multisystem organ failure (MSOF), or a reflection of transient hypotension (shock liver), right-sided heart failure, the metabolic breakdown of red blood cells, or pharmacologic toxicity. Acute ICU jaundice is best divided into obstructive and nonobstructive. This stratification directs subsequent management and therapeutic decisions.

### Bilirubin-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and respiratory health outcomes: a mendelian randomization study [^a1fa1b66]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory disorder that is among the leading causes of death worldwide. Much of the morbidity, mortality, and economic costs that result from COPD are a result of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), which are characterized by periods of increased respiratory symptoms requiring a change in treatment. Current therapies for COPD are only modestly effective at reducing AECOPD, and new approaches are needed to reduce the devastating impact of this common disease.

Oxidative stress is increased in COPD, and further increases during AECOPD. Oxidative stress has been implicated in COPD and AECOPD pathogenesis and is a potential therapeutic target. Bilirubin, the main metabolic end-product of heme degradation, is a potent anti-oxidant that scavenges peroxyl radicals and inhibits membrane-bound nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, which is a large intracellular source of reactive oxygen species. We and others have demonstrated in large observational studies that higher serum bilirubin concentrations are associated with lower risk of AECOPD, slower rate of lung function decline, and lower all-cause mortality. In a recent systematic review we found that higher serum bilirubin concentrations may be associated with decreased mortality, lower risk of AECOPD, reduced incidence of COPD diagnosis, and improved lung function. Although these data suggest protective effects of serum bilirubin levels, and thus that manipulation of bilirubin levels may be a therapeutic target in COPD, these observational study designs are prone to biases, confounding, and reverse causation. Mendelian randomization studies are one way of overcoming some of the problems inherent in observational studies. Mendelian randomization leverages genetic variants that affect a risk factor (e.g. a variant that leads to higher bilirubin levels) to test if an observational association is consistent with a causal effect.

### Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the neonate and young infant [^e3f65389]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice in the first few weeks of life may herald potentially life-threatening pathology. It is therefore incumbent upon the pediatric practitioner to have a high index of suspicion for severe disease when investigating jaundice in a young infant. This article outlines the epidemiology, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic workup for both the most common and the most severe causes of cholestasis in the neonatal period.

### Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in children [^b003b55d]. Pediatrics in Review (2012). Low credibility.

A variety of anatomic, infectious, autoimmune, and metabolic diseases can lead to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, both in the newborn period and later in childhood. The pediatric practitioner is most likely to encounter conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period. It is crucial to maintain a high degree of suspicion for cholestasis in the persistently jaundiced newborn. The goal is recognition of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia between 2 and 4 weeks after birth, allowing for the prompt identification and management of infants who have biliary atresia, which remains the most common cause of neonatal cholestasis.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^18367727]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The etiologies of infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are numerous. Because of the consequences of untimely correction of EHBA as well as the potential consequences of untreated galactosemia, hypothyroidism and other etiologies associated with this problem, clinical evaluation needs to be prompt, focused, and complete. While specific symptoms may narrow the diagnostic possibilities, a complete history and physical examination, diagnostic imaging and laboratory investigations directed at the more common etiologies is required to make a prompt, definitive diagnosis. This systematic review provides evidence to direct the investigation of an infant with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^6a130be4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

### Neonatal cholestasis [^7ccbdc54]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Neonatal jaundice is common and usually not concerning when it is secondary to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, below the neurotoxic level, and resolves early. Primary care providers should be vigilant, however, about evaluating infants in whom jaundice presents early, is prolonged beyond 2 weeks of life, or presents at high levels. Even in well-appearing infants, fractionated (direct and indirect) bilirubin levels should be obtained in these clinical scenarios to evaluate for potential cholestasis. This review presents an approach to the evaluation of a jaundiced infant and discusses diagnosis and management of several causes of neonatal cholestasis.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^3b965a14]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests

There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results whose recognition can aid diagnosis:
Isolated raised bilirubin — most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome (affects 5–8% of the population). Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and a direct and indirect bilirubin; the total bilirubin should rise further, owing to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting reticulocyte count/lactate dehydrogenase/haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L) then rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndromeshould be considered and genetic testing undertaken.
Cholestatic — predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and not be liver related, or it may relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood, and thus the presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, however, GGT is characteristically low or normal. In these disorders, cholestasis occurs without GGT elevation.
Hepatitic — predominantly raised ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular liver injury (hepatitis). Common causes include viral hepatitis, NAFLD, ARLD, AIH and drug-induced liver injury. Details of the approach to these liver blood test abnormalities are given in the subsequent section on outcomes and pathways.

### End-tidal carbon monoxide and hemolysis [^580c376d]. Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Hemolytic disease in newborns can result from a number of conditions, which can place such infants at an increased risk for the development of severe hyperbilirubinemia. Because the catabolism of heme produces equimolar amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin, measurements of end-tidal breath CO (corrected for ambient CO) or ETCOc can serve as an index of hemolysis as well as of bilirubin production from any cause. Elevated levels of ETCOc have been correlated with blood carboxyhemoglobin levels and thus hemolysis. However, the detection of hemolysis can be a clinically challenging problem in newborns. Here, we describe the importance of determining ETCOc levels and their application in identifying infants at risk for developing hyperbilirubinemia associated with hemolysis and other causes of increased bilirubin production.

### Induction of mild hyperbilirubinemia: hype or real therapeutic opportunity? [^822ed07c]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Observational epidemiological studies showed that mild hyperbilirubinemia has beneficial effects on the prevention of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome. In mammals, bilirubin plays a major role as a potent antioxidant. Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT)1A1 variants coding for bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyl transferase resulting in mild hyperbilirubinemia (as in Gilbert syndrome (GS)) may confer a strong genetic advantage. Strategies to boost bioavailability of bilirubin or to mimic GS represent an attractive approach to prevent many oxidative stress and inflammation-mediated diseases. Even a tiny, micromolar increase in serum bilirubin concentrations substantially decreases the risk of oxidative stress-mediated diseases. There are several possible ways to achieve this, including lifestyle changes, changes in dietary patterns, regular physical activities, or use of chemical drug or of specific plant products either in the form of regular food items or nutraceuticals. Further basic and experimental research is required to fully uncover this promising therapeutic field.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: evaluation and treatment… [^71fd3360]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

More than two-thirds of newborns develop jaundice, the clinical manifestation of hyperbilirubinemia, and most cases are physiologic and benign. 1 In healthy newborns, unconjugated bilirubin, a lipid-soluble breakdown product of heme, transiently elevates during days 2 to 5 after delivery due to the turnover of fetal erythrocytes. 2 The liver conjugates the bilirubin into a water-soluble form that can be excreted via urine and stool. Bilirubin levels usually return to normal over one to three weeks without intervention or adverse effects. 2, 3. Several conditions increase bilirubin beyond normal physiologic levels. Pathologic causes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia include metabolic conditions, conditions that increase bilirubin production, and conditions that increase enterohepatic circulation. 2 Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is uncommon, occurring in about one in 2, 500 infants.

4, 5 Conjugated or direct bilirubin levels of 5 mg per dL or greater are likely due to cholestatic causes including biliary atresia, while lesser elevations are seen in the setting of metabolic causes, hemolysis, and infections. 4, 6, 7. RISK FACTORS Neurotoxicity risk factors are conditions that increase the ability of bilirubin to cross the blood-brain barrier. 4, 6 However, a single mild elevation of conjugated or direct bilirubin is unlikely to represent cholestasis from biliary atresia or other causes. 6, 7 Physicians should instead consider and evaluate for conditions that elevate conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, notably HDN and sepsis, and repeat testing in several days to two weeks if a cause is not identified. If the conjugated or direct bilirubin level continues to increase, cholestasis is more likely.

Newborns with hyperbilirubinemia due to suboptimal breast milk intake, as evidenced by weight loss of greater than 10% of birthweight or decreased urine and stool output, may benefit from supplementation to promote bilirubin excretion and shorten phototherapy duration. Supplementation with formula or expressed or donor breast milk should be considered using shared decision-making between parents and physicians. 4.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to G6PD testing, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to measure G6PD activity in any infant with jaundice of unknown cause if total serum bilirubin increases despite intensive phototherapy, increases suddenly or increases after an initial decline, or if escalation of care is required.

### Inherited disorders of bilirubin transport and conjugation: new insights into molecular mechanisms and consequences [^7b44f71d]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Inherited disorders of bilirubin metabolism might reduce bilirubin uptake by hepatocytes, bilirubin conjugation, or secretion of bilirubin into bile. Reductions in uptake could increase levels of unconjugated or conjugated bilirubin (Rotor syndrome). Defects in bilirubin conjugation could increase levels of unconjugated bilirubin; the effects can be benign and frequent (Gilbert syndrome) or rare but severe, increasing the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy (Crigler-Najjar syndrome). Impairment of bilirubin secretion leads to accumulation of conjugated bilirubin (Dubin-Johnson syndrome). We review the genetic causes and pathophysiology of disorders of bilirubin transport and conjugation as well as clinical and therapeutic aspects. We also discuss the possible mechanisms by which hyperbilirubinemia protects against cardiovascular disease and the metabolic syndrome and the effects of specific genetic variants on drug metabolism and cancer development.

### Genome-wide analyses of neonatal jaundice reveal a marked departure from adult bilirubin metabolism [^ed172a72]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Most neonates are affected by jaundice in their first days of life, caused by accumulation of bilirubin (hyperbilirubinemia). While this condition occurs to some degree in 50–90% of births, usually it resolves without treatment. Phototherapy is used in more serious cases, around 5–10% of newborns, and can be effective. Yet, severe cases of jaundice still occur — leading to neurotoxicity, long-term cognitive impairment, and in rare cases kernicterus and death — and cause a significant burden on global health –.

Many questions about the etiology of neonatal jaundice remain, although the core biochemistry of bilirubin metabolism is known. Bilirubin (unconjugated form) is produced in the breakdown of hemoglobin, then taken up into hepatocytes, and converted to conjugated bilirubin by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). Conjugated bilirubin is transported to bile, while hopping in and out of hepatocytes to prevent local accumulation, then travels to intestines for excretion via feces. In neonates, liver UGT expression is low, while the production of unconjugated bilirubin is high (because of faster turnover of red blood cells and fetal hemoglobin), leading to its accumulation. Likely, neonates also differ in activity of other enzymes, such as uptake into the liver, transporters, and excretion mechanisms, contributing to the bilirubin imbalance, but these factors have only begun to be explored.

It is not clear why in some newborns this imbalance is more severe, and clinical presentation worse. Bilirubin accumulation is more pronounced in preterm newborns, reportedly because the relevant metabolic pathways are not yet matured, although the specifics of this are not yet established. Some rare pathological factors with clear mechanisms are known, such as hemolysis due to ABO or Rhesus incompatibilityand highly deleterious mutations in UGT1A1 or transporter genes. Genetic variants may also modify the effects of environmental factors, such as breastfeeding. However, genetic studies of neonatal jaundice to date have been limited to only established candidate genes, and have often produced conflicting results even for the same variants. Most of the genetic basis, and in particular common variants or other, non-UGT genes, remains largely unexplored. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) could fill in these gaps by discovering new variants or genes associated with neonatal jaundice, as well as clarifying the importance of different known metabolic pathways in newborns, ultimately leading to better identification of risk cases or new treatment strategies.

### Neonatal cholestasis [^a8ad7bbd]. NeoReviews (2013). Low credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice is a common presenting feature of neonatal hepatobiliary and metabolic dysfunction. Any infant who remains jaundiced beyond age 2 to 3 weeks should have the serum bilirubin level fractionated into a conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (indirect) portion. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is never physiologic or normal. The differential diagnosis of cholestasis is extensive, and a step-wise approach based on the initial history and physical examination is useful to rapidly identify the underlying etiology. Early recognition of neonatal cholestasis is essential to ensure timely treatment and optimal prognosis. Even when specific treatment is not available, infants who have cholestasis benefit from early medical management and optimization of nutrition. Future studies are necessary to determine the most reliable and cost-effective method of universal screening for neonatal cholestasis.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^dbb7d99b]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

G6PD deficiency — risk identification and clinical implications: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, an X-linked recessive enzymopathy that decreases protection against oxidative stress, is now recognized as one of the most important causes of hazardous hyperbilirubinemia leading to kernicterus in the United States and across the globe. Overall, 13% of African American males and about 4% of African American females have G6PD deficiency. Newborn infants with G6PD deficiency are more likely to receive phototherapy before hospital discharge, probably because of both increased bilirubin production and decreased conjugation, and have a greater risk of readmission and retreatment. Severe hyperbilirubinemia or atypical development of hyperbilirubinemia, such as elevated TSB in a formula-fed infant or late-onset jaundice, should raise the possibility of G6PD deficiency. An infant with G6PD deficiency can develop a sudden and extreme increase in TSB that may be hard to anticipate or prevent, and even after what appears to be an acute hemolytic event, there may be little or no laboratory evidence of hemolysis. Identifying neonates with G6PD deficiency is a challenge; most affected infants will not have a positive family history, and genetic ancestry from a population in which this condition is prevalent can be helpful in predicting risk.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of antiviral therapy [^4d60ef24]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common side effect of antiviral medications. The mechanisms underlying its development are multiple and unique to each therapy. During administration of antiviral medications, the hyperbilirubinemia observed in the absence of liver injury is most frequently manifested by isolated increases in the indirect-reacting fraction. Relevant mechanisms leading to indirect hyperbilirubinemia in this setting include hemolysis, decreased hepatic bilirubin clearance as a result of impairment of bilirubin conjugation, or circumstances in which both processes occur simultaneously. Underlying genetic susceptibilities may potentiate these side effects of antiviral therapy. Conjugated (direct-reacting) hyperbilirubinemia can be a consequence of generalized hepatocellular injury, selective cholestatic defects, biliary obstruction, or, rarely, genetic disorders of bilirubin transport. In the specific setting of antiviral therapy, preexisting liver disease or antiviral hepatotoxicity, such as is encountered with the use of the nucleoside and non-nucleoside human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are the most frequent causes of direct-reacting or mixed direct- and indirect-reacting hyperbilirubinemia. Modification in antiviral drug choice or dose may be required in cases of liver injury or of brisk hemolysis leading to significant anemia. The mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia associated with impairment in conjugation tends to be well tolerated and of little consequence. The decision to continue or discontinue antiviral therapy in the face of hyperbilirubinemia should be made after an assessment of the cause of the elevated bilirubin level and a thorough assessment of the risks and benefits of antiviral therapy.

### Assessment of UGT polymorphisms and neonatal jaundice [^48109239]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevation of the serum bilirubin level is a common, if not universal, finding during the first week of life. This can be a transient phenomenon that resolves spontaneously or can signify a serious or even life-threatening condition. There are many causes of hyperbilirubinemia and related therapeutic and prognostic implications. The diseases in which there is a primary disorder of the metabolism of bilirubin will be reviewed regarding their clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. These disorders-Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar Syndrome-both involve abnormalities in bilirubin conjugation secondary to deficiency of bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase. The purpose of this article is to review the current understanding of the genetic polymorphisms that result in these diseases and discuss recent advances in diagnosis and treatment.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^01635dfb]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations

Infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia presents with persistent jaundice as part of a clinical constellation that may include other symptoms based on the underlying etiology. The differential diagnosis is broad and requires timely evaluation. The data presented in this review suggest that INH, EHBA, and infection (with CMV being the most common infection) account for 63.36% of all cases of infants presenting with elevated serum concentrations of conjugated bilirubin.

The diagnostic evaluation should be guided by symptomatology and may include various imaging studies and serologic, hematologic, and urine investigations for various infections and endocrinopathies, as well as genetic testing for inborn errors of metabolism. While the definitive diagnosis of EHBA requires a percutaneous liver biopsy, ongoing research is investigating less invasive methods of differentiating EHBA from other etiologies of infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Inconsistency of the diagnostic approach is a major limitation of this review. While there are general guidelines directing the evaluation of an infant with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, reports published prior to establishment of these guidelines are included in the present review. Moreover, diagnostic practices vary by country and multiple studies focused on the ability of a specific radiologic test to differentiate EHBA from other causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Together, these conditions may introduce inherent disparities in evaluation and may contribute to bias among these studies.

Variability in sample populations is also a potential source of bias. While 12 countries and 5 continents are represented, there is no data from Eastern Europe or South America. Disorders that may be uniquely prevalent in these areas may be underrepresented. Finally, summary data that includes subjects from all over the world may be less relevant to any specific country given the uneven distribution of etiologies between developed and developing countries as well as diseases endemic to the East and West.

Finally, the use of the category of INH to include all idiopathic cases of infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a potential source of bias in this review. While Ipek et. al defined INH as conjugated hyperbilirubinemia that persists beyond 3 months without another identifiable cause, multiple studies did not specifically use the term INH or provide a definition.

### Jaundice and breastfeeding [^485da029]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Optimal management of breastfeeding does not eliminate neonatal jaundice and elevated serum bilirubin concentrations. Rather, it leads to a pattern of hyperbilirubinemia that is normal and, possibly, beneficial to infants. Excessive frequency of exaggerated jaundice in a hospital or community population of breastfed infants may be a warning that breastfeeding policies and support are not ideal for the establishment of good breastfeeding practices. The challenge to clinicians is to differentiate normal patterns of jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia from those that indicate an abnormality or place an infant at risk.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^aead04fd]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Jaundice is an indication of hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by derangements in bilirubin metabolism. It is typically apparent when serum bilirubin levels exceed 3 mg/dL and can indicate serious underlying disease of the liver or biliary tract. A comprehensive medical history, review of systems, and physical examination are essential for differentiating potential causes such as alcoholic liver disease, biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, drug-induced liver injury, hemolysis, or hepatitis. Initial laboratory evaluation should include assays for bilirubin (total and fractionated), a complete blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio. Measuring fractionated bilirubin allows for determination of whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Ultrasonography of the abdomen, computed tomography with intravenous contrast media, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are first-line options for patients presenting with jaundice, depending on the suspected underlying etiology. If the etiology of jaundice is unclear despite laboratory testing and imaging, liver biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the disease.

### Antioxidant bilirubin works in multiple ways to reduce risk for obesity and its health complications [^f5af27ea]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Unconjugated bilirubin functions physiologically to inhibit NADPH oxidase complexes

Gilbert syndrome (GS) is a common genetic variant in which plasma unconjugated bilirubin levels are elevated throughout life, in the absence of hepatic pathology. This typically reflects decreased hepatic capacity for conjugation of bilirubin coupled with an upregulation of bilirubin generation. Typically, subjects with GS are homozygous for promoter mutations compromising transcriptional efficiency in the gene coding for uridine-diphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), which links bilirubin to glucuronic acid; as a result, hepatic expression of this enzyme is decreased, although the enzyme itself is functionally normal. However, plasma bilirubin levels in many people homozygous for such mutations fail to exceed the level (defined as either 17.1 or 20 µmol/L) considered diagnostic for GS. Hence, subjects with GS also are characterised by an increased rate of bilirubin generation, ultimately traceable to increased heme synthesis. In some cases, this may reflect upregulated heme oxygenase activity, which would reflexly boost heme production.

Epidemiological studies have found that GS confers potent and versatile health protection. Notably, an analysis of the Health Improvement Network primary care database in the UK found that, after adjustment for pertinent covariants, a diagnosis of GS was associated with a relative risk for all-cause mortality of 0.5 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p < 0.001).

This remarkable health benefit appears likely to stem largely from the fact that physiological intracellular levels of unconjugated bilirubin inhibit certain common isoforms of NADPH oxidase. These membrane-bound superoxide-generating complexes are a major source of the oxidants that drive or exacerbate a high proportion of health disorders. Bilirubin's inhibitory impact on NADPH oxidase activity presumably explains much of the profound antioxidant activity of heme oxygenase, which cleaves heme to yield biliverdin, carbon monoxide and free iron; biliverdin is then rapidly reduced by the ubiquitously expressed enzyme biliverdin reductase to yield bilirubin. Expression of inducible form of heme oxygenase, HO-1, can be boosted by oxidative stress — often derived from NADPH oxidase activity; the resultant production of bilirubin feeds back to quell this oxidative stress. Although bilirubin can also act as a direct oxidant scavenger, its physiological intracellular level — in the low nanomolar range — is too low to compete in this regard with other intracellular scavengers (eg, glutathione, ascorbate) present in millimolar concentrations.

### The biology of bilirubin production [^104cf229]. Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

Heme oxygenase (HO), the rate-limiting enzyme in bilirubin production, has been identified from the late 1960s. This enzyme has been shown to have many other roles in recent years. The inducible form is regulated by oxidative stress, inflammation, and heavy metals, among others, and is cytoprotective in many instance. Nonetheless, there are instances when HO-1 can be deleterious due to the release of iron from the reaction. Another important by-product, carbon monoxide, is a vasodilator and a neurotransmitter and has been implicated in signal transduction pathways. More recently, nonenzymatic, signaling roles of HO have been suggested. This may serve to regulate the endogenous activity of this enzyme when cellular heme levels are low.

### Bilirubin, platelet activation and heart disease: a missing link to cardiovascular protection in Gilbert's syndrome? [^d05e66ec]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Gilbert's syndrome (GS) is a relatively common condition, inducing a benign, non-hemolytic, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gilbert's Syndrome is associated with mutation in the Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene promoter, reducing UGT1A1 activity, which normally conjugates bilirubin allowing its elimination from the blood. Individuals with GS demonstrate mildly elevated plasma antioxidant capacity caused by elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), reduced thiols and glutathione. Interestingly, the development of, and risk of mortality from, cardiovascular disease is remarkably reduced in GS individuals. An explanation for this protection may be explained by bilirubin's ability to inhibit multiple processes that induce platelet hyper-reactivity and thrombosis, thus far under-appreciated in the literature. Reactive oxygen species are produced continuously via metabolic processes and have the potential to oxidatively modify proteins and lipids within cell membranes, which may encourage the development of thrombosis and CVDs. Oxidative stress induced platelet hyper-reactivity significantly increases the risk of thrombosis, which can potentially lead to tissue infarction. Here, we discuss the possible mechanisms by which increased antioxidant status might influence platelet function and link this to cardiovascular protection in GS. In summary, this is the first article to discuss the possible role of bilirubin as an anti-thrombotic agent, which inhibits platelet activation and potentially, organ infarction, which could contribute to the reduced mortality rate in mildly hyperbilirbinemic individuals.

### Jaundice in the adult patient [^d1ad438d]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Jaundice in an adult patient can be caused by a wide variety of benign or life-threatening disorders. Organizing the differential diagnosis by prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic causes may help make the work-up more manageable. Prehepatic causes of jaundice include hemolysis and hematoma resorption, which lead to elevated levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. Intrahepatic disorders can lead to unconjugated or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The conjugated (direct) bilirubin level is often elevated by alcohol, infectious hepatitis, drug reactions, and autoimmune disorders. Posthepatic disorders also can cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gallstone formation is the most common and benign posthepatic process that causes jaundice; however, the differential diagnosis also includes serious conditions such as biliary tract infection, pancreatitis, and malignancies. The laboratory work-up should begin with a urine test for bilirubin, which indicates that conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is present. If the complete blood count and initial tests for liver function and infectious hepatitis are unrevealing, the work-up typically proceeds to abdominal imaging by ultrasonography or computed tomographic scanning. In a few instances, more invasive procedures such as cholangiography or liver biopsy may be needed to arrive at a diagnosis.

### Evaluation of transcutaneous bilirubin levels in healthy and preeclamptic pregnancies: a pilot study [^1f2de94d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussions

In our study, we demonstrated that transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) levels measured from different maternal skin sites were significantly higher in women with preeclampsia and pre-eclampsia with severe features compared to the control group. Furthermore, TcB values showed a stepwise increase in parallel with the severity of the disease. In contrast, total serum bilirubin (TsB) levels did not differ significantly among the control, preeclampsia, and pre-eclampsia with severe features groups. These findings suggest that TcB measurement may serve as a valuable non-invasive tool in the classification of preeclampsia.

While transcutaneous bilirubin levels were significantly elevated in women with preeclampsia, total serum bilirubin levels remained within normal limits and did not differ significantly among groups. This divergence may reflect the subclinical accumulation of bilirubin in tissue compartments that is not captured by serum measurements, possibly due to efficient hepatic clearance or early-stage hemolysis. Additionally, the observed elevation in LDH without corresponding reductions in hemoglobin may indicate subclinical hemolytic activity or hepatic dysfunction, which precedes measurable changes in red blood cell count or hemoglobin levels.

Conditions that affect bilirubin metabolism may lead to elevated serum bilirubin concentrations. When blood bilirubin levels exceed 1 mg/dL, bilirubin begins to accumulate in tissues rich in elastic fibers, such as the skin and conjunctiva. At serum levels above 2.5 mg/dL, a yellowish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes becomes apparent. In adults, hyperbilirubinemia alone does not indicate a poor prognosis, as the body possesses effective detoxification mechanisms.

Pre-hepatic hyperbilirubinemia refers to elevated bilirubin levels resulting from excessive bilirubin production. The most common cause is accelerated hemolysis. When the rate of bilirubin production exceeds the liver's capacity for uptake and excretion, serum unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) levels rise, while conjugated bilirubin levels remain normal or only mildly elevated. In the presence of elevated bilirubin levels, hepatic injury is typically absent if there is no disruption in aminotransferase levels, albumin concentration, or prothrombin activity. Moreover, increased bilirubin concentrations are not considered a sensitive marker of liver damage. A healthy liver is capable of conjugating up to twice the daily production of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) without causing an increase in total bilirubin concentrations. Additionally, the hepatic clearance rate of bilirubin exceeds its production rate by up to tenfold.

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^a2ed912e]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice in infancy — abstract recommendations and epidemiology — affects approximately 1 in every 2500 term infants; the most common causes in the first months of life are biliary atresia (25%–40%) and an expanding list of monogenic disorders (25%). The recommendations include that any infant noted to be jaundiced after 2 weeks of age be evaluated for cholestasis with measurement of total and direct serum bilirubin, and that an elevated serum direct bilirubin level (direct bilirubin ≥ 1.0 mg/dL or > 17 μmol/L) warrants timely consideration for evaluation and referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist or hepatologist.

### Gilbert's syndrome revisited [^b6aec43e]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Gilbert's syndrome, also known as benign hyperbilirubinaemia, was described more than 100 years ago. It has usually been considered a physiological abnormality characterised by a mild elevation of the systemic level of unconjugated bilirubin, in the absence of any underlying liver or overt haemolytic disease. However, since the re-discovery of the potent antioxidant effects of bilirubin in the late 1980s, as well as multiple intracellular signalling pathways affected by bilirubin, an ever-increasing body of evidence suggests that individuals with Gilbert's syndrome may benefit from the mild hyperbilirubinaemia and are actually protected from the development of a wide variety of "diseases of civilisation" such as cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers, and autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases. This review analyses the current state of medical knowledge given recent discoveries in this rapidly developing field, as well as their possible clinical significance, and provides a new perspective on this condition.

### Hyperbilirubinemia as a predictor of gangrenous / perforated appendicitis: a prospective study [^6686b74a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Appendicitis is one of the commonest causes of abdominal pain requiring emergency surgery. Often, it is difficult to reach a proper diagnosis. There may not be classical symptoms and signs of appendicitis. Different clinical signs and symptoms always mimic the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, as there are a number of causes leading to pain in right iliac fossa particularly in female patients. Diagnosing acute appendicitis clinically still remains a common surgical problem. Accurate diagnosis can be aided by additional testing or expectant management or both. These might delay laparotomy and lead to appendiceal perforation with increased morbidity and hospital stay. A safe alternative seems to be appendectomy as soon as the condition is suspected, a strategy that increases the number of unnecessary appendectomies. A timelier and more accurate diagnosis has been attempted by the employment of additional laboratory tests, scoring systems, ultrasound imaging, computed tomography (CT) scan, scintigraphy, MRI, and laparoscopy. None of these methods stands alone as they all come in support of, and are secondary to a primary clinical assessment.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a new diagnostic tool for perforation of appendix. Hyperbilirubinemia is the result of imbalance between production and excretion of bilirubin by the liver. It may be because of hepatocellular, cholestatic or hemolytic diseases. Liver receives blood mainly through the portal venous system, which receives blood from abdominal organs. Portal blood carries nutrients and other substances absorbed from gut including bacteria and its product (toxins). In a small percentage, even in normal healthy people, bacteria are found in portal blood. It is commonly cleared by detoxification and immunological action of the reticuloendothelial system of the liver that acts as first-line defense in clearing toxic substances, bacteria and its products. But when bacterial load overwhelms the Kupffer cell function, it may cause dysfunction or damage to hepatocytes (liver parenchyma). It reflects a rise in serum bilirubin (SB) alone or in combination with liver enzymes depending upon the type, severity and site of the lesion. Recently, another substance known as cytokines e.g. interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), has also been considered to be responsible for depressed excretory function of the liver and may lead to increase in SB levels without a rise in liver enzymes.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^ad9ec5ac]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Synthesis of results

Results from all of the studies were pooled to provide rate estimates of categorical and specific etiologies of cholestasis. Rate estimates for etiologic categories were calculated from the number of subjects used in the entire review. Rate estimates for specific infectious and metabolic etiologies used the total number of subjects reported with specific infectious and metabolic disorders as the denominator.

Sources of bias across studies

Variability in diagnostic evaluations and the potential for overestimation of INH represent possible sources for bias. The identification of multiple etiologies in individual patients as well as inconsistencies and vagaries in nomenclature were potential sources of error when studies were combined. In some cases, delayed clinical presentation may have affected diagnostic accuracy.

### Associations between UGT1A1 and SLCO1B1 polymorphisms and susceptibility to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in Thai population [^a97e2c0f]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, one of the most common clinical problems in newborns, occurs up to 60% of healthy full-term newborns. In general, elevated levels of total serum bilirubin can develop into severe neonatal jaundice that result in bilirubin-induced neurological damage such as hearing loss, athetosis, and rarely, intellectual deficits. Ultimately, severe cases may lead to seizures, coma, and death. The demographic, environmental, and genetic factors could account for risk of developing neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

The causes of neonatal jaundice can be due to the elevation of bilirubin, which is caused by the increased production or inability to metabolize and excrete it. This can be due to the immature liver of the newborn. Another cause is due to the decreased bilirubin uptake and conjugation due to the deficiency of the process of serum albumin binding to bilirubin, and carrying it to the liver. However, there is a transient deficiency in newborns of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), which in turns leads to a reduced amount of ligandin, a bilirubin binding protein. Lastly, it may be caused by increased enterohepatic circulation. As conjugated bilirubin is excreted through the bile into the intestine, it is then deconjugated by a mucosal enzyme, β-glucuronidase, and reabsorbed into the enterohepatic circulation, before excretion via the stool. Newborns have slow intestinal motility, due to less gut flora, so this can be a cause of concern for major problems regarding excretion. Other causes include ABO incompatibility, hemolytic anemia and infection.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^f23e6e58]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Except in the neonatal period, the majority of measurable bilirubin should be conjugated, even in individuals with significant liver disease. Hence if the majority of the elevated bilirubin comprises the unconjugated fraction then the cause, in the absence of haemolysis, is virtually always Gilbert's syndrome. As Gilbert's syndrome is not associated with liver disease or ill health, any such individuals should be fully reassured. In the neonatal period, there may be a physiological increase in total bilirubin, which is unconjugated. This may be pathological if high or prolonged. In neonates and infants in whom the conjugated bilirubin is > 25 μmol/L, referral to a paediatrician for urgent assessment of possible liver disease is essential.

Albumin is a protein that is produced only in the liver and has multiple biological actions, including maintenance of oncotic pressure, binding of other substances (such as fatty acids, bilirubin, thyroid hormone and drugs), metabolism of compounds, including lipids, and antioxidant properties. As albumin is only produced by the liver, the serum albumin concentration is often considered as a marker of the synthetic function of the liver. However, overinterpretation of the measured concentrations of albumin as a marker of the severity of liver disease is not always merited. Albumin concentrations are reduced in many clinical situations, including sepsis, systemic inflammatory disorders, nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption and gastrointestinal protein loss.

### Unusual case of immune haemolytic disease causing severe neonatal cholestasis in a newborn [^9f468a79]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is a very common entity witnessed in most of the newborns. Rarely are there events where the bilirubin levels reach extreme values mandating invasive therapy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia when solely present is easy to manage and diagnose the common aetiological factors associated with it. The issue arises when we come across a mixed picture of conjugated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and puts us in a dilemma as to what are we treating. Our case highlights a similar picture where we witnessed the highest documented levels of total bilirubin but to our surprise the major component of which was direct bilirubin. This report takes us through the differentials which were ruled out and our management strategies for solving this rare mystery.

### Bilirubin production and hour-specific bilirubin levels [^7aca9b3e]. Journal of Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

We assessed the relative contributions of increased bilirubin production (indexed by end-tidal carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations, corrected for ambient CO (ETCOc)) to hour-specific total bilirubin (TB) levels in healthy late preterm and term newborns.

Study Design

Post hoc analyses of concurrent ETCOc and TB (at 30 ± 6h of age) and follow-up TB levels at age 96 ± 12h and up to 168h after birth were performed in a cohort of 641 term and late preterm infants.

Results

Increased bilirubin production (hour-specific ETCOc ⩾1.7p.p.m. at age 30 ± 6h) was noted in ~80%, 42% and 32% of infants in the high-, intermediate- and low-risk TB zones, respectively. One infant with TB < 40th percentile and ETCOc < 1.7p.p.m. developed TB ⩾95th percentile at age 168h, probably due to decreased bilirubin elimination.

Conclusions

Infants in the high-risk quartile of the hour-specific bilirubin nomogram have a higher mean bilirubin production. Infants with TB levels ⩾95th percentile without increased bilirubin production have impaired bilirubin elimination.

### Carbon monoxide and bilirubin production in neonates [^b00f005a]. Seminars in Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is a normal postnatal phenomenon resulting from a transitional imbalance between the production and elimination of bilirubin in the neonate. Bilirubin has been shown to be not only a potent antioxidant, but also toxic at excessive concentrations. As a result, the biology of bilirubin, its production, regulation, and measurements have been the focus of extensive studies. Bilirubin, carbon monoxide, and iron are derived from the degradation of heme, a ubiquitous two-step pathway catalyzed by the enzyme, heme oxygenase. It has been shown that these metabolically active products from the heme catabolic pathway may, in turn, influence many other biologic processes. This report provides a brief overview of these interrelationships in the hope that it may provide insight into the central role this pathway plays in the existence of most organisms.

### Does elevated bilirubin aid weight control by preventing development of hypothalamic leptin resistance? [^e2d2599d]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Gilbert syndrome is associated with lower gain in fat mass during later life

Gilbert syndrome (GS) is characterised by a lifelong genetically determined elevation of plasma unconjugated bilirubin levels. This typically entails decreased hepatic expression of the enzyme that conjugates free bilirubin to glucuronic acid, uridine-diphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1); this decreased activity reflects homozygosity for variant alleles in which promoter mutations decrease but do not eliminate transcription. In addition, genetic upregulation of bilirubin production — reflecting upregulation of haem oxygenase activity or increased haem synthesis — also contributes to the elevation of unconjugated bilirubin observed in subjects with GS. Diagnosis of GS generally requires a plasma bilirubin of 20 µM or above — alternatively, 1.2 mg/dL — but this diagnosis is not entirely objective, as non-genetic factors such as fasting status, gastrointestinal motility, enterohepatic bilirubin reabsorption/secretion and degree of light exposure can cause bilirubin levels to vary considerably over time. Moreover, many individuals carrying genetic variants which decrease hepatic UGT1A1 activity maintain plasma bilirubin levels below the cut-off limits for GS diagnosis; these variants alone are not sufficient to guarantee a GS diagnosis. In any case, the key point to recognise is that tissues of properly diagnosed subjects with GS are exposed to quite significantly elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels over the course of their lives.

A recent cross-sectional epidemiological study evaluating subjects with GS has achieved some remarkable findings. This study enrolled 124 subjects with GS (average plasma unconjugated bilirubin 30.7 µM) and 124 age-matched and gender-matched controls (8.7 µM). This study was unique in that it segregated the groups by age; subjects under and over age 35 were analysed separately. One of the most striking findings was this: whereas among the subjects under 35 body mass index (BMI) was only slightly but significantly lower in the GS group (22.5 vs 23.5, p < 0.05), among those over 35 there was a large disparity: 23.8 vs 27.2 (p < 0.001). The difference in body fat content in the over-35 group was even more stark: 21.8% in the subjects with GS vs 29.3% in the controls (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that elevated unconjugated bilirubin — and/or possibly genetic upregulation of haem oxygenase activity — somehow prevents gain of body fat during ageing.

### Systems pharmacology modeling of drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia: differentiating hepatotoxicity and inhibition of enzymes / transporters [^068416e3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Bilirubin, the product of heme breakdown from red blood cells, is exclusively eliminated by the liver. Thus, circulating bilirubin is widely used as a diagnostic biomarker for liver function. Large postmarketing studies of patients with drug‐induced liver injury (DILI) show that ∼10% of subjects with hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice die or require a liver transplant. 1, 2, 3 In the setting of a clinical trial of a new drug candidate, elevations in serum bilirubin may also indicate severe liver injury with global hepatic dysfunction. The 2009 US Food and Drug Administration guidance on assessing liver safety in clinical trials defines the "Hy's Law Case" as a trial subject who experiences a hepatocellular injury with concomitant elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) and serum total bilirubin (TB) elevation > 2× ULN when there is no more likely cause than the study drug. The existence of Hy's Law Cases in a clinical trial database is interpreted as indicating that the study drug is capable of causing liver failure, a conclusion that can lead to termination of the development program, requirement of extended clinical trials to assess risk management strategies, or restricted indications. Therefore, the observation of hyperbilirubinemia during clinical trials or postmarketing can raise concern about irreversible liver injury with serious regulatory consequences.

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^8338faf9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Neonatal cholestasis — rare diseases and idiopathic causes — is described as a shrinking "black box", with identifiable causes increasing through modern clinical genetics; reducing costs and access to genetic testing, including exome and genome sequencing and extended gene panels, have facilitated diagnosis, the most studied causes include metabolic diseases and disorders of bile transport and of bile acids, and the meaning of a gene mutation or polymorphism is dependent on clinical context with advanced sequencing methods promising to further increase the diagnostic yield. In conclusions, cholestatic jaundice in an infant is a typical presenting feature of inherited liver disease and frequently clinically confounds prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia; identification of infants with cholestasis remains crucial, the guideline is not intended as a substitute for individualized care, and vigilance is crucial in detecting these infants and referring them to a pediatric gastroenterologist or hepatologist who can provide essential diagnostic and treatment modalities to optimize outcome.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to bilirubin measurement, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider using the rate of increase to identify infants at higher risk of subsequent hyperbilirubinemia if > 1 transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin measure is available. Suspect hemolysis in case of a rapid rate of increase (≥ 0.3 mg/dL/hour in the first 24 hours or ≥ 0.2 mg/dL/hour thereafter). Obtain a direct antiglobulin test in this case if not previously done.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: an unexpected cause [^f38d0b4a]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common cause for newborn hospital admission. Although the cause of hyperbilirubinemia is usually benign and self-limited, there is always a large differential diagnosis. Atypical presenting signs and symptoms, such as significant anemia or bleeding, should encourage further evaluation for underlying disorders, such as inherited coagulation defects. This article describes the case of a 5-day-old infant who presented to the emergency department with hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and ecchymoses from birth trauma. His hospital course is described, along with a review on the background, evaluation, management, and complications of hemophilia A.

### Cholestatic liver (dys) function during sepsis and other critical illnesses [^100cdb86]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

In ICU patients, abnormal liver tests are common. Markers of cholestasis are associated with adverse outcome. Research has focused on the possibility that mild hyperbilirubinemia, instead of indicating inadvertent cholestasis, may be adaptive and beneficial. These new insights are reviewed and integrated in the state-of-the-art knowledge on hepatobiliary alterations during sepsis and other critical illnesses.

Data Sources

Relevant publications were searched in Medline with search terms bile, bile acids, cholestasis, critical illness, intensive care, sepsis, alone or in combination.

Data Synthesis

Studies have shown that bilirubin, but also bile acids, the main active constitutes of bile, are increased in plasma of patients with critical illnesses. In particular the conjugated fractions of bilirubin and bile acids are high, indicating that during critical illness the liver is capable of converting these molecules to less toxic forms. In human liver biopsies of prolonged critically ill patients, expression of bile acid excretion pumps towards the bile canaliculi was lower, while alternative transporters towards the systemic circulation were upregulated. Remarkably, in the presence of increased circulating bile acids, expression of enzymes controlling synthesis of bile acids was not suppressed. This suggested loss of feedback inhibition of bile acids synthesis, possibly explained by the observed cytoplasmic retention of the nuclear FXR/RXR heterodimer. As macronutrient restriction during acute critical illness, an intervention that improved outcome, was found to further increase plasma bilirubin while reducing other markers of cholestasis, a potentially protective role of hyperbilirubinemia was suggested.

Conclusion

The increase in circulating levels of conjugated bile acids and bilirubin in response to acute sepsis/critical illnesses may not necessarily point to cholestasis as a pathophysiological entity. Instead it may be the result of an adaptively altered bile acid production and transport back towards the systemic circulation. How these changes could be beneficial for survival should be further investigated.

### Prevalence and risk factors of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in a semi-rural area of the democratic republic of Congo: a cohort study [^2e136826]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NH) is common among healthy newborns and usually resolves spontaneously within a week. The excess of unconjugated bilirubin in plasma is the result of a transient imbalance between bilirubin production, mostly derived from the breakdown of red blood cells, which have a higher concentration and a shorter life span than in adults, and its elimination by the immature liver. Conditions that increase bilirubin production and/or decrease its excretion may exacerbate this imbalance. Unconjugated bilirubin is a neurotoxic lipid-soluble compound that, if in excess, can cross the blood-brain barrier causing acute and chronic encephalopathy and long-term neurological sequelae (kernicterus spectrum disorder) and can lead to neonatal death. Morbidity and mortality are largely preventable if cases are identified and treated early. Where available, effective treatment includes blue-light phototherapy and in severe cases exchange transfusion. Known neonatal and maternal factors associated with an increased risk of NH are preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestational age), low birth weight (LBW; < 2,500 g) or small for gestational age (SGA), maternal-fetal ABO or Rhesus incompatibility, and inherited neonatal disorders such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and Gilbert's syndrome. Postnatal factors include birth trauma, infections, inadequate breastfeeding and dehydration in the first few days of life, and exclusive breastfeeding (late-onset hyperbilirubinemia). Pregnancy-associated complications and intercurrent diseases that increase the risk of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm birth, or LBW/SGA can increase the risk of NH.

It is estimated that worldwide this condition affects at least 481,000 term or near-term newborns annually, causing 114,000 deaths and more than 63,000 cases of moderate or severe disability. In high-income settings, early diagnosis and treatment have dramatically improved outcomes for newborns at risk. However, in low- and middle-income countries, true population-based data are scarce, especially from rural areas, and the contribution of hyperbilirubinemia to neonatal morbidity and mortality remains unclear. A recent meta-analysis of data from 12,327 infants in four sub-Saharan African countries estimated that more than one in four babies had hyperbilirubinemia (28%; 95% CI: 20–36%) with large differences across and between countries (ranging from 4.9% to 44.9%). These differences are probably caused in part by the use of different methods of diagnosis and different case definitions applied.

### Hyperbilirubinemia, hemolysis, and increased bilirubin neurotoxicity [^a7a161c2]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Increased hemolysis in the presence of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia appears to augment the risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity. The mechanism of this intensifying effect is uncertain. In direct antiglobulin titer (DAT) positive, isoimmune hemolytic disease, the bilirubin threshold at which neurotoxicity occurs appears to be lower than in DAT-negative hyperbilirubinemia. In other hemolytic conditions, the hemolysis may simply facilitate the development of extremely high serum bilirubin levels. Whether the hemolytic process per se exerts an independent effect or whether a very rapid rise in serum bilirubin might lead to greater penetration of the blood-brain barrier is unclear. In this review, we survey the synergistic role of hemolysis associated with severe hyperbilirubinemia in the potentiation of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity and suggest methods of identifying at-risk babies with increased hemolysis to allow for their increased surveillance.

### Effect of bilirubin and Gilbert syndrome on health: cohort analysis of observational, genetic, and mendelian randomisation associations [^dce12ed1]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Bilirubin is a breakdown product of haemoglobin and is widely measured as part of routine liver function testing. Bilirubin is known to have antioxidant properties and can reduce cellular exposure to reactive oxygen species in various in vitro and model animal systems. Additionally, observational studies have identified protective effects of increasing bilirubin concentrations on a wide range of outcomes. In particular, observational estimates have suggested large protective associations (eg, higher bilirubin concentrations were associated with lower odds) of myocardial infarctions and strokes.

Despite these studies, the evidence that bilirubin is causal for these outcomes remains limited. Concentrations of bilirubin are known to be altered by overall health state, liver function, obesity, and lifestyle traits such as smoking and alcohol intake. In the context of decompensated cirrhosis, hyperbilirubinaemia reflects synthetic dysfunction, hepatic failure, and can also be nephrotoxic. Due to these associations, measured bilirubin concentrations are highly likely to be confounded by health state. An association between health state (eg, low body mass index) and both high bilirubin levels and outcomes of interest (eg, cardiovascular disease) means that reported observations might not be causal, and bilirubin merely reflects a marker of health state.

### Bilirubin: translational perspectives [^5a754c0e]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Bilirubin, an old tetrapyrrolic compound that had occurred on Earth early on, is the final product of the catabolic heme pathway in the intravascular bed. Data from recent decades revealed its enormous bioactivity in a human body, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, antiproliferative, and even cell signaling activities that translate into beneficial effects of mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations resulting in prevention or amelioration of progression of many diseases of civilization. Furthermore, recent advances in bilirubin research have changed our understanding of bilirubin metabolism in the neonatal period, with discoveries of bilirubin reductase of bacterial origin in the intestinal lumen with direct pathophysiological and clinical implications. Similarly, our knowledge of the pathophysiology of neonatal jaundice phototherapy has improved substantially, although we are still at the beginning of the path to understand all the pathophysiological aspects and reveal related clinical implications. BULLET POINTS: Recent advances in our understanding of bilirubin metabolism with clear clinical implications, as well as other, so far putative, translational impacts. Demonstration of the beneficial biological potential of bilirubin, its evolutionary and ontogenetic functions, its possible role in chronobiology, and its correlation with increased fitness in elite athletes (a sort of gain of function). Discussion on the protective role of physiological neonatal jaundice. Inspiration for further basic and clinical research in specific fields of bilirubin metabolism.

Study selection

The results of the literature search are shown in the Fig. 1. Searches of Medline and EMBASE databases yielded 193 references. An additional 44 citations were found by extensively searching the bibliographies of selected articles. From the 237 studies identified, 180 studies were excluded after a cursory review of the title, abstract, and, when necessary, the results section. The full text of the remaining 57 articles was reviewed in detail. Forty of the remaining studies were excluded: 11 reports failed to report specific diagnoses; 6 reports had inclusion criteria that were too narrow; 6 reports included patients without conjugated hyperbilirubinemia; 6 reports were not case series or cohort studies; 5 reports had subjects with previously identified disease processes; 2 failed to include a detailed clinical evaluation; 1 each had vague inclusion criteria, non-consecutive patients, included the same patient population from another selected study, or had a sample size of less than 10. The remaining 17 studies comprise this review.

### Conjugated bilirubin triggers anemia by inducing erythrocyte death [^66e14e06]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Liver failure and fibrosis are commonly associated with anemia, a phenomenon which remains ill-defined due to the heterogeneous nature of anemia's pathogenesis. During liver disease, anemia can occur after blood loss, infection, cancer, or nutritional imbalances. Bleeding through esophageal varices can result in rapid blood loss and consequently anemia in patients with liver failure. Additionally, chronic viral infections can reduce the number of circulating erythrocytes by depletion of progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Hepatitis B and C infections and their treatment regimens are similarly associated with reduced erythrocyte counts.–Furthermore, as folate and vitamin B 12 are critical for erythrocyte development, nutritional imbalances may result in reduced erythrocyte production and consequently anemia. Moreover, expression of ferroportin-1 in the liver can impact the development of anemia, as ferroportin-1 is critical for iron metabolism and hematopoiesis during an iron-deficient diet. Although many conditions are associated with anemia, the impact of liver damage on erythrocytes and the associated underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Secondary acquired liver injury

Definition

Acquired liver injury without underlying liver disease represents the most common form of hepatic dysfunction in the ICU. It can occur after a hypoxic (e.g. shock), toxic (i.e. hepatotoxic drugs) or inflammatory insult (e.g. sepsis). There is no common definition for this syndrome, and its diagnosis is mainly based on the elevation of liver parameters, such as transaminases or bilirubin.

Cholestasis is characterized by altered bile excretion (i.e. extrahepatic cholestasis due to mechanical bile duct obstruction) or impaired conjugation and/or secretion (i.e. intrahepatic cholestasis owing to altered hepatocellular signaling and transport). This results in an accumulation of bile acids and conjugated bilirubin, together with increased enzymes that indicate cholestasis, such as alkaline phosphatase (AP) or γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). A consensus on how to define cholestasis in critically ill patients using these routine laboratory parameters does not exist. As defined by the SOFA score, a bilirubin threshold > 2 mg/dl is included in the guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and has been adopted by many authors. However, elevated bilirubin levels are not specific to cholestasis and might also reflect hemolysis. Lyu et al. showed that 73% of adult cardiac patients supported by veno-arterial ECMO had hyperbilirubinemia (> 3 mg/dl), which may be due to hemolysis in up to 42% of the cases. The combination of AP and GGT with or without bilirubin has been suggested to diagnose cholestasis more specifically.

Hypoxic liver injury is generally defined based on a clinical setting of circulatory, cardiac or respiratory failure, a substantial increase in transaminases, ranging from > 5 to > 20 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and the absence of other causes of liver damage. It was first reported in 1901 as "central necrosis" and is known as "ischemic hepatitis", "shock liver" or "hypoxic hepatitis". The cause is an imbalance of oxygen supply and demand in the liver that results in cell death. More specifically, insufficient hepatic perfusion, including Budd–Chiari perfusion, hypoxemia, poor global oxygen delivery, inadequate oxygen extraction by hepatocytes or an increased metabolic demand, can cause hypoxic liver injury. Three subgroups of causes may be distinguished: respiratory failure, cardiac failure and shock/hypotension.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^8201f123]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

Providing feeding support — breastfeeding-related jaundice categories and risks are described as follows: "Exclusive breastfeeding and hyperbilirubinemia are strongly associated.13 Jaundice in breastfed infants falls into 2 main categories, depending on its timing of onset". Suboptimal intake can lead to hyperbilirubinemia, the so-called breastfeeding jaundice, which "typically peaks on days 3 to 5 after birth and is frequently associated with excess weight loss", and "Breastfeeding fewer than 8 times per day has been associated with higher TSB concentrations". Mechanistically, "Low milk and low caloric intake contribute to decreased stool frequency and increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin". In contrast, "hyperbilirubinemia that persists with adequate human milk intake and weight gain is referred to as "breast milk jaundice" or the "breast milk jaundice syndrome". This cause of prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which "can last up to 3 months", "is almost always nonpathogenic and not associated with direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia".

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^f8c52eff]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### UGT1A1 genetic variants are associated with increases in bilirubin levels in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with sarilumab [^14ecdb7e]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the most frequent cause of safety-related postmarketing drug withdrawals and is the most common reason for acute liver failure in the United States. DILI shares many clinical features with other forms of liver injury, making a definitive DILI diagnosis challenging. A DILI diagnosis is usually determined by ruling out other common forms of liver injury, such as gall bladder disease, malignancy, and concomitant hepatotoxic drugs. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin are routinely measured in clinical trials to detect potential signals of drug-induced liver abnormalities. Drug-induced elevations in aminotransferases > 3 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) in combination with total bilirubin elevations > 2 × ULN have been termed "Hy's law", and may be indicative of severe hepatocellular injury and DILI. However, a number of drugs can cause transient aminotransferase elevations without progressing to severe liver injury (e.g. aspirin, statins, heparin), and genetic factors can predispose some individuals to hyperbilirubinemia.

The uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 gene (UGT1A1) encodes the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1–1, responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin and glucuronic acid, forming a water-soluble glucuronide that is excreted into the bile. Genetic variation in UGT1A1 has been linked to Gilbert's syndrome, a common benign condition characterized by elevations in unconjugated bilirubin and jaundice in the absence of aminotransferase elevations. The underlying genetic variation responsible for the majority of cases has been identified as a TA repeat polymorphism (UGT1A1 *28 allele) located in the promoter region. UGT1A1 *28 carriers have seven copies of the TA repeat polymorphism [A(TA) 7 TAA] and ~70% reduced UGT1A1 gene expression versus individuals with the more common allele featuring six copies of the TA repeat [A(TA) 6 TAA]. Gilbert's syndrome patients are typically homozygous carriers of the UGT1A1 *28 allele, and have lower UGT1A1 gene expression and diminished bilirubin metabolism. Other variants have been identified that influence UGT1A1 function and are associated with Gilbert's syndrome but are less common than the UGT1A1 *28 allele.

NASPGHAN hepatology training — importance and medical knowledge emphasize that because diseases of the liver and biliary tract have a significant impact on children, trainees in pediatric gastroenterology should have comprehensive exposure to the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders, their complications, and their pathophysiology; trainees should understand the normal structure and function of the liver and biliary tree and the prevalence, natural history, age-appropriate differential diagnoses, and genetic and other risk factors of hepatobiliary disorders; caring for children with hepatobiliary disease requires understanding of both common and rare causes including infectious, metabolic, genetic, anatomic, immunologic, and toxic; trainees should understand varying clinical manifestations including issues unique to pediatric hepatobiliary disorders (eg, effects on growth, nutrition, puberty, psychosocial functioning); and trainees also should have a complete understanding of diagnostic criteria that distinguish liver and biliary diseases with common patterns of presentation (eg, cholestasis, neonatal cholestasis, elevated aminotransferases, hepatomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, acute liver failure, direct or indirect hyperbilirubinemia, ascites) including differences in affected populations, results of laboratory evaluations, histopathology, radiologic studies, and disease course.

### Experimental models assessing bilirubin neurotoxicity [^db167bea]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The molecular and cellular events leading to bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity, the mechanisms regulating liver and intestine expression in neonates, and alternative pathways of bilirubin catabolism remain incompletely defined. To answer these questions, researchers have developed a number of model systems to closely recapitulate the main characteristics of the disease, ranging from tissue cultures to engineered mouse models. In the present review we describe in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models developed to study bilirubin metabolism and neurotoxicity, with a special focus on the use of engineered animal models. In addition, we discussed the most recent studies related to potential therapeutic approaches to treat neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, ranging from anti-inflammatory drugs, activation of nuclear receptor pathways, blockade of bilirubin catabolism, and stimulation of alternative bilirubin-disposal pathways.

Prognostic clinical features

Serum bilirubin is a stable and prevailing marker of liver impairment in the ICU. Its concentration is influenced by bilirubin synthesis, transport, uptake, conjugation and excretion. Ischemic and sepsis-associated cholestasis, drug-induced liver injury and parenteral nutrition are predominant causes of hyperbilirubinemia in the ICU. Bilirubin is a marker of liver dysfunction and a powerful prognostic factor. It has been shown to be linked to infections in surgical patients, to an increased mortality among trauma patients, sepsis or hematological malignancies, to a poor prognosis among ARDS patients, or simply to a worse outcome in the ICU (summarized in Table 3).

Table 3
Summary of the incidence and the overall mortality associated with increased bilirubin in ICU patients as reported in the literature

OR odds ratio, CI confidence interval, ICU intensive care unit, ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, N.d not documented, TA transaminases, AST aspartate aminotransferase, CA cardiac arrest

*Increase of 2 mg/dl from baseline

OR for complications, not for mortality

*Within the first 2 days after ICU admission

OR for unfavorable neurological outcome, not for mortality

In the case of cholestasis, total bile acids are also an independent prognostic factor of disease severity. An elevation of 5.2 µmol/l of total bile acids from baseline data demonstrated discriminating value, while mortality was specifically augmented with increases > 10 µmol/l. Horvatits et al. suggested that bile acids could be a better prognostic factor than bilirubin in the ICU. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the elevation of bile acids in critically ill patients is a distinct pathophysiological entity or a compensatory mechanism.

Regarding hypoxic liver injury, the indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate is an effective tool for assessing liver function. In an observational study with 97 patients, a cutoff value of 9% 48 h after ICU admission demonstrated a significant prognostic accuracy for 28-day mortality. In contrast, bilirubin, due to the later peak time, might not be a reliable marker and is elevated in only one-third of patients with hypoxic liver injury. The indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate outperforms bilirubin as a more sensitive combined indicator of perfusion and excretory liver function in the ICU.

Finally, underlying and concomitant syndromes will impact the outcome, such as sepsis or need for organ support. Moreover, the presence of coagulopathy or hepatic encephalopathy has been shown to predict mortality in critically ill patients with hypoxic liver injury. As expected, the severity of organ failure results in higher mortality rates.

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^c1f5fd50]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice in infants — background and risk factors — Cholestasis is defined as reduced bile formation or flow with retention of biliary substances, and cholestatic jaundice affects approximately 1 in every 2500 term infants; the most common causes in the first months of life are biliary atresia (BA) (25%–40%) and individually uncommon genetic disorders (25%). Parenteral nutrition (PN)-related cholestasis is present in up to one-fifth of neonates receiving PN for > 2 weeks, with longer duration of PN and intestinal failure described as independent risk factors; small for gestational age is an independent risk factor for neonatal cholestasis. The guideline notes it is not meant to address cholestasis in the preterm infant or PN, but close follow-up and serial measurements of fractionated bilirubin levels early in life are important, alongside monitoring growth and tolerance of enteral feedings. Persistent cholestasis in any infant should be considered hepatocellular in origin and all causes of cholestasis, including BA, should be ruled out in a timely fashion, and several studies demonstrate a higher incidence of BA in preterm infants compared with term infants with delayed diagnosis resulting in poorer outcome.

### The contribution of hemolysis to early jaundice in normal newborns [^2037bb31]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Neonatal jaundice is the result of an imbalance between bilirubin production and elimination, and our objective was to clarify the contribution of an increase in bilirubin production to hyperbilirubinemia in newborns.

Methods

We measured the end-tidal carbon monoxide concentration corrected for ambient carbon monoxide concentration in 108 jaundiced newborns (total serum bilirubin level > 75th percentile) and 164 control newborns in our well-infant nursery, for the first 4 days after birth.

Results

Mean end-tidal carbon monoxide levels decreased in the control infants in the first 4 days but increased in the hyperbilirubinemic group. The differences between the jaundiced and nonjaundiced infants were statistically significant on all days.

Conclusions

Before hospital discharge, most infants with bilirubin levels > 75th percentile are producing significantly more bilirubin than those with lower bilirubin levels. Because the ability of newborns to conjugate bilirubin is significantly impaired in the first few days, even a small increase in the rate of production can contribute to the development of hyperbilirubinemia. These data suggest that increased heme catabolism is an important mechanism responsible for hyperbilirubinemia in the first 4 days after birth.

### Effect of bilirubin and Gilbert syndrome on health: cohort analysis of observational, genetic, and mendelian randomisation associations [^a23c8e0d]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Gilbert syndrome is a common inherited condition association with mutations in the hepatic isoform (1A1) of uridine diphosphoglucose glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1A1). This enzyme, produced in the liver, conjugates water insoluble unconjugated bilirubin to glucuronic acid. This conjugated bilirubin can then be excreted in the bile. Gilbert syndrome is associated with various mutations, but in European populations, homozygosity for a two base pair TA insertion into the promoter of the UGT1A1 (rs3064744, also known as UGT1A*28) is the most common. This mutation impairs transcription of UGT1A1 leading to around 20–30% of normal transcriptional values and a subsequent reduced amount of enzyme. This reduced enzyme function leads to higher concentrations of conjugated bilirubin. People who are homozygous for this allele have greatly reduced enzyme transcription and subsequently higher concentrations of conjugated bilirubin than people who are heterozygotes (ie, inheritance of Gilbert syndrome at this allele is generally considered as recessive). This insertion is in complete linkage disequilibrium with a common single nucleotide polymorphism (rs887829) that is commonly genotyped and well imputed, allowing genotyping at scale in large cohorts. This mutation is common (around 35% of Europeans are heterozygotes and 10% are heterozygotes). This variant alone explains around 30–40% of variation in serum bilirubin concentrations, and nearly all European people with Gilbert syndrome carry this genotype. Hereafter, we refer to rs887829-T homozygosity as the Gilbert syndrome genotype because we recognise that most people with this genotype will have elevated bilirubin but no formal diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome (ie, incomplete penetrance).

This locus has a strong association with bilirubin and consequently has a clear mechanism (impairing transcription of the enzyme). The enzyme is known to have no other function apart from breaking down bilirubin, providing the opportunity for Mendelian randomisation to be performed. In Mendelian randomisation, genetic variants (in this case the variant rs887829) are used as instrumental variables to explore the causal association between an exposure (in this case bilirubin) and outcomes (in this case a variety of health outcomes). With specific assumptions, Mendelian randomisation can provide an estimate of the causal association between an exposure and outcomes, which are often intractable in observational studies due to the presence of unmeasured confounding.

In this study, we aimed to estimate the causal association between bilirubin and health outcomes using the Gilbert syndrome genotype as an instrumental variable and compare results with observational, measured analyses in a large UK volunteer cohort.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in pediatrics: evaluation and care [^a30cbeb6]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common laboratory finding for children, especially in infancy. It represents a broad range of diagnoses from benign physiologic changes to severe systemic illness. This paper addresses the evaluation and differential diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia for infants and older children based on the most recent guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) (1), the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) and the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) (2).

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^f5016dcb]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolonged neonatal jaundice is yellowing of the skin and sclerae, secondary to hyperbilirubinaemia, persisting beyond 14 days after birth. It is very common — 20–30% of breastfed neonates are still jaundiced at 1 month — and is usually transient and benign; however, it can be an important indicator of serious underlying pathology. The most common cause is physiological jaundice (especially in breastfed neonates), but a number of disease processes must be excluded, including haemolysis, sepsis, hypothyroidism, cystic fibrosis, metabolic disease and liver disease (mainly congenital hepatitis B/C or biliary atresia). It is particularly important to diagnose biliary atresia as, although rare, it is the only cause that is usually asymptomatic but in which early specialist assessment and surgery (Kasai portoenterostomy; ideally within 6–8 weeks of age) are crucial for prognosis. The abnormality of the biliary tree causes an obstructive jaundice with conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinaemia, whereas physiological jaundice and almost all other pathological causes result in a predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence — the primary publisher of UK clinical guidelines (NICE) — guidance is that the cause of prolonged jaundice requires investigation and referral for any neonate with a conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia > 25 µmol/L, but this is based on no referenced data. The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHN) recently released an updated guideline in collaboration with their European Society (ESPGHN) recommending further investigation under the definition of an abnormal direct bilirubin (a slight overestimate of conjugated bilirubin — see the Methods section) as > 1.0 mg/dL (17.2 µmol/L). Their previous guideline, which also incorporated the direct–total bilirubin ratio, acknowledged that their thresholds are based on 'lower quality studies'. And they now state that the move away from using the ratio is for simplicity rather than any novel evidence.

Standard Liver Tests

Clinical biomarkers routinely used to detect liver injury

In current clinical practice, there is a limited number of serum biomarkers used routinely to monitor the health of the liver (see Table 1).

Table 1
Current serum liver biomarkers used in clinical practice

Although these biomarkers have been used for many decades and are very useful in clinically assessing and managing patients with liver injury, they have shortcomings. ALT, a highly sensitive biomarker that is elevated in the serum during hepatocellular injury, can also be present due to several other conditions, including (i) glucocorticoid‐related enzyme induction, 35 (ii) decreased clearance secondary to impaired Kupffer cell function, 36 (iii) damage to other tissues, such as muscle, 37 and (iv) intense exercise. 38 Elevations of total bilirubin (TBILI) are observed for liver injuries caused by other diseases. Gilbert's syndrome is a fairly common genetic condition of impaired bilirubin conjugation that is considered benign and does not generally need treatment, but drugs whose disposition depends on the uridine 5′‐diphospho‐glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) pathway may have aberrant pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in patients with Gilbert's syndrome. 39 When DILI is the cause, one major shortcoming of elevated TBILI is poor sensitivity; by the time elevations in circulating TBILI are detected in conjunction with ALT elevations, the patient may have an advanced stage of drug‐induced liver damage. In addition, TBILI elevations can also occur in the setting of hemolysis as well as with inhibition of bilirubin transporters and the UGT1A1 enzyme. To evaluate potential DILI, the standard liver tests are used in the evaluation of Hy's Law. 40 Thus, the specificity of serum aminotransferase elevations and the sensitivity of changing bilirubin levels for DILI are both limited. In addition, other causes of these standard biomarker increases must be ruled out before attributing them to DILI.

Late-preterm infants — bilirubin-related neurologic risks — Moderately preterm infants are also at increased risk for acute bilirubin encephalopathy, and clinical manifestations may be more subtle in the LPT infant versus the term infant. Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus) secondary to high concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin can result in permanent neurologic damage. Even exposure to moderate concentrations of bilirubin may lead to more subtle yet permanent neurodevelopmental impairment, which is labeled as bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction. Auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder is a common manifestation of bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction in the LPT infant.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^f0d8216f]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy are diverse.

Objective

Determine the prevalence rates of the specific etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy.

Data Sources

EMBASE and Pubmed were searched electronically and the bibliographies of selected studies were search manually. The search was conducted independently by two authors.

Study Selection

(1) prospective or retrospective case series or cohort study with 10 or more subjects; (2) consecutive infants who presented with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia; (3) subjects underwent appropriate diagnostic work-up for conjugated hyperbilirubinemia; (4) no specific diagnoses were excluded in the studied cohort.

Data Extraction

Patient number, age range, country of origin, and categorical and specific etiologies.

Results

From 237 studies identified, 17 studies encompassing 1692 infants were selected. Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (INH) occurred in 26.0% of cases; the most common specific etiologies were extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) (25.89%), infection (11.47%), TPN- associated cholestasis (6.44%), metabolic disease (4.37%), alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency (4.14%), and perinatal hypoxia/ischemia (3.66%). CMV was the most common infection identified (31.51%) and galactosemia (36.49%) was the most common metabolic disease identified.

Limitations

Major limitations are: (1) inconsistencies in the diagnostic evaluations among the different studies and (2) variations among the sample populations.

Conclusions

INH is the most common diagnosis for conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy while EHBA and infection are the most commonly identified etiologies. The present review is intended to be a guide to the differential diagnosis and evaluation of the infant presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

### Jaundice in the adult patient… [^8d1f3075]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

The classic definition of jaundice is a serum bilirubin level greater than 2. 5 to 3 mg per dL in conjunction with a clinical picture of yellow skin and sclera. Bilirubin metabolism takes place in three phases — prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic. Dysfunction in any of these phases may lead to jaundice. Differential Diagnosis Jaundice can be caused by a malfunction in any of the three phases of bilirubin production. 8 Pseudojaundice can occur with excessive ingestion of foods rich in beta-carotene. Unlike true jaundice, carotenemia does not result in scleral icterus or elevation of the bilirubin level.
8. 1 Typically, the disease results in a mild decrease in the activity of the enzyme glucuronosyltransferase, causing an increase in the indirect fraction of serum bilirubin.

Gilbert syndrome is typically an incidental finding on routine liver function tests, when the bilirubin level is slightly increased and all other liver function values are within normal limits. Jaundice and further elevation of the bilirubin level may occur during periods of stress, fasting, or illness. However, these changes are usually transient, and there is no need to pursue treatment or liver biopsy.

1. Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia The predominant causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are intrahepatic cholestasis and extrahepatic obstruction of the biliary tract, with the latter preventing bilirubin from moving into the intestines. Viruses, alcohol, and autoimmune disorders are the most common causes of hepatitis. Intrahepatic inflammation disrupts transport of conjugated bilirubin and causes jaundice. Dubin-Johnson syndrome and Rotor's syndrome are rare hereditary metabolic defects that disrupt transport of conjugated bilirubin from the hepatocyte.

8 Many drugs have been shown to play a role in the development of cholestatic jaundice. Agents classically identified with drug-induced liver disease are acetaminophen, penicillins, oral contraceptives, chlorpromazine, and estrogenic or anabolic steroids. Cholestasis can develop during the first few months of oral contraceptive use and may result in jaundice. 14.

### How to use donath-landsteiner test to diagnose paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria (PCH) [^bd412416]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

What initial laboratory tests may be useful in aiding a diagnosis of haemolytic anaemia and what might you expect from these investigations?

A haemolytic screen should be carried out and its result interpreted collectively: full blood count (FBC) and film, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), split bilirubin (unconjugated and conjugated), reticulocytes, haptoglobin and urinalysis (dipstick and microscopy). Typical findings and limitations in interpretation are noted in figure 7. Laboratory results in extravascular haemolysis are generally less severe, as haemolysis occurs in the reticuloendothelial system, with fewer degradation products released into the circulation.

Figure 7
Comparison between the typical laboratory findings in an extravascular versus an intravascular haemolysis. Note: Haptoglobin is not produced efficiently in children under 2 years or those with liver disease (levels are artificially low) and rises with acute inflammation, so it may be misleadingly normal in infection/inflammation despite haemolysis. LDH is non-specifically elevated in tissue damage and may remain low in extravascular haemolysis as red cells are mopped up by the reticuloendothelial system. Reticulocytes may be depressed initially because infection is often myelosuppressive and then rebound. ↑↑, significantly increased; ↑, increased; ↓, decreased; ↓↓, significantly decreased; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.

Haemolysis causes anaemia if the bone marrow RBC production cannot compensate for increased RBC destruction. Haemoglobinuria should be suspected if the urine dipstick is positive for blood but urine microscopy shows minimal red cells. Haptoglobin, the most sensitive laboratory indicator of haemolysis and last marker to normalise, is significantly decreased due to free haemoglobin (Hb) exceeding the Hb-binding capacity of the circulating haptoglobins. A reticulocytosis is usually seen, although with AIHA reticulocytopenia can commonly occur in the acute phase due to myelosuppression secondary to a recent infection or inadequate compensatory reticulocytosis. The patient's blood results are shown in figure 1.

The breastfed infant with prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia can present a vexing clinical dilemma. Although it is a frequently observed and usually benign finding, prolonged jaundice in the breastfed newborn requires a thoughtful evaluation that excludes possible pathological aetiologies. While recommendations for the treatment of unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in the first 7 days of life are straightforward, the approach to the breastfeeding infant with jaundice that persists beyond the immediate neonatal period is less clearly delineated. A sound understanding of bilirubin physiology and familiarity with current literature must guide the management of the otherwise well breastfeeding infant with prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

Introduction

Neonatal jaundice, also known as neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, is the most common cause of neonatal morbidity in the first week of life; approximately 60% of all term neonates and 80% of preterm neonates develop clinical jaundice, although the majority of them are physiological and do not require treatment. Several factors contribute to neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, including increased bilirubin production from the lysis of more red blood cells (RBCs) due to their greater blood volume and higher RBC mass compared with adults, decreased lifespan of RBCs due to the presence of fetal haemoglobin, decreased bilirubin clearance by the immature hepatic enzyme system and increased reabsorption by enterohepatic circulation. Increased enterohepatic circulation is due to a deficiency in Clostridium ramosum and the overactivity of beta-glucuronidase in the gut, which rapidly deconjugates conjugated bilirubin. Because of its non-polar, non-water-soluble and fat-soluble nature, unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) crosses the gut wall and enters enterohepatic circulation. Stasis or delay in the passage of the meconium also increases enterohepatic circulation. Bilirubin is a potent endogenous antioxidant that prevents reactive oxidative damage. Thus, physiological jaundice in neonates may act as a natural protective mechanism. However, very high serum bilirubin levels can cause bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND) or bilirubin encephalopathy in some babies. Thus, among all the cases of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, approximately 5%–10% require treatment in the form of phototherapy to lower the bilirubin level to prevent the development of BIND. Amorphous calcium phosphates selectively bind to UCB (fat-soluble) in a dose-dependent manner and convert it into an ionic compound that cannot cross the intestinal wall; thus, it acts as a trapping agent for bilirubin in the intestine. Normally, approximately 10%–20% of bilirubin enters the enterohepatic circulation; therefore, with the use of oral calcium phosphate, we can expect a 10%–20% decrease in bilirubin load, which the hepatic conjugation system or phototherapy has to deal with. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of oral calcium phosphate as an adjunct to standard phototherapy in reducing the duration of phototherapy. Secondary objectives included comparing the rate of fall of bilirubin and the incidence of rebound hyperbilirubinaemia between the study groups.

Are There Other Causes of a Falsely Elevated Serum Creatinine Level?

The concentration of creatinine in serum is the most widely used and commonly accepted measure of renal function in clinical medicine. In renal failure, deterioration of renal function, results in the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products, including creatinine.

In the absence of renal failure, elevated creatinine levels may be due to factors influencing creatine production as well as elimination. The total muscle mass is the most important determinant of the creatine pool size and thereby of creatinine production. Hence serum creatinine is increased in people with increased muscle mass, those with a high-meat diet, users of anabolic steroids, and weight lifters. Trauma or febrile states have been associated with significant increases in the excretion of creatinine.

Rhabdomyolysis or extensive crush injury may result in an increase of serum creatinine, at times exceeding what can be accounted for by the decrement in renal function, the excess creatinine is generally assumed to derive from injured muscle. But it was found that phosphocreatine was present in muscle in sufficient amounts to serve as a direct intermediate in the conversion of phosphocreatine to creatinine.

Other substances that can cause false elevations of the measured serum creatinine determined by the Jaffe method include ketoacids, acetone, pyruvate, glucose, uric acid, proteins, creatine, ascorbic acid, dopamine, and certain cephalosporins. High concentrations of bilirubin can falsely lower the serum creatinine concentration determined by the Jaffe method. Enzymatic methods for determining serum creatinine concentration are not affected by the presence of nitromethane in serum. Substances that can interfere with this enzymatic method when present in the serum include creatine, bilirubin, dopamine, dobutamine, ascorbic acid, and calcium dobesilate.

What are Some Other Common Laboratory Analysis Cross-reactivities of Interest to Toxicologists?

The techniques for detecting the presence of drugs include a variety of chromatographic methods, immunoassays, and chemical and spectrometric techniques. A number of interferences resulting in "false-positive" results have been reported. Some common, important interferences resulting in false-positive results are listed in Table 1.

### Technical report: diagnosis and management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^657beb30]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia ≥ 35 weeks' gestation — scope and risk context: The gestational age cutoff of ≥ 35 weeks was chosen because it includes most newborn infants cared for in mother-baby units and well-baby nurseries, and this guideline does not apply to preterm newborns born < 35 weeks' gestation who generally receive care in neonatal intensive care units. Although rare in high-resource settings, kernicterus is deadly and leads to severe, lifelong neurodevelopmental impairment in survivors, and at some patient-specific threshold severe bilirubinemia can lead to bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus. The current evidence base is insufficient to quantitatively derive the exact treatment threshold, but recent, large cohort investigations have provided reassurance that there are certain total serum bilirubin concentrations below which kernicterus or adverse effects are not observed.

### Hemolytic anemia [^a518eb93]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hemolysis presents as acute or chronic anemia, reticulocytosis, or jaundice. The diagnosis is established by reticulocytosis, increased unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, and peripheral blood smear findings. Premature destruction of erythrocytes occurs intravascularly or extravascularly. The etiologies of hemolysis often are categorized as acquired or hereditary. Common acquired causes of hemolytic anemia are autoimmunity, microangiopathy, and infection. Immune-mediated hemolysis, caused by antierythrocyte antibodies, can be secondary to malignancies, autoimmune disorders, drugs, and transfusion reactions. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane is damaged in circulation, leading to intravascular hemolysis and the appearance of schistocytes. Infectious agents such as malaria and babesiosis invade red blood cells. Disorders of red blood cell enzymes, membranes, and hemoglobin cause hereditary hemolytic anemias. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency leads to hemolysis in the presence of oxidative stress. Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by spherocytes, a family history, and a negative direct antiglobulin test. Sickle cell anemia and thalassemia are hemoglobinopathies characterized by chronic hemolysis.

### Gastrointestinal and hepatic complications of sickle cell disease [^9e190ff9]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive abnormality of the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin (Hb), resulting in poorly deformable sickled cells that cause microvascular occlusion and hemolytic anemia. The spleen is almost always affected by SCD, with microinfarcts within the first 36 months of life resulting in splenic atrophy. Acute liver disorders causing right-sided abdominal pain include acute vaso-occlusive crisis, liver infarction, and acute hepatic crisis. Chronic liver disease might be due to hemosiderosis and hepatitis and possibly to SCD itself if small, clinically silent microvascular occlusions occur chronically. Black pigment gallstones caused by elevated bilirubin excretion are common. Their small size permits them to travel into the common bile duct but cause only low-grade obstruction, so hyperbilirubinemia rather than bile duct dilatation is typical. Whether cholecystectomy should be done in asymptomatic individuals is controversial. The most common laboratory abnormality is an elevation of unconjugated bilirubin level. Bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase levels correlate with one another, suggesting that chronic hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis, rather than liver disease, are the sources of hyperbilirubinemia. Abdominal pain is very common in SCD and is usually due to sickling, which resolves with supportive care. Computed tomography scans might be ordered for severe or unremitting pain. The liver typically shows sickled erythrocytes and Kupffer cell enlargement acutely and hemosiderosis chronically. The safety of liver biopsies has been questioned, particularly during acute sickling crisis. Treatments include blood transfusions, exchange transfusions, iron-chelating agents, hydroxyurea, and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.

Despite in vitro activityand strong observational associations, the application of Mendelian randomisation here suggests that life course exposure to altered bilirubin concentrations is unlikely to be causally related to a broad range of health outcomes.

### Involvement of the liver in COVID-19: a systematic review [^e1e967c3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Elevation in aminotransferase levels.

The commonest liver test abnormalities reported are mild to moderate elevations in ALT and AST levels (seen in 14–53% of cases). Significant elevations of ALT and AST are commoner in those with other digestive symptoms. Raised liver aminotransferases are associated with significantly longer hospital stays. A multicenter retrospective cohort study of 5,771 adult COVID-19 patients found AST to increase initially followed by ALT. Aspartate transaminase abnormalities were associated with the highest risk of mortality. Although ALT is more specific to the liver, higher AST levels may be associated with injury to other organs or because of mitochondrial injury and should thus be interpreted with caution.

Elevations in bilirubin levels.

Elevated bilirubin levels are observed in 20–40% of patients and 10% had very high levels. Bilirubin levels are significantly higher in those with severe disease and are associated with a poorer prognosis. Most of the studies do not indicate whether the hypebilirubinemia is of the direct or indirect type. A study from Spain found a biphasic pattern of hyperbilirubinemia, initially hepatocellular and later cholestatic in type. This suggests that the elevation of bilirubin may be because of both direct hepatic injury and cholestasis. In addition to the increase in serum total bilirubin levels, raised conjugated bilirubin levels and conjugated to unconjugated bilirubin ratios were observed in COVID-19 patients. The high bilirubin levels may also be related to hemolysis. Further studies would delineate the predominant pathogenesis of elevated bilirubin levels in COVID-19.

### Can the type of gallstones be predicted with known possible risk factors? a comparison between mixed cholesterol and black pigment stones [^9710a3e1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gallstone (GS) disease is one of the leading upper gastrointestinal surgical problems in the Western countries causing a significant health care burden. Though prevalence of GS disease is low among Asians a rising trend of GS disease is observed. The worldwide distribution of types of GS is different and cholesterol GS is the commonest type in Western population while brown pigment GS is the commonest type in East Asians. Black pigment stones are rare in these countries. Compare to Western and East Asian countries black pigment GS are prevalent in South Asian population. Moreover, of the different types of cholesterol GS, mixed cholesterol and black pigment GS are identified as the predominant types of GS in South Asian population. Therefore the identification of aetiopathogenesis of GS with special reference to both mixed cholesterol and black pigment GS is important in implementing preventive measures for GS among South Asians. Both mixed cholesterol and black pigment stones are composed of same chemical constituents namely cholesterol, calcium bilirubinate, calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. Cholesterol is the main chemical constituent in mixed cholesterol GS whereas calcium bilirubinate is the main constituent in black pigment GS. Further in mixed cholesterol GS, cholesterol is concentrated mainly in peripheral zones and pigments are mainly seen in the core. Therefore though these two types of GS are described separately existence of common aetiological factors for both types of GS is also a possibility.

Main cause for the pathogenesis of black pigment GS is the elevated unconjugated bilirubin level in bile. Conditions causing chronic hemolysis and chronic liver disease are identified as classic causes for elevated biliary unconjugated bilirubin. Apart from that gall bladder hypomotility, acquired enterohepatic circulation of unconjugated bilirubin and effects of trace elements are under investigation as the causes for pathogenesis of black pigment GS, as most of the incidence of this type of stone cannot be explained by the classic causes. Of these causes the acquired enterohepatic circulation of unconjugated bilirubin is a new concept of pathogenesis of black pigment GS and ileal dysfunction is identified as the principle pathology behind this concept. Diseases, resection or bypass surgeries of ileum, dietary factors causing impaired ileal function (high carbohydrate and cholesterol) and alcoholism are the main causes for ileal dysfunction.

### Genetic interactions in the pathogenesis of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: Gilbert's syndrome and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [^29e02dc0]. Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency is a common condition with a worldwide distribution that has the potential for causing severe hyperbilirubinemia with bilirubin encephalopathy. Hemolysis resulting from identifiable triggers may be the cause of the jaundice in some cases, but in many, jaundice continues to occur despite avoidance of contact with known hemolytic triggers. In some G-6-PD-deficient population groups, carboxyhemoglobin studies have indicated exaggerated hemolysis; but in others, increased hemolysis has not correlated with serum total bilirubin values. As hyperbilirubinemia results from an imbalance between bilirubin production and bilirubin elimination, diminished bilirubin conjugation was suspected to contribute to the pathogenesis of hyperbilirubinemia. Serum-conjugated bilirubin fractions, reflecting intrahepatocytic bilirubin conjugation, were low in G-6-PD-deficient neonates who developed hyperbilirubinemia. This conjugated bilirubin profile was similar to that seen in adults with Gilbert's Syndrome, a condition associated with promoter polymorphism for the gene encoding the bilirubin-conjugating enzyme, UGT glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT). Whereas G-6-PD deficiency or Gilbert's Syndrome, alone, did not predispose to hyperbilirubinemia, G-6-PD-deficient neonates who also were heterozygotes or homozygotes for the variant UGT gene promoter did have significantly increased incidences of hyperbilirubinemia. Additional conditions which predispose to neonatal jaundice in the presence of Gilbert's Syndrome, include Coombs' negative ABO blood group heterospecificity, hereditary spherocytosis, and prolonged breastfeeding. Gilbert's Syndrome and G-6-PD deficiency are both common, inherited conditions. Individually, and in the absence of additional genetic or environmental factors, both are benign, and should result in minimal health disturbance or interference with the quality of life of affected individuals. However, in combination, or following exposure to environmental or other genetic factors, these benign conditions may have severe manifestations, with potentially dangerous and possibly life-threatening consequences. This review highlights the major clinical features of both Gilbert's Syndrome and G-6-PD deficiency, and surveys a series of studies related to neonatal jaundice in G-6-PD-deficient neonates culminating in the documentation of an interaction between the two conditions that is crucial to the pathogenesis of hyperbilirubinemia.

Background

Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy defined by the new onset of hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation, accompanied by proteinuria and/or signs of maternal organ dysfunction. It complicates approximately 2–8% of all pregnancies and is responsible for at least 17% of maternal deaths worldwide. PE may progress to multiorgan failure and maternal mortality, and it is a major contributor to fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality due to compromised placental perfusion and preterm delivery. Despite extensive research efforts, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PE remain incompletely elucidated.

Due to its involvement in diverse pathological pathways and its heterogeneous clinical manifestations, PE is frequently described as a "disease of theories". The clinical course of PE can deteriorate rapidly and unpredictably, and currently, the only definitive treatment is delivery. The potential for life-threatening complications — such as acute renal injury, hepatic dysfunction, and neurological, cardiac, or hematologic involvement — has intensified efforts to enhance early diagnosis and risk prediction. Nevertheless, existing predictive tools remain suboptimal. A 2024 study reported a predictive accuracy of only 41% for term PE at a 10% false-positive rate, highlighting the limitations of current diagnostic strategies. Consequently, ongoing research continues to seek improvements in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of PE.

The pathophysiology of PE is characterized by abnormal placental perfusion, tissue hypoxia, and subsequent cellular injury. This injury is commonly associated with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a well-established marker of cellular damage. Hemolysis is also a prominent feature, resulting in erythrocyte destruction and the release of bilirubin, a breakdown product of hemoglobin catabolism. Heme is enzymatically degraded by heme oxygenase (HO) into ferrous iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin, which is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. While bilirubin possesses notable antioxidant properties, it may exert cytotoxic effects when present at elevated concentrations. In the circulation, bilirubin binds tightly to albumin and is transported to the liver, where it undergoes conjugation by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, increasing its solubility and facilitating biliary excretion. Elevated levels of indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin typically reflect hemolysis or impaired hepatic conjugation, whereas increased direct (conjugated) bilirubin suggests biliary obstruction or impaired hepatic excretory function.

Assessment and monitoring — risk factor–based follow-up: Infants with risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia (Table 1) require closer monitoring than infants without risk factors. Determining the presence of these risk factors requires examining the infant, assessing laboratory data, and obtaining a family history of blood disorders or neonatal jaundice.
