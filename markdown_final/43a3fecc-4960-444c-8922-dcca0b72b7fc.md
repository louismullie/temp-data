## Question

Can you order more than 10 days narcotic after spine surgery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is appropriate to prescribe more than 10 days of opioids after spine surgery and, if so, under what circumstances and with what safeguards. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline recommendation for opioid-naïve patients and the rationale for short courses. Then, I should verify how preoperative opioid exposure changes risk and duration needs. Next, I will examine procedure-specific factors that might justify longer courses. After that, I need to check the evidence linking duration and dose to persistent postoperative opioid use and outcomes. Finally, I should review tapering, follow-up, and multimodal alternatives, and then synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the baseline guidance for opioid-naïve patients. The CDC recommends prescribing no more than needed for the expected duration of severe acute pain, and for many nonsurgical acute pain conditions, a few days or less are sufficient; when opioids are used continuously for more than a few days, a brief taper is advised to mitigate withdrawal, which argues against routine prescriptions beyond about 7–10 days unless there is a compelling indication [^114Jgcp4] [^116nN3yj]. I should also note that expert consensus from the UK advises no more than 7 days for opioid-naïve postoperative patients, reinforcing a conservative default duration after surgery [^115jPjj7].

> Wait, let me verify the risk of prolonged use in spine surgery specifically. Multiple high-quality cohorts and guidelines show that preoperative opioid exposure is the strongest predictor of persistent postoperative use, with odds ratios around 3–6 for continued use and substantially higher risks when preoperative use exceeds 3–6 months. This means that even modest postoperative exposure can convert to long-term use in vulnerable patients, so I need to be cautious about extending courses beyond 10 days without a clear plan and reassessment [^111r7hqx] [^112rsWr1] [^111phGDX]. I should double-check the dose–response signal as well: higher initial postoperative doses correlate with dependence and slower cessation, which further supports minimizing both quantity and duration whenever possible [^113sLUvE] [^112xruh5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Procedure type matters. For simple decompressions or single-level discectomies, pain typically improves rapidly and many patients require little to no opioid beyond a week, so extending beyond 10 days is rarely justified. In contrast, multilevel instrumented fusions or complex deformity surgery may entail more intense pain for 1–2 weeks, which could necessitate a longer initial prescription, but even then, careful reassessment at 7–10 days is prudent to avoid drift into prolonged use [^112T8Kv6]. I need to ensure that any extension beyond 10 days is tied to documented ongoing severe pain and a concrete taper plan rather than a blanket "just in case" refill [^114Jgcp4].

> Next, I should review the evidence on duration and outcomes. In opioid-naïve patients, extending postoperative opioid duration into 31–60 days is associated with markedly increased odds of chronic opioid use at 1 year and worse pain and disability outcomes, which strengthens the case for limiting initial prescriptions and planning early follow-up to de-escalate promptly [^112xruh5]. Let me consider dose as well: discharge prescriptions exceeding roughly 120 mg/day morphine equivalents are independently associated with opioid dependence after spine surgery, so both higher dose and longer duration compound risk and should prompt tighter stewardship and tapering protocols [^113sLUvE] [^115qc2o3].

> I should confirm the monitoring cadence. The CDC advises that if opioids are continued for acute pain, patients should be reassessed within about 2 weeks to verify ongoing indication, efficacy, and adverse effects; if therapy continues beyond a month, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible drivers of pain are addressed and that prescribing does not unintentionally transition to long-term therapy without intentional shared decision-making [^114Jgcp4] [^116nN3yj]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "mandatory reassessment", but I should correct that to "clinically indicated reassessment" given variability in state laws and institutional policies; still, scheduling a check-in at 7–14 days is a reasonable safeguard after an initial 7–10 day prescription [^114Jgcp4].

> Let me think about tapering, because that's often overlooked. If opioids are used around the clock for more than a few days, a brief taper reduces withdrawal risk; for example, after 7–10 days of regular use, a 20% dose reduction every 2–3 days is commonly effective, with adjustments based on total exposure and patient response, and the plan should be communicated at discharge to avoid abrupt discontinuation and missed follow-up [^1147bgZG]. I should double-check that this aligns with guideline-based tapering schedules referenced by trauma societies and the CDC, which endorse individualized, stepwise reductions tied to inpatient consumption patterns when feasible [^113P6tBa] [^1147bgZG].

> Next, I should review opioid-sparing strategies because minimizing quantity and duration is only one piece. Multimodal regimens incorporating acetaminophen, NSAIDs when not contraindicated, gabapentinoids, and regional techniques consistently reduce opioid requirements and improve pain control after spine surgery; in particular, triple therapy with paracetamol, NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor, and an adjunct such as low-dose ketamine or alpha-2 agonist provides the largest opioid-sparing effect in meta-analyses, and procedure-specific PROSPECT guidance supports these combinations in complex spine procedures [^112uam6E] [^112T8Kv6] [^111zTdPm]. But wait, what if NSAIDs are contraindicated due to fusion concerns? In that scenario, I need to ensure we still prioritize nonopioid multimodal options and consider regional or neuraxial strategies to maintain opioid minimization while protecting bone healing considerations [^111zTdPm].

> I will now examine how to operationalize risk stratification at discharge. For opioid-naïve patients with straightforward decompressions, prescribing 7–10 days with a built-in taper and a 7–14 day follow-up is reasonable. For opioid-tolerant patients, I should calculate a short-term increase over baseline for about 7–10 days and then return to the preoperative dose with a taper, coupled with close follow-up and a multimodal plan. For complex multilevel fusions, a 10–14 day initial prescription may be justified, but I should confirm early reassessment and a hard stop date to prevent creep beyond 2 weeks without explicit indication [^114Jgcp4] [^115jPjj7]. Hold on, I should verify that higher initial quantities do not translate into proportionally higher consumption; real-world data show a strong correlation between prescribed quantity and consumed quantity, reinforcing the need to right-size prescriptions and avoid surplus that fuels diversion or unintended prolonged use [^115iiZus].

> Finally, I need to ensure I am framing this as an individualized, risk-informed decision rather than a rigid rule. Yes, more than 10 days of opioids can be appropriate after spine surgery in select scenarios such as complex instrumented fusions, high pain severity with functional limitation despite optimized multimodal therapy, and carefully managed opioid-tolerant patients, but each extension should be accompanied by a documented rationale, a clear taper schedule, scheduled reassessment within 1–2 weeks, and explicit exit criteria to stop therapy. Conversely, for most opioid-naïve patients with routine decompressions, exceeding 10 days increases risk without added benefit and should generally be avoided [^114Jgcp4] [^116nN3yj] [^112xruh5]. I should double-check that my plan aligns with both CDC stewardship principles and spine-specific guideline syntheses emphasizing preoperative exposure as the dominant risk factor and the value of multimodal, procedure-specific protocols to minimize opioid exposure while maintaining analgesia [^111tXo4t] [^112T8Kv6].

It is generally **not recommended** to prescribe more than 10 days of narcotics after spine surgery, as evidence shows that longer courses increase the risk of persistent opioid use without improving pain control [^112xruh5] [^112iRBuU]. For opioid-naïve patients, **limit prescriptions to 7–10 days** and avoid refills unless there is a clear, documented need after reassessment [^114Jgcp4] [^115jPjj7]. For patients already on opioids, **individualize dosing and taper to the preoperative baseline as soon as possible**, with close follow-up and a strict taper plan to minimize risk of dependence and withdrawal [^114Jgcp4] [^1147bgZG]. Prolonged prescribing beyond 10 days should be reserved for exceptional cases with documented justification and ongoing reassessment [^116nN3yj].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The CDC's 2022 guideline advises clinicians to prescribe **the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration**, typically no more than 3–5 days for acute pain, and to avoid "just in case" refills; if pain persists, reassess and address reversible causes before continuing opioids [^114Jgcp4] [^116nN3yj]. The CNS recommends **individualized prescribing** based on preoperative opioid use, procedure type, and patient-specific risk factors, with careful tapering and close follow-up [^notfound].

---

## Risks associated with prolonged opioid use

Prolonged opioid use after spine surgery is associated with **significant risks**, including:

- **Persistent opioid use**: 15–18% of opioid-naïve patients become long-term users after spine surgery [^115WneXu] [^115oq8Su].
- **Dependence and misuse**: Higher discharge doses (> 120 MME/day) are independently associated with opioid dependence [^113sLUvE] [^115qc2o3].
- **Adverse outcomes**: Prolonged use is linked to higher complications, longer length of stay, increased healthcare costs, and poorer functional outcomes [^111Am5Wa] [^1166fzrc].

---

## Evidence on optimal duration of opioid therapy

Evidence supports **limiting opioid therapy to 7–10 days** after spine surgery:

- **Opioid-naïve patients**: Studies show no difference in pain outcomes between low-dose (< 40 MME/day) and higher-dose regimens, supporting the use of lower doses for shorter durations [^113VAm5n].
- **Patient-reported outcomes**: Shorter durations (≤ 10 days) are associated with improved satisfaction, faster opioid cessation, and fewer complications [^112xruh5].
- **Unused medication**: Large proportions of prescribed opioids remain unused, increasing diversion risk [^112iRBuU] [^116YwX57].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing opioid duration

Duration should be **individualized** based on:

| **Factor** | **Impact on opioid duration** |
|-|-|
| Preoperative opioid use | Strongly predicts prolonged postoperative use; taper to baseline ASAP [^111tXo4t] [^113dQj1M] |
| Procedure complexity | More extensive surgeries may require longer courses, but still limit to ≤ 10 days when possible [^notfound] |
| Comorbidities (e.g. depression, anxiety) | Increase risk of persistent use; monitor closely and taper early [^111QeuHR] [^1164Yd88] |
| Patient preference and response | Use shared decision-making; reassess at ≤ 2 weeks [^114Jgcp4] |

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with prolonged opioid use

Prolonged opioid use after spine surgery is associated with **worse clinical outcomes**, including [^112xruh5]:

- **Increased pain and disability**: Higher pain scores and reduced functional improvement at 1 year [^112xruh5].
- **Higher complication rates**: Increased risk of wound complications, infections, and revision surgery [^111wdNDG].
- **Lower satisfaction**: Patients report lower satisfaction and quality of life [^113McEfg] [^112xruh5].

---

## Alternative pain management strategies

Multimodal analgesia is recommended to minimize opioid use, including:

- **Non-opioid medications**: Acetaminophen, NSAIDs, gabapentinoids, and ketamine [^112T8Kv6] [^113wEM4X].
- **Regional anesthesia**: Epidural analgesia and nerve blocks [^112T8Kv6] [^111zTdPm].
- **Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols**: Reduce opioid consumption, length of stay, and complications [^113MrZ8D] [^114uRKN2].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Opioid-naïve patients**: Limit to 7–10 days; avoid refills without reassessment [^114Jgcp4] [^112iRBuU].
- **Opioid-tolerant patients**: Individualize dosing, taper to baseline ASAP, with close follow-up [^114Jgcp4] [^1147bgZG].
- **Prolonged use**: Generally discouraged; if necessary, document justification and monitor closely [^116nN3yj].

---

Prescribing more than 10 days of narcotics after spine surgery is generally **not recommended** due to the increased risk of persistent opioid use and adverse outcomes. Clinicians should limit opioid therapy to the shortest duration, use multimodal analgesia, and reassess patients regularly to minimize risks and optimize recovery [^112xruh5] [^114Jgcp4].

Eligibility criteria

Our patient population included adult and paediatric patients undergoing spinal surgical procedure on any spinal anatomical site. These anatomical sites cervical (anterior or posterior cervical decompression and fusion), thoracic (e.g. thoracic decompression and fusion), lumbar (e.g. lumbar decompression and fusion, lumbar laminectomy, sacral or any one combination of these). The interventions of interest have been classified in 5 perioperative pillars: preadmission period, preoperative period, intraoperative period, postoperative period, and audit and compliance processes (Table 1). These interventions (22 individual pathway components) have been defined through previous published work. We reviewed the evidence with regards to each component studied independently or in any one combination. Comparator interventions consisted of standard of care, no treatment or placebo.

In line with other ERAS reviews, we defined our primary outcomes in the following groups:
Morbidity, including pulmonary, cardiac, and renal complication rates; surgical complication rates; and
readmission rates.
Mortality from all causes.
Patient-reported experiences and outcomes (PREMs/PROMs), including pain-related outcomes.
(pain score rating and/or opioid consumption, pain management satisfaction), readiness for surgery, quality of care patient scores, and quality of recovery outcomes.
Health service-related outcomes, including length of stay and reported economic/financial outcomes (e.g. costs of the length of stay).

We included systematic reviews and meta-analysis, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled studies, and observational studies (e.g. cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, and case series). We included human data studies published in the English language after 1990.

### Pain management after complex spine surgery: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^113FHuqv]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complex spine surgery can be defined as thoracolumbar spine surgery with instrumentation, laminectomy at three or more levels, or scoliosis surgery. Complex spine surgery can improve long-term pain and quality of life in patients with symptomatic back diseases such as idiopathic scoliosis. However, complex spine surgery is associated with significant postoperative pain. Effective pain control can affect early postoperative rehabilitation and long-term outcomes. Although previous reviews stated that multimodal analgesia should be preferred for spine surgery, insufficient evidence did not allow clear recommendations for certain associations of analgesics.

With significant variations in analgesic protocols, a unified approach is necessary to provide standardised interventions on pain reduction. The PROcedure SPECific postoperative pain managemenT (PROSPECT) Working Group is a collaboration of surgeons and anaesthetists working to formulate procedure-specific recommendations for pain management after common but potentially painful operations. The recommendations are based on a procedure-specific systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses. The methodology considers clinical practice, efficacy and adverse effects of analgesic techniques.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature on the effects of analgesic, anaesthetic and surgical interventions on pain after complex back surgery. The primary outcomes sought were postoperative pain scores and analgesic requirements.

This Clinical Research discusses the diverse nature of spine surgery procedures and the use of multimodal analgesia within enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols to improve patient outcomes. Spine surgeries range from minor decompressions to extensive tumor resections, performed by neurosurgeons or orthopedic spine surgeons on adults and children. To manage perioperative pain effectively, various methods have been employed, including multimodal analgesia within ERAS protocols. Incorporating ERAS protocols into spine surgery has shown benefits such as reduced pain scores, decreased opioid use, shorter hospital stays, and improved functionality. ERAS protocols help to enhance patient outcomes, focusing on deconstructing these protocols for surgeons and anesthesiologists.

Implementation Considerations

Nontraumatic, nonsurgical acute pain can often be managed without opioids (see Recommendation 1).
Opioids are sometimes needed for treatment of acute pain (see Recommendation 1). When the diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. For many common causes of nontraumatic, nonsurgical pain, when opioids are needed, a few days or less are often sufficient, and shorter courses can minimize the need to taper opioids to prevent withdrawal symptoms at the end of a course of opioids. However, durations should be individualized to the patient's clinical circumstances.
Clinicians should generally avoid prescribing additional opioids to patients just in case pain continues longer than expected.
For postoperative pain related to major surgery, procedure-specific opioid prescribing recommendations are available with ranges for amounts of opioids needed (on the basis of actual use and refills and on consensus).
To minimize unintended effects on patients, clinicians, practices, and health systems should have mechanisms in place for the subset of patients who experience severe acute pain that continues longer than the expected duration. These mechanisms should allow for timely reevaluation to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis and adjust pain management accordingly. Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize disparities in access to and affordability of care and refills by ensuring all patients can obtain and afford additional evaluation and treatment, as needed.
Longer durations of opioid therapy are more likely to be needed when the mechanism of injury is expected to result in prolonged severe pain (e.g. severe traumatic injuries).
Patients should be evaluated at least every 2 weeks if they continue to receive opioids for acute pain.
If opioids are continued for ≥ 1 month, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. Clinicians should refer to recommendations on subacute and chronic pain for initiation (Recommendation 2), follow-up (Recommendation 7), and tapering (Recommendation 5) of ongoing opioid therapy.
If patients already receiving long-term opioid therapy require additional opioids for superimposed severe acute pain (e.g. major surgery), opioids should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days.
If opioids are used continuously (around the clock) for more than a few days for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe a brief taper to minimize withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of opioids.
If a taper is needed, taper durations might need to be adjusted depending on the duration of the initial opioid prescription (see Supporting Rationale for this recommendation for additional details).
Tapering plans should be discussed with the patient before hospital discharge and with clinicians coordinating the patient's care as an outpatient. (See Recommendation 5 for tapering considerations when patients have taken opioids continuously for > 1 month.)

### Pain management after complex spine surgery: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^112T8Kv6]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are currently no studies in the literature that directly assess the effectiveness of muscle relaxants and nonbenzodiazepines. We did not find evidence to promote one surgical technique over another.

The limitations of this review are related to those of the included studies. There was considerable heterogeneity across the studies, such as the type of surgery. The number of vertebrae involved differed between studies and also differed in some populations within a single RCT. There was also heterogeneity in the drug doses administered, the methods of drug administration and the sample sizes. Not all drugs in the RCTs were compared with a multimodal analgesic regimen. One of the major gaps in the literature is the lack of studies assessing analgesic interventions for different types of pain (e.g. neuropathic or radicular pain), or specific patient populations (e.g. opioid-dependent patients or those with major psychiatric disorders).

In summary, major spine surgery with multilevel instrumentation is painful, requiring significant opioid use. This review has identified the analgesic regimen for optimal pain management after complex spine surgery (Table 2). We also identified analgesic interventions that are not recommended (Table 3). We recommend multimodal pain management including pre- or intra-operative paracetamol and NSAIDs or COX-2 specific inhibitors and continued in the postoperative period. Intra-operatively, we recommend the use of a low-dose ketamine infusion. Further, we suggest the use of an epidural catheter, placed under direct visualisation by the surgeon, and postoperative infusion with local anaesthetic alone or combined with opioids. As rescue analgesia postoperatively, we recommend the use of opioids. Well designed procedure-specific studies are necessary to assess the clinical benefits of the recommendations.

### Risk factors for prolonged postoperative opioid use after spine surgery: a review of dispensation trends from a state-run prescription monitoring program [^1166gC2B]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Opioid abuse and dependence have a detrimental effect on elective orthopaedic surgeries, yet pain control is an important predictor of postoperative satisfaction. We aimed at better defining risk factors for prolonged postoperative opioid requirements and risk factors for patients requiring higher doses of opioids after spine surgery.

Methods

The Illinois Prescription Monitoring Program was queried to analyze opioid dispensation patterns at 3 and 6 months postoperatively for adult patients who had spine surgery at a tertiary care hospital by a single surgeon over a 5-year period. Patients were divided into three groups: group 1 patients had opioid dispensed to them 3 and 6 months preoperatively, group 2 patients had opioid dispensed to them only at 3 months preoperatively, and group 3 patients did not have preoperative opioid prescriptions. Demographic characteristics, psychiatric history, smoking status, alcohol use, body mass index, surgical region, and presence of multiple prescribers were abstracted. Statistical analysis included multivariate modified Poisson regression, linear regression, and chi-squared testing when appropriate.

Results

Patients in group 1 were at significantly increased risk of continued opioid usage than those in group 2 (relative risk, 3.934; 95% confidence interval, 1.691 to 9.150; P = 0.0015) and those in group 3 (relative risk, 4.004; 95% confidence interval, 1.712 to 9.365; P = 0.0014) at 6 months postoperatively. Group 1 patients also had larger quantities of opioid dispensed to them relative to patients in group 2 or group 3 (P < 0.0001) at 6 months postoperatively.

Discussion

Use of opioid medications at 6 months preoperatively is a risk factor for continued usage and at higher doses 6 months postoperatively.

Level Of Evidence

### Association of the 2016 US centers for disease control and prevention opioid prescribing guideline with changes in opioid dispensing after surgery [^1143c8q2]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the release of the 2016 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain associated with changes in opioid dispensing after surgery?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 361 556 opioid-naive patients undergoing 8 common surgical procedures, time-series analysis found that the amount of opioid dispensed after surgery decreased progressively in the 2 years after the guideline release, whereas it was increasing in the 2 years prior.

Meaning

These findings suggest that the release of the 2016 CDC guideline coincided with a decrease in postoperative opioid dispensing across a range of surgical procedures and may have been associated with decreases in overprescribing of opioids for postoperative pain management.

### Postoperative opioid prescription and patient-reported outcomes after elective spine surgery: a Michigan spine surgery improvement collaborative study [^112xJhEJ]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to assess how postoperative opioid prescription dosage could affect patient-reported outcomes after elective spine surgery.

Methods

Patients enrolled in the Michigan Spine Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MSSIC) from January 2020 to September 2021 were included in this study. Opioid prescriptions at discharge were converted to total morphine milligram equivalents (MME). A reference value of 225 MME per week was used as a cutoff. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on prescribed total MME: ≤ 225 MME and > 225 MME. Primary outcomes included patient satisfaction, return to work status after surgery, and whether improvement of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 4-question short form for physical function (PROMIS PF) and EQ-5D was met. Generalized estimated equations were used for multivariate analysis.

Results

Regression analysis revealed that patients who had postoperative opioids prescribed with > 225 MME were less likely to be satisfied with surgery (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.81) and achieve PROMIS PF MCID (aOR 0.88). They were also more likely to be opioid dependent at 90 days after elective spine surgery (aOR 1.56).

Conclusions

The opioid epidemic is a serious threat to national public health, and spine surgeons must practice conscientious postoperative opioid prescribing to achieve adequate pain control. The authors' analysis illustrates that a postoperative opioid prescription of 225 MME or less is associated with improved patient satisfaction, greater improvement in physical function, and decreased opioid dependence compared with those who had > 225 MME prescribed.

### Safety and efficacy of depoDur in lumbar spine surgery… [^113PWuwd]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

- Pain scores will be recorded with vital signs. In a one-to-one randomization, patients will receive either a 10 or 15 mg dose of DepoDur at the time of surgery. Each patient will be provided with a morphine PCA system postoperatively and then oral analgesics as appropriate. Analgesic requirements in morphine equivalents will be recorded. Comparison between the 10 and 15 mg dose will be done as to analgesic effectiveness and safety. Post-operative orders will include epidural narcotic protocol to include. The following post-operative orders are standard of care.
- Patient's bedside and chart will be identified as "spinal narcotic".
- Head of bed maintained at 30 degrees of elevation.
- 0. 4 mg of Narcan will be added to each liter of IV fluid
- Counted respirations and pupil size to be included with vital signs.

Current post-operative PCA orders usually start with 1 mg of morphine per cc with a seven to ten minute lockout. Based on work by Rawal, who demonstrated that small doses of Naloxone could help eliminate nuisance side effects of epidural narcotics such as localized pruritis, 0. 4 mg of Naloxon will be added to each liter of IV fluid. What will be altered through this study is the addition of the long acting epidural narcotic, DepoDur. This will potentially provide for sustained pain relief for 48 hours. Usually by 48 hours postoperatively, the patient is starting to improve to a point of being able to be maintained on oral analgesics. The remainder of the study is consistent with standard of care for epidural narcotics. Drug: DepoDur
- 11678. **Exclusion Criteria**:

- Patients less than 18 years old, those not able to give consent, prisoners, patients with allergies to narcotic analgesics, and pregnant women will be excluded.

Women who are pregnant or are not practicing medically acceptable contraception. Patients who experience complications during the surgery will not receive the study drug.

### Association between spine surgery and availability of opioid medication [^113YmUEu]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Of the 2223 patients, 2148 (96.6%) were alive and still residing in the 11-county catchment area at 1 year after hospital discharge. According to CONSORT definitions applied from 181 to 365 days postoperatively after hospital discharge, of the 2148 patients, 1583 (73.7%) had no postoperative opioid availability, 398 (18.5%) had short-term postoperative opioid availability, 104 (4.8%) had episodic postoperative opioid availability, and 63 (2.9%) had long-term postoperative opioid availability. A total of 1672 patients (77.8%) met the criteria for successful patterns of postoperative opioid prescribing, defined as having improved CONSORT status or no opioid availability 1 year postoperatively for those who had no preoperative availability. Rates of success for preoperative opioid availability were 628 of 757 (83.0%) for no preoperative opioid availability, 810 of 1081 (74.9%) for short-term preoperative opioid availability, 178 of 223 (79.8%) for episodic preoperative opioid availability, and 56 of 87 (64.4%) for long-term preoperative opioid availability (Figure 1 and Table 2). For patients who had long-term opioid availability preoperatively, the daily opioid availability from 180 days before surgery through 365 days following hospital discharge is presented in Figure 2. Within each CONSORT category, there was considerable intraindividual variability.

### Opioid prescribing and use in the military health system: a framework synthesis, FY2016-FY2021 [^111CbEJc]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Opioid misuse is a nationwide issue and is of particular concern with regard to military readiness. The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act charges the Military Health System with greater oversight of opioid use and mitigation of misuse.

Methods

We synthesized published articles using secondary analysis of TRICARE claims data, a nationally representative database of 9.6 million beneficiaries. We screened 106 articles for inclusion and identified 17 studies for data abstraction. Framework analysis was conducted, which assessed prescribing practices, patient use, and optimum length of opioid prescriptions after surgery, trauma, and common procedures, as well as factors leading to sustained prescription opioid use.

Results

Across the studies, sustained prescription opioid use after surgery was low overall, with < 1% of opioid-naïve patients still receiving opioids more than 1year after spinal surgery or trauma. In opioid-exposed patients who had undergone spine surgery, sustained use was slightly lower than 10%. Higher rates of sustained use were associated with more severe trauma and depression, as well as with prior use and initial opioid prescriptions for low back pain or other undefined conditions. Black patients were more likely to discontinue opioid use than were White patients.

Conclusions

Prescribing practices are well correlated with degree of injury or intensity of intervention. Sustained prescription opioid use beyond 1year is rare and is associated with diagnoses for which opioids are not the standard of care. More efficient coding, increased attention to clinical practice guidelines, and use of tools to predict risk of sustained prescription opioid use are recommended.

Persistent postoperative opioid use is thought to contribute to the ongoing opioid epidemic in the United States. However, efforts to study and address the issue have been stymied by the lack of a standard definition, which has also hampered efforts to measure the incidence of and risk factors for persistent postoperative opioid use. The objective of this systematic review is to (1) determine a clinically relevant definition of persistent postoperative opioid use, and (2) characterize its incidence and risk factors for several common surgeries. Our approach leveraged a group of international experts from the Perioperative Quality Initiative-4, a consensus-building conference that included representation from anesthesiology, surgery, and nursing. A search of the medical literature yielded 46 articles addressing persistent postoperative opioid use in adults after arthroplasty, abdominopelvic surgery, spine surgery, thoracic surgery, mastectomy, and thoracic surgery. In opioid-naïve patients, the overall incidence ranged from 2% to 6% based on moderate-level evidence. However, patients who use opioids preoperatively had an incidence of > 30%. Preoperative opioid use, depression, factors associated with the diagnosis of substance use disorder, preoperative pain, and tobacco use were reported risk factors. In addition, while anxiety, sex, and psychotropic prescription are associated with persistent postoperative opioid use, these reports are based on lower level evidence. While few articles addressed the health policy or prescriber characteristics that influence persistent postoperative opioid use, efforts to modify prescriber behaviors and health system characteristics are likely to have success in reducing persistent postoperative opioid use.

### Duration and dosage of opioids after spine surgery: implications on outcomes at 1 year [^112xruh5]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Longitudinal Cohort Study OBJECTIVE.: The aim of this study was to determine whether duration of postoperative opioids is associated with long-term outcomes, and if initial postoperative opioid dosage is associated with opioid cessation after spine surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

Preoperative opioid use is associated with poor outcomes, but little evidence exists regarding the implications of opioid dosage and duration after spine surgery.

Methods

Data from our state's prescription drug database was linked to our prospective clinical spine registry to analyze opioid dispensing and outcomes in elective surgical spine patients between 2010 and 2017. Patients were stratified based on preoperative chronic opioid use and multivariable regression was used to assess associations between duration of postoperative opioids and outcomes at one year, including satisfaction, chronic opioid use, and meaningful improvements in pain, disability, and quality of life. In a secondary aim, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine whether initial postoperative opioid dosage was associated with time to opioid cessation.

Results

Of 2172 patients included, 35% had preoperative chronic opioid use. In patients without preoperative chronic opioid use, a postoperative opioid duration of 31 to 60 days was associated with chronic opioid use at 1 year (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 4.1 [1.7–9.8]) and no meaningful improvement in extremity pain (aOR: 1.8 [1.3–2.6]) or axial pain (aOR: 1.6 [1.1–2.2]); cessation between 61 and 90 days was associated with no meaningful improvement in disability (aOR: 2 [1.3–3]) and dissatisfaction (aOR:1.8 [1–3.1]). In patients with preoperative chronic opioid use, postoperative opioids for ≥ 90 days was associated with dissatisfaction. Cox regression analyses showed lower initial postoperative opioid dosages were associated with faster opioid cessation in both groups.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that a shorter duration of postoperative opioids may result in improved 1-year patient-reported outcomes, and that lower postoperative opioid dosages may lead to faster opioid cessation.

### Understanding how methadone treatment during surgery affects… [^113hWPZ6]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

This phase III trial compares methadone to standard pain medications during spinal surgery in managing pain. Managing pain levels for the first 72 hours after surgery is very important. Poor pain management can lead to severe pain, and it can cause people to have a difficult time recovering both physically and mentally. Inclusion Criteria
- Adult patients scheduled for extradural spine surgery with instrumentation of expected duration ≥ 2 hours.
- Postoperative hospital stay expected to be ≥ 2 nights at the time of consent. Exclusion Criteria
- Use of methadone currently or within the previous 6 weeks.
- Drug misuse history.
- Current use of opioid antagonist/partial antagonist.
- Current or past diagnosis of a major psychiatric disorder.
- Patients with a body mass index ≥ 36 kg/m².
- 2nd or 3rd degree heart block as assessed by preoperative electrocardiogram.
- Corrected QT > 450 msec on preoperative EKG.
- Documentation of congestive heart failure and/or ejection fraction < 30% if recorded in the pre-operative record.
- Contraindication to use of any analgesic medications listed in the enhanced recovery after surgery pathways.
- Serum creatinine > 1. 5 mg/dl.
- Instrumented spine cases of less than 2 levels.
- All non-instrumented spine cases.
- All intradural tumor resections.
- All "take backs" that occur within 72 hours of surgery. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess acute post-operative pain measured using numerical rating scale pain scores at rest. II.

To assess the dose of rescue analgesia from extubation to PACU arrival. III. To assess intraoperative opioid consumption on a per hour basis.

### Pain management after complex spine surgery: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^112YbEB7]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The included studies were grouped together based upon the analgesic interventions. Within each group, the studies were further placed into subgroups of pre-operative, intra-operative and postoperative interventions.

Pain intensity scores were used as primary outcome measures. We defined a 10% change as clinically important: more than 10 mm on the VAS or 1 point on the NRS. The effectiveness of each intervention for each outcome was evaluated qualitatively, by assessing the number of studies showing a significant difference between treatment arms (P < 0.05 as reported in the study publication). A meta-analysis was not performed due to the limited number of studies with homogeneous design and differences in how results were reported, restricting pooled analysis.

Recommendations are given when at least two congruent studies support an intervention. Recommendations for optimal pain relief are graded A to D according to the overall level of evidence (as determined by the quality of studies included), consistency of evidence and source of evidence (Table 1). The methodology of the PROSPECT group is unique in that it aims to synthesise clinical evidence while considering risks and benefits of interventions, as well as taking into account study design. Specifically, the group seeks to determine the relevance of study interventions in current peri-operative care practice, and critically evaluate the baseline pain treatment.

Relationship between quality and source of evidence, levels of evidence and grades of recommendation

The proposed recommendations were sent to the PROSPECT Working Group for review and comments. A panel discussion took place, which included several rounds of individual comments followed by round-table discussions. Following a round of discussion during the face-to-face meeting, the Working Group unanimously agreed with the proposed recommendations.

### Characterizing the risk of long-term opioid utilization in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery [^115qc2o3]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Single-institution retrospective cohort study.

Objective

To determine whether prescribing practices at discharge are associated with opioid dependence (OD) in patients undergoing discectomy or laminectomy procedures for degenerative indications.

Summary Of Background Data

Long-term opioid use in spine surgery is associated with higher healthcare utilization and worse postoperative outcomes. The impact of prescribing practices at discharge within this surgical population is poorly understood.

Methods

A query of an administrative database was conducted to identify all patients undergoing discectomy or laminectomy procedures at our high-volume tertiary referral center between 2007 and 2016. For patients included in the analysis, opioid prescription data on admission and discharge were manually abstracted from the electronic health record, including opioid type, frequency, route, and dose, and then converted to daily morphine equivalent dose (MED) values. We defined OD as a consecutive narcotic prescription lasting for at least 90 days within the first 12 months after the index surgical procedure.

Results

Of the 819 total patients, 499 (60.9%) patients had an active opioid prescription before surgery. Postoperatively, 813 (99.3%) received at least one narcotic prescription within 30 days of index surgery, and 162 (19.8%) continued with sustained opioid use in the 12 months after surgery. In adjusted analysis, patients with OD had a higher incidence of preoperative depression (P = 0.012) and preoperative opioid use (P < 0.001), as well as a higher frequency of preoperative benzodiazepine prescriptions (P = 0.009), and discharge MED value exceeding 120mg/day (P = 0.013). Postoperative OD was observed in 7.5% of previously opioid-naïve patients.

Conclusion

This is the first study to test for an association between MED values prescribed at discharge and sustained opioid use after lumbar spine surgery. In addition to previously reported risk factors, discharge prescription dose exceeding 120mg/day is independently associated with OD after spine surgery.

### Association between spine surgery and availability of opioid medication [^112CqMzW]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Prolonged prescribing of opioids after spine surgery is often perceived as a negative outcome, but successful opioid reduction may occur despite continued prescribing. Improved characterization of opioid availability before and after surgery is necessary to identify these successes.

Objective

To evaluate the association between spine surgery and modification of opioid availability postoperatively by using consistent definitions to classify opioid availability before and after surgery.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study included 2223 adults (age ≥ 18 years) who underwent spine surgery in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed from April 1, 2019, to December 1, 2019.

Exposures

Preoperative opioid availability based on prescription data in the 180 days before surgery in accordance with Consortium to Study Opioid Risks and Trends (CONSORT) definitions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Successful modification of opioid availability, defined as an improvement in CONSORT status postoperatively (assessed from 181 to 365 days after surgery) compared with preoperative status, or continued absence of opioid availability for patients with no preoperative availability. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between preoperative opioid availability and successful modification by 1 year after undergoing surgery.

Results

Of 2223 patients included in the study, 1214 were male (54.6%), with a median age of 55 years (interquartile range, 43–68) years. Patients were classified as having no (778 [35.0%]), short-term (1118 [50.3%]), episodic (227 [10.2%]), or long-term (100 [4.5%]) preoperative opioid availability. Of the 2148 patients (96.6%) who were alive at 1 year, postoperative opioid availability was classified as no (1583 [73.7%]), short-term (398 [18.5%]), episodic (104 [4.8%]), and long-term (63 [2.9%]). A total of 1672 patients (77.8%) had successful modification of opioid availability, with success of 83.0% for those with no preoperative availability, 74.9% for those with short-term preoperative availability, 79.8% for those with episodic preoperative availability, and 64.4% for those with long-term preoperative opioid availability. In multivariable analysis, success was significantly associated with preoperative opioid availability (odds ratio [OR] for short term, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.48–0.77]; OR for episodic, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.64–1.40]; OR long term, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.30–0.82]; P < .001 overall vs no availability).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, when following standardized CONSORT definitions, 4 of 5 adults undergoing spine surgery in a population-based cohort met the criteria for a successful pattern of postoperative opioid prescribing. Similar methods to objectively assess changes in opioid prescribing may be clinically useful in other perioperative settings.

### The role of multimodal analgesia in spine surgery [^113wEM4X]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Optimal postoperative pain control allows for faster recovery, reduced complications, and improved patient satisfaction. Historically, pain management after spine surgery relied heavily on opioid medications. Multimodal regimens were developed to reduce opioid consumption and associated adverse effects. Multimodal approaches used in orthopaedic surgery of the lower extremity, especially joint arthroplasty, have been well described and studies have shown reduced opioid consumption, improved pain and function, and decreased length of stay. A growing body of evidence supports multimodal analgesia in spine surgery. Methods include the use of preemptive analgesia, NSAIDs, the neuromodulatory agents gabapentin and pregabalin, acetaminophen, and extended-action local anesthesia. The development of a standard approach to multimodal analgesia in spine surgery requires extensive assessment of the literature. Because a substantial number of spine surgeries are performed annually, a standardized approach to multimodal analgesia may provide considerable benefits, particularly in the context of the increased emphasis on accountability within the healthcare system.

### Persistent opioid use after spine surgery: a prospective cohort study [^116MHMmj]. Spine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Single-center, investigator-initiated, prospective cohort study.

Objective

This study aimed to determine patient-reported reasons for persistent opioid use following elective spine surgery, assess the frequency of withdrawal symptoms, and characterize pain-related care sought after discharge.

Summary Of Background Data

Patients are often prescribed opioids at discharge from hospital following surgery. Several studies have shown that a large number of patients fail to discontinue opioid treatment and use opioids even months to years after surgery. Spine surgery has proven to be a high-risk procedure in regard to persistent opioid use. There is, however, limited evidence on why patients continue to take opioids.

Methods

Three hundred patients, scheduled to undergo spine surgery at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, were included. Baseline characteristics and discharge data on opioid consumption were collected. Data on opioid consumption, patient-reported reasons for opioid use, withdrawal symptoms, and pain-related care sought were collected at 3- and 6-month follow-up via a REDCap survey.

Results

Before surgery, opioid use was reported in 53% of patients. Three months after surgery, opioid use was reported in 60% of preoperative opioid-users and in 9% of preoperative opioid non-users. Patients reported the following reasons for postoperative opioid use: treatment of surgery-related pain (53%), treatment of surgery-related pain combined with other reasons (37%), and reasons not related to spine surgery (10%). Withdrawal symptoms were experienced by 33% of patients during the first 3 months after surgery and were associated with failure to discontinue opioid treatment (P < 0.001). Half of patients (52%) contacted health care after discharge with pain-related topics the first 3 months.

Conclusion

Patients use opioids after spine surgery for reasons other than surgery-related pain. Withdrawal symptoms are frequent even though patients are given tapering plans at discharge. Further studies should address how to facilitate successful and safe opioid tapering in patients undergoing spine surgery. Level of Evidence: 3.

Table 2.
Opioid Use Outcomes at 1 Year in Patients With Follow-up Data Available

Abbreviation: CONSORT, Consortium to Study Opioid Risks and Trends.

Of the 2148 patients available for follow-up, 188 (8.8%) had opioids available within the 7 days before 1 year after hospital discharge (ie, point prevalence opioid availability). Point-prevalence opioid availability at 1 year postoperatively was 31 of 757 (4.1%) for those with no preoperative availability, 74 of 1081 (6.8%) for those with short-term preoperative availability, 39 of 223 (17.5%) for those with episodic preoperative availability, and 44 of 87 (50.6%) for those with long-term preoperative availability.

In multivariable analysis, success in postoperative opioid prescribing was significantly associated with preoperative opioid availability (OR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.48–0.77] for short-term availability; OR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.64–1.40] for episodic availability; and OR 0.49 [95% CI, 0.30–0.82] for long-term compared with no availability; P < .001) (Table 3). Compared with patients with no preoperative opioid availability, those with long-term and short-term preoperative availability but not those with episodic availability were less likely to meet the criteria for success. Other factors independently associated with a lower success rate included a higher burden of comorbidity (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.32–0.63 for Charlson comorbidity index > 4 vs reference of 0), the presence of anxiety (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58–0.99), and not being discharged to home after surgery (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47–0.94). Success did not depend on age, whether instrumentation was used, tobacco abuse or the presence of depression.

### Postoperative prescription of low-dose narcotics yields equivalent pain outcomes compared to high-dose narcotics in opioid-naïve patients undergoing spine surgery [^113VAm5n]. Spine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study at a single institution. Patients undergoing specific, elective spinal procedures between 2012 and 2018.

Objective

The aim of thi stsudy was to investigate the relationship between opioid prescriptions during the immediate, post-discharge period, and patient-reported pain outcomes.

Summary Of Background Data

Medically prescribed opiates contribute to the opioid crisis, manifesting in significant mortality and economic burden. Although opioids are a mainstay of pain amelioration following spinal surgery, prescription practices are heterogeneous.

Methods

Inclusion criteria included: patients who underwent one of 10 spinal procedures (Table 1); patients with preoperative, postoperative day (POD 1, and POD 30 pain scores reported on the visual analog scale (VAS); patients discharged without a complicated perioperative course. Opioids were converted to morphine milligram equivalents per day (MME/day) using a standard reference table. χ², Kruskal-Wallis, and logistic regression were utilized to investigate associations between clinical variables and postoperative pain scores. Univariate and multivariable linear regression models with Stepwise selection (cut off: P = 0.05) were employed as appropriate on POD 30 VAS pain scores.

Results

Smoking status and postoperative LOS were associated with opioid prescription doses. Patients prescribed opioids < 40MME/day, equivalent to five tablets of 5mg oxycodone/day, showed no significant difference in POD 30 VAS score (β coefficient: 0.095, P = 0.752) when compared to patients who received the highest-dose opioids (> 80MME/day-equivalent to 10 tablets of 5mg oxycodone/day). Adjusted multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that postoperative opioid dosage/prescription was not a significant predictor of patients reporting at least 50% pain improvement, suggesting that 40MME/day is sufficient to maintain patient satisfaction.

Conclusion

Patients receiving the lowest dosage of opioid prescriptions with sufficient nonopiate analgesics did not report worse pain relief at POD 30 compared to those receiving higher opioid prescriptions. In light of the opioid epidemic, this study supports initial dosing recommendations by the American Society for Addiction Medicine. Level of Evidence: 3.

### Pain management after complex spine surgery: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^112CpDWS]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Search strategy

A systematic review of literature associated with analgesia after complex spine surgery was conducted according to the PROSPECT Methodology. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 statement was used as a guide for this review. Specific to this study, the Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane Databases were searched for RCTs published between 1 January 2008 and 18 April 2020. A 10-year period for literature review was chosen because it more likely resembles relevant clinical practice, given that rapid changes occur in peri-operative care including surgical techniques. Of note, the project started in 2018.

The search terms are described in the appendix. Selection criteria for studies include RCTs or systematic reviews of analgesic, anaesthetic and operative interventions, published in the English language assessing pain management for patients undergoing complex spinal surgery. A study was also required to measure pain intensity using a numerical linear scoring system, such as the numerical rating scale (NRS) or visual analogue scale (VAS).

In accordance with the PRISMA checklist, a stepwise process was used, which included screening of abstracts of potential articles. This process was undertaken by two reviewers. Any discrepancies between results were discussed within the working group and a decision was made on inclusion or exclusion by consensus.

Criteria employed in the assessment of the quality of eligible studies included allocation concealment, numerical (1 to 5) quality scoring system employed by Jadad to assess randomisation, double blinding and the flow of patients, follow-up of greater or less than 80% of participants, and whether the study met the requirements of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 Statement.

Summary information for each included study was extracted and recorded in data tables. Unless specified otherwise, it was assumed that the pain scores were assessed at rest. The systematic reviews were used to find additional studies via bibliographic screens as well as aid in formulating recommendations.

### Association between spine surgery and availability of opioid medication [^113emk5e]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Although the goal of this investigation was not to identify predictors of postoperative opioid use, multivariable analysis revealed that those with more preoperative availability were less likely to experience successful modification of opioid availability, with the exception of those with episodic preoperative availability. The reason for this exception is not clear, although those with episodic availability were less likely to have no opioid availability at year 1 than those with short-term preoperative availability despite approximately one-quarter successfully transitioning from episodic to short-term postoperative availability.

Of interest, some factors that were associated with increased preoperative availability were not independently associated with less postoperative success, including female sex, depression, tobacco use, and the need for instrumentation. If the latter is considered as an indicator of surgical complexity, this finding suggests that patients undergoing more complex spine surgical procedures are not at increased risk for an unsuccessful pattern of postoperative opioid use. Again, direct comparisons with other studies are problematic, but because many of these factors have been found to be risk factors for prolonged opioid use after spine surgery, this finding provides another example of how point-prevalence approaches to analyzing postoperative opioid availability may be misleading in identifying patients at risk for not having success in modifying preoperative opioid availability.

Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of this investigation include using a population-based cohort (thus minimizing referral bias) with complete ascertainment of opioid prescription data and full access to medical records of multiple institutions through an established medical records linkage system.

This study has limitations. Interpretation of prescription data in terms of availability on a given date assumes that all prescriptions were filled and that opioids were used at the prescribed rate; actual availability on a given day may be less (eg, if the prescription was not filled) or more (if opioids were used more often than the prescribed rate). It is also possible that patients could have obtained opioid prescriptions not captured by our data set, although previous validation work with these data suggests that this is minimal. Although we adjusted our statistical models for many of the factors that have previously been identified as being associated with postoperative opioid use, associations may be confounded by other relevant unmeasured variables. Indications for opioid prescribing were not available, and it is possible that some prescriptions were not related to the index surgical procedure. In addition, these data were derived from a relatively demographically and socioeconomically homogeneous population in southeastern Minnesota, and the generalizability of study findings to other populations is unclear.

Background

Prescription opioid use and opioid-related deaths have become an epidemic in the United States, leading to devastating economic and health ramifications. Opioids are the most commonly prescribed drug class to treat low back pain, despite the limited body of evidence supporting their efficacy. Furthermore, preoperative opioid use prior to spine surgery has been reported to range from 20% to over 70%, with nearly 20% of this population being opioid dependent.

Objective

To review the medical literature on the effect of preoperative opioid use in outcomes in spine surgery.

We reviewed manuscripts published prior to February 1, 2019, exploring the effect of preoperative opioid use on outcomes in spine surgery. We identified 45 articles that analyzed independently the effect of preoperative opioid use on outcomes (n = 32 lumbar surgery, n = 19 cervical surgery, n = 7 spinal deformity, n = 5 "other").

Results

Preoperative opioid use is overwhelmingly associated with negative surgical and functional outcomes, including postoperative opioid use, hospitalization duration, healthcare costs, risk of surgical revision, and several other negative outcomes.

Conclusion

There is an urgent and unmet need to find and apply extensive perioperative solutions to combat opioid use, particularly in patients undergoing spine surgery. Further investigations are necessary to determine the optimal method to treat such patients and to develop opioid-combative strategies in patients undergoing spine surgery.

### Are we prescribing our patients too much pain medication? Best predictors of narcotic usage after spinal surgery for scoliosis [^113727Qz]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Physicians play a role in the current prescription drug-abuse epidemic. Surgeons often prescribe more postoperative narcotic pain medication than patients routinely need. Although narcotics are effective for severe, acute, postoperative pain, few evidence-based guidelines exist regarding the routinely required amount and duration of use post-hospital discharge.

Methods

Patients in a prospective cohort undergoing posterior spinal fusion for idiopathic scoliosis were asked preoperatively to rate their pain level, the level of pain expected each week postoperatively, and their pain tolerance. Post-discharge pain scores and narcotic use were reported at weekly intervals for 4 weeks postoperatively. Demographic data, preoperative Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22 scores, operative details, perioperative data, and self-reported pain levels were analyzed with respect to their association with total medication use and refills received. Disposal plans were also assessed.

Results

Seventy-two patients were enrolled, and 85% completed the surveys. The mean patient age was 14.9 years; 69% of the patients were female. The cohort was divided into 3 groups on the basis of total medication usage. The mean number of pills used in the middle (average-use) group was 49 pills. In postoperative week 4, narcotic usage was minimal (a mean of 2.9 pills by the highest-use group). Also by this time point, pain scores had, on average, returned to preoperative levels. Older age, male sex, a higher body mass index, and a higher preoperative pain score were associated with increased narcotic use. Sixty-seven percent of the patients planned to dispose of their unused medication, although only 59% of those patients planned on doing so in a manner recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Conclusions

Postoperative narcotic dosing may be improved by considering patient age, weight, sex, and preoperative pain score. The precise estimation of individual narcotic needs is complex. Patient and family education on the importance and proper method of narcotic disposal is an essential component of minimizing the availability of unused postoperative medication.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for perioperative spine: preoperative opioid evaluation [^112rsWr1]. Neurosurgery (2021). High credibility.

Level II evidence — cervical fusion surgery — In patients undergoing cervical spine surgery, chronic preoperative opioid use was associated with chronic postoperative opioid use, with one study defining chronic postoperative opioid use as ≥ 120 days of filled opioid prescriptions or ≥ 10 opioid prescriptions filled between 3 and 12 months after surgery and reporting that among elective one or two level ACDF for degenerative diagnoses preoperative opioid use was strongly associated with chronic postoperative opioid use (odds ratio [OR] 5.7 [95% CI 5.3–6.2], P < .001). Additional chart review data found that duration of preoperative opioid use of > 180 days, antidepressant use, tobacco use, and Medicaid insurance were significant predictors of prolonged postoperative opioid use for at least 90 to 180 days after surgery, and database analysis reported that nearly half of preoperative opioid users continued to fill opioid prescriptions 1 year after anterior or posterior cervical fusion. Short-term opioid users, defined as patients who received opioids for < 3 months, were more likely to return to work in the first year after surgery compared with intermediate (3–6 months) and long-term (> 6 months) preoperative opioid users, and patients with opioid prescriptions for > 6 months before cervical fusion surgery had higher risk of 90-day wound complications and were more likely to have chronic longer-term opioid use (defined as opioid use ≤ 1 year after surgery), repeat cervical fusion surgery, and epidural or facet joint injections within the year after surgery.

Conclusions

We presented a method to define successful modification of opioid availability after spine surgery as quantified by the CONSORT classification system. Approximately 4 of 5 patients in a geographically defined population demonstrated successful modification of prescribing patterns, with patients who received long-term prescribed opioids preoperatively being least likely to achieve success. Success rates were not congruent with simplified 1-year point prevalence evaluations of opioid availability. Use of CONSORT or similar methods to objectively assess changes in opioid status may be clinically useful in other perioperative settings.

### Opioid oversupply after joint and spine surgery: a prospective cohort study [^116YwX57]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Many patients receive prescription opioids at hospital discharge after surgery, yet little is known regarding how often these opioids go unused. We estimated the prevalence of unused opioids, use of nonopioid analgesics, and storage and disposal practices after same-day and inpatient surgery.

Methods

In this prospective cohort study at a large, inner-city tertiary care hospital, we recruited individuals ≥ 18 years of age undergoing elective same-day or inpatient joint and spine surgery from August to November 2016. Using patient surveys via telephone calls, we assessed patient-reported outcomes at 2-day, 2-week, 1-month, and 6-month intervals, including: (1) stopping opioid treatment and in possession of unused opioid pills (primary outcome), (2) number of unused opioid tablets reported after stopping opioids, (3) use of nonopioid pain treatments, and (4) knowledge and practice regarding safe opioid storage and disposal.

Results

Of 141 eligible patients, 140 (99%) consented (35% taking preoperative opioids; mean age 56 years [standard deviation 16 years]; 47% women). One- and 6-month follow-up was achieved for 115 (82%) and 110 patients (80%), respectively. Among patients who stopped opioid therapy, possession of unused opioids was reported by 73% (95% confidence intervals, 62%-82%) at 1-month follow-up and 34% (confidence interval, 24%-45%) at 6-month follow-up. At 1 month, 46% had ≥ 20 unused pills, 37% had ≥ 200 morphine milligram equivalents, and only 6% reported using multiple nonopioid adjuncts. Many patients reported unsafe storage and failure to dispose of opioids at both 1-month (91% and 96%, respectively) and 6-month (92% and 47%, respectively) follow-up.

Conclusions

After joint and spine surgery, many patients reported unused opioids, infrequent use of analgesic alternatives, and lack of knowledge regarding safe opioid storage and disposal. Interventions are needed to better tailor postoperative analgesia and improve the safe storage and disposal of prescription opioids.

### Association between spine surgery and availability of opioid medication [^113wJJB1]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

When patterns of opioid availability were described according to standardized CONSORT definitions during the 180 days before surgery (preoperative) and 181 to 365 days after hospital discharge (postoperative), 77.8% of a population-based cohort of patients undergoing spine surgery met the criteria for a successful pattern of postoperative opioid prescribing. In contrast, if success was defined as no available prescription opioids at 1 year postoperatively (ie, point-prevalence prescription opioid availability), 91.2% of patients met the criteria for success. The latter definition underestimated success in those with long-term preoperative opioid availability and overestimated success in those with short-term or no preoperative availability compared with the former definition.

For most patients with back pain, one of the goals of surgical intervention is to improve pain and reduce or eliminate analgesic use, especially the use of opioids. For patients not using opioids preoperatively, the hope is that opioids will not be required postoperatively for the long term. Determining whether these goals are met requires quantification of preoperative and postoperative opioid prescribing patterns. However, there is little consensus on how to best quantify perioperative opioid prescribing in surgical patients, and several challenges to such quantification. For example, opioid use and prescription opioid availability are distinct entities. The former uses an assessment of consumption, which relies on either patient self-report or direct observation and is difficult to accurately measure in large population-based studies. The latter uses prescription information to estimate the availability of prescribed opioids, which can be reliably ascertained from prescription databases. Several recent publications have highlighted a critical need for standardization of how opioid availability or use is described preoperatively and postoperatively across surgery types. Criteria to define a lack of preoperative opioid availability or use have included no self-reported opioid use or prescription availability at the time of surgery, no prescription opioid availability between 90 and 7 days before surgery, no opioid availability in the 180 days before surgery, no opioid availability in the 12 months before surgery, and no opioid availability from 365 to 7 days before surgery. Some studies report opioid use or availability as a dichotomous variable (yes or no), whereas others analyzed opioid dose typically in oral morphine equivalents. This methodologic heterogeneity makes it difficult to compare studies and to determine whether surgery has been associated with modification of opioid prescribing among those with preoperative opioid availability or with a new pattern of opioid use among those without preoperative availability.

### Factors associated with chronic opioid use after cervical spine surgery for degenerative conditions [^1164Yd88]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Opioids are commonly prescribed after surgery for painful spinal conditions, yet little is known about postoperative opioid use. The relationship between chronic opioid use and patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction with surgery is also unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate factors associated with opioid use 1 year after elective cervical spine surgery for degenerative conditions causing radiculopathy and myelopathy. The authors hypothesized that patients with preoperative opioid use would be more likely to report postoperative opioid use at 1 year, and that postoperative opioid use would be associated with patient-reported outcomes and dissatisfaction with surgery.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective study of a prospective cohort of adult patients who underwent elective cervical spine surgery for degenerative changes causing radiculopathy or myelopathy. Patients were prospectively and consecutively enrolled from a single academic center after the decision for surgery had been made. Postoperative in-hospital pain management was conducted using a standardized protocol. The primary outcome was any opioid use 1 year after surgery. Secondary outcomes were the Neck Disability Index (NDI); 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) physical function (PF), bodily pain (BP), and mental component summary (MCS) scores; the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score among myelopathy patients; and patient expectations surveys. Patients with and without preoperative opioid use were compared using the chi-square and Student t-tests, and multiple logistic regression was used to study the associations between patient and surgical characteristics and postoperative opioid use 1 year after surgery.

Results

Two hundred eleven patients were prospectively and consecutively enrolled, of whom 39 were lost to follow-up for the primary outcome; 43.6% reported preoperative opioid use. Preoperative NDI and SF-36 PF and BP scores were significantly worse in the preoperative opioid cohort. More than 94% of both cohorts rated expectations of pain relief as extremely or somewhat important. At 1 year after surgery, 50.7% of the preoperative-opioid-use cohort reported ongoing opioid use, and 17.5% of patients in the no-preoperative-opioid-use cohort reported ongoing opioid use. Despite this, both cohorts reported similar improvements in NDI as well as SF-36 PF, BP, and MCS scores. More than 70% of both cohorts also reported being extremely or somewhat satisfied with pain relief after surgery. Predictors of 1-year opioid use included preoperative opioid use, duration of symptoms for more than 9 months before surgery, tobacco use, and higher comorbidity index.

Conclusions

One year after elective cervical spine surgery, patients with preoperative opioid use were significantly more likely to report ongoing opioid use. However, patients in both groups reported similar improvements in patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction with pain relief. Interventions targeted at decreasing opioid use may need to focus on patient factors such as preoperative opioid use or duration of symptoms before surgery.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^114Jgcp4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

When patients are discharged from the hospital after surgery, the course and dosage of any opioid medications administered during hospitalization and before discharge can help predict ongoing pain management needs. For postoperative pain, procedure-specific opioid prescribing recommendations are available with ranges for amounts of opioids needed (on the basis of use and refills and on consensus).

Clinicians should generally not prescribe additional opioids to patients just in case pain continues longer than expected. However, if pain continues longer than expected, some patients might face challenges in successfully navigating the health care system (e.g. clinician and pharmacy contact, transportation, and need for assistance) to obtain additional medication as needed, leading to potential disparities in treatment. Clinicians, practices, and health systems should have mechanisms in place for the subset of patients who experience severe acute pain that continues longer than the expected duration. These mechanisms should allow for timely reevaluation to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis and adjust pain management accordingly. In particular, clinicians, practices, and health systems should ensure all patients can obtain and afford additional evaluation and treatment as needed to minimize disparities in access to and affordability of care and refills.

Patients should be evaluated at least every 2 weeks if they continue to receive opioids for acute pain. If opioids are continued for ≥ 1 month, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. Clinicians should refer to recommendations on subacute and chronic pain for initiation (Recommendation 2), follow-up (Recommendation 7), and tapering (Recommendation 5) of ongoing opioid therapy. If patients already receiving long-term opioids require additional opioids for superimposed severe acute pain (e.g. major surgery), opioids should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days.

### Association between spine surgery and availability of opioid medication… [^112Xf6QW]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The CONSORT criteria was specifically designed with support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to improve understanding of longitudinal trends in opioid prescribing among patients with chronic noncancer pain through the assessment of more than 3 million opioid prescribing episodes. The purpose of this population-based cohort study was to evaluate the association of spine surgery with modifications in postoperative opioid availability, as assessed through the CONSORT classification system, which allows for consistent and comprehensive assessment of longitudinal opioid availability. If the period of prescribed opioids was fewer than 90 days, the patient was considered to have short-term availability.

If the period was 90 days or more, the patients were considered to have long-term availability if they either had more than 10 prescriptions during the prescribing period or if they had opioids available for more than 120 days based on consumption according to the maximum prescribed rate. Patients with a prescribing period of more than 90 days who did not meet the criteria for long-term availability were classified as having episodic availability. Postoperative prescribed opioid availability was also defined in accordance with CONSORT definitions using opioid prescription data available between 181 and 365 days after the date of hospital discharge. The presence of psychiatric and substance abuse diagnoses was also associated with higher preoperative opioid availability.

Among patients who had been prescribed opioids in the 180 days before surgery, those with higher opioid availability had longer duration of surgery and were more likely to require surgery with instrumentation. Among those discharged home, higher preoperative opioid availability was associated with discharge prescriptions having higher total morphine milligram equivalents. The reoperation rate at 30 days was 3. 7% and at 90 days was
6. 9%.

### Association of the 2016 US centers for disease control and prevention opioid prescribing guideline with changes in opioid dispensing after surgery [^115ViAJP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this analysis of 361 556 patients undergoing 8 common surgical procedures, we found that the 2016 CDC guideline release was associated with decreases in postoperative opioid dispensing. While we observed a trend toward increasing amounts of opioids dispensed prior to the guideline, trends in the amount of opioid dispensed in the initial prescription and all prescriptions filled within 30 days after surgery decreased after guideline release. We estimate the CDC prescribing guideline was associated with a clinically meaningful decrease of approximately 3.61 MME/month and 0.05 days' supply in the initial prescription, equivalent to a reduction of approximately 11 oxycodone 5-mg pills during the 2 years after guideline release. Absolute prescribing levels remained high, with nearly half of all patients treated after March 2016 receiving amounts more than 2 times greater than the levels anticipated to be necessary. Our results were consistent across a number of supplemental analyses, including a patient-level regression that adjusted for potential confounders.

While unintended, multiple past observers have noted the potential for the 2016 CDC guideline to influence postoperative pain treatment. A 2017 consensus panel convened by the American Academy of Pain Medicine Foundation observed potential for the guideline to "promote unintended 'drift' into an increasing reluctance by providers to prescribe opioids" after surgery. A subsequent report by the CDC guideline's authors noted that "practices purportedly derived from the guideline have… been inconsistent with, and often go beyond, its recommendations", including application of the guideline's acute pain treatment recommendations to postsurgical prescribing contexts. Indeed, our findings suggest that the CDC guideline may have contributed to changes in postsurgical pain treatment, even despite its exclusion from the guideline's stated scope. Such changes may also have been driven in part by concurrent local or regional initiatives, such as a 2015 Washington State guideline focused on limiting opioid overprescribing after surgery, as well as by broader secular forces, potentially including an emerging awareness among clinicians and patients in general regarding opioid-related harms. While the specific approach used here does not allow us to disentangle the potential impact of the CDC guideline vs other secular forces, this topic remains important for further study.

### How many steps per day during the early postoperative period are associated with patient-reported outcomes of disability, pain, and opioid use after lumbar spine surgery? [^115DznHE]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether early postoperative walking is associated with "best outcome" and no opioid use at 1 year after lumbar spine surgery and establish a threshold for steps/day to inform clinical practice.

Design

Secondary analysis from randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Two academic medical centers in the United States.

Participants

We enrolled 248 participants undergoing surgery for a degenerative lumbar spine condition (N = 248). A total of 212 participants (mean age, 62.8 ± 11.4y, 53.3% female) had valid walking data at baseline.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Disability (Oswestry Disability Index), back and leg pain (Brief Pain Inventory), and opioid use (yes vs no) were assessed at baseline and 1 year after surgery. "Best outcome" was defined as Oswestry Disability Index ≤ 20, back pain ≤ 2, and leg pain ≤ 2. Steps/day (walking) was assessed with an accelerometer worn for at least 3 days and 10 h/d at 6 weeks after spine surgery, which was considered as study baseline. Separate multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the association between steps/day at 6 weeks and "best outcome" and no opioid use at 1-year. Receiver operating characteristic curves identified a steps/day threshold for achieving outcomes.

Results

Each additional 1000 steps/d at 6 weeks after spine surgery was associated with 41% higher odds of achieving "best outcome" (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15–1.74) and 38% higher odds of no opioid use (95% CI, 1.09–1.76) at 1 year. Walking ≥ 3500 steps/d was associated with 3.75 times the odds (95% CI, 1.56–9.02) of achieving "best outcome" and 2.37 times the odds (95% CI, 1.07–5.24) of not using opioids.

Conclusions

Walking early after surgery may optimize patient-reported outcomes after lumbar spine surgery. A 3500 steps/d threshold may serve as an initial recommendation during early postoperative counseling.

### Benchmarks of duration and magnitude of opioid consumption after common spinal procedures: a database analysis of 47, 823 patients [^115oq8Su]. Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study performed in a nationwide insurance claims database.

Objective

This study aimed to examine duration and magnitude of postoperative opioid prescriptions following common spinal procedures.

Summary Of Background Data

Postoperative opioid prescription practices vary widely among providers and procedures and standards of care are not well-established. Previous work does not adequately quantify both duration and magnitude of opioid prescription.

Methods

Forty seven thousand eight hundred twenty three patients with record of any of four common spinal procedures in a nationwide insurance claims database were stratified by preoperative opioid use into three categories: "opioid naive", "sporadic user", or "chronic user", defined as 0, 1, or 2+ prescriptions filled in the 6 months preceding surgery. Those with record of subsequent surgery or readmission were excluded. Duration of opioid use was defined as the time between the index surgery and the last record of filling an opioid prescription. Magnitude of opioid use was defined as milligram morphine equivalents (MME) filled by 30 days post-op, converted to 5mg oxycodone pills for interpretation.

Results

Opioid naive patients were less likely than chronic opioid users to fill any opioid prescription after surgery (63–68% naive vs. 91–95% chronic, P < 0.001), and when they did, their prescriptions were smaller in magnitude (76–91 pills naive vs. 127–152 pills chronic). One year after surgery, 15% to 18% of opioid naive and 50% to 64% of chronic opioid users continued filling prescriptions.

Conclusion

Opioid naive patients use less postoperative opioids, and for a shorter period of time, than chronic users. This study serves as a normative benchmark for examining postoperative opioid use, which can assist providers in identifying patients with opioid dependence. Importantly, this work calls out the high risk of opioid exposure, as 15% to 18% of opioid naive patients continued filling opioid prescriptions 1 year after surgery.

### Efficacy of perioperative pharmacological and regional pain interventions in adult spine surgery: a network meta-analysis and systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^112uam6E]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Development of a widely accepted standardised analgesic pathway for adult spine surgery has been hampered by the lack of quantitative analysis. We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare, rank, and grade all pharmacological and regional interventions used in adult spine surgery.

Methods

A systematic search was performed in January 2021. We performed double study screening, selection, and data extraction. The co-primary outcomes were cumulative morphine consumption (mg) and visual analogue pain score (range 0–10) at postoperative 24 h. An NMA was performed using the Bayesian approach (random effects model). We also ranked and graded all analgesic interventions using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach for NMA.

Results

We screened 5908 studies and included 86 randomised controlled studies, which comprised 6284 participants. Of 20 pharmacological and 10 regional interventions, the most effective intervention was triple-drug therapy, consisting of paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and adjunct. The pooled mean reduction in morphine consumption and pain score at postoperative 24 h were -26 (95% credible interval [CrI]: -39 to -12) mg and -2.3 (95% CrI: -3.1 to -1.4), respectively. Double-drug therapy was less effective, but showed moderate morphine reduction in a range of -15 to -17 mg and pain score reduction in a range of -1 to -1.6. Single-agent interventions were largely ineffective.

Conclusions

Triple-drug therapy is the most effective pain intervention in adult spine surgery with moderate-to-high certainty of evidence. We have also identified a graded analgesic effect, in which analgesic efficacy increased with the number of multimodal drugs used.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for perioperative spine: preoperative opioid evaluation [^112TKJPy]. Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Opioid use disorders in the United States have rapidly increased, yet little is known about the relationship between preoperative opioid duration and dose and patient outcomes after spine surgery. Likewise, the utility of preoperative opioid weaning is poorly understood.

Objective

The purpose of this evidence-based clinical practice guideline is to determine if duration and dose of preoperative opioids or preoperative opioid weaning is associated with patient-reported outcomes or adverse events after elective spine surgery for degenerative conditions.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was performed using the National Library of Medicine/PubMed database and Embase for studies relevant to opioid use among adult patients undergoing spine surgery. Clinical studies evaluating preoperative duration, dose, and opioid weaning and outcomes were selected for review.

Results

A total of 41 of 845 studies met the inclusion criteria and none were Level I evidence. The use of any opioids before surgery was associated with longer postoperative opioid use, and longer duration of opioid use was associated with worse outcomes, such as higher complications, longer length of stay, higher costs, and increased utilization of resources. There is insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of opioid weaning on postoperative opioid use, improving outcome, or reducing adverse events after spine surgery.

Conclusion

This evidence-based clinical guideline provides Grade B recommendations that preoperative opioid use and longer duration of preoperative opioid use are associated with chronic postoperative opioid use and worse outcome after spine surgery. Insufficient evidence supports the efficacy of an opioid wean before spine surgery (Grade I).

### Association between spine surgery and availability of opioid medication [^1116LrwQ]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Although there have been several attempts to discriminate patient groups at highest risk for prolonged postoperative opioid use based on the duration and/or dose of preoperative prescribing, few studieshave used consistent definitions before and after surgery. This limits the ability to determine associations of preoperative opioid availability with the modification of postoperative availability. The CONSORT framework facilitates robust assessment of longitudinal opioid availability through prescription records, but it remains clinically pragmatic by not necessitating calculations of cumulative opioid doses. In this investigation, we chose to analyze opioid prescription availability patterns in accordance with CONSORT definitions during the 180 days before surgery as a marker of preoperative opioid status. Recognizing that early postoperative opioid availability (ie, within the first months after surgery) may not be reflective of longer-term availability, we opted to define postoperative opioid status in accordance with CONSORT definitions assessed between 181 and 365 days postoperatively. Although other intervals could be used, this approach provided a clinically relevant benchmark in the assessment of analgesic outcomes after surgery while also providing an appropriate space for any potential associations of early surgical complications with postoperative opioid use. Through the use of CONSORT or similar classification schemes, a clinician may be able to estimate a patient's preoperative potential for successful modification of opioid availability after surgery; however, this was not the goal of this investigation and predictive models would need to be developed and validated to provide such patient-level predictions.

### Analgesic therapy for major spine surgery [^115ZY6gB]. Neurosurgical Review (2015). Low credibility.

Pain following spine surgery is often difficult to control and can persist. Reduction of this pain requires a multidisciplinary approach that depends on contributions of both surgeons and anesthesiologists. The spine surgeon's role involves limiting manipulation of structures contributing to pain sensation in the spine, which requires an in-depth understanding of the specific anatomic etiologies of pain originating along the spinal axis. Anesthesiologists, on the other hand, must focus on preemptive, multimodal analgesic treatment regimens. In this review, we first discuss anatomic sources of pain within the spine, before delving into a specific literature-supported pain management protocol intended for use with spinal surgery.

### Prescription opioid type and the likelihood of prolonged opioid use after orthopaedic surgery [^117HLRfa]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A common belief is that some narcotic medications have a higher association with prolonged use. We assessed whether the initial opiate type prescribed to postoperative, opiate-naive orthopaedic trauma patients was associated with prolonged opioid use.

Methods

We studied 17,961 adult, opiate-naive patients treated for a surgical musculoskeletal injury. Discharge prescription in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs, a standardized dosing unit that allows for comparison across opioid types) was calculated. Opioid prescribing beyond 90 days after injury was defined as prolonged use.

Results

Initial analysis demonstrated a higher likelihood of prolonged use for patients discharged on hydromorphone or morphine versus hydrocodone. However, when we adjusted for discharge MME, only opioid quantity was predictive of prolonged use (P < 0.001). In addition, discharge MME was associated with opioid type (P < 0.01).

Discussion

Persistent opiate use was associated with discharge opioid quantity, not the opioid type. These results highlight the importance of calculating equivalence doses when selecting opioid types and considering amount of narcotics prescribed.

Level Of Evidence

Level III.

### Understanding the natural history of postoperative pain and patient-reported opioid consumption after elective spine and nerve surgeries with an automated text messaging system [^115iiZus]. Neurosurgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a gap in understanding how to ensure opioid stewardship while managing postoperative neurosurgical pain.

Objective

To describe self-reported opioid consumption and pain intensity after common neurosurgery procedures gathered using an automated text messaging system.

Methods

A prospective, observational study was performed at a large, urban academic health system in Pennsylvania. Adult patients (≥ 18 years), who underwent surgeries between October 2019 and May 2020, were consented. Data on postoperative pain intensity and patient-reported opioid consumption were collected prospectively for 3 months. We analyzed the association between the quantity of opioids prescribed and consumed.

Results

A total of 517 patients were enrolled. The median pain intensity at discharge was 5 out of a maximum of pain score of 10 and was highest after thoracolumbar fusion (median: 6, interquartile range [IQR]: 4–7). During the follow-up period, patients were prescribed a median of 40 tablets of 5-mg oxycodone equivalent pills (IQR: 28–40) and reported taking a median of 28 tablet equivalents (IQR: 17–40). Responders who were opioid-naive vs opioid-tolerant took a similar median number of opioid pills postoperatively (28 [IQR: 17–40] vs 27.5 [17.5–40], respectively). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the quantity of opioids prescribed and used during the 3-month follow-up (Pearson R = 0.85, 95% CI [0.80–0.89], P < .001). The correlation was stronger among patients who were discharged to a higher level of care.

Conclusion

Using real-time, patient-centered pain assessment and opioid consumption data will allow for the development of evidence-based opioid prescribing guidelines after spinal and nerve surgery.

### Application of the 2022 CDC guidelines-does in-hospital opioid dosage after lumbar fusion affect long-term opioid use and outcomes for opioid Naïve patients? [^111MAbPR]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Objective

To examine long term opioid use in opioid-naïve patients who received > or < 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day while at the hospital.

Summary Of Background Data

The 2022 CDC guidelines suggest that > 50 MME/day does not provide additional pain/function benefit, but likely increases risks of misuse, overdose and death. To date, there are no studies that examine whether opioid-naïve patients who consume higher quantities of opioids are at increased risk of long-term opioid use.

Methods

All adult patients with > 1 year without opioid use (opioid naïve) who underwent lumbar fusion (2018–2019) were identified. Patients were stratified by > or < 50 MME/day during their postoperative inpatient hospital stay. Patients were retrospectively reviewed for demographic and surgical information. Total opioid prescriptions and MME were tracked from one year preoperatively to two years postoperatively, utilizing the Pennsylvania Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. Linear and Poisson regressions were conducted using MME per day within the first 90 days and 90–365 days postoperatively as dependent variables.

Results

143 opioid naïve patients consumed < 50 MME/day, while 180 consumed > 50 MME/day. The > 50 MME/day group were younger with lower CCI scores and a shorter length of stay. The > 50 MME/day group consumed more MMEs from 0–90 days, and 90–365 days, but were similar after 365 days. Multivariate regression identified CCI and inpatient MME/day as independent predictors of elevated MME within the first year postoperatively.

Conclusions

Daily MME consumption after lumbar fusion was an independent predictor of post-discharge MME consumption for up to a year amongst opioid naïve patients. However, higher inpatient opioid consumption does not appear associated with chronic opioid usage beyond one year. Further prospective research should examine the more granular effects that this tradeoff may have to optimize narcotic analgesic risk benefit ratios and to maximize value.

### Prescription trends of opioid and nonopioid controlled prescription adjunctive analgesics before and after cervical spinal surgery: a retrospective cohort study [^117Lnv5E]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cervical spine surgery may be needed in those with refractory pain or neurologic deficits to improve outcomes in patients with cervical spine disease. However, consensus varies in the literature on the effect of surgery on opioid use. The objectives of this study were to analyze prescription rates of multiple controlled substances before and after cervical spine surgery and distinguish factors that may have contributed to opioid use after surgery.

Design

This is a retrospective cohort study analyzing prescription trends of various controlled substances in 632 patients who underwent cervical spine surgery from 2019 to 2021.

Results

Opioids have the largest rise in prescriptions at 3- and 6-mo time points after cervical spine surgery. A significant association (P < 0.001) was found between opioid use 1 yr before and 1 yr after cervical spine surgery. Exposure to opioids before surgery (odds ratio = 2.77, 95% confidence interval = 1.43–5.51, P = 0.003) and higher morphine milligram equivalent dose (odds ratio = 1.02, 95% confidence interval = 1.01–1.04, P = 0.012) were found to be associated with opioid use after surgery. Significantly more females were prescribed controlled substances (P = 0002).

Conclusions

Higher morphine milligram equivalent dose and opioid exposure before surgery are important factors in predicting postsurgical opioid use.

### Association of the 2016 US centers for disease control and prevention opioid prescribing guideline with changes in opioid dispensing after surgery [^1163PkAi]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

This study has important policy and practice implications. Although the primary focus of the 2016 CDC guideline was on opioid prescribing for chronic pain, our findings suggest that the guideline was associated with clinically relevant changes in patterns of opioid prescribing after surgery. Concurrently, our observation of high opioid amounts dispensed relative to recommendations indicates ongoing opportunities to improve pain treatment after surgery and the potential need for additional policy and clinical interventions to transform care.

### Opioid alternatives in spine surgery: a narrative review [^111zTdPm]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Adequate analgesia is known to improve outcomes after spine surgery. Despite recent attention highlighting the negative effects of narcotics and their addiction potential, opioids have been the mainstay of management for providing analgesia following spine surgeries. However, side effects including hyperalgesia, tolerance, and subsequent dependence restrict the generous usage of opioids. Multimodal analgesia regimens acting through different mechanisms offer significant opioid sparing and minimize the side effects of individual drugs. Hence, they are being increasingly incorporated into enhanced recovery protocols. Multimodal analgesia includes drugs such as N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and membrane-stabilizing agents, neuraxial opioids, local anesthetic infiltration, and fascial compartment blocks. Analgesia started before the painful stimulus, termed preemptive analgesia, facilitates subsequent pain management. Both nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and neuraxial analgesia have been conclusively shown to reduce opioid requirements after spine surgery, and there is a resurgence of interest in the use of low-dose ketamine or methadone. Neuraxial narcotics offer enhanced analgesia for a longer duration with lower dosage and side effect profiles compared with systemic opioid administration. Fascial compartment blocks are increasingly used as they provide effective analgesia with fewer adverse effects. In this narrative review, we will discuss multimodality analgesic regimens incorporating opioid-sparing adjuvants to manage pain after spine surgery.

### Surgery and opioids: evidence-based expert consensus guidelines on the perioperative use of opioids in the United Kingdom [^115jPjj7]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

There are significant concerns regarding prescription and misuse of prescription opioids in the perioperative period. The Faculty of Pain Medicine at the Royal College of Anaesthetists have produced this evidence-based expert consensus guideline on surgery and opioids along with the Royal College of Surgery, Royal College of Psychiatry, Royal College of Nursing, and the British Pain Society. This expert consensus practice advisory reproduces the Faculty of Pain Medicine guidance. Perioperative stewardship of opioids starts with judicious opioid prescribing in primary and secondary care. Before surgery, it is important to assess risk factors for continued opioid use after surgery and identify those with chronic pain before surgery, some of whom may be taking opioids. A multidisciplinary perioperative care plan that includes a prehabilitation strategy and intraoperative and postoperative care needs to be formulated. This may need the input of a pain specialist. Emphasis is placed on optimum management of pain pre-, intra-, and postoperatively. The use of immediate-release opioids is preferred in the immediate postoperative period. Attention to ensuring a smooth care transition and communication from secondary to primary care for those taking opioids is highlighted. For opioid-naive patients (patients not taking opioids before surgery), no more than 7 days of opioid prescription is recommended. Persistent use of opioid needs a medical evaluation and exclusion of chronic post-surgical pain. The lack of grading of the evidence of each individual recommendation remains a major weakness of this guidance; however, evidence supporting each recommendation has been rigorously reviewed by experts in perioperative pain management.

### Characterizing discharge opioid prescription in postoperative neurosurgical patients: a systematic review [^116LzEBd]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Over the past two decades, the United States has experienced a rise of opioid misuse, with a significant increase in drug overdose deaths- many of these deaths have been attributed to prescription opiate misuse. Given this epidemic, numerous specialties have created enhanced recovery after surgery protocols to decrease opiate usage post-operatively and some specialties have even created guidelines advising how many morphine milligram equivalents per day are recommended at discharge. The neurosurgical literature is lacking on best practices for discharge opiate prescribing. The goal of this review is to assess opiate prescribing practices at discharge for both cranial and spine neurosurgical patients, and to determine if neurosurgeons are over-prescribing opiates to their patients. A systematic literature review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. After searching PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase, a total of 288 abstracts were identified, 71 studies underwent full text review and 23 were included in this study. Studies that quantified opiate usage (number of pills prescribed, morphine equivalents, prescription refills) were included. The range of opiate prescribing varied and there was a tendency to both over-prescribe and under-prescribe; therefore, no conclusions could be made. This review underscores the need to take individual patient pain needs into account and shows the need for higher quality literature that can help formulate guideline creation.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for perioperative spine: preoperative opioid evaluation [^116EAWdc]. Neurosurgery (2021). High credibility.

Perioperative spine preoperative opioid evaluation — studies in this evidence table link preoperative opioid exposure with postoperative outcomes. Higher preoperative opioid load (P < .001) and duration of use (P < .001) were positively associated with higher postoperative rates of COT. Prolonged preoperative opioid use was a negative predictor of successful RTW status (OR 0.73 [95% CI 0.55–0.98]; p = 0.04). One study concluded that factors associated with the highest risk for chronic opioid use were preoperative opioid use (OR 5.7). Another study affirms and shows that quartiles of opioid use duration before surgery associated with outcome. Patients with a preoperative opioid prescription for ≤ 3 months before a major arthroplasty or a 1- or 2-level lumbar fusion had a similar risk of adverse outcomes as opioid-naïve patients, while > 6 months of opioid use was associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes, and a 3-month prescription-free period before the surgery appeared to mitigate this risk for chronic users.

### Association of state opioid duration limits with postoperative opioid prescribing [^114232in]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

The modest findings in our study differ somewhat from prior studies that have shown greater reductions in opioid prescribing. In 2016, Rhode Island implemented limits to restrict opioid prescribing by the total number of doses and the OMEs prescribed per day, and not by the days supplied. These limits reduced opioid prescription by more than 50% after lumbar spine surgery at a single institution. Another single-institution study in Florida observed a decrease by more than 30% in opioid prescriptions for patients undergoing common outpatient surgical procedures after prescribing limit implementation. It should be noted that Rhode Island's limit is much more restrictive in that it limits opioid prescriptions to 20 doses, while Florida's limit restricts prescriptions to a 3-day supply. Even if some variation on limits may be able to achieve greater prescribing reductions, it is important to consider that the goal is not absolute reduction alone, but rather reductions of prescribing that exceed clinical need. As such, prescribing restrictions based on number of days alone or number of doses may miss important nuances of perioperative care, such as prior opioid exposure, procedure type, and patient-level risk factors.

An alternative approach to reduce excessive prescribing may be to develop and implement evidence-based prescribing guidelines based on patient-reported opioid-related outcomes, including opioid consumption, use of opioid alternatives, pain, and satisfaction. For example, Hill et aldeveloped opioid prescribing guidelines based on the amount consumed while being an inpatient to direct the amount prescribed for outpatient pain control after surgery. This approach was able to effectively tailor postoperative opioid prescribing by accounting for patient variability. Evidence-based prescribing guidelines have also proven to be effective in reducing opioid prescribing after surgery without increasing the need for refills in multiple other contexts.

Preoperative opioid use — overall spine surgery outcomes: Any preoperative opioid use was associated with higher early postoperative patient-controlled analgesia morphine consumption in the first 3 days after lumbar spine surgery, and across Level III studies any preoperative opioid use was associated with worse 2-year outcomes and with chronic postoperative opioid use 1 year after spine surgery. Using registry and monitoring data, preoperative chronic opioid use was defined as having an active prescription for opioids for > 50% of the month for 3 consecutive months before surgery; patients with any preoperative chronic opioid use had worse outcome at 1 year, including higher odds of not achieving meaningful improvements, dissatisfaction, continued opioid use, and 90-day complications, and high preoperative opioid dosage > 30 MMEs was significantly associated with postoperative chronic opioid use. The odds of achieving a minimum clinically important difference in outcome decreased significantly as morphine equianalgesic dose increased from 47.8 to 90 mg per day (95% CI 29.0–60.0 mg/day).

### Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols in orthopaedic surgery: opioids or not opioids? [^116S7rRM]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Opioid-free anaesthesia has been used in several surgical procedures, and the benefits of this approach were evaluated in different meta-analyses. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of the studies included was high and some studies administered dexmedetomidine at the same time as opioids. A cohort study that evaluated an opioid-free anaesthesia regimen for lumbar decompressive surgery, comparing it with traditional opioid-balanced anaesthesia, showed a significant decrease in total perioperative opioid consumption in patients who received opioid-free anaesthesia (2.43 ± 0.86 oral morphine equivalents [OMEs]; mean ± SEM), compared to patients who received opioid-balanced anaesthesia (38.125 ± 6.11 OMEs). However, there were no statistically significant differences observed between the two groups regarding the worst PO pain scores (NRS scores 2.55 ± 0.70 vs 2.58 ± 0.73), opioid consumption in the post anaesthesia care unit (5.28 ± 1.7 vs 4.86 ± 1.5 OMEs for opioid-free anaesthesia and opioid-balanced anaesthesia, respectively), and time to readiness for discharge. Despite the implementation of new pain management protocols, post-spinal surgery chronic pain is still a significant issue, affecting 10–40% of patients. Misdiagnosis and flawed surgical planning are key contributing factors. In this regard, the canonical approach recommended by international guidelines imposes a choice of drugs according to pain intensity, in a "chronological" order, which starts with paracetamol, NSAIDs, or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors and then moves to opioids, if the first ones are ineffective. It must be noted however that opioids are often considered to have more haemodynamic stability compared to non-opioid medications; they generally do not interfere with coagulation factors or the modulation of haemostasis. Adverse cardiovascular events associated with non-opioid analgesics, such as NSAIDs, are often attributed to the inhibition of COX enzymes. COX enzymes play a role in the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are involved in various physiological processes, including inflammation and regulation of blood flow. Non-opioid analgesics, particularly NSAIDs, may pose risks in certain patient populations. Hence, caution is advised in patients with pre-existing conditions such as renal, pulmonary, dermatological, and haematological issues. While NSAIDs have the potential for adverse effects, they are generally considered safe when used for short periods at the lowest effective dose, but the duration and dosage should be carefully monitored, especially in patients with risk factors for complications. Already in 2012, Allegri et al proposed to include the global vision of the patients and their pathology, encompassing every pain type when choosing an analgesic approach. This paradigmatic vision puts the three categories of analgesics at the same level because the choice will be driven by the specific conditions of the patient. It is important to direct every effort not only towards improvement in pain management but also towards the personalization of therapy based on the patient, type of surgery (including the type of pathophysiology of pain), and identification of therapies/techniques that can improve the long-term outcome (reduction of side effects and reduction of chronic pain). In 2020, in a pilot study the feasibility and potential efficacy of a motivational interviewing and guided opioid tapering support (MI-Opioid Taper) compared to usual care was investigated in patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty. This approach, while feasible, necessitates validation on a larger scale to establish its efficacy in promoting complete PO opioid cessation. Hence, the problem is not related to whether drugs/techniques are effective and/or safe, but to which approach will be optimal for meeting the patient's needs in specific contexts. To mitigate long-term opioid therapy risks in chronic pain, several strategies are recommended: prioritizing non-pharmacological and non-opioid pharmacological approaches; prescribing the lowest effective dose of immediate-release opioids to minimize misuse/addiction risk; avoiding long-term opioid use for acute pain; limiting opioid duration (preferably < 7 days), with risk-benefit reassessment within 1–4 weeks; avoiding concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use to prevent overdose; and regularly reassessing narcotic effects. Thus, although opioid-free anaesthesia represents an opportunity to minimise perioperative opioid exposure in some surgical settings, it is still not ready for standardised use in orthopaedics, especially considering its target population (often composed of elderly people or individuals with pre-existing conditions) and the recurrence of pain in the postsurgical period.

### Association between spine surgery and availability of opioid medication [^114fUhZy]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

One of the goals of spine surgery for both patients and surgeons is to reduce pain. For patients requiring preoperative prescription opioids for back pain, a related goal is to reduce or eliminate opioid use postoperatively. Many patients do not achieve this goal, with more than 50% continuing to use prescription opioids at 1 year postoperatively (ie, point prevalence opioid use). Numerous studies, have described patient and procedural risk factors for this outcome, including patient age, mental health disorders (ie, depression, anxiety), a history of drug abuse, spinal instrumentation, and preoperative opioid use. Prolonged postoperative opioid use has attracted particular concern in the context of the opioid crisis. If a patient requires prolonged opioid use after surgery, the surgery may be considered to have failed to provide the anticipated improvement in analgesia.

However, a clinical assessment regarding whether surgery was successful in improving pain may benefit from a more nuanced approach to the way in which opioid use is evaluated before and after surgery. For example, a reduction in prescribed opioids postoperatively may be indicative of clinical benefit, even if prescribed opioids are not eliminated completely after surgery. To identify such improvements in opioid prescribing patterns, looking beyond simplified definitions of opioid use (eg, point prevalence at some postoperative time) and using robust yet clinically translatable definitions that can capture the complexity of individual opioid prescribing patterns preoperatively and postoperatively may be necessary. Classification systems such as the Consortium to Study Opioid Risks and Trends (CONSORT) criteria, have been widely used to categorize longitudinal patterns of opioid prescribing among those with chronic pain by using standardized definitions at each time point of interest and may also be useful in the perioperative setting. The CONSORT criteria was specifically designed with support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to improve understanding of longitudinal trends in opioid prescribing among patients with chronic noncancer pain through the assessment of more than 3 million opioid prescribing episodes.

The purpose of this population-based cohort study was to evaluate the association of spine surgery with modifications in postoperative opioid availability, as assessed through the CONSORT classification system, which allows for consistent and comprehensive assessment of longitudinal opioid availability.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1147bgZG]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

If opioids are used continuously (around the clock) for more than a few days for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe a brief taper to minimize withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of opioids. Taper durations might need to be adjusted depending on the duration of the initial opioid prescription. For example, if opioids are used continuously for > 3 days but for < 1 week, clinicians can consider reducing the daily dosage to 50% for 2 days to ameliorate withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing opioids. When patients have taken opioids continuously for ≥ 1 week but < 1 month, clinicians might consider a slower taper (e.g. reducing the daily dosage by approximately 20% every 2 days, a range consistent with tapering rates successfully used in studies of postoperative opioid prescribing). When patients are discharged from the hospital after surgery, opioid dosages needed during hospitalization and before discharge can help predict tapering needs to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Tapering plans should be discussed with the patient before discharge and with clinicians coordinating the patient's care as an outpatient. (See Recommendation 5 for tapering considerations when patients have taken opioids continuously for > 1 month.)

Recommendation 7

Clinicians should evaluate benefits and risks with patients within 1–4 weeks of starting opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain or of dosage escalation. Clinicians should regularly reevaluate benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical utility of enhanced recovery after surgery pathways in adult spine surgery [^113MrZ8D]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Spine surgery has been identified as a significant source of healthcare expenditures in the United States. Prolonged hospitalization has been cited as one source of increased spending, and there has been drive from providers and payors alike to decrease inpatient stays. One strategy currently being explored is the use of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols. Here, the authors review the literature on adult spine ERAS protocols, focusing on clinical benefits and cost reductions. They also conducted a quantitative meta-analysis examining the following: 1) length of stay (LOS), 2) complication rate, 3) wound infection rate, 4) 30-day readmission rate, and 5) 30-day reoperation rate.

Methods

Using the PRISMA guidelines, a search of the PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Reviews, Embase, CINAHL, and OVID Medline databases was conducted to identify all full-text articles in the English-language literature describing ERAS protocol implementation for adult spine surgery. A quantitative meta-analysis using random-effects modeling was performed for the identified clinical outcomes using studies that directly compared ERAS protocols with conventional care.

Results

Of 950 articles reviewed, 34 were included in the qualitative analysis and 20 were included in the quantitative analysis. The most common protocol types were general spine surgery protocols and protocols for lumbar spine surgery patients. The most frequently cited benefits of ERAS protocols were shorter LOS (n = 12), lower postoperative pain scores (n = 6), and decreased complication rates (n = 4). The meta-analysis demonstrated shorter LOS for the general spine surgery (mean difference -1.22 days [95% CI -1.98 to -0.47]) and lumbar spine ERAS protocols (-1.53 days [95% CI -2.89 to -0.16]). Neither general nor lumbar spine protocols led to a significant difference in complication rates. Insufficient data existed to perform a meta-analysis of the differences in costs or postoperative narcotic use.

Conclusions

Present data suggest that ERAS protocol implementation may reduce hospitalization time among adult spine surgery patients and may lead to reductions in complication rates when applied to specific populations. To generate high-quality evidence capable of supporting practice guidelines, though, additional controlled trials are necessary to validate these early findings in larger populations.

### Preoperative opioids and 1-year patient-reported outcomes after spine surgery [^113McEfg]. Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Longitudinal Cohort Study.

Objective

Determine 1-year patient-reported outcomes associated with preoperative chronic opioid therapy and high-preoperative opioid dosages in patients undergoing elective spine surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

Back pain is the most disabling condition worldwide and over half of patients presenting for spine surgery report using opioids. Preoperative dosage has been correlated with poor outcomes, but published studies have not assessed the relationship of both preoperative chronic opioids and opioid dosage with patient-reported outcomes.

Methods

For patients undergoing elective spine surgery between 2010 and 2017, our prospective institutional spine registry data was linked to opioid prescription data collected from our state's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program to analyze outcomes associated with preoperative chronic opioid therapy and high-preoperative opioid dosage, while adjusting for confounders through multivariable regression analyses. Outcomes included 1-year meaningful improvements in pain, function, and quality of life. Additional outcomes included 1-year satisfaction, return to work, 90-day complications, and postoperative chronic opioid use.

Results

Of 2128 patients included, preoperative chronic opioid therapy was identified in 21% and was associated with significantly higher odds (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) of not achieving meaningful improvements at 1-year in extremity pain (aOR:1.5 [1.2–2]), axial pain (aOR:1.7 [1.4–2.2]), function (aOR:1.7 [1.4–2.2]), and quality of life (aOR:1.4 [1.2–1.9]); dissatisfaction (aOR:1.7 [1.3–2.2]); 90-day complications (aOR:2.9 [1.7–4.9]); and postoperative chronic opioid use (aOR:15 [11.4–19.7]). High-preoperative opioid dosage was only associated with postoperative chronic opioid use (aOR:4.9 [3–7.9]).

Conclusion

Patients treated with chronic opioids prior to spine surgery are significantly less likely to achieve meaningful improvements at 1-year in pain, function, and quality of life; and less likely to be satisfied at 1-year with higher odds of 90-day complications, regardless of dosage. Both preoperative chronic opioid therapy and high-preoperative dosage are independently associated with postoperative chronic opioid use.

### Association between spine surgery and availability of opioid medication [^117Qcs5P]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Approximately one-third of patients in this cohort had no preoperative opioid availability, consistent with the range of 22% to 53% reported in previous studies (albeit with other definitions of availability). Also consistent with other studies, factors associated with greater preoperative opioid availability included female sex, a greater burden of comorbidity, depression, anxiety, and substance dependence. Of interest, there was not a consistent association between preoperative availability and markers of surgical complexity (eg, duration of surgery and the need for instrumentation). Although the varying definitions of preoperative and postoperative opioid availability and heterogeneity in the type of spine procedures analyzed among studies make it difficult to make direct comparisons, the finding that patients who underwent spine surgery with the greatest preoperative opioid availability were at greater risk to have opioids prescribed for an extended period postoperatively is broadly consistent with previous studies. Our point-prevalence rate of opioid availability at 1 year postoperatively (8.8%) was also consistent with previous work, as was the high point-prevalence rate specifically in those with the highest opioid availability. However, our results also demonstrated the limitations of using cross-sectional assessments of postoperative opioid availability to assess the association of surgery with modification of opioid prescribing. For example, although only 4.1% of patients with no preoperative availability had opioids available at 1 year after discharge (point prevalence), 17.0% had at least short-term postoperative availability from 181 to 365 days after discharge, with some experiencing episodic or long-term availability. At the other end of the spectrum, 50.6% of patients with long-term preoperative availability had 1-year point prevalence availability, but 64.4% were successful in reducing opioid availability.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^112iRBuU]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Since 2017, multiple studies have found that many patients do not use all prescribed opioids after surgery and that prescribing a lower quantity of opioids postoperatively is associated with less opioid use without increases in pain score or in requests for refills of pain medication and without reductions in satisfaction with pain management. One study found that, after five common surgical procedures, median opioid consumption was three 5-mg oxycodone pills or less, and that following consensus recommendations intended to reduce unnecessary postoperative opioid prescribing published in 2018 and 2019 would still result in 47%–56% of pills prescribed remaining unused. Evidence exists of variation in opioid needs across patients undergoing the same procedures attributable to factors including pain at discharge and previous opioid use. One study found that, although a majority of patients used no or few (> 0 to < 50 MME during their entire postoperative course) opioids, some patients required opioids for up to 15 days after surgery.

Clinical evidence reviews found observational evidence that opioid use for acute pain is associated with long-term opioid use and that a greater amount of early opioid exposure is associated with greater likelihood of long-term use, noting recent evidence for a dose- and duration-dependent effects. Opioids prescribed for surgery and other acute pain conditions that go unused are a potential source for misuse and diversion (,–). In addition, sudden discontinuation of opioids might result in clinically significant opioid withdrawal. Therefore, limiting duration of opioids prescribed can minimize the need for a taper to prevent distressing or unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.

Many common causes of nonsurgical, nontraumatic acute pain can often be managed without opioids (see Recommendation 1). When the diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant the use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. A few days or less are often sufficient when opioids are needed for many common causes of nonsurgical acute pain, and limiting the duration of opioid therapy can minimize the need to taper to prevent withdrawal symptoms at the end of the course of opioids and limit unused opioids. Certain circumstances (e.g. severe traumatic injuries) might require use of opioids for durations of > 7 days. Durations should be individualized based on the patient's clinical circumstances.

Preoperative opioid duration and mitigation period — Jain et al., 2019: Patients with a preoperative opioid prescription for ≤ 3 months before a major arthroplasty or a 1- or 2-level lumbar fusion had a similar risk of adverse outcomes as opioid-naïve patients, whereas > 6 months of opioid use was associated with a higher risk; a 3-month prescription-free period before surgery appeared to mitigate this risk for chronic users.

### Use of prescription opioids before and after an operation for chronic pain (lumbar fusion surgery) [^111Ufp5v]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Lumbar fusion surgery is usually prompted by chronic back pain, and many patients receive long-term preoperative opioid analgesics. Many expect surgery to eliminate the need for opioids. We sought to determine what fraction of long-term preoperative opioid users discontinue or reduce dosage postoperatively; what fraction of patients with little preoperative use initiate long-term use; and what predicts long-term postoperative use. This retrospective cohort study included 2491 adults undergoing lumbar fusion surgery for degenerative conditions, using Oregon's prescription drug monitoring program to quantify opioid use before and after hospitalization. We defined long-term postoperative use as ≥ 4 prescriptions filled in the 7 months after hospitalization, with at least 3 occurring > 30 days after hospitalization. Overall, 1045 patients received long-term opioids preoperatively, and 1094 postoperatively. Among long-term preoperative users, 77.1% continued long-term postoperative use, and 13.8% had episodic use. Only 9.1% discontinued or had short-term postoperative use. Among preoperative users, 34.4% received a lower dose postoperatively, but 44.8% received a higher long-term dose. Among patients with no preoperative opioids, 12.8% became long-term users. In multivariable models, the strongest predictor of long-term postoperative use was cumulative preoperative opioid dose (odds ratio of 15.47 [95% confidence interval 8.53–28.06] in the highest quartile). Cumulative dose and number of opioid prescribers in the 30-day postoperative period were also associated with long-term use. Thus, lumbar fusion surgery infrequently eliminated long-term opioid use. Opioid-naive patients had a substantial risk of initiating long-term use. Patients should have realistic expectations regarding opioid use after lumbar fusion surgery.

Perioperative spine — observational studies of lumbar fusion report that minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion patients were less likely to report postoperative opioid use at the 3-month follow-up; chronic opioid use before surgery, defined as supplies for > 120 days during the year before lumbar fusion, was associated with chronic opioid use, and chronic postoperative use was defined as opioid prescriptions supplied for > 1 year after the immediate 6- weeks after surgery. In the Nationwide Inpatient Sample analysis of patients with opioid dependence (International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification codes 304.0 and 304.7), opioid dependence was associated with a higher odds of prolonged duration of stay of ≥ 5 days, surgical complications, and higher costs. Claims studies found that in Humana data between 2007 and 2015, duration of preoperative opioid prescriptions within 3 months before surgery was significantly associated with opioid use 1 year after anterior or posterior lumbar fusions; in Humana data from 2007 to 2016, a preoperative opioid prescription of > 6 months was associated with higher risk of 90-day emergency department visits and readmissions, wound dehiscence and infection, and revision surgery within 1 year after posterior lumbar fusions. In Optum data, postoperative long-term opioid use was defined as ≥ 365 days after surgery, and preoperative use for ≥ 250 days before surgery was associated with an increased odds of postoperative long-term opioid use (OR 220 [95% CI 149–326], P < .001).

### Impact of Michigan's new opioid prescribing laws on spine surgery patients: analysis of the Michigan spine surgery improvement collaborative [^117EY94g]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

In 2017, Michigan passed new legislation designed to reduce opioid abuse. This study evaluated the impact of these new restrictive laws on preoperative narcotic use, short-term outcomes, and readmission rates after spinal surgery.

Methods

Patient data from 1 year before and 1 year after initiation of the new opioid laws (beginning July 1, 2018) were queried from the Michigan Spine Surgery Improvement Collaborative database. Before and after implementation of the major elements of the new laws, 12,325 and 11,988 patients, respectively, were treated.

Results

Patients before and after passage of the opioid laws had generally similar demographic and surgical characteristics. Notably, after passage of the opioid laws, the number of patients taking daily narcotics preoperatively decreased from 3783 (48.7%) to 2698 (39.7%; p < 0.0001). Three months postoperatively, there were no differences in minimum clinically important difference (56.0% vs 58.0%, p = 0.1068), numeric rating scale (NRS) score of back pain (3.5 vs 3.4, p = 0.1156), NRS score of leg pain (2.7 vs 2.7, p = 0.3595), satisfaction (84.4% vs 84.7%, p = 0.6852), or 90-day readmission rate (5.8% vs 6.2%, p = 0.3202) between groups. Although there was no difference in readmission rates, pain as a reason for readmission was marginally more common (0.86% vs 1.22%, p = 0.0323).

Conclusions

There was a meaningful decrease in preoperative narcotic use, but notably there was no apparent negative impact on postoperative recovery, patient satisfaction, or short-term outcomes after spinal surgery despite more restrictive opioid prescribing. Although the readmission rate did not significantly increase, pain as a reason for readmission was marginally more frequently observed.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for perioperative spine: preoperative opioid evaluation [^113TiQUT]. Neurosurgery (2021). High credibility.

Congress of Neurological Surgeons perioperative spine preoperative opioid evaluation — introduction and scope: From 2005 to 2014, opioid use disorders increased 6.47% annually in the United States and were reported 25% more often between 2010 and 2014 compared with 2005 to 2009 among patients hospitalized for treatment of spinal conditions. Despite increasing attention to opioid use, evidence to support best practice regarding preoperative opioid dose and duration in the management of patients with surgical degenerative spine disease is not well known. Likewise, the efficacy of preoperative opioid weaning is poorly understood, although this has been suggested as a potential intervention. The purpose of this work is to systematically review the literature to form evidence-based guidelines regarding the relationship between duration and dose of preoperative opioids and patient-reported outcomes and adverse events after elective spine surgery for degenerative conditions. We also review the literature regarding the association between preoperative opioid weaning and these outcomes.

Congress of Neurological Surgeons perioperative spine guidelines — preoperative opioid weaning before spine surgery: There is insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of opioid weaning on postoperative opioid use, improving outcome, or reducing adverse events after spine surgery, and the strength of recommendation is Grade Insufficient. For this question, there was a single Level II study in which patients were taken off opioids for a 3- to 489-month prescription-free "drug holiday" before 1 or 2-level posterior lumbar fusion surgery; risks of emergency department visits, readmissions, and wound dehiscence and infection were similar to opioid-naïve patients and lower than patients with preoperative opioid prescriptions sustained for > 6 months.

Lumbar spine surgery — associations of preoperative opioid use: Level III studies reported a significant association between any preoperative opioid use (yes/no) and long-term postoperative opioid use; compared with patients without preoperative opioid use, those with preoperative opioid use had increased postoperative leg pain intensity 2 weeks after lumbar spine surgery. Chronic postoperative opioid use was defined as a consecutive opioid prescription for > 90 days within the first year after the lumbar discectomy or laminectomy surgery at a single center, and a significant association between preoperative and chronic postoperative opioid use was found. Preoperative opioid use was also associated with postoperative use among 37 patients with lumbar pseudarthrosis, and there was a significant association between preoperative and postoperative opioid use among patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery.

### An institutional intervention to modify opioid prescribing practices after lumbar spine surgery [^112Syq6Q]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patients with lumbar spine pathology are at high risk for opioid misuse. Standardizing prescribing practices through an institutional intervention may reduce the overprescribing of opiates, leading to a decrease in the risk for opioid misuse and the number of pills available for diversion. Without quantitative data on the "minimum necessary quantity" of opioids appropriate for postdischarge prescriptions, the optimal method for changing existing prescribing practices is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether mandatory provider education and prescribing guidelines could modify prescriber behavior and lead to a decreased amount of opioids prescribed at hospital discharge following lumbar spine surgery.

Methods

Qualified staff were required to attend a mandatory educational conference, and a consensus method among the spine service was used to publish qualitative prescribing guidelines. Prescription data for 2479 patients who had undergone lumbar spine surgery were captured and compared based on the timing of surgery. The preintervention group consisted of 1177 patients who had undergone spine surgery in the period before prescriber education and guidelines (March 1, 2016-November 1, 2016). The postintervention group consisted of 1302 patients who had undergone spine surgery after the dissemination of the guidelines (February 1, 2017-October 1, 2017). Surgeries were classified as decompression or fusion procedures. Patients who had undergone surgeries for infection and patients on long-acting opioids were excluded.

Results

For all lumbar spine surgeries (decompression and fusion), the mean amount of opioids prescribed at discharge was lower after the educational program and distribution of prescribing guidelines (629 ± 294 oral morphine equivalent [OME] preintervention vs 490 ± 245 OME postintervention, p < 0.001). The mean number of prescribed pills also decreased (81 ± 26 vs 66 ± 22, p < 0.001). Prescriptions for 81 or more tablets dropped from 65.5% to 25.5%. Tramadol was prescribed more frequently after prescriber education (9.9% vs 18.6%, p < 0.001). Refill rates within 6 weeks were higher after the institutional intervention (7.6% vs 12.4%, p < 0.07).

Conclusions

Qualitative guidelines and prescriber education are effective in reducing the amount of opioids prescribed at discharge and encouraging the use of weaker opioids. Coupling provider education with prescribing guidelines is likely synergistic in achieving larger reductions. The sustainability of these changes is yet to be determined.

### Lack of consensus in physician recommendations regarding return to driving after cervical spine surgery [^1177gSfY]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Design

A cross-sectional study.

Objective

The goal of this study is to investigate how surgeons differ in collar and narcotic use, as well as return to driving recommendations following cervical spine surgeries and the associated medico-legal ramifications of these conditions.

Summary Of Background Data

Restoration of quality of life is one of the main goals of cervical spine surgery. Patients frequently inquire when they may safely resume driving after cervical spine surgery. There is no consensus regarding postoperative driving restrictions. This study addresses how surgeons differ in their recommendations concerning cervical immobilization, narcotic analgesia, and suggested timeline of return to driving following cervical spine surgery.

Methods

Surgeons at the Cervical Spine Research Society annual meeting completed anonymous surveys assessing postoperative patient management following fusion and nonfusion cervical spine surgeries.

Results

Seventy percent of surgeons returned completed surveys (n = 71). About 80.3% were orthopedic surgeons and 94.2% completed a spine fellowship. Experienced surgeons (> 15 years in practice) were more likely to let patients return to driving within 2 weeks than less experienced surgeons (47.1% vs. 24.3%, P = 0.013) for multilevel anterior discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and laminectomy with fusion procedures. There were no differences between surgeons practicing inside and outside the USA for prescribing collars or return to driving time. Cervical collars were used more for fusions than nonfusions (57.7% vs. 31.0%, P = 0.001). Surgeons reported 75.3% of patients ask when they may resume driving. For cervical fusions, 31.4% of surgeons allowed their patients to resume driving while restricting them with collars for longer durations. Furthermore, 27.5% of surgeons allowed their patients to resume driving while taking narcotics postoperatively.

Conclusion

This survey-based study highlights the lack of consensus regarding patient "fitness to drive" following cervical spine surgery. The importance of establishing evidence-based guidelines is critical, as recommendations for driving in the postoperative period may have significant medical, legal, and financial implications.
