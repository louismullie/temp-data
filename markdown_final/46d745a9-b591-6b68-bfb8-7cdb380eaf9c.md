## Question

Do adrenal adenomas need workup

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether adrenal adenomas need workup. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes an adrenal adenoma in the context of an incidentaloma. Then, I should verify the two key clinical questions that drive workup: is the lesion functional and is it malignant. Next, I will review size thresholds and imaging characteristics that modify risk and testing. After that, I should confirm the hormonal evaluation strategy and when it can be omitted. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-based algorithm and state exceptions where no workup is needed, anchoring to high-credibility sources like AAES, ENSAT/ESE, CUA/AUA, and ACR.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: an adrenal adenoma is most commonly an incidental adrenal mass ≥ 1 cm discovered on imaging obtained for unrelated reasons, and the term "workup" refers to the combined morphologic and functional evaluation needed to exclude hormone excess and malignancy, which is standard for adrenal incidentalomas rather than a special case.

> Hold on, let's not conflate entities. I should distinguish a clearly benign, lipid-rich adenoma from an indeterminate adrenal mass. A homogeneous adrenal lesion with unenhanced CT attenuation ≤ 10 HU is overwhelmingly benign and lipid-rich, and in this scenario, many guidelines advise no further imaging or routine hormonal follow-up, which means essentially no workup beyond the initial characterization, though I need to ensure I'm aligning with the most current guidance before concluding that definitively [^1168uMii] [^11782jLp].

> Next, I should review the two clinical questions that mandate workup in all other cases: is the tumor functional, and is it malignant. Function matters because even silent cortisol excess is associated with increased cardiometabolic risk, and malignancy risk, while low overall, rises with size and atypical imaging features, so I need to keep both axes in mind as I proceed [^116qkURQ] [^111YChyt].

> I will now examine size thresholds and imaging features that modify risk and testing. For lesions ≥ 1 cm, multiple high-credibility guidelines recommend biochemical evaluation for autonomous cortisol secretion and catecholamine excess, with selective testing for aldosterone when hypertension or hypokalemia is present; for lesions ≥ 4 cm or with indeterminate features, the malignancy risk is higher and surgical consultation is often indicated, whereas very small lesions < 1 cm generally do not require dedicated adrenal imaging or routine hormonal testing in patients without cancer history, though I should double-check that nuance [^111hxQ7X] [^117L8oex] [^116a8brP] [^111VXECj].

> Wait, let me verify the hormonal testing specifics so I don't overgeneralize. Autonomous cortisol secretion is screened with a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, pheochromocytoma with plasma metanephrines or a 24-hour urine fractionated metanephrines, and primary aldosteronism with an aldosterone-to-renin ratio when clinically indicated; androgens are reserved for suspected adrenocortical carcinoma or virilization, and I should confirm that repeating normal hormonal tests is not routinely advised unless new symptoms emerge [^1143w3CT] [^117L8oex] [^116a8brP] [^112mi7fg] [^113fuJ7r].

> Let me consider imaging strategy carefully. Noncontrast CT is first-line to assess attenuation; if HU ≤ 10 and the lesion is homogeneous, no further imaging is needed and no pheochromocytoma screening is required. If HU > 10 or the lesion is heterogeneous, adrenal protocol CT with washout or MRI can help differentiate benign from malignant, and in patients with a history of extra-adrenal malignancy, PET/CT may be appropriate for indeterminate lesions ≥ 4 cm, so I should tailor the sequence to pretest probability and local expertise [^1168uMii] [^111FZKiX] [^1131jbVG].

> But wait, what if the lesion is clearly benign on imaging and nonfunctional on testing; do I still need follow-up. For a nonfunctioning adenoma < 4 cm with benign imaging features, several contemporary guidelines advise against routine scheduled follow-up imaging or repeat hormonal testing, which effectively means no ongoing workup once initially characterized, though I should acknowledge that some older or more conservative pathways suggested periodic reassessment, so shared decision-making is prudent in borderline cases [^115yEzUc] [^113bamif] [^113fuJ7r] [^11782jLp].

> I should double-check special populations and exceptions. In patients with a history of extra-adrenal malignancy, even smaller adrenal lesions carry a higher risk of metastasis and merit a lower threshold for additional imaging and PET/CT. In children and adolescents, any adrenal mass warrants a more aggressive evaluation for malignancy. And in MEN1 or other hereditary syndromes, surveillance and biochemical testing thresholds differ, so I need to adjust the workup accordingly [^111FZKiX] [^111hxQ7X] [^112L9oG1].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. Yes, most adrenal adenomas discovered incidentally do need a standardized workup to exclude hormone excess and malignancy, with the exception of clearly benign, lipid-rich lesions ≤ 10 HU on noncontrast CT that are homogeneous and < 4 cm, which typically require no further workup. For lesions ≥ 1 cm or with indeterminate features, obtain biochemical testing for cortisol and catecholamines, add aldosterone testing if hypertensive or hypokalemic, and use adrenal protocol CT or MRI to characterize malignancy risk, escalating to surgical consultation for lesions ≥ 4 cm, rapid growth, or functional tumors [^111hxQ7X] [^1168uMii] [^111FZKiX] [^112Dv8qu].

> Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating universality. Very small incidental nodules < 1 cm in patients without cancer history generally do not require dedicated adrenal imaging or routine hormonal testing, though clinical judgment applies if symptoms or risk factors emerge; this nuance prevents overtesting while preserving safety [^111VXECj].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is precise: adrenal adenomas in the form of incidentalomas ≥ 1 cm typically require a structured workup for function and malignancy, but a clearly benign, lipid-rich adenoma on noncontrast CT with HU ≤ 10 and size < 4 cm is a notable exception where no further workup is recommended by contemporary guidelines, and ongoing surveillance is not advised unless clinical circumstances change [^111hxQ7X] [^1168uMii] [^115yEzUc] [^113bamif].

Adrenal adenomas **require a structured workup** to exclude hormone excess and malignancy [^111hxQ7X]. All patients with an adrenal incidentaloma ≥ 1 cm should have a **biochemical evaluation** for autonomous cortisol secretion, pheochromocytoma, and — if hypertensive or hypokalemic — primary aldosteronism [^111hxQ7X] [^116a8brP]. Non-contrast CT is the **first-line imaging** to assess density and morphology; lesions ≤ 10 HU are benign and need no further imaging, whereas lesions > 10 HU or > 4 cm warrant additional imaging and multidisciplinary review [^1168uMii] [^112Dv8qu]. Routine follow-up is not needed for benign, nonfunctioning adenomas < 4 cm, but new symptoms or growth should prompt re-evaluation [^115yEzUc] [^113fuJ7r].

---

## Clinical significance of adrenal adenomas

Adrenal adenomas are **common incidental findings** on cross-sectional imaging, with a prevalence of approximately 3–7% in adults [^1127vYZU]. While most are benign and nonfunctioning, a significant minority are either hormonally active or malignant, necessitating careful evaluation and management [^111YChyt].

---

## Indications for workup

The decision to pursue further workup depends on several factors, including **tumor size**, **imaging characteristics**, and **clinical context**. The following scenarios typically warrant evaluation:

- **Incidental discovery**: Adrenal masses ≥ 1 cm discovered incidentally on imaging [^111hxQ7X].
- **Hormonal symptoms**: Patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of hormone excess (e.g. Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism) [^113soc8S].
- **Imaging characteristics**: Lesions with indeterminate or suspicious imaging features (e.g. heterogeneous appearance, high attenuation, or size > 4 cm) [^112Dv8qu].

---

## Recommended diagnostic workup

### Biochemical evaluation

Biochemical testing is essential to determine whether the adenoma is **functioning** (hormonally active) or **nonfunctioning**. The following tests are recommended:

| **Hormone** | **Indication** | **Recommended test** |
|-|-|-|
| Cortisol | All patients with adrenal incidentaloma ≥ 1 cm | - 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test [^111JfTtP] <br/> - Or 2–3 midnight salivary cortisol measurements [^1143w3CT] |
| Catecholamines | All patients with adrenal incidentaloma ≥ 1 cm | - Plasma free metanephrines [^notfound] <br/> - Or 24-hour urine fractionated metanephrines [^notfound] |
| Aldosterone | Patients with hypertension or hypokalemia | Aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) [^116a8brP] |
| Sex hormones | Suspected adrenocortical carcinoma or virilization | Serum androgens (DHEAS, testosterone, estradiol) [^112mi7fg] |

---

### Imaging evaluation

Imaging is critical for characterizing adrenal adenomas and distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. Non-contrast **CT** is the first-line modality to assess lesion density (Hounsfield units, HU) and morphology [^115zjqhM]. Benign adenomas typically have a homogeneous appearance and attenuation ≤ 10 HU [^1168uMii]. Lesions with attenuation > 10 HU or size > 4 cm require further evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to assess washout characteristics and exclude malignancy [^111FZKiX] [^112Dv8qu].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **results of biochemical and imaging evaluations**:

- **Nonfunctioning, benign adenomas**: No further treatment or follow-up is required for lesions < 4 cm with benign imaging features [^115yEzUc] [^113bamif].
- **Functioning adenomas**: Surgical adrenalectomy is recommended for hormonally active tumors (e.g. Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism) [^115PFCBY].
- **Suspicious or large lesions**: Lesions > 4 cm or with indeterminate imaging features should be considered for surgical resection or close surveillance with repeat imaging [^112Dv8qu] [^114XNXXe].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Routine follow-up is not necessary for patients with **benign, nonfunctioning adenomas** < 4 cm [^115yEzUc]. However, patients should be advised to report any new symptoms suggestive of hormone excess or tumor growth. If new symptoms arise or the lesion grows significantly, repeat imaging and biochemical evaluation are indicated [^113fuJ7r].

---

## Conclusion

Adrenal adenomas **require a structured workup** to exclude hormone excess and malignancy. Biochemical evaluation and imaging characterization are essential components of this workup. Management is individualized based on tumor size, imaging features, and hormonal activity, with surgical intervention reserved for functioning or suspicious lesions.

The appropriate evaluation of adrenal masses is strongly dependent on the clinical circumstances in which it is discovered. Adrenal incidentalomas are masses that are discovered on imaging studies that have been obtained for purposes other than adrenal disease. Although the vast majority of adrenal incidentalomas are benign, further radiological and biochemical evaluation of these lesions is important to arrive at a specific diagnosis. Patients with a history of malignancy or symptoms of excess hormone require different imaging evaluations than patients with incidentalomas. This document reviews imaging approaches to adrenal masses and the various modalities utilized in evaluation of adrenal lesions. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Adrenal masses are commonly encountered as incidental findings in urologic practice. Many of these lesions do not undergo appropriate testing, likely because guidelines have historically been complex and contradictory. However, the workup for the vast majority of these lesions is actually straightforward. Here we present a practical, guidelines-based approach to the workup of adrenal lesions. We focus on distinguishing between benign, nonhormonally active adenomas (which require no further imaging or intervention) from those which are concerning for malignancy or are hormonally active.

### Evaluation of an adrenal incidentaloma [^117FCQjN]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Given the frequent use of cross-sectional imaging in medicine, adrenal masses are discovered at an increasing rate. Once detected, it is critical to ensure the patient undergoes the appropriate biochemical/hormonal workup to rule out any aberrant activity and ensure imaging features do not raise suspicion for a malignant neoplasm. Patients with hormonal overactivity, concerning size, and/or imaging characteristics must be referred for surgical consideration. For those not requiring adrenalectomy, it is important to determine which patients mandate follow-up to ensure no further growth or development of hormonal production. It is also critical to understand what is the appropriate follow-up.

### Adrenal incidentaloma [^111YChyt]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

An adrenal incidentaloma is now established as a common endocrine diagnosis that requires a multidisciplinary approach for effective management. The majority of patients can be reassured and discharged, but a personalized approach based upon image analysis, endocrine workup, and clinical symptoms and signs are required in every case. Adrenocortical carcinoma remains a real concern but is restricted to < 2% of all cases. Functional adrenal incidentaloma lesions are commoner (but still probably < 10% of total) and the greatest challenge remains the diagnosis and optimum management of autonomous cortisol secretion. Modern-day surgery has improved outcomes and novel radiological and urinary biomarkers will improve early detection and patient stratification in future years to come.

### Imaging of adrenal masses [^115zjqhM]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Adrenal lesions are common and require appropriate management when clinically relevant. The approach to the evaluation of an adrenal lesion is to exclude malignancy and hormone excess as these are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Methods

Imaging of adrenal lesions primarily aims to identify features indicating benignity. Noncontrast computed tomography is recommended as first-line imaging for adrenal lesions. Indeterminate lesions that require further characterization may proceed to adrenal protocol computed tomography (with contrast) or magnetic resonance imaging, with a trend in recent years towards increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography may also be used to assess adrenal lesions in certain clinical scenarios.

Results

Clinical guidelines recommend that all adrenal incidentalomas require further dedicated imaging unless they are clearly benign on imaging. The imaging strategy of adrenal lesions depends upon a number of factors including patient history, nature of detection, imaging characteristics (size, heterogeneity, presence of intracellular lipid), and the presence or absence of hormone excess. Special considerations are given to pregnant patients, young patients < 40 years, and those with a history of an extra-adrenal malignancy.

Conclusion

This review outlines the role of imaging for adrenal lesions, describes the various imaging options and investigation strategies, and highlights relevant imaging findings.

### Evaluation of adrenal incidentaloma [^112M8jU1]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Adrenal incidentalomas have increased due to advanced and more sensitive imaging modalities, their increased utilization, and the aging population. Most adrenal incidentalomas are nonfunctional and benign, but a subset of patients has functional and/or malignant tumors. The evaluation of patients with an adrenal incidentaloma involves addressing 2 clinical questions: (1) Is the tumor functional? (2) Is the tumor malignant? A careful history and physical examination focused on signs and symptoms of adrenal functional tumors, biochemical testing, and imaging features are the cornerstone in the evaluation of patients with an adrenal incidentaloma.

American Association of Endocrine Surgeons Guidelines for Adrenalectomy — scope, evaluation, and follow-up for adrenal tumors are highlighted: The guidelines "represent a series of 26 carefully composed recommendations" and the update "focuses on 7 areas of clinical concern to the practicing adrenal surgeon". For incidentally identified adrenal nodules, the commentary underscores "a comprehensive biochemical evaluation of patients with incidentally identified adrenal nodules more than 1 cm on cross-sectional imaging (recommendations 1.1–1.3)" and describes "referral to a multidisciplinary clinic (staffed by endocrinology and adrenal surgeons)". It states, "We encourage adrenal surgeons to lead the implementation of similar processes and the multidisciplinary discussion of patients with adrenal tumors including those being considered for unconventional treatments (recommendation 7.4)". Regarding follow-up in patients with "nonfunctional adrenal tumors with benign imaging characteristics", it notes that "Multidisciplinary care is particularly important in determining the appropriate follow-up" and that "the authors do not recommend routine scheduled follow-up in these patients (recommendation 1.4)", with the "level of evidence is "low quality".

### Incidental adrenal nodules [^1177wYAZ]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Incidentally detected adrenal nodules are common, and prevalence increases with patient age. Although most are benign, it is important for the radiologist to be able to accurately determine which nodules require further testing and which are safely left alone. The American College of Radiology incidental adrenal White Paper provides a structured algorithm based on expert consensus for management of incidental adrenal nodules. If further diagnostic testing is indicated, adrenal computed tomography is the most appropriate test in patients for nodules less than 4 cm. In addition to imaging, biochemical testing and endocrinology referral is warranted to exclude a functioning mass.

### Hepatic… [^115iP7RU]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Further history, including radiation exposure and family history; a physical examination to detect enlarged lymph nodes or hoarseness; targeted ultrasonography; and measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are recommended after nodules are detected. Most nodules 1 cm or smaller can be followed with ultrasonography in six months. 4, 5 Fine-needle aspiration biopsy should be considered for smaller nodules in patients with risk factors. 5 Fine-needle aspiration is recommended for nodules larger than 1 to 2 cm with hypoechogenicity, microcalcifications, or intranodular vascularity. 11 All other scenarios involve repeat CT over six to 24 months, except in high-risk patients, who should be reevaluated in three months.

The ACCP recommends the use of low-dose, non–contrast-enhanced CT to minimize radiation exposure. Ground-glass or subsolid nodules are suspicious for early adenocarcinoma. Hepatic The ACR recommends no further workup in low-risk patients who have lesions smaller than 5 mm, or larger lesions with low attenuation or benign imaging features. 1 Lesions of any size with "flash-filling" are usually benign hemangiomas. Suspicious findings include solid lesions 5 mm or larger, or those with ill-defined margins, enhancement greater than 20 HU, a heterogenous appearance, or interval growth. 1, 13. Lesions smaller than 1 cm with fatty or cyst-like consistency do not require further workup. Lesions larger than 4 cm should be further evaluated with special imaging modalities and are usually biopsied unless they are convincingly benign, such as cysts or myelolipomas. Lesions 1 to 4 cm in size are often benign adenomas.

In patients with no history or physical findings to suggest hyperfunctioning lesions, physicians may defer a hormonal workup, although endocrinologists from the Mayo Clinic recommend annual monitoring. 1, 23 Such monitoring includes 24-hour urine cortisol and metanephrine/catecholamine levels, and plasma aldosterone and renin testing. In 2012, the ACR updated their appropriateness criteria for management of adrenal incidentalomas. 24.

### Adrenal incidentalomas – a continuing management dilemma [^114jzmKA]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Adrenal incidentalomas (AI), adrenal tumors detected through an imaging procedure done for reasons unrelated to adrenal dysfunction, is becoming a common clinical problem with the more frequent utilization of different imaging techniques. Most such tumors are benign and hormonally inactive. A variety of diagnostic strategies have been developed to distinguish the latter; however, they are still controversial. Even after a commissioned systematic review of the literature and a state of the science conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the optimal strategy for hormonal screening of a patient with AI is unknown, but we anticipate further refinements and major advances in the field. Surgery is the ultimate solution for the diagnostic-therapeutic dilemma of AI. Careful planning is required, and the learning curve which influences clinical decision making is especially relevant to immediate outcomes. The benefit of making a diagnosis of a clinically significant AI must be considered in the context of the patient's overall condition and preferences.

### American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for adrenalectomy: executive summary [^111hxQ7X]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

American Association of Endocrine Surgeons — adrenal incidentaloma evaluation and surveillance are specified with strong recommendations and growth-based management guidance: We recommend that all patients with an adrenal incidentaloma 1 cm or larger undergo biochemical testing for autonomous cortisol secretion; patients with hypokalemia or hypertension also require biochemical evaluation for primary aldosteronism, and patients with adrenal imaging findings that have noncontrast CT with HU greater than 10 should undergo evaluation for pheochromocytoma (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.). We recommend that a primary adrenal malignancy be considered in patients with an adrenal incidentaloma larger 4 cm and/or HU greater than 20 on noncontrast CT and in any patient younger than 18 years, and we recommend that patients with a history of extra-adrenal malignancy be recognized to be at increased risk for adrenal metastases (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.). Most nonfunctional adrenal nodules with benign imaging characteristics remain stable in size, but up to 10% of adrenal incidentalomas will grow 1 cm or more over 2 to 5 years of surveillance; surgical resection may be considered for nodules that are larger than 2 cm at initial presentation and grow more than 1 cm by 12 months, while smaller nodules or those with less growth may undergo repeated short-interval imaging at 6 to 12 months. The risk context provided notes 3% in patients without a history of malignancy and up to 8% in patients with a history of extra-adrenal malignancy.

### Approach to the patient with adrenal incidentaloma [^116qkURQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Adrenal tumors are commonly discovered incidentally on cross-sectional abdominal imaging performed for reasons other than adrenal mass. Incidence of adrenal tumors increased 10-fold in the past 2 decades, with most diagnosed in older adults. In any patient with a newly discovered adrenal mass, determining whether the adrenal mass is malignant and whether it is hormonally active is equally important to guide the best management. Malignancy is diagnosed in 5% to 8% of patients with adrenal tumors, with a higher risk in young patients, if history of extra-adrenal malignancy, in those with large adrenal tumors with indeterminate imaging characteristics, and in bilateral adrenal tumors. Although overt hormone excess is uncommon in adrenal incidentalomas, mild autonomous cortisol secretion can be diagnosed in up to 30% to 50% of patients. Because autonomous cortisol secretion is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and metabolic abnormalities, all patients with adrenal incidentalomas require work up with dexamethasone suppression test. Management of adrenal tumors varies based on etiology, associated comorbidities, and patient's preference. This article reviews the current evidence on the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with adrenal mass and focuses on management of the most common etiologies of adrenal incidentalomas.

### Neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111FZKiX]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Adrenal gland tumors — initial evaluation and clinical diagnosis: For an "Adrenal gland tumor on imaging" with "History of prior or current malignancy with risk of or suspicion of adrenal metastasis", the pathway directs to "Additional Evaluation (AGT-2)". With "No history of prior or current malignancy", perform morphologic and functional evaluations. Morphologic evaluation uses an adrenal protocol CT scan starting with non-contrast CT; "If Hounsfield unit (HU) < +10, no further imaging", whereas "If > +10 HU, proceed with contrast CT with washout", and "Consider additional imaging" or "MRI with and without contrast"; "Depending on HU and imaging characteristics, additional imaging and workup may be indicated". Functional evaluation calls for "Biochemical workup (NE-E 2 of 4)" for "Primary aldosteronism", "Hypercortisolemia (± Cushing syndrome)", "PCC", and "Androgen excess", with the footnote that "If HU < +10, no PCC screening is needed". Clinical diagnosis categories listed include "Primary aldosteronism", "Hypercortisolemia (± Cushing syndrome)", "Suspected adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC)", and "PCC". "Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated".

### Adrenal incidentaloma: evaluation and management [^11197saS]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Adrenal incidentalomas are adrenal masses discovered incidental to imaging studies performed for reasons unrelated to adrenal pathology. Although most adrenal incidentalomas are non-functioning benign adenomas, their increasing prevalence presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The assessment of adrenal incidentalomas is aimed at deciding whether or not the tumour should be surgically removed. Adrenalectomy is indicated for phaeochromocytoma, other symptomatic hormone-secreting tumours and those with a high risk of malignancy. Biochemical screening for tumour hypersecretion is mandatory in all adrenal incidentalomas, since hormone secreting tumours may be clinically silent. The diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma is of paramount importance because of its life-threatening complications. Non-functioning adrenal incidentalomas need assessment for risk of malignancy, and this is based on the size of the tumour and its imaging characteristics. An observational policy with periodic radiological and biochemical reassessment is pursued in patients with non-functioning incidentalomas with low malignancy risk. The duration and frequency of reassessment remains unclear, as the natural history of adrenal incidentalomas has yet to be clearly defined, and there is a lack of controlled studies comparing surgical intervention with observation. However, the possibility of acquiring autonomous hypersecretion or conversion to malignancy in an incidentaloma diagnosed to be a benign non-functioning lesion is very low, and most patients may be safely discharged after an initial follow-up period of 2 years.

### Incidentally detected bilateral adrenal nodules in patients without cancer: is further workup necessary? [^115FELNY]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of malignancy in incidentally detected bilateral adrenal masses in patients with no known history of cancer.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective search of CT reports of patients with incidentally detected bilateral adrenal nodules was performed from January 1, 2002, to January 1, 2014. Patients were excluded if they had a known cancer or suspected functioning adrenal tumor; 161 patients were included. Nodules were characterized as benign or malignant on the basis of imaging features at the index CT examination, imaging features at subsequent adrenal protocol CT or MRI, imaging stability for a minimum of 1 year, or clinical follow-up of a minimum of 2 years.

Results

Mean nodule size was 1.8 cm (range, 0.7–4.9 cm). There were no cases of primary or secondary adrenal malignancy (95% CI, 0.00–0.023). The nodules diagnosed on index CT scans were 73 adrenal adenomas and two myelolipomas. Seventy-four nodules were subsequently characterized as adrenal adenomas on the basis of imaging findings. Of the 113 indeterminate nodules that had imaging follow-up, 111 were stable at the latest follow-up examination. One nodule grew 26% over 8.1 years, and the other grew 59% over 12.4 years. Clinical follow-up of patients with 60 indeterminate nodules revealed no evidence of adrenal malignancy.

Conclusion

No case of malignancy was found in 322 incidentally detected bilateral adrenal nodules at CT of patients without known cancer. Imaging follow-up of such lesions may be unnecessary.

The vast majority of the adrenal incidentalomas were benign, hormonally inactive adenomas. For patients with an initial normal biochemical investigation, the 24-month hormonal follow-up did not result in the finding of any additional hormonally active tumours. This study indicates that patients with an initial normal hormonal screening may not need further biochemical follow-up.

Where should the focus of future adrenal incidentaloma research be?

Whilst we believe there is sufficient data to support our recommendations thus far, we acknowledge other aspects of AI workup presently lack strong evidence. We therefore encourage further research into these areas to assist in refining an algorithmic approach to AI management.

Further attenuation and size subcategorisation

Further stratification of subgroups within and beyond the stated 20 HU and 4 cm thresholds (e.g. combinations of 10–20 HU, 20–40 HU; 1–2 cm, 2–4 cm, 4–6 cm, > 6 cm) may enable reduced imaging for additional benign lesions. Some evidence suggests a more cautious approach may be appropriate for all lesions > 40 HU on ncCT given the relative infrequency of adenomas in this range; however, this data was obtained primarily in the context of PCC determination. Additionally, some studies indicate lesions > 6 cm have a significantly increased risk of malignancy, independent of attenuation. Conversely, there is early data that AIs below a size threshold of 1.5 cm may not require cortisol testing; however, larger validation studies are required.

Post-contrast CT detected adrenal incidentalomas

For AIs first detected on post-contrast CT with indeterminate imaging features, ncCT may be performed. However, given the established low ~0.1% risk of malignancy of true AIs < 4 cm of any attenuation, it may be possible that ncCT could be delayed 6–12 months in this subgroup to simultaneously allow growth assessment. Additionally, further research may identify subgroups where ncCT may not be required at all.

Stability and growth

Current guidelines indicate a variable range of 6–12-month stability as evidence of benignity, and there is currently only limited data assessing adenoma versus ACC growth rates. Further research into both these areas is therefore warranted.

Spectral CT attenuation

Historic studies have been based on conventional 120 kVp imaging data; however, attenuation values derived from spectral CT, including virtual noncontrast measurements, may differ. With the expected proliferation of photon-counting CT, it will be important to establish how spectral CT attenuation measurements can be used in AL assessment.

Heterogeneous lesions and morphology

A recent study indicated that attenuation measurement in heterogeneous lesions has poor diagnostic performance. Furthermore, heterogeneity and other morphologic features in some studies have shown high specificity but poor sensitivity for indicating malignancy. Further investigation into the management of heterogeneous nodules is therefore warranted, noting recent disappointing results also for MRI in differentiating adenomas and metastases by heterogeneity and T2-weighted signal.

### The landmark series: evaluation and management of adrenal incidentalomas [^111z3aT3]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Adrenal incidentalomas are adrenal masses ≥ 1 cm discovered on imaging studies for unrelated clinical conditions. The prevalence of adrenal incidentalomas has increased as a byproduct of the widespread use of cross-sectional imaging, particularly in older adults. The clinical significance of adrenal incidentalomas varies based on tumor size, hormonal activity, and imaging characteristics. While most adrenal incidentalomas are benign and asymptomatic, a significant minority are hormonally active or malignant, necessitating careful evaluation and management. Adrenal hormone secretion can have significant clinical implications. Biochemical testing is crucial to assess for hormone excess, including steroid hormones (mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens), which are made in the adrenal cortex, as well as catecholamines, which are made in the adrenal medulla. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) is the preferred modality for evaluating adrenal nodules as it allows for assessment of tissue density in Hounsfield units (HU). Benign lesions typically have an homogeneous appearance with HU ≤ 10. Contrast-enhanced CT with delayed washout can help differentiate benign tumors from malignant tumors. Tumors ≥ 4 cm, or those with indeterminate features may require further imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. The management of adrenal incidentalomas is determined by hormonal secretion and imaging characteristics. Surgical resection is recommended for functional tumors and those that are suspicious for malignancy, including tumors ≥ 4 cm in size and those with rapid growth. Non-functional tumors < 4 cm may undergo imaging surveillance. The goal of this review is to summarize the contemporary literature and guidelines on adrenal incidentalomas, and to describe the key principles regarding evaluation and management.

Follow-up in patients without surgery

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommends repeated imaging for up to 5 years for benign tumors. However, the more recent European guidelines do not recommend further imaging for benign, nonfunctioning lesions of less than 4 cm. Patients with adrenal lesions over 4cm or indeterminate lesions, who have not undergone surgery are recommended to have repeat imaging, either a noncontrast CT or MRI in 6 to 12 months, the optimal timing is at the discretion of the MDT and depends on the index of suspicion. Surgical resection is recommended if there is a 20% increase in size, in addition to at least a 5 mm increase in diameter over this period. Both adrenocortical cancers and metastases usually demonstrate rapid growth over months, in contrast to a benign adenoma. Further imaging should be undertaken, again at 6 to 12 months, if there is an increase in size, but not at the threshold for surgical intervention. For younger patients, MRI surveillance, rather than CT, is preferred due to lower radiation exposure. In elderly patients follow up with imaging, even with nodules over 4 cm might be favored over surgery, in the presence of multiple comorbidities. Patients are treated on an individual basis but it is acknowledged that many clinicians and patients would not feel comfortable following up a tumor over 4 cm on imaging, even if radiologically benign, in a young patient and surgery is often the preferred option.

Repeat hormonal testing is not advised in patients without evidence of hormone oversecretion on their initial assessment. It should only be considered if patients develop new clinical signs of adrenal hormone hypersecretion or worsening of comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, or osteoporosis.

The risk of patients with ACS progressing to overt Cushing's syndrome is negligible; however, ACS is associated with numerous comorbidities. If patients with ACS do not undergo surgery initially, they should be annually reassessed for cortisol hypersecretion and potential worsening of comorbidities. If there is clinical or biochemical progression then patients can be re-evaluated for surgery.

Biochemical Evaluation

Adrenal hormone evaluation is crucial for the management of adrenal incidentalomas, as functional tumors typically require surgical resection. Biochemical evaluation should be performed in conjunction with a careful clinical assessment including history and physical examination. A summary of the current screening guidelines can be found in Table 2. – While prior guidelines have recommended routine testing for all adrenal hormones, contemporary guidelines suggest routine testing for autonomous cortisol secretion and catecholamines, and only selective testing for aldosterone and androgens in patients with clinical signs or symptoms. These recommendations are based on the higher likelihood of clinically occult disease in pheochromocytoma and MACS, which makes testing based on clinical findings less reliable. Selective screening does increase the importance of meticulous and expert clinical evaluation.

### Diagnosis, management, and follow-up of the incidentally discovered adrenal mass: CUA guideline endorsed by the AUA [^1119fiaa]. The Journal of Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Incidental adrenal masses are common and require a multidisciplinary approach to evaluation and management that includes family physicians, urologists, endocrinologists, and radiologists. The purpose of this guideline is to provide an updated approach to the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of adrenal incidentalomas, with a special focus on the areas of discrepancy/controversy existing among the published guidelines from other associations.

Materials and Methods

This guideline was developed by the Canadian Urological Association (CUA) through a working group comprised of urologists, endocrinologists, and radiologists and subsequently endorsed by the American Urological Association (AUA). A systematic review utilizing the GRADE approach served as the basis for evidence-based recommendations with consensus statements provided in the absence of evidence. For each guideline statement, the strength of recommendation was reported as weak or strong, and the quality of evidence was evaluated as low, medium, or high.

Results

The CUA working group provided evidence- and consensus-based recommendations based on an updated systematic review and subject matter expertise. Important updates on evidence-based radiological evaluation and hormonal testing are included in the recommendations. This guideline clarifies which patients may benefit from surgery and highlights where short term surveillance is appropriate.

Conclusion

Incidentally detected adrenal masses require a comprehensive assessment of hormonal function and oncologic risk. This guideline provides a contemporary approach to the appropriate clinical, radiographic, and endocrine assessments required for the evaluation, management, and follow-up of patients with such lesions.

### American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for adrenalectomy: executive summary [^115PFCBY]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Adrenalectomy is the definitive treatment for multiple adrenal abnormalities. Advances in technology and genomics and an improved understanding of adrenal pathophysiology have altered operative techniques and indications.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations to enhance the appropriate, safe, and effective approaches to adrenalectomy.

Evidence Review

A multidisciplinary panel identified and investigated 7 categories of relevant clinical concern to practicing surgeons. Questions were structured in the framework Population, Intervention/Exposure, Comparison, and Outcome, and a guided review of medical literature from PubMed and/or Embase from 1980 to 2021 was performed. Recommendations were developed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology and were discussed until consensus, and patient advocacy representation was included.

Findings

Patients with an adrenal incidentaloma 1 cm or larger should undergo biochemical testing and further imaging characterization. Adrenal protocol computed tomography (CT) should be used to stratify malignancy risk and concern for pheochromocytoma. Routine scheduled follow-up of a nonfunctional adrenal nodule with benign imaging characteristics and unenhanced CT with Hounsfield units less than 10 is not suggested. When unilateral disease is present, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is recommended for patients with primary aldosteronism or autonomous cortisol secretion. Patients with clinical and radiographic findings consistent with adrenocortical carcinoma should be treated at high-volume multidisciplinary centers to optimize outcomes, including, when possible, a complete R0 resection without tumor disruption, which may require en bloc radical resection. Selective or nonselective α blockade can be used to safely prepare patients for surgical resection of paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma. Empirical perioperative glucocorticoid replacement therapy is indicated for patients with overt Cushing syndrome, but for patients with mild autonomous cortisol secretion, postoperative day 1 morning cortisol or cosyntropin stimulation testing can be used to determine the need for glucocorticoid replacement therapy. When patient and tumor variables are appropriate, we recommend minimally invasive adrenalectomy over open adrenalectomy because of improved perioperative morbidity. Minimally invasive adrenalectomy can be achieved either via a retroperitoneal or transperitoneal approach depending on surgeon expertise, as well as tumor and patient characteristics.

Conclusions and Relevance

Twenty-six clinically relevant and evidence-based recommendations are provided to assist surgeons with perioperative adrenal care.

### Discrepancies in the recommended management of adrenal incidentalomas by various guidelines [^111dyqpe]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Adrenal incidentalomas are being discovered with increasing frequency, and their discovery poses a challenge to clinicians. Despite the 2002 National Institutes of Health consensus statement, there are still discrepancies in the most recent guidelines from organizations representing endocrinology, endocrine surgery, urology and radiology. We review recent guidelines across the specialties involved in diagnosing and treating adrenal incidentalomas, and discuss points of agreement as well as controversy among guidelines.

Materials and Methods

PubMed®, Scopus®, Embase™ and Web of Science™ databases were searched systematically in November 2019 in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement to identify the most recently updated committee produced clinical guidelines in each of the 4 specialties. Five articles met the inclusion criteria.

Results

There is little debate among the reviewed guidelines as to the initial evaluation of an adrenal incidentaloma. All patients with a newly discovered adrenal incidentaloma should receive an unenhanced computerized tomogram and hormone screen. The most significant points of divergence among the guidelines regard reimaging an initially benign appearing mass, repeat hormone testing and management of an adrenal incidentaloma that is not easily characterized as benign or malignant on computerized tomography. The guidelines range from actively recommending against any repeat imaging and hormone screening to recommending a repeat scan as early as in 3 to 6 months and annual hormonal screening for several years.

Conclusions

After reviewing the guidelines and the evidence used to support them we posit that best practices lie at their convergence and have presented our management recommendations on how to navigate the guidelines when they are discrepant.

### The clinically inapparent adrenal mass: update in diagnosis and management [^115S1YJU]. Endocrine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Clinically inapparent adrenal masses are incidentally detected after imaging studies conducted for reasons other than the evaluation of the adrenal glands. They have frequently been referred to as adrenal incidentalomas. In preparation for a National Institutes of Health State-of-the-Science Conference on this topic, extensive literature research, including Medline, BIOSIS, and Embase between 1966 and July 2002, as well as references of published metaanalyses and selected review articles identified more than 5400 citations. Based on 699 articles that were retrieved for further examination, we provide a comprehensive update of the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches focusing on endocrine and radiological features as well as surgical options. In addition, we present recent developments in the discovery of tumor markers, endocrine testing for subclinical disease including autonomous glucocorticoid hypersecretion and silent pheochromocytoma, novel imaging techniques, and minimally invasive surgery. Based on the statements of the conference, the available literature, and ongoing studies, our aim is to provide practical recommendations for the management of this common entity and to highlight areas for future studies and research.

### Adrenal incidentaloma [^114fho31]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

An AI is now established as a common endocrine diagnosis that requires a multidisciplinary approach for effective management. The majority of patients can be reassured and discharged, but a personalized approach based upon image analysis, endocrine workup, and clinical symptoms and signs is required in every case. ACC remains a real concern but is restricted to < 2% of all cases. Functional AI lesions are commoner (but still probably < 10% of total) and the greatest challenge remains the diagnosis and optimum management of ACS. Modern-day surgery has improved outcomes and novel radiological and urinary biomarkers will improve early detection and patient stratification in future years to come.

### Adrenal incidentaloma [^114PBwKf]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Because of the frequent use of computed tomography and other abdominal imaging modalities, clinicians more frequently see the incidentally discovered, clinically silent adrenal mass. Most adrenal incidentalomas should be evaluated for hormonal activity and assessed for their risk of malignancy. Adrenalectomy is indicated for hyperfunctioning tumors and for any potential primary malignant adrenal lesion. Nonfunctioning cortical adenomas < 4 to 5 cm in size should be followed clinically and radiographically. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy has been used increasingly as the preferred approach in patients who require surgical resection whereas open adrenalectomy is reserved for patients with large, malignant tumors. The indications for adrenalectomy in patients with nonfunctioning adrenal tumors should not be liberalized because of the laparoscopic approach.

### Adrenal incidentaloma [^114XNXXe]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Follow-up imaging

European guidelines suggest no further imaging for patients with adrenal lesions with benign characteristics < 4 cm in diameter. This is further supported by a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of nonfunctioning adrenal lesions where a mean tumor growth of 2 mm occurred over a median of 52.8 months, and clinically significant tumor enlargement (≥ 10 mm) occurred in only 2.5% of patients, and none developed adrenal cancer.

Data from a large Italian cohort study reported a 4 cm size cut-off had the highest sensitivity (93%) but low specificity (24%) for prediction of malignancy. For this reason, larger lesions with clear benign features warrant interval reassessment with imaging after 6 to 12 months to exclude significant growth (> 20% increase in size with at least 5 mm absolute increase in diameter) which would prompt surgical resection. Less marked interim lesion growth warrants reassessment with a further scan after 6 to 12 months.

Ideally, every patient with an AI should be managed by an expert MDT, incorporating an endocrinologist, radiologist, pathologist, and a surgeon, with significant expertise in adrenal tumors. However, this is a challenging aspiration given the increasing prevalence of AI. Therefore the ESE/ENSAT guideline identifies certain patients who are most likely to benefit from MDT discussion. This includes conditions where one of the following criteria is met; imaging is not consistent with a benign lesion; there is evidence of hormone excess (including ACS); there is evidence of significant tumor growth during follow-up imaging; and where adrenal surgery is considered.

### Cardio-metabolic pathophysiology in mild glucocorticoid excess: potential implications for management of adrenal incidentaloma [^115PakRY]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Adrenal adenomas are incidentally identified in up to 5% of computer tomography scans performed for unrelated indications. A proportion of these adrenal incidentalomas are found to autonomously secrete cortisol based on definitions in current guidelines. Epidemiological studies suggest that chronic exposure to mild glucocorticoid excess from adrenal incidentalomas is associated with significantly increased cardiometabolic risk. However, current management guidelines adopt a conservative approach as no large prospective randomized studies have demonstrated that these patients benefit from surgery. This narrative review examines the epidemiological and mechanistic studies related to three common clinical settings of mild glucocorticoid excess to gain further insight into the potential benefits of treating patients with adrenal incidentaloma and possible autonomous cortisol secretion.

### Adrenal lesions found incidentally: how to improve clinical and cost-effectiveness [^114DHhYz]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Background

The significant variability in the approach to treating patients with adrenal incidentalomas stems from the fact that there were no UK NHS-compatible guidelines for managing the condition. Guidance has limited utility, as highlighted in a NHS report confirming that adrenal incidentalomas are a common clinical dilemma and the majority of affected patients are inappropriately investigated.

A recent literature review (using search terms including 'adrenal incidentaloma management' and 'adrenal incidentaloma guidance') indicated that US/European guidelines have been largely based on retrospective, limited and often conflicting data relating to thresholds and timelines for planning investigations.NHS management plans are not driven by insurers or fee-for-service payments (unlike US/European-based systems), limiting the relevance of these guidelines to the UK.

A study from a UK district general hospital identified 75 patients with adrenal incidentalomas in 2010. The majority (80%) received no biochemical investigation or follow-up, with only 13 (17%) referred for specialist review and two further patients undergoing additional evaluation in primary care. A further UK study, focusing on biochemical investigations, accepted that, for patients with adrenal incidentaloma, ' Their best management strategy is unknown'. The medical literature emphasises international acknowledgement that these tumours pose a management dilemma, but there is no NHS-compatible system to ensure appropriate management.

### Imaging of adrenal-related endocrine disorders [^113qsyuz]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Endocrine disorders associated with adrenal pathologies can be caused by insufficient adrenal gland function or excess hormone secretion. Excess hormone secretion may result from adrenal hyperplasia or hormone-secreting (ie, functioning) adrenal masses. Based on the hormone type, functioning adrenal masses can be classified as cortisol-producing tumors, aldosterone producing tumors, and androgen-producing tumors, which originate in the adrenal cortex, as well as catecholamine-producing pheochromocytomas, which originate in the medulla. Nonfunctioning lesions can cause adrenal gland enlargement without causing hormonal imbalance. Evaluation of adrenal-related endocrine disorders requires clinical and biochemical workup associated with imaging evaluation to reach a diagnosis and guide management.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) adrenal mass risk assessment and follow-up: A homogeneous adrenal mass with Hounsfield unit (HU) of ≤ 10 on noncontrast CT indicates a benign lesion, and in such scenarios no additional imaging is necessary. For masses with HU between 11 and 20 and measuring ≤ 4 cm with a normal hormonal work-up, immediate follow-up imaging is encouraged; if immediate additional imaging is not feasible, a noncontrast CT or MRI should be considered at a 12-month follow-up interval. Masses ≥ 4 cm, heterogeneous, or with HU > 20 indicate a considerable risk for malignancy; if surgery is deemed unnecessary, follow-up imaging should be scheduled within 6 to 12 months. Adrenal biopsy is discouraged unless there is a known extra-adrenal malignancy; if adrenocortical carcinoma is suspected, measurement of sex steroids and steroidogenesis precursors is advisable and multisteroid profiling via tandem mass spectrometry may be useful. For masses that do not conform to established criteria, a multidisciplinary team discussion is recommended, and if an indeterminate mass is selected for observation, interval imaging should occur within 6 to 12 months.

Summarised recommendations for adrenal incidentaloma management

Based on the presented evidence, and with acknowledgement of areas requiring further research, the following AI management principles are provided:

Definition of adrenal incidentalomas

A robust definition of an AI inherently delineates a population with an extremely low prevalence of malignancy. To reiterate, we define AIs as ≥ 1 cm lesions in patients without current or prior extra-adrenal malignancy, or clinically suspected adrenal disease. AIs with overtly benign imaging features, such as myelolipomas or cysts, or those with long-term stability (for now, defined as 6–12 months) do not require further evaluation.

Recommendation for hormonal correlation

Radiology reports should include a recommendation to perform a hormonal evaluation for all remaining AIs, which will identify nearly all PCC, as well as most ACC. Additionally, endocrine correlation identifies subclinically functional adenomas (including MACS), where clinical management may take precedence. Recommending additional endocrinologist referral may depend on local preferences, as in some regions, to manage cost and access issues, endocrine testing can be performed by primary care physicians, with endocrinologist referral limited to those with abnormal results.

Elimination of adrenal washout CT

In the defined AI population, and with application of endocrine assessment, current evidence indicates no role for AWCT.

Categorisation on noncontrast CT

On ncCT (Fig. 1), homogeneous AIs ≤ 20 HU and ≤ 4 cm, or as per existing guidelines, < 10 HU and any size, are considered benign (Category-1), with no imaging follow-up required. AIs which are > 20 HU and 1–4 cm, OR 10–20 HU but > 4 cm, are highly likely benign (Category-2), and therefore 6–12 month ncCT is currently suggested as supported by most AI guidelines, purely to identify growth or stability.

Those > 20 HU AND > 4 cm are considered higher risk (Category-3), with multidisciplinary meeting or surgical referral recommended, albeit acknowledging that most will still be of benign aetiology. As discussed prior, a more cautious approach is advised if AIs are > 40 HU and/or > 6 cm.

Neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors — hypercortisolemia (± Cushing syndrome) evaluation specifies initial screening with an overnight 1‑mg dexamethasone suppression test, 2 to 3 midnight salivary cortisol measurements, or free cortisol in a 24‑hour urine sample; elevated cortisol indicates hypercortisolemia. If confirmed, morning plasma ACTH should be checked to determine ACTH‑dependent versus ACTH‑independent disease (ACTH < 5 pg/mL). If a clear pituitary adenoma is not visible by MRI, inferior petrosal sinus vein sampling can be considered, and endocrinology referral should be considered for biochemical workup, localization, and medical therapy until definitive therapy can be arranged.

PPIs, other drugs, some medical conditions, and certain foods are known to cause false elevations in serum gastrin and chromogranin A; to confirm diagnosis, serum gastrin should be checked when fasting and off PPI for > 1 week, although PPI should be continued in patients with overt clinical symptoms of gastrinoma and/or risks of complications.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for adrenal incidentaloma, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ENSAT/ESE 2023 guidelines recommend to consider providing an individualized approach in cases of adrenal masses not falling in one of the categories above (tumor size ≥ 4 cm with unenhanced HUs of 11–20; tumor size < 4 cm with unenhanced HUs > 20; or tumor size < 4 cm with heterogeneous appearance) with discussion in a multidisciplinary team meeting. Recognize that the likelihood of malignancy is still low. Prefer obtaining immediate additional imaging according to the center's expertise and availability in most cases. Obtain interval imaging in 6–12 months (non-contrast CT/MRI) if the tumor is still judged as an indeterminate mass and surgery is not performed.

### Diagnostic dilemmas: a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of adrenal incidentaloma pathology based on radiographic size [^117WKxqZ]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Along with a conservative approach to management comes a need to clarify ongoing surveillance imaging and laboratory evaluation intervals. This is due to a 17%, 29%, 47% risk of AIs converting to functional status and a 6%, 14%, 29% risk of increasing in size at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Current guidelines vary, with most suggesting follow-up guided by clinical judgment and the presumed cause of the mass based on initial workup. National Institute of Health (NIH) data suggests that for masses that are benign-appearing (< 10 HU; washout > 50%), small (< 3 cm), and completely non-functioning, imaging and biochemical reevaluation at 1–2 years (or more) is appropriate, with subsequent follow-up only if the clinical picture changes; the risk of malignancy or subsequent hyperfunction is almost nonexistent though reported conversion to ACC exists in recent literature. For indeterminate lesions, repeat evaluation for growth after 3–12 months is appropriate. Subsequent testing should occur earlier for lesions with increasing size, and later for those with no change. The AAES extends the criteria for "small" AIs to include those < 4 cm and they better outline surveillance recommendations to include radiographic reevaluation at 3 to 6 months, then annually for 1–2 years. Similarly, they suggest hormonal evaluation annually for up to 5 years. Repeat screening for hyperaldosteronism is not perceived to be beneficial, but most authors recommend screening for catecholamine and cortisol excess for at least four years due to the similar appearance of pheochromocytomas to lipid-poor adenomas on CT scan. This is one instance in which clinical judgment can be used to guide surveillance as most pheochromocytomas grow over time suggesting that further imaging may not be indicated in the setting of a stable mass.

### Radiologic evaluation of incidentally discovered adrenal masses [^115FHh8y]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The increasing use of cross-sectional imaging has led to an increase in the incidental discovery of adrenal masses (adrenal incidentalomas). Although most of these lesions are benign, they often present a diagnostic dilemma. Before creating a management plan, the physician should determine if the lesion is benign or malignant and if the lesion is functioning or nonfunctioning. Incidentally discovered adrenal masses usually are benign adenomas; however, myelolipomas, cysts, hemorrhage, pheochromocytomas, metastases, and adrenocortical carcinomas are also possible. Unenhanced computed tomography and chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging can characterize most adenomas because the lesions have high lipid content. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography can further characterize the adenomas because of the washout characteristics with iodinated intravenous contrast media. Fluorodeoxyglucose- positron emission tomography can be helpful in characterizing some lesions, and biopsy is rarely required. This article summarizes the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria for the use of imaging modalities and biopsy to characterize incidentally discovered adrenal masses.

### Adrenal lesions found incidentally: how to improve clinical and cost-effectiveness [^11575QWS]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

In summary, these studies highlight the lack of consensus regarding adrenal incidentaloma management. There is a risk of missing serious conditions that could be life threatening (including phaeochromocytoma and excess cortisol production) and that require rapid intervention. Many patients who ultimately do not require further follow-up need appropriate and timely investigation and effective communication to avoid unnecessary distress.

Our proposal, therefore, aimed to combine the new NHS-compatible European adrenal incidentaloma guidelines with information technology (IT) infrastructure and NHS-based referral processes to establish the first streamlined, clinically effective, patient-centred electronic Adrenal Incidentaloma Management System (eAIMS). This is highly innovative because it is

Evidence-based: eAIMS uses newly developed guidelines appropriate for integration into NHS processes (acknowledging the magnitude of the problem, referral processes and patient safety).
Multidisciplinary: Involving all key stakeholders (patients, commissioners, radiologists, clinical biochemists, hospital IT and Service Transformation experts as well as acute hospital physicians) in the design and evaluation from the outset.
Patient-orientated: Engaging patients in designing eAIMS (eg, steps followed in investigating and communicating results) and development of information leaflets. Patients will also help in evaluation via a survey of impact on anxiety.
Embedded: By involving IT experts and Service Transformation teams, this System will be embedded into routine clinical pathways for adrenal incidentaloma management.
Efficient: Exploiting IT to establish an integrated management system to facilitate interaction between the different steps and specialists in the pathway, ensuring timely investigations, multidisciplinary team interpretations, and communication with patients and general practitioners.
Cost-effective: Eliminating unnecessary investigations, outpatient visits and interventions(independently evaluated by University of East Anglia).
Generalisable: By selecting two sites with differing demographic populations and approaches to adrenal incidentaloma management, the potential for roll-out across the wider NHS is more assessable.
Addressing an unmet need: There is currently no system to address this gap in proactively managing patients with adrenal incidentalomas.

### Radiologic evaluation of incidentally discovered adrenal masses… [^112kiXpe]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

ADRENAL BIOPSY TO DETECT MALIGNANCY The role of adrenal biopsy has evolved. Biopsy is not performed to diagnose adrenal adenoma, but mostly to confirm or rule out malignancy in the few cases in which CT or MRI results are equivocal. However, before adrenal biopsy is performed, pheochromocytoma should be excluded with biochemical tests, especially in an incidentally detected mass, because hemorrhage and hypertensive crisis have been reported as complications of pheochromocytomas biopsy. 27, 28. Is the Lesion Functioning or Nonfunctioning. Subclinical hyperfunctioning adrenal nodules are well recognized; pheochromocytomas, aldosteronomas, and cortisol-secreting nodules are the most common. 30 Although a functioning mass is often suggested by the history and physical examination findings, the absence of these findings does not exclude a hormonally active lesion.

Studies have shown detectable secretion of aldosterone, cortisol, or catecholamines in 5 to 23 percent of patients with adrenal incidentalomas. 31–34 Table 3 outlines the biochemical workup to help determine if the lesion is functioning.
5. Follow-up and Treatment Patients with incidentally discovered adrenal masses measuring greater than 4 cm who do not have a history of malignancy usually undergo surgery if the lesions cannot be characterized as cysts or myelolipomas, because of the higher risk of adrenocortical carcinoma in masses of this size. 6 For lesions measuring 1 to 4 cm that are characterized as adenomas, follow-up unenhanced CT at 12 months can be performed to ensure that there has not been significant growth. Tumors that have grown should be further investigated, and adrenal biopsy or resection should be considered, although even growing adrenal lesions are usually not malignant.

13 If the size of the mass is stable, no further imaging is required, although serial biochemical evaluation may be needed.
35. The National Institutes of Health and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend that if autonomous function is not present on the initial study, hormonal evaluation should be repeated annually for at least four years. 5, 6, 13, 35, 36 Benign lesions that demonstrate autonomous function are managed either medically or surgically depending on the clinical circumstances. 37, 38 Adrenal cysts and myelolipomas usually do not need follow-up; however, surgical evaluation may be needed if the mass is large enough to cause symptoms.

### Missed opportunities to promptly diagnose and treat adrenal tumors [^112LLUEe]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adrenal mass management guidelines are insufficiently applied, and timeliness of treatment is unknown. We evaluated missed opportunities to promptly diagnose and treat adrenal tumors that ultimately required adrenalectomy.

Methods

From the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse, we identified patients who underwent adrenalectomy (2010–2016) in the South-Central Veterans Affairs HealthCare Network and reviewed their records. Diagnostic timeliness was assessed by the interval between initial (index) imaging with adrenal abnormality and the next diagnostic step. Workup was defined as early (interval ≤ 6 mo) or late (> 6 mo). Adrenalectomy was considered prompt when the interval between index imaging and adrenalectomy was ≤ 12 mo and delayed when this was > 12 mo. We quantified diagnostic and treatment delays and assessed factors associated with delayed adrenalectomy.

Results

During the study period, 84 patients underwent adrenalectomy: male (86.9%), White (57.1%), with a mean age of 58.7 y (± 8.8). Of those, 25 (29.8%) had late workup, and 36 (42.9%) had delayed surgery (median interval: 44 mo, range 14–282). Late hormonal workup occurred in 24 of 36 (66.7%) patients with delayed surgery, compared with one of 48 (2.1%, P < 0.001) with prompt surgery.

Conclusions

Missed opportunities in prompt diagnosis and treatment were common in patients with adrenal masses ultimately requiring adrenalectomy. Late hormonal workup is associated with delayed adrenalectomy. Interventions are needed to aid clinicians to recognize the presence, promptly evaluate, and make guideline-informed decisions on the management of an adrenal mass.

### Diagnostic dilemmas: a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of adrenal incidentaloma pathology based on radiographic size [^1119heuS]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The malignant potential of a small, incidentally found lesion of the adrenal gland causes great anxiety amongst patients, but rarely causes harm. An adrenal incidentaloma (AI) is defined as mass measuring greater than 1 cm on the adrenal gland found fortuitously during radiographic imaging. The diameter of the average AI measures approximately 3–3.5 cm on Computed Tomography (CT) scan. With increased utilization and advancements in the sensitivity of medical imaging, adrenal masses are observed in as many as 4.4% of all patients undergoing CT scan.

Over the past two decades, an increasing body of evidence has supported restructuring the current guidelines for the management of AIs. Most AIs result in the histological diagnosis of benign adrenal cortical adenoma. Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is more commonly diagnosed at younger ages than benign adrenal masses and is found more often in males than females. For patients without a history of malignancy, the estimated prevalence of ACC is less than 2 cases per million adrenal lesions identified. Twenty-five percent of benign masses increase in size during follow up; however, given the estimated 1 in 1000 risk of malignant transformation over time for benign masses, continued observation may be an appropriate option. Exposing patients to additional risks with surgery for a rare chance of cancer in smaller adrenal masses may not be warranted.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES) guidelines have changed over the last decade in regards to excision based on size from a previous cutoff of ≥ 6 cm to now only > 4 cm. Current clinical guidelines recommend a workup to include contrasted cross-sectional imaging and a functional evaluation to investigate for hormonal activity. Surgical excision is then recommended if the lesion is radiographically suspicious, > 4 cm in size, or hormonally active. Due to the rarity of ACC, most of these recommendations are based on information obtained from controlled trials without randomization (Level 3 Evidence).

Because there have been few randomized controlled studies regarding the management of AIs, there is a lack of qualified management guidelines for patient care. To address this clinical question, we sought to perform a collaborative effort reviewing ten years of adrenalectomy data comparing pathologic outcomes based on size criteria. It was hypothesized that our data would further support a needed modification in the current guidelines for removal of AIs.

Imaging

Non-contrast, or unenhanced, CT is the preferred initial imaging modality for the evaluation of adrenal incidentalomas. CT allows assessment of tissue density or tissue attenuation and is essential to assess the likelihood of malignancy in adrenal lesions. An adrenal mass is considered benign if it appears homogeneous and lipid-rich, with a density of ≤ 10 HU on an unenhanced CT scan. While standard contrast-enhanced CT is not suitable for distinguishing benign from malignant adrenal tumors, CT with delayed washout is more helpful. An adrenal protocol CT includes an unenhanced sequence followed by intravenous contrast administration with repeat imaging at 60–75 s (venous phase) and again at 15 min (delayed phase). Injected intravenous contrast washes out of benign lesions more rapidly than malignant lesions. Specifically, benign adenomas demonstrate an absolute percentage washout > 60% at 15 min delay, which is therefore used as a key diagnostic cut-off.

The 2023 ESE/European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumours (ESNAT) guidelines recommend that the initial step is differentiating benign from malignant adrenal incidentalomas using a non-contrast CT. If non-contrast CT is consistent with a benign adrenal incidentaloma, i.e. homogenous in appearance and HU ≤ 10, no further imaging is required. This marks a significant shift from prior recommendations.

Tumor size is a key characteristic that determines management, due to the correlation between tumor size and risk of malignancy. In 2002, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) published a consensus recommendation on adrenal incidentalomas, which classified adrenal tumors measuring < 4 cm as having a low risk of malignancy, those between 4 and 6 cm as indeterminate, and tumors ≥ 6 cm as having a high risk of malignancy. Multiple international society guidelines continue to use a cut-off size of 4 cm to determine management. For indeterminate nodules 1–4 cm in size on CT, either immediate additional imaging (adrenal protocol CT or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) or interval imaging in 6–12 months is recommended due to a slightly increased risk of malignancy. Nodules ≥ 4 cm with indeterminate imaging characteristics are typically recommended for surgical resection.

### Subclinical Cushing's syndrome [^115pzDPz]. Pituitary (2004). Low credibility.

Clinically inapparent adrenal masses, or adrenal incidentalomas, are discovered inadvertently in the course of workup or treatment of unrelated disorders. Cortical adenoma is the most frequent type of adrenal incidentaloma accounting for approximately 50% of cases in surgical series and even greater shares in medical series. Incidentally discovered adrenal adenomas may secrete cortisol in an autonomous manner, that is not fully restrained by pituitary feed-back, in 5 to 20% of cases depending on study protocols and diagnostic criteria. A number of different alterations in the endocrine tests aimed to assess the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis has been demonstrated in such patients. This heterogeneous condition has been termed as subclinical Cushing's syndrome, a definition that is more accurate than preclinical Cushing's syndrome since the evolution towards clinically overt hypercortisolism does occur rarely, if ever. The criteria for qualifying subclinical cortisol excess are controversial and we presently do not have sufficient evidence to define a gold standard for the diagnosis of subclinical Cushing's syndrome. An increased frequency of hypertension, central obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes and hyperlipoproteinemia has been described in patients with subclinical Cushing's syndrome; however, there is not evidence-based demonstration of its long-term complications and, consequently, the management of this condition is largely empirical. Either adrenalectomy or careful observation associated with treatment of metabolic syndrome has been suggested as treatment options because data are insufficient to indicate the superiority of a surgical or nonsurgical approach to manage patients with subclinical hyperfunctioning adrenal cortical adenomas.

### Approach to the patient with bilateral adrenal masses [^114NcBBz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Bilateral adrenal masses, increasingly encountered in clinical practice, manifest across diverse contexts, including incidental discovery, malignancy staging, and targeted imaging after hormonal diagnosis of adrenal disorders. The spectrum encompasses various pathologies, such as cortical adenomas, macronodular adrenal disease, pheochromocytomas, myelolipomas, infiltrative disorders, and primary and secondary malignancies. Notably, not all masses in both adrenal glands necessarily share the same etiology, often exhibiting diverse causes. Recently, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors updated guidelines, introduced a 4-option schema based on imaging, aiding in targeted hormonal testing and management. This "Approach to the Patient" review delves into the latest advancements in imaging, biochemical, and genetic approaches for the diagnostic and management nuances of bilateral adrenal masses. It provides insights and a contemporary framework for navigating the complexities associated with this clinical entity.

Future Directions

While adrenal incidentalomas are both common and increasing in incidence, there remains a significant gap in understanding and management. Notably, rates of completion of appropriate testing and imaging are low. A systematic review examining adherence to guidelines found that median rates of imaging (34%) and biochemical evaluation (18%) were unacceptably low. In this study, the factor most consistently associated with improved follow-up was the radiologist's recommendation, highlighting the significance of radiology reporting and suggesting a potential opportunity for improvement.

Several recent studies have tried to improve identification and management of adrenal incidentalomas by leveraging quality improvement initiatives and the electronic health record (EHR). Studies have targeted different steps to improve follow-up from standardizing radiology reports to engaging primary care providers to EHR-based strategies. Use of a standardized radiology template to report adrenal incidentalomas successfully improved rates of primary care provider (PCP) follow-up, biochemical testing, follow-up imaging, and appropriate specialist referrals in one center. Direct engagement with PCPs as well as the implementation of multidisciplinary adrenal clinics including endocrinologists and surgeons also represent promising targets for improving follow-up. One novel approach utilizing a natural language processing algorithm to detect clinically significant adrenal nodules increased biochemical evaluation sevenfold and adrenal-specific imaging threefold in participating patients. Orthogonal studies in primary aldosteronism utilizing EHR-based tools to automatically identify patients, and active choice nudges to guide provider ordering, resulted in a significantly higher proportion of patients being appropriately screened.

These novel approaches suggest that there are opportunities to leverage systems-based health care informatics to improve guideline-concordant care for adrenal incidentalomas at multiple levels. Optimal strategies would target: (1) identification, using standardized radiologic reporting of adrenal nodules and recommendations for biochemical and imaging evaluation; (2) evaluation, using EHR-embedded guidance to facilitate provider ordering of specific biochemical testing and imaging studies if indicated; (3) interpretation, providing normal ranges to support laboratory value interpretation and diagnosis; and (4) management, facilitating specialist referrals for patients who require further medical or surgical treatment or surveillance, as shown in Fig. 1.

### Imaging features of adrenal masses [^115oUM8d]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The widespread use of imaging has dramatically increased the detection of incidental adrenal lesions, which are mostly benign and non-functioning adenomas. Nevertheless, differentiating a benign adrenal lesion from a malignant one can be challenging and is critical especially in oncology patients, since it will greatly affect patient management. In this setting, imaging plays a crucial role with several tools, which can be employed in the attempt to characterize adrenal lesions. Radiologists should recall the strengths and weaknesses of imaging modalities to better help clinicians and surgeons in the management of patients, avoiding a misinterpretation of imaging features which frequently overlap between benign and malignant conditions.

### Prevalence and outcomes of incidental imaging findings: umbrella review [^11675Ng4]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Policy makers

Our results are relevant for policy makers in two ways: to inform new guidelines about the management of organ specific incidentalomas, and to update existing guidelines. We report the outcomes of incidentalomas across 12 different organs (table 2), as well as the meta-analysed prevalence of malignancy (table 4). Guidelines exist in the United States and Europe for the management of incidentalomas for five organs (pituitary, adrenal, ovary, kidney, and thyroid). Guidelines concerning pituitary and adrenal incidentalomas offer recommendations for clinicians requesting imaging, whereas the remaining three guidelines (ovary, renal, and thyroid) target radiologists and their recommendations assume a level of radiological expertise.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American Association of Endocrine Surgeons 2009 guideline on the management of adrenal incidentalomastargets non-radiologist clinicians and recommends: "Patients with an adrenal incidentaloma should undergo evaluation clinically, biochemically, and radiographically for signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism, aldosteronism (if hypertensive), the presence of a pheochromocytoma, or a malignant tumour". This recommendation appears congruent with our results; our data suggest that around 12% of patients with adrenal incidentalomas will have subclinical Cushing's syndrome (also known as low level autonomous cortisol secretion). However, the same guideline recommends: "Patients with adrenal incidentalomas who do not fulfil the criteria for surgical resection need to have radiographic re-evaluation at 3 to 6 months and then annually for 1 to 2 years". This recommendation is incongruent with our data: we found that less than 1% of adrenal incidentalomas are malignant. The more recent 2016 European Society of Endocrinology recommendationsare more closely aligned with our results, but are also somewhat conservative: "We recommend that all adrenal incidentalomas undergo an imaging procedure to determine if the mass is homogeneous and lipid rich and therefore benign. For this purpose, we primarily recommend the use of non-contrast computed tomography. We suggest that if the non-contrast computed tomography is consistent with a benign adrenal mass (Hounsfield units ≤ 10) that is homogeneous and smaller than 4 cm, no further imaging is required".

### ACR appropriateness criteria on incidentally discovered adrenal mass [^112F3ToX]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

For patients without a history of malignancy, most small (less than 3 cm) incidentally discovered adrenal masses are benign, and extensive and costly workup is usually not justified. For incidentalomas from 3 to 5 cm in size, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography, adrenal biopsy, or surgery can be considered. Lesions larger than 5 cm should be removed because of the higher risk for malignancy. For patients with histories of malignancy, incidentally discovered adrenal masses are more often malignant, and thus even smaller adrenal lesions are suspect. Adrenal biopsy should be reserved for cases in which the results of noninvasive techniques are equivocal.

Clinical Findings

Adrenal adenomas usually present as clinically unapparent adrenal masses, detected incidentally with imaging studies conducted for other reasons. The two major clinical concerns are that adrenal masses may overproduce hormones or that they represent adrenal cortical carcinomas. By definition, no clinical symptoms or signs of adrenal disease should be present at the time of diagnosis in patients with incidentally detected adrenal masses. However, a more detailed questioning and a careful physical examination might reveal subtle evidence for hormone excess. Hormonal assessment is usually done by an endocrinologist, in some countries also by an endocrine surgeon. In addition, repeat imaging after 6–12 months is necessary to assess malignant potential. Clinically silent lesions that are less than 4 cm are generally not resected. Surgery is indicated in adrenal masses larger than 6 cm because they frequently harbor malignancies and, in the case of hormone-producing adenomas, because of the metabolic consequences. For lesions between 4 and 6 cm, with benign characteristics on imaging, that do not appear to overproduce hormones, both close follow-up and adrenalectomy are considered a reasonable approach.

Considerations for Surveillance

Based on the low incidence of hormone-producing adrenal adenomas and the rarity of adrenal cancer in FAP patients, surveillance does not seem to be justified. However, clinical awareness is very important. Subtle clues such as weight gain, hypertension or hypokalemia and diabetes mellitus may prompt further hormonal analysis. Once a tumor in the adrenals is identified, hormonal and radiological evaluations according to the NIH conference guidelines need to be performed. Patients should be referred to an endocrinologist. This is especially important since recent reports suggest that up to 20% of patients with adrenal incidentaloma (which means 1–3% of all FAP patients) have some form of subtle and subclinical hormonal dysfunction resulting in an increased risk of metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease.

### An evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to the clinical considerations, management, and surveillance of adrenal lesions in familial adenomatous polyposis: report of three cases [^115tB36Q]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2006). Low credibility.

Adrenal masses are commonly discovered incidentally in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, and adrenal malignancies have been rarely reported. Individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis frequently undergo abdominal CT-scan examinations for surveillance or symptoms. Adrenal lesions often are detected unexpectedly and are thus becoming a common clinical problem in this population. Adrenal lesions encompass a heterogeneous spectrum of pathologic entities, including primary adrenocortical and medullary tumors, benign or malignant lesions, hormonally active or inactive lesions, metastases, and infections. When an adrenal mass is detected, the clinician needs to address two crucial questions: 1) is the mass malignant? and 2) is it hormonally active? This article presents three new cases of incidental adrenal lesions in familial adenomatous polyposis, reviews the medical literature for this setting, and provides an overview of the diagnostic clinical approach and management of the adrenal findings in familial adenomatous polyposis patients.

### Diagnostic performance of photon-counting detector CT for differentiation between adrenal adenomas and metastases [^114QDqAe]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidental detection of adrenal lesions has increased over the past decades due to improved imaging techniques and increasing numbers of CT scans, with an estimated prevalence of 4–8% on abdominal CT scans. Recent guidelines from the American College of Radiology provide an algorithm for the workup of incidentally detected adrenal lesions ≥ 1 cm. Depending on size, the presence of indeterminate or high-risk imaging features, and history of cancer, either a follow-up or an adrenal CT is recommended. An adrenal CT consists of a pre-contrast scan, a portal venous phase, and a late phase (15 min).

Adrenal adenomas can be differentiated from metastases by low CT values on unenhanced CT (< 10 HU) or by rapid washout between portal venous and late contrast phases (relative washout > 60%). In clinical routine, adrenal lesions are often detected on contrast-enhanced CT scans and therefore cannot be confidently identified as adenomas. In these cases, further imaging (e.g. an adrenal CT) or follow-up is recommended, resulting in additional radiation dose to the patient or a delayed clarification with the potential psychological burden respectively.

Previous studies on dual-energy CT (DECT) have addressed the value of virtual non-contrast (VNC) images for the assessment of adrenal lesions. However, most studies indicated that VNC overestimated CT values compared to true non-contrast (TNC). VNC series were therefore not recommended for routine clinical use.

In 2021, the photon-counting detector (PCD) technology was introduced. It enables the direct conversion of single X-ray photons into an electric signal, resulting in the reduction of electronic noise and the availability of broad spectral imaging with each scan. A recent study assessed the value of VNC reconstructions on a PCD-CT for the evaluation of adrenal adenomas. However, similar to previous studies, VNC showed an over- or underestimation of CT values compared to TNC.

### Radiomics in the characterization of lipid-poor adrenal adenomas at unenhanced CT: time to look beyond usual density metrics [^1127vYZU]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An adrenal incidentaloma is defined as an asymptomatic adrenal mass discovered on imaging that was not performed to investigate a suspected adrenal disease. In most cases, adrenal incidentalomas represent benign non-functioning adenomas, but they may also correspond to different conditions requiring full clinical attention and therapeutic intervention (e.g. adrenocortical carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, hormone-producing adenoma or metastasis). As a consequence of the burgeoning use of advanced diagnostic imaging in daily medical practice, in the last decades, we have observed a constantly increasing incidence rate of incidentally discovered adrenal nodules. Indeed, adrenal incidentalomas are common, estimated to occur in approximately 3 to 7% of adults.

Incidental adrenal masses represent diagnostic challenges for both radiologists and referring clinicians, particularly when the initial imaging features are equivocal or non-diagnostic. The main challenge is correctly identifying the infrequent unexpected malignant lesions (or hyperfunctioning adenomas), while sparing the vast majority of patients with clinically insignificant disease from unnecessary further examinations.

Diagnostic imaging is crucial in the classification of adrenal masses, since the precise etiology can be determined on both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for several entities without the need for further tests.

In particular, CT could aid the diagnosis of adrenal adenomas in two ways, namely density measurement and contrast washout. A density lesser than 10 HU on non-enhanced CT (NECT) is almost always diagnostic of a lipid-rich adenoma, regardless of size. By contrast, if there are no benign diagnostic imaging features (for instance, macroscopic fat, adrenal density < 10 HU), a dedicated adrenal CT protocol including a 15-min delayed acquisition after contrast media administration is advisable, in order to assess the absolute — or relative — percentage washout. However, pheochromocytomas and adrenal metastases from hypervascular primary extra-adrenal malignancies could sometimes exhibit a washout pattern similar to that of adrenal adenomas.

### Clinical review: the approach to the evaluation and management of bilateral adrenal masses [^117BMZsW]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This white paper provides practical guidance for clinicians encountering bilateral adrenal masses.

Methods

A case-based approach to the evaluation and management of bilateral adrenal masses. Specific clinical scenarios presented here include cases of bilateral adrenal adenomas, hemorrhage, pheochromocytomas, metastatic disease, myelolipomas, as well as primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia.

Results

Bilateral adrenal masses represent approximately 10% to 20% of incidentally discovered adrenal masses. The general approach to the evaluation and management of bilateral adrenal masses follows the same protocol as the evaluation of unilateral adrenal masses, determined based on the patient's clinical history and examination as well as the imaging characteristics of each lesion, whether the lesions could represent a malignancy, demonstrate hormone excess, or possibly represent a familial syndrome. Furthermore, there are features unique to bilateral adrenal masses that must be considered, including the differential diagnosis, the evaluation, and the management depending on the etiology. Therefore, considerations for the optimal imaging modality, treatment (medical vs surgical therapy), and surveillance are included. These recommendations were developed through careful examination of existing published studies as well as expert clinical opinion consensus.

Conclusion

The evaluation and management of bilateral adrenal masses require a comprehensive systematic approach which includes the assessment and interpretation of the patient's clinical history, physical examination, dynamic hormone evaluation, and imaging modalities to determine the key radiographic features of each adrenal nodule. In addition, familial syndromes should be considered. Any final treatment options and approaches should always be considered individually.

### Adrenal incidentalomas: a disease of modern technology offering opportunities for improved patient care [^1138WNqL]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Adrenal incidentalomas (AIs) are found in approximately 4% of patients undergoing abdominal imaging, with peak prevalence in the sixth and seventh decades of life. Detection of AI warrants clinical, biochemical, and radiological evaluation to establish its secretory status and risk of malignancy. Careful review of the lipid content, size, and imaging phenotype of an adrenal mass is needed to evaluate the risk for malignancy. Identification of an AI may be an opportunity to identify an underlying secretory tumor that may have been otherwise unrecognized. A practical approach to investigation and follow-up of AIs is presented in this article.

Cushing's syndrome — management after normal or abnormal initial results: "In individuals with normal test results in whom the pretest probability is high (patients with clinical features suggestive of Cushing's syndrome and adrenal incidentaloma or suspected cyclical hypercortisolism), we recommend further evaluation by an endocrinologist to confirm or exclude the diagnosis". "In other individuals with normal test results (in whom Cushing's syndrome is very unlikely), we suggest reevaluation in 6 months if signs or symptoms progress". "In individuals with at least one abnormal test result (for whom the results could be falsely positive or indicate Cushing's syndrome), we recommend further evaluation by an endocrinologist to confirm or exclude the diagnosis".
