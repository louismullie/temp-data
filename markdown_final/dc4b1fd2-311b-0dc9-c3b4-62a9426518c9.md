## Question

Pelvic inflammatory disease treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pelvic inflammatory disease treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and when to treat empirically. Then, I should verify severity and decide on outpatient versus inpatient management. Next, I will select evidence-based antibiotic regimens, including anaerobic coverage and Mycoplasma genitalium considerations. After that, I need to check special populations such as pregnancy, HIV, and IUD users. Finally, I will outline follow-up, partner management, and prevention strategies, and I will double-check areas of controversy and where the evidence is weak or evolving.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic approach and the threshold for empiric therapy, because delays increase the risk of infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. PID is a clinical diagnosis in sexually active women with pelvic or lower abdominal pain and cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness, and clinicians should maintain a low threshold for treatment even when classic signs are subtle or absent, as subclinical disease is common and consequential [^e71f0410] [^3ebd8e74] [^3763f632]. I should double-check that supportive findings like mucopurulent discharge, elevated ESR/CRP, or WBCs on wet prep increase specificity, but absence of these does not exclude PID, so I should not withhold therapy solely on that basis [^e71f0410] [^3ebd8e74].

> Wait, let me verify severity stratification because it drives site of care and regimen choice. Mild to moderate disease typically lacks systemic toxicity, tubo-ovarian abscess, or pregnancy, whereas severe disease includes high fever, marked peritoneal signs, inability to tolerate oral therapy, suspected surgical emergency, or immunocompromise; pregnancy and tubo-ovarian abscess are specific indications for hospitalization and parenteral therapy [^d885fb82] [^3ebd8e74]. I should confirm that outpatient therapy is acceptable for mild to moderate cases with reliable follow-up, and that randomized data show no long-term reproductive outcome differences between inpatient and outpatient strategies in this group [^b1384556] [^61327f50].

> Next, I should review first-line outpatient regimens and ensure I align with current guidance. The CDC recommends ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once (or 1 g if weight ≥ 150 kg) plus doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days, with the addition of metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 14 days to enhance anaerobic coverage; alternatives include cefoxitin 2 g IM with probenecid 1 g orally plus doxycycline, or moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 14 days if cephalosporins are contraindicated, though I need to ensure local gonorrhea susceptibility before choosing a fluoroquinolone [^b413679f] [^42477954]. Hold on, I should verify the rationale for metronidazole: while older meta-analyses were inconclusive, a recent randomized trial showed reduced endometrial anaerobes, less M. genitalium, and less pelvic tenderness with metronidazole added to ceftriaxone and doxycycline, supporting routine inclusion when tolerated [^3cc3240c] [^d885fb82].

> I will now examine inpatient regimens for severe disease or when hospitalization is indicated. Recommended parenteral options include ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 24 hours plus doxycycline 100 mg IV or orally every 12 hours plus metronidazole 500 mg IV or orally every 12 hours, or cefotetan 2 g IV every 12 hours plus doxycycline 100 mg IV or orally every 12 hours, or cefoxitin 2 g IV every 6 hours plus doxycycline 100 mg IV or orally every 12 hours; transition to oral therapy is appropriate after 24–48 hours of clinical improvement to complete 14 total days, with metronidazole included if a tubo-ovarian abscess is present [^58bcca46] [^07070cb5] [^02657013]. Let me reconsider the role of clindamycin plus gentamicin; it remains an alternative when beta-lactams are unsuitable, but I should confirm that local resistance patterns and patient-specific risks guide this choice [^b413679f].

> But wait, what if Mycoplasma genitalium is present, since doxycycline has limited activity and resistance is rising. I should confirm that if M. genitalium is detected or strongly suspected, moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 14 days is the preferred agent, acknowledging that routine testing for M. genitalium in PID is not currently recommended due to limited outcome data, though some experts consider targeted testing in refractory cases or high-prevalence settings [^f9be22d7] [^1db6fe31]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure that adding moxifloxazole is reserved for confirmed or highly suspected cases to avoid promoting resistance, and that I document the rationale if I deviate from standard regimens [^f9be22d7].

> I should double-check special populations, starting with pregnancy. Pregnant patients with suspected PID should be hospitalized and treated with parenteral therapy in consultation with obstetrics and infectious diseases, as maternal morbidity and preterm delivery risks are increased; standard outpatient regimens are not appropriate in this setting [^cf92774e]. For patients with HIV, I need to ensure that management is otherwise the same, recognizing higher rates of tubo-ovarian abscess but similar responses to recommended regimens; I should monitor closely for abscess formation and consider imaging if not improving [^8d3e6e0f]. For IUD users, I should confirm that the device does not need to be removed solely because of PID; treat per guidelines, reassess at 48–72 hours, and consider removal only if there is no clinical improvement or if the patient desires removal, with contraceptive counseling and emergency contraception as indicated [^05540a96] [^2e743616].

> Next, I should review follow-up and response assessment. Women should demonstrate clinical improvement within 72 hours, including defervescence and reduction in abdominal and pelvic tenderness; if there is no improvement, I need to check for misdiagnosis, nonadherence, tubo-ovarian abscess, or resistant organisms, and escalate to inpatient care and additional diagnostics, including ultrasound and consideration of laparoscopy if the diagnosis remains uncertain [^f87fe1b9] [^3ebd8e74]. I should confirm that all patients are retested for gonorrhea and chlamydia in about 3 months, as reinfection is common and increases recurrence risk, and that patients abstain from sex until therapy is complete, symptoms resolve, and partners are treated [^f87fe1b9] [^9d699c92].

> I need to ensure partner management is addressed because reinfection risk is high. Sex partners within the prior 60 days should be notified, tested, and presumptively treated for gonorrhea and chlamydia; if linkage to care is delayed, expedited partner therapy is recommended where legal, and patients should abstain from sex until both parties complete therapy [^e9663b2e] [^9d699c92]. Let me verify that this applies regardless of the specific PID pathogen isolated, as partners may be asymptomatic carriers of gonorrhea or chlamydia even when PID is due to other organisms [^e9663b2e].

> Prevention is integral, so I should confirm screening recommendations. Routine screening for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae is recommended for all sexually active women younger than 25 years and for older women at increased risk, and screening for bacterial vaginosis is not routinely indicated for PID prevention, though treating symptomatic BV may be reasonable in select contexts [^3ebd8e74] [^3763f632]. Hold on, I should verify that counseling on condom use and sexual health behaviors reduces recurrence and that structured follow-up reminders improve adherence and outcomes, especially in adolescents [^3ebd8e74] [^8a5fe52b].

> Let me consider controversies and evidence gaps so I do not overstate certainty. The necessity of routine metronidazole has been debated, but the most recent randomized data support adding metronidazole to ceftriaxone and doxycycline for acute PID to reduce anaerobes and improve short-term outcomes, which aligns with CDC's emphasis on anaerobic coverage pending further data [^3cc3240c] [^d885fb82]. Azithromycin versus doxycycline comparisons show mixed results; a low-bias study suggested azithromycin superiority in mild to moderate PID, but broader meta-analytic data are inconclusive, so I should individualize based on tolerance, adherence, and local resistance patterns while ensuring gonorrhea coverage with a cephalosporin [^ba294b9e] [^22460cf4]. Finally, I should acknowledge that many trials are small, heterogeneous, and short-term, so long-term fertility and chronic pain outcomes remain understudied and guideline recommendations reflect consensus and biological plausibility as much as head-to-head superiority data [^22460cf4] [^1ed7c963].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: diagnose clinically with a low threshold, stratify severity, select guideline-concordant regimens with anaerobic coverage, manage special populations with heightened caution, enforce partner treatment and retesting, and monitor closely for response within 72 hours. This balances the best available evidence with the imperative to prevent irreversible reproductive harm from delayed or undertreatment [^e71f0410] [^3ebd8e74] [^d885fb82].

---

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is treated with **empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics** to cover N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and anaerobes, started promptly to prevent infertility and chronic pain [^1ed7c963] [^3ebd8e74]. Outpatient therapy is appropriate for mild-to-moderate cases: **ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once** plus **doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days**, with **metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 14 days** added for anaerobic coverage [^b413679f] [^3cc3240c]. Hospitalize for severe illness, pregnancy, suspected tubo-ovarian abscess, or failure of outpatient therapy; use IV regimens such as cefotetan or cefoxitin plus doxycycline, or clindamycin plus gentamicin, then transition to oral therapy to complete 14 days [^58bcca46] [^07070cb5]. Ensure partner treatment, abstain from sex until therapy is complete, and retest for gonorrhea and chlamydia in 3 months [^e9663b2e] [^f87fe1b9].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

Hospitalization is indicated for patients with any of the following:

- **Severe illness**: High fever, nausea/vomiting, or marked leukocytosis [^d885fb82].
- **Pregnancy**: Due to risk of maternal morbidity and preterm delivery [^cf92774e].
- **Suspected tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA)**: Requires close monitoring and possible surgical intervention [^f04d5db6].
- **Failure of outpatient therapy**: No clinical improvement within 72 hours [^f87fe1b9].
- **Inability to tolerate oral therapy**: Persistent vomiting or poor adherence [^d885fb82].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

### Outpatient regimens (mild-to-moderate PID)

| **Regimen** | **Dosage and duration** |
|-|-|
| Ceftriaxone | 500 mg IM once (1 g if ≥ 150 kg) [^b413679f] |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days [^b413679f] |
| Metronidazole | 500 mg orally twice daily for 14 days [^b413679f] |

---

Alternative regimens include **cefoxitin 2 g IM once** with **probenecid 1 g orally** administered concurrently, followed by doxycycline and metronidazole as above, or **moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 14 days** with metronidazole if cephalosporins are contraindicated [^b413679f] [^42477954].

---

### Inpatient regimens (severe PID or hospitalization indicated)

- **Cefotetan 2 g IV every 12 hours** or **cefoxitin 2 g IV every 6 hours** plus **doxycycline 100 mg IV or orally every 12 hours** [^58bcca46].
- **Clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours** plus **gentamicin loading dose IV or IM** (maintenance dose every 8 hours) [^58bcca46].
- Transition to oral therapy after 24–48 hours of clinical improvement to complete 14 days total therapy [^07070cb5].

---

## Role of anaerobic coverage

Anaerobes, including **Bacteroides species**, are commonly isolated in PID and associated with tubal damage [^1ed7c963]. Metronidazole is **routinely recommended** to enhance anaerobic eradication and reduce short-term pelvic tenderness, though evidence for long-term benefit is limited [^3cc3240c] [^a8f0db26].

---

## Management of special populations

### Pregnant patients

Pregnant patients should be **hospitalized and treated with IV antimicrobials** (e.g. cefotetan or cefoxitin plus doxycycline) [^cf92774e]. Avoid **metronidazole in the first trimester** if possible; use cautiously thereafter.

---

### Patients with HIV infection

Patients with HIV infection generally receive the same regimens as those without HIV, though they have a higher risk of **tubo-ovarian abscess** and may require closer monitoring [^8d3e6e0f].

---

### Patients with intrauterine devices (IUDs)

IUDs **do not need to be removed** solely because of PID; treat and reassess in 48–72 hours. Consider removal if there is no clinical improvement or if the patient desires removal [^05540a96] [^2e743616].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Patients should demonstrate **clinical improvement within 72 hours** (defervescence, reduced tenderness) [^f87fe1b9]. If there is no improvement, reassess the diagnosis, consider hospitalization, and obtain additional diagnostics (e.g. ultrasound) [^f87fe1b9]. Retest for **gonorrhea and chlamydia** 3 months after therapy to detect reinfection [^f87fe1b9].

---

## Partner management

Partners should be **notified, tested, and presumptively treated** for gonorrhea and chlamydia if they had sexual contact within 60 days [^e9663b2e]. Use **expedited partner therapy** when available to prevent reinfection [^e9663b2e].

---

## Potential complications of untreated or inadequately treated PID

- **Infertility**: 10–20% risk after a single episode [^8e677ad6].
- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Increased risk due to tubal scarring [^3ebd8e74].
- **Chronic pelvic pain**: Occurs in approximately 40% of women [^8e677ad6].
- **Tubo-ovarian abscess**: May require surgical intervention [^f04d5db6].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **screening sexually active women < 25 years and older women at risk** for chlamydia and gonorrhea [^0e7274b3]. Promote **condom use** and provide sexual health education to reduce STI risk [^3ebd8e74].

---

PID management centers on **prompt empiric antibiotics** with gonorrhea, chlamydia, and anaerobic coverage, tailored to severity and patient factors, with close follow-up and partner management to prevent complications and recurrence [^1ed7c963].

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection that affects 4% to 12% of young women, and is one of the most common causes of morbidity in this age group. The main intervention for acute PID is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics which cover Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and anaerobic bacteria, administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally. In this review, we assessed the optimal treatment regimen for PID.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic regimens used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group's Specialized Register, which included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1944 to 2016, located through electronic searching and handsearching; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid platform (1991 to July 2016); MEDLINE (1946 to July 2016); Embase (1947 to July 2016); LILACS, iAHx interface (1982 to July 2016); World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (July 2016); Web of Science (2001 to July 2016); OpenGrey (1990, 1992, 1995, 1996, and 1997); and abstracts in selected publications.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing the use of antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics for the treatment of PID in women of reproductive age, either as inpatient or outpatient treatment. We limited our review to comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended for consideration by the 2015 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for treatment of PID.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted investigators to obtain missing information. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by consulting a fourth review author if necessary. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria, classifying it as high, moderate, low, or very low. We calculated Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RR), using either random-effects or fixed-effect models and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome or for an additional harmful outcome, with their 95% confidence interval (CI), to measure the effect of the treatments. We conducted sensitivity analyses limited to studies at low risk of bias, for comparisons where such studies were available.

Main Results

We included 37 RCTs (6348 women). The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency, and serious imprecision. Azithromycin versus doxycyclineThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two drugs in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.55, I² = 72%, 2 RCTs, 243 women, very low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05, 1 RCT, 309 women, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.34, 3 RCTs, 552 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to a single study at low risk of bias, azithromycin was superior to doxycycline in achieving cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.67, 133 women, moderate-quality evidence). Quinolone versus cephalosporinThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two drugs in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10, 3 RCTs, 459 women, I² = 5%, low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.23, 2 RCTs, 313 women, I² = 7%, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.52 to 9.72, 5 RCTs, 772 women, I² = 0%, very low-quality evidence). Nitroimidazole versus no use of nitroimidazoleThere was no conclusive evidence of a difference between the nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) group and the group receiving other drugs with activity over anaerobes (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate) in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.10, 5 RCTs, 2427 women, I² = 60%, moderate-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01, 11 RCTs, 1383 women, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.59; participants = 3788; studies = 16; I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to studies at low risk of bias, findings did not differ substantially from the main analysis (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.15, 2 RCTs, 1201 women, I² = 32%, high-quality evidence). Clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinoloneThere was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13, 1 RCT, 25 women, very low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19, 2 studies, 151 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.72, 3 RCTs, 163 women, very low-quality evidence). Clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporinThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two groups in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09, 2 RCTs, 150 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06, 10 RCTs, 959 women, I² = 21%, moderate-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.42, 10 RCTs, 1172 women, I² = 0%, very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no conclusive evidence that one regimen of antibiotics was safer or more effective than any other for the cure of PID, and there was no clear evidence for the use of nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) compared to use of other drugs with activity over anaerobes. Moderate-quality evidence from a single study at low risk of bias suggested that a macrolide (azithromycin) may be more effective than a tetracycline (doxycycline) for curing mild-moderate PID. Our review considered only the drugs that are currently used and mentioned by the CDC.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease [^4b6d93f4]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2013). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic inflammatory disease is caused by infection of the upper female genital tract and is often asymptomatic. Pelvic inflammatory disease is the most common gynaecological reason for admission to hospital in the US, and is diagnosed in approximately 1% of women aged 16 to 45 years consulting their GP in England and Wales.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: How do different antimicrobial regimens compare when treating women with confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease? What are the effects of routine antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease before intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) insertion? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up to date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 13 RCTs or systematic reviews of RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (oral, parenteral, different durations, different regimens) and routine antibiotic prophylaxis (before intrauterine device insertion in women at high risk or low risk).

### Pelvic inflammatory disease [^35eb42c9]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic inflammatory disease is caused by infection of the upper female genital tract and is often asymptomatic. Pelvic inflammatory disease is the most common gynaecological reason for admission to hospital in the USA and is diagnosed in almost 2% of women aged 16–45 years consulting their GP in England and Wales.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical treatment compared with treatment delayed until the results of microbiological investigations are known? How do different antimicrobial regimens compare? What are the effects of routine antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease before intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD)8 insertion? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 9 systematic reviews, RCTs or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (oral, parenteral, empirical treatment, treatment guided by test results, different durations, outpatient, inpatient), and routine antibiotic prophylaxis (before intrauterine device insertion in women at high risk or low risk).

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: how should it be managed? [^cc0690d8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the published literature on pelvic inflammatory disease over the past year and put into context the major findings.

Recent Findings

remains the commonest identified cause of pelvic inflammatory disease, and yet our understanding of how it causes mucosal damage and the factors explaining why only a subgroup of women develop pelvic inflammatory disease are not known. The increasing evidence for a chlamydial toxin may help to explain how tissue damage occurs and the indolent nature of many chlamydial infections. The evidence for as an important sexually transmitted cause of pelvic inflammatory disease is growing, with implications for treatment regimens and diagnostic testing. Power Doppler ultrasound has been reported to be both sensitive and specific in diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease, although larger studies are needed to confirm these early results. Outpatient treatment with cefoxitin and doxycycline appears to be as effective when given in an outpatient setting compared with inpatient management with the same agents in a large randomized controlled trial with almost 3 years' follow-up.

Summary

There remain many gaps in our knowledge of pelvic inflammatory disease, but the reviewed studies increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of infection, and offer the possibility of better diagnosis and reassurance about the long-term success of antibiotic treatment.

### Antibiotic therapy for acute pelvic inflammatory disease: the 2006 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines [^e3a95612]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a substantial cause of reproductive morbidity in young women. A systematic review of the literature related to PID management was performed in preparation for the 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines. This search was conducted using PubMed and was limited to articles written in English and published between 1 January 2002 and 31 January 2005 that were related to PID treatment. Studies were evaluated for new data on PID with regard to site, route, and timing of antimicrobial administration; regimen adherence; experience in adolescents and women > 35 years of age; coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus; and management of sex partners. Strong evidence suggests that neither site nor route of treatment administration affects the short- or long-term major outcome of women with mild or moderate clinical presentations. Data on these outcomes in women with more severe clinical presentations are inadequate to provide guidance as to the preferred agents or route of administration. Important contributions to the literature that impact the 2006 guidelines are described in this article.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: current concepts in pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^41b1d05a]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is characterized by infection and inflammation of the upper genital tract in women and can cause significant reproductive health sequelae for women. Although a definitive diagnosis of PID is made by laparoscopic visualization of inflamed, purulent fallopian tubes, PID is generally a clinical diagnosis and thus represents a diagnostic challenge. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment algorithms advise a high index of suspicion for PID in any woman of reproductive age with pelvic or abdominal pain. Antibiotic therapy should be started early, and given for an adequate period of time to reduce the risk of complications. Coverage for anaerobic organisms should be considered in most cases.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^8e677ad6]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women is described as an inflammation of the upper genital tract and surrounding structures as a result of ascending infection from the lower genital tract — bacteria spread directly from the cervix to the endometrium and on to the upper genital tract. The signs and symptoms of PID are not specific and may range from asymptomatic to abdominal pain/tenderness, fever, vomiting, dyspareunia and menorrhagia.

The incidence of PID in the UK has been estimated to range between 1.1% and 1.7% among women between 16 and 46 years old. Among women with PID, 10%–20% may become infertile, 40% will develop chronic pelvic pain, and 10% of those who conceive will have an ectopic pregnancy. The cost of pelvic infection has been estimated to exceed US$2.4 billion in the USA, and the mean total cost per episode managed as an outpatient is around US$700. In the UK, the mean cost of an uncomplicated episode of PID is £163, considering an average of two outpatient appointments per woman across all settings.

PID requires effective treatment to reduce the incidence of chronic pelvic pain, infertility and ectopic pregnancy. The main intervention for treating acute PID is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics which cover Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobic bacteria, but the optimal treatment strategy is unclear. A variety of antibiotic regimens and routes of administration (intravenous, intramuscular or oral) have been used, with marked geographical variation. Current practice generally involves the use of multiple agents to provide broad antimicrobial cover, but the best combination of agents is unknown. Guidelines have been produced in the USA, and in Europe, to guide therapy, but these have not been based on a systematic review. The authors of the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and International Union against Sexually Transmitted Infections (IUSTI) guidelines state that there is limited evidence for the need to eradicate anaerobes or for the use of alternative regimens, such as azithromycin.

The current review is an abridged version of a Cochrane systematic review and presents the main findings from the primary outcomes and an enhanced discussion section. This review addresses clinical questions raised in the current guidelines on the treatment of PIDregarding the effectiveness and safety of nitroimidazole, the relative benefits of azithromycin versus doxycycline, the use of quinolones, and the relative benefits of cephalosporins compared with clindamycin plus aminoglycoside, to inform future guideline development and clinical practice.

### Updated French guidelines for diagnosis and management of pelvic inflammatory disease [^6713e724]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is commonly encountered in clinical practice.

Objectives

To provide up-to-date guidelines on management of PID.

Search Strategy

An initial search of the Cochrane database, PubMed, and Embase was performed using keywords related to PID to identify reports in any language published between January 1990 and January 2012, with an update in May 2015.

Selection Criteria

All identified reports relevant to the areas of focus were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

A level of evidence based on the quality of the data available was applied for each area of focus and used for the guidelines.

Main Results

PID must be suspected when spontaneous pelvic pain is associated with induced adnexal or uterine pain (grade C). Pelvic ultrasonography is necessary to exclude tubo-ovarian abscess (grade B). Microbiological diagnosis requires vaginal and endocervical sampling for molecular and bacteriological analysis (grade B). First-line treatment for uncomplicated PID combines ofloxacin and metronidazole for 14days (grade B). Treatment of tubo-ovarian abscess is based on drainage if the collection measures more than 3cm (grade B), with combined ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and doxycycline for 14-21days.

Conclusions

Current management of PID requires easily reproducible investigations and treatment, and thus can be applied worldwide.

### Concerns regarding the centers for disease control's published guidelines for pelvic inflammatory disease [^1243f662]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The International-Infectious Disease Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology-USA (I-IDSOG-USA) has concerns about the most recently published Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). I-IDSOG-USA advocates the following changes when the guidelines are revised. We recommend the use of the term "upper genital tract infection" (UGTI), followed by the designation of the etiologic agent, instead of the currently employed term, "pelvic inflammatory disease", or PID. In diagnoses, there should be greater emphasis on signs and symptoms related to subclinical or occult UGTI. Therapeutic recommendation for the treatment of UGTI should be documented for various stages of this diverse disease entity. There should be greater emphasis on hospitalization for infected nulligravida teenagers. This permits monitoring of antibiotic treatment and provides a site for medical educational efforts to teach this medically underserved segment of our society how to protect their future fertility, their health, and their lives.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease [^22460cf4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) affects 4% to 12% of women of reproductive age. The main intervention for acute PID is broad-spectrum antibiotics administered intravenously, intramuscularly or orally. We assessed the optimal treatment regimen for PID. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic regimens to treat PID.

Search Methods

In January 2020, we searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group's Specialized Register, which included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1944 to 2020, located through hand and electronic searching; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; four other databases; and abstracts in selected publications.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics for the treatment of PID in women of reproductive age, either as inpatient or outpatient treatment. We limited our review to a comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended by the 2015 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for treatment of PID.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and conducted GRADE assessments of the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included 39 RCTs (6894 women) in this review, adding two new RCTs at this update. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency, and serious imprecision. None of the studies reported quinolones and cephalosporins, or the outcomes laparoscopic evidence of resolution of PID based on physician opinion or fertility outcomes. Length of stay results were insufficiently reported for analysis. Regimens containing azithromycin versus regimens containing doxycycline We are uncertain whether there was a clinically relevant difference between azithromycin and doxycycline in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.55; 2 RCTs, 243 women; I² = 72%; very low-quality evidence). The analyses may result in little or no difference between azithromycin and doxycycline in rates of severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05; 1 RCT, 309 women; low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.34; 3 RCTs, 552 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to a single study at low risk of bias, azithromycin probably improves the rates of cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.67; 133 women; moderate-quality evidence), compared to doxycycline. Regimens containing quinolone versus regimens containing cephalosporin The analysis shows there may be little or no clinically relevant difference between quinolones and cephalosporins in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.14; 4 RCTs, 772 women; I² = 15%; low-quality evidence), or severe PID (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.23; 2 RCTs, 313 women; I² = 7%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there was a difference between quinolones and cephalosporins in adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.52 to 9.72; 6 RCTs, 1085 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence). Regimens with nitroimidazole versus regimens without nitroimidazole There was probably little or no difference between regimens with or without nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09; 6 RCTs, 2660 women; I² = 50%; moderate-quality evidence), or severe PID (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01; 11 RCTs, 1383 women; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). The evidence suggests that there was little to no difference in in adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.61; 17 studies, 4021 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to studies at low risk of bias, there was little or no difference for rates of cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12; 3 RCTs, 1434 women; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence). Regimens containing clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinolone We are uncertain whether quinolone have little to no effect in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID compared to clindamycin plus aminoglycoside (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13; 1 RCT, 25 women; very low-quality evidence). The analysis may result in little or no difference between quinolone vs. clindamycin plus aminoglycoside in severe PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19; 2 studies, 151 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether quinolone reduces adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.72; 3 RCTs, 163 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence). Regimens containing clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus regimens containing cephalosporin We are uncertain whether clindamycin plus aminoglycoside improves the rates of cure for mild-moderate PID compared to cephalosporin (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09; 2 RCTs, 150 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). There was probably little or no difference in rates of cure in severe PID with clindamycin plus aminoglycoside compared to cephalosporin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; 10 RCTs, 959 women; I² = 21%; moderate-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether clindamycin plus aminoglycoside reduces adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment compared to cephalosporin (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.42; 10 RCTs, 1172 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain whether one treatment was safer or more effective than any other for the cure of mild-moderate or severe PID Based on a single study at a low risk of bias, a macrolide (azithromycin) probably improves the rates of cure of mild-moderate PID, compared to tetracycline (doxycycline).

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: new diagnostic criteria and treatment [^c22264d9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

PID is a common infection in reproductive-age women that presents an enormous public health and economic burden. It is responsible for much short- and long-term morbidity that may necessitate interventions subsequent to the original infection. Mild PID seems to be much more common than severe or "classic" PID, and the importance of early recognition and treatment cannot be understated. Current treatment regimens seem to be effective in terms of immediate clinical efficacy. As we learn more about the frequency and importance of subclinical PID, the true burden of upper genital tract infection upon reproductive age women continues to be elucidated.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: diagnosis, management, and prevention [^3ebd8e74]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper genital tract occurring predominantly in sexually active young women. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causes; however, other cervical, enteric, bacterial vaginosis-associated, and respiratory pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, may be involved. PID can be acute, chronic, or subclinical and is often underdiagnosed. Untreated PID can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and intra-abdominal infections. The diagnosis is made primarily on clinical suspicion, and empiric treatment is recommended in sexually active young women or women at risk for sexually transmitted infections who have unexplained lower abdominal or pelvic pain and cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness on examination. Mild to moderate disease can be treated in an outpatient setting with a single intramuscular injection of a recommended cephalosporin followed by oral doxycycline for 14 days. Additionally, metronidazole is recommended for 14 days in the setting of bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, or recent uterine instrumentation. Hospitalization for parenteral antibiotics is recommended in patients who are pregnant or severely ill, in whom outpatient treatment has failed, those with tubo-ovarian abscess, or if surgical emergencies cannot be excluded. Treatment does not change in patients with intrauterine devices or those with HIV. Sex partner treatment is recommended; expedited partner treatment is recommended where legal. Prevention of PID includes screening for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae in all women younger than 25 years and those who are at risk or pregnant, plus intensive behavioral counseling for all adolescents and adults at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease [^c6f01b7b]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease is a polymicrobial infection of the upper genital tract. It primarily affects young, sexually active women. The diagnosis is made clinically; no single test or study is sensitive or specific enough for a definitive diagnosis. Pelvic inflammatory disease should be suspected in at-risk patients who present with pelvic or lower abdominal pain with no identified etiology, and who have cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are the most commonly implicated microorganisms; however, other microorganisms may be involved. The spectrum of disease ranges from asymptomatic to life-threatening tubo-ovarian abscess. Patients should be treated empirically, even if they present with few symptoms. Most women can be treated successfully as outpatients with a single dose of a parenteral cephalosporin plus oral doxycycline, with or without oral metronidazole. Delay in treatment may lead to major sequelae, including chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Hospitalization and parenteral treatment are recommended if the patient is pregnant, has human immunodeficiency virus infection, does not respond to oral medication, or is severely ill. Strategies for preventing pelvic inflammatory disease include routine screening for chlamydia and patient education.

Pelvic inflammatory disease — other management considerations state that to minimize disease transmission, women should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until therapy is complete, symptoms have resolved, and sex partners have been treated; all women who receive a diagnosis of PID should be tested for gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, and syphilis; the value of testing women with PID for M. genitalium is unknown; and all contraceptive methods can be continued during treatment.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^0c66783a]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We found no evidence that one regimen is more effective or safer than any other for the treatment of PID, and there is no clear evidence that the addition of nitroimidazoles is beneficial. Adherence to clinical treatment for PID is an important issue that should be considered when choosing a treatment regimen. Moderate-quality evidence from a single study at low risk of bias suggests that a macrolide (azithromycin) may be more effective than a tetracycline (doxycycline) for curing mild-moderate PID. There remains a need for high-quality RCTs to assess treatments for women with PID, particularly comparing regimens with or without the addition of nitroimidazoles and comparing azithromycin (eg, 1 g once a week for 2 weeks) with doxycycline. The lack of a consistent outcome measure to assess response to therapy is a major limitation, and there is a clear need for core outcome measures to be developed.

Key messages

There is no clear evidence that any one of the currently recommended treatment regimens for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is superior to another.
There is no evidence of improved efficacy when metronidazole is included within a treatment regimen, although this is currently recommended in some guidelines.
There is a need for better understanding of the role of azithromycin in the treatment of PID, given uncertainty about its efficacy compared with doxycycline and concerns about inducing antimicrobial resistance.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^464ef88c]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

We used Cochrane methodology, following our published protocol.

Methods for identification of studies

We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily Update, Embase, LILACS and Web of Science up to July 2016. The complete search strategy is available in the Cochrane review. We screened the reference lists of all identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and previous systematic reviews on similar topics for additional relevant articles. Furthermore, we searched trial registers, conference proceeding abstracts and grey literature. We contacted the authors of all RCTs identified by other methods, as well as pharmaceutical companies producing 'antibiotic therapy' for 'pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)'.

Types of studies

We included RCTs, including those which did not describe their method of randomisation (ie, where the authors stated that treatment was randomised without providing further details). Trials were included irrespective of publication status, publication year or language. We excluded quasi-randomised trials because they produce effects estimates indicating more extreme benefits when compared with RCTs. We also excluded cross-over and cluster trials.

Selection of studies

Two review authors (DGF and RVD) performed an initial screen of titles and abstracts retrieved by the search, and we retrieved the full text of all potentially eligible studies. Two review authors (DGF and RVD) independently examined these studies for compliance with the inclusion criteria and selected studies that met these criteria. Disagreements regarding eligibility were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author (JR).

Inclusion criteria

RCTs were included in the review if the women participating in the trial were of reproductive age (14 years of age or older) diagnosed as having acute PID (symptoms for less than 6 weeks) based on clinical findings, laparoscopy, endometrial biopsy, or detectable N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis in the upper genital tract. We limited our review to comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended for consideration by the 2015 CDC guidelines for treatment of PID.

### Identification and treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and associated sequelae [^f04d5db6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an ascending polymicrobial infection of the upper female genital tract. The presentation of PID varies from asymptomatic cases to severe sepsis. The diagnosis of PID is often one of exclusion. Primary treatment for PID includes broad-spectrum antibiotics with coverage against gonorrhea, chlamydia, and common anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. If not clinically improved by antibiotics, percutaneous drain placement can promote efficient source control, as is often the case with large tubo-ovarian abscesses. Ultimately, even with treatment, PID can result in long-term morbidity, including chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^8bf50c15]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes were clinical cure according to the criteria defined by the treating physician (eg, resolution or improvement of signs and symptoms related to PID) and antibiotic-related adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy. For secondary outcomes, please see the full Cochrane systematic review.

Where studies included women with various types of pelvic infection, we considered only women with endometritis, salpingitis, parametritis or oophoritis (not related to labour, delivery, cancer or surgery). Where studies reported multiple time points, we included outcomes at between 14 and 28 days after initiation of treatment.

Data extraction

Data from each study were extracted independently by two of the three review authors (SF, DGF, RVD) using a data extraction form that the review authors designed and pilot-tested. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by consulting a fourth review author (JR or RFS). If a study had more than two intervention arms, we included or combined only those that met the predefined inclusion criteria. Where studies had multiple publications, we used the main trial report as the reference and derived additional details from secondary papers. We corresponded with study investigators for further data as required.

Quality of evidence

For each included trial, three review authors (SF, DGF, RVD) independently assessed the risk of bias using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane guidelines. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by involving a third review author (JR or RFS).

Two reviewers (SF, RFS) independently assessed and graded the evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by involving a third review author (JR). The GRADE tables are available in the full Cochrane review.

### Do short-term markers of treatment efficacy predict long-term sequelae of pelvic inflammatory disease? [^93bffef3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to assess whether short-term markers, often used to measure clinical cure after treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease, predict sequelae of lack of pregnancy, recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease, and chronic pelvic pain.

Study Design

Women with mild-to-moderate pelvic inflammatory disease were assessed after treatment initiation at 5 days for tenderness (n = 713) and at 30 days for tenderness, cervical infections and endometritis (n = 298). Pregnancy, recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease, and chronic pelvic pain were evaluated after 84 months, on average.

Results

Pelvic tenderness at 5 and at 30 days significantly elevated the risk for developing chronic pelvic pain; tenderness at 30 days was also significantly associated with recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease. However, pelvic tenderness at 5 and at 30 days was only modestly clinically predictive of chronic pelvic pain or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (positive predictive values 22.1–66.9%). No short-term marker significantly influenced the likelihood of achieving a pregnancy.

Conclusion

Tenderness at 5 or 30 days did not accurately predict the occurrence of pelvic inflammatory disease-related reproductive morbidities.

### Effectiveness of inpatient and outpatient treatment strategies for women with pelvic inflammatory disease: results from the pelvic inflammatory disease evaluation and clinical health (PEACH) randomized trial [^b1384556]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a common and morbid intraperitoneal infection. Although most women with pelvic inflammatory disease are treated as outpatients, the effectiveness of this strategy remains unproven.

Study Design

We enrolled 831 women with clinical signs and symptoms of mild-to-moderate pelvic inflammatory disease into a multicenter randomized clinical trial of inpatient treatment initiated by intravenous cefoxitin and doxycycline versus outpatient treatment that consisted of a single intramuscular injection of cefoxitin and oral doxycycline. Long-term outcomes were pregnancy rate, time to pregnancy, recurrence of pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancy.

Results

Short-term clinical and microbiologic improvement were similar between women randomized to the inpatient and outpatient groups. After a mean follow-up period of 35 months, pregnancy rates were nearly equal (42.0% for outpatients and 41.7% for inpatients). There were also no statistically significant differences between outpatient and inpatient groups in the outcome of time to pregnancy or in the proportion of women with pelvic inflammatory disease recurrence, chronic pelvic pain, or ectopic pregnancy.

Conclusion

Among women with mild-to-moderate pelvic inflammatory disease, there was no difference in reproductive outcomes between women randomized to inpatient treatment and those randomized to outpatient treatment.

### The challenge of pelvic inflammatory disease [^f0adfc55]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper genital tract in women that can include endometritis, parametritis, salpingitis, oophoritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and peritonitis. The spectrum of disease ranges from subclinical, asymptomatic infection to severe, life-threatening illness; sequelae include chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. PID is diagnosed clinically, with laboratory and imaging studies reserved for patients who have an uncertain diagnosis, are severely ill, or do not respond to initial therapy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria include uterine, adnexal, or cervical motion tenderness with no other obvious cause in women at risk of PID. Empiric treatment should be initiated promptly and must cover Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; the possibility of fluoroquinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae also should be considered. Hospitalization for initial parenteral therapy is necessary for patients with tubo-ovarian abscess and for those who are pregnant, severely ill, unable to follow a prescribed treatment plan, or unable to tolerate oral antibiotics. Patients also should be hospitalized if a surgical emergency cannot be excluded or if no clinical improvement occurs after three days. Routine screening for asymptomatic chlamydial infection can help prevent PID and its sequelae.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^631c56d8]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic regimens used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Design

This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Risk of bias was assessed using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane guidelines. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation.

Data Sources

Eight electronic databases were searched from date of inception up to July 2016. Database searches were complemented by screening of reference lists of relevant studies, trial registers, conference proceeding abstracts and grey literature.

Eligibility Criteria

RCTs comparing the use of antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics for the treatment of PID in women of reproductive age, either as inpatient or outpatient treatment.

Results

We included 37 RCTs (6348 women). The quality of evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency and serious imprecision. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the rates of cure for mild-moderate or for severe PID for the comparisons of azithromycin versus doxycycline, quinolone versus cephalosporin, nitroimidazole versus no use of nitroimidazole, clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinolone, or clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporin. No clear evidence of a difference between regimens in antibiotic-related adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy was observed.

Conclusions

We found no conclusive evidence that one regimen of antibiotics was safer or more effective than any other for the treatment of PID, and there was no clear evidence for the use of nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) compared with the use of other drugs with activity against anaerobes. More evidence is needed to assess treatments for women with PID, particularly comparing regimens with or without the addition of nitroimidazoles and the efficacy of azithromycin compared with doxycycline.

Finally, hospitalization rates for women of both racial groups decreased similarly over the decade, and hospitalization rates declined in all four geographic regions. B. Although correcting this situation is a high public health priority, three qualifications regarding this more sensitive diagnostic approach must be noted. A single intramuscular injection of cefoxitin or ceftriaxone, even in conjunction with oral doxycycline for 10–14 days, will provide less complete antimicrobial coverage for a shorter duration than regimens recommended for inpatients. Theoretically, outpatient management could, therefore, reduce the likelihood of successful eradication of upper-genital-tract pathogens and potentially increase the likelihood of late sequelae. PID therapy regimens are designed to provide broad-spectrum coverage of likely etiologic pathogens.

In addition to considering microbial etiology, selection criteria for a treatment regimen should also include institutional availability, cost-control efforts, patient acceptance, and regional differences in antimicrobial susceptibility. The treatment regimens that follow are recommendations, and the specific antibiotics named are examples.
2. Outpatient Management Recommended regimen Cefoxitin 2 g IM plus probenecid, 1 g orally, concurrently or ceftriaxone 250 mg IM or equivalent cephalosporin plus Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times a day for 10–14 days or Tetracycline 500 mg orally 4 times a day for 10–14 days. Alternative Regimen for Patients Who Do Not Tolerate Doxycycline/tetracycline * Substitute erythromycin 500 mg orally 4 times a day for 10–14 days. * Rationale These empiric regimens provide broad-spectrum coverage against the common etiologic agents of PID.

Notably, these regimens were particularly designed to treat persons with chlamydial and gonococcal infections; few data are available on the efficacy of these regimens for treating persons with PID, particularly nonchlamydial/nongonococcal PID. Patients who do not respond to therapy within 72 hours should be hospitalized for parenteral therapy. Doxycycline provides definitive therapy for chlamydial infections. Patients treated on an outpatient basis need to be monitored closely and reevaluated in 72 hours. E. Management of HIV-Infected Women Although the precise etiologic relation between HIV infection and the risk of PID is uncharacterized — since HIV infection is sexually transmitted and PID is often caused by sexually transmitted pathogens — these two conditions often coexist.

### Effectiveness of treatment strategies of some women with pelvic inflammatory disease: a randomized trial [^61327f50]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Among all women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), prevention of adverse reproductive consequences appears to be similarly achieved by outpatient treatment and inpatient treatment. We assessed whether outpatient is as effective as inpatient treatment in relevant age, race, and clinical subgroups of women with PID.

Methods

Women with clinical signs and symptoms of mild-to-moderate pelvic inflammatory disease (n = 831) were randomized into a multicenter trial of inpatient treatment, initially employing intravenous cefoxitin and doxycycline compared with outpatient treatment consisting of a single intramuscular injection of cefoxitin and oral doxycycline. Comparisons between treatment groups during a mean of 84 months of follow-up were made for pregnancies, live births, time to pregnancy, infertility, PID recurrence, chronic pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancy.

Results

Outpatient treatment assignment did not adversely impact the proportion of women having one or more pregnancies, live births, or ectopic pregnancies during follow-up; time to pregnancy; infertility; PID recurrence; or chronic pelvic pain among women of various races; with or without previous PID; with or without baseline Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis infection; and with or without high temperature/white blood cell count/pelvic tenderness score. This was true even in teenagers and women without a previous live birth. Ectopic pregnancies were more common in the outpatient than the inpatient treatment group, but because these were so rare, the difference did not reach statistical significance (5 versus 1, odds ratio 4.91, 95% confidence interval 0.57–42.25).

Conclusion

Among all women and subgroups of women with mild-to-moderate PID, there were no differences in reproductive outcomes after randomization to inpatient or outpatient treatment.

### Current concepts in managing pelvic inflammatory disease [^20101e12]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The management of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) has significantly changed during the last two decades. Moreover, some recent bacterial findings have led to recent changes in this management.

Recent Findings

Most cases of PID are mild-to-moderate uncomplicated forms that can be treated as outpatients. Apart from Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, other pathogens such as Mycoplasma genitalium and bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated bacteria are playing a significant role in PID and thus must be reckoned with. Moreover, gonococci have increasingly become resistant to the majority of antibiotics. This has led to a universal recommendation to treat N. gonorrhoeae infections with ceftriaxone. A few recent clinical trials have shown that quinolones and azithromycin (with metronidazole) are the best therapeutic options to treat uncomplicated PID.

Summary

The management of PID nowadays must take into account the role of pathogens such as M. genitalium, BV-associated bacteria and multiresistant gonococci.

Many women with lower genital tract infections associated with sexually transmitted pathogens have evidence of upper genital tract inflammation despite the absence of symptoms and signs traditionally associated with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). New biomarkers are needed to identify these women with clinically mild PID or subclinical PID (silent salpingitis) to facilitate initiation of early treatment and ameliorate the sequelae associated with upper genital tract infection and inflammation.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1ed7c963]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) treatment principles — PID treatment regimens should provide empiric, broad-spectrum coverage of likely pathogens, and multiple parenteral and oral antimicrobial regimens have been effective in achieving clinical and microbiologic cure in randomized clinical trials with short-term follow-up. However, only a limited number of studies have assessed and compared these regimens with regard to infection elimination in the endometrium and fallopian tubes or determined the incidence of long-term complications after antimicrobial regimens, and the optimal treatment regimen and long-term outcome of early treatment of women with subclinical PID are unknown. All regimens used to treat PID should also be effective against N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis because negative endocervical screening for these organisms does not rule out upper genital tract infection. Anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from the upper genital tract of women who have PID, some anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis can cause tubal and epithelial destruction, and BV is often present among women who have PID.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease [^cba503dd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection-caused inflammatory continuum from the cervix to the peritoneal cavity. Most importantly, it is associated with fallopian tube inflammation, which can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. The microbial etiology is linked to sexually transmitted microorganisms, including Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrheae, Mycoplasma genitalium, and bacterial vaginosis-associated microorganisms, predominantly anaerobes. Pelvic pain and fever are commonly absent in women with confirmed PID. Clinicians should consider milder symptoms such as abnormal vaginal discharge, metrorrhagia, postcoital bleeding, and urinary frequency as potential symptoms associated with the disease, particularly in women at risk of sexually transmitted infection. The diagnosis of PID is based on the findings of lower genital tract inflammation associated with pelvic organ tenderness. The outpatient treatment of mild-to-moderate PID should include tolerated antibiotic regimens with activity against the commonly isolated microorganisms associated with PID and usually consists of an extended spectrum cephalosporin in conjunction with either doxycycline or azithromycin. Clinically severe PID should prompt hospitalization and imaging to rule out a tuboovarian abscess. Parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with activity against a polymicrobial flora, particularly gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, should be implemented. Screening for and treatment of Chlamydia infection can prevent PID.

Pelvic inflammatory disease — management of sex partners advises that persons who have had sexual contact with a partner with PID during the 60 days preceding symptom onset should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for chlamydia and gonorrhea, regardless of the PID etiology or pathogens isolated; if the last sexual intercourse was > 60 days before symptom onset or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be treated; sex partners of persons who have PID caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae frequently are asymptomatic; and if linkage is delayed or unlikely, EPT is an alternative approach to treating sex partners who have chlamydial or gonococcal infection.

Discussion

Thirty-seven trials with 6348 women were included in the review. We found no clear evidence of a difference between any of the regimens studied in terms of effectiveness or safety. Within a sensitivity analysis of cases of mild-moderate PID for the comparison of macrolide (azithromycin) versus tetracycline (doxycycline), we identified a single study at low risk of bias which provided moderate-quality evidence that azithromycin was superior to doxycycline in achieving clinical cure. Some guidelines have recommended the use of nitroimidazoles for PID, but we found no conclusive evidence of a difference in outcomes between the use or not of nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) in successfully treating PID. There was also no clear evidence of a difference in rates of adverse effects between the regimens.

The applicability of the evidence to the target population (women of reproductive age diagnosed with PID) was broad because the included trials were conducted in different clinical settings and implemented varying diagnostic approaches. Additionally, the interventions analysed in the review are currently available and represent the most frequently used treatment regimens in current clinical practice. Given these factors, we consider that the evidence identified applies to a wide range of women with PID varying in disease severity, age, geographical location and diagnostic criteria, which provides external validity.

The trials included in this review cover a period of approximately 30 years and several countries, with 7 out of 37 studies being conducted after the year 2000. The searches for this review were last updated in July 2016 and new evidence may now be available. Considering the availability of additional studies, an update of this review is expected to take place in 2020. Little data are available on temporal variation in bacterial causes of PID because few countries systematically collect this information. Wide variations in the bacterial aetiology of PID may occur in different geographical areas and these may affect the choice of treatment, but few trials were carried out in low-income/middle-income countries. Although we consider that the results of this review are generalisable to a wide range of geographical locations, our conclusions may not be generalisable to low-income/middle-income countries.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^e71f0410]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) diagnosis and empiric treatment — Presumptive treatment for PID should be initiated for sexually active young women and other women at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for the illness other than PID can be identified, or if one or more of the following three minimum clinical criteria are present on pelvic examination: cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness. Requiring that all three minimum criteria be present before the initiation of empiric treatment can result in insufficient sensitivity for a PID diagnosis, and after deciding whether to initiate empiric treatment, clinicians should also consider the risk profile for STIs. In addition to one of the three minimum criteria, one or more additional criteria can be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical criteria and support a PID diagnosis, including oral temperature > 38.3°C (> 101°F), abnormal cervical mucopurulent discharge or cervical friability, presence of abundant numbers of white blood cells (WBCs) on saline microscopy of vaginal fluid, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, elevated C-reactive protein, and laboratory documentation of cervical infection with N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis. The majority of women with PID have either mucopurulent cervical discharge or evidence of WBCs on a wet prep, and if the cervical discharge appears normal and no WBCs are observed on the wet prep of vaginal fluid, a PID diagnosis is unlikely, and alternative causes of pain should be considered; a wet prep of vaginal fluid also can detect the presence of concomitant infections such as bacterial vaginosis (BV) or trichomoniasis. Because of the difficulty of diagnosis and of the potential for damage to the reproductive health of women, health care providers should maintain a low threshold for the clinical diagnosis of PID, and more elaborate diagnostic evaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis and management of PID might cause unnecessary morbidity.

Data synthesis and analysis

Data analyses were performed using Review Manager V.5.3. A fixed-effect meta-analysis was used for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that trials were estimating the same underlying treatment effect (ie, where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials' populations and methods were sufficiently similar). We conducted separate analyses for mild-moderate and severe PID based on the CDC criteria. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected (I 2 = 40% or greater), a random-effects meta-analysis was planned to produce an overall summary if a mean treatment effect across trials was considered to be clinically meaningful. For random-effects analyses, the results are presented as the mean treatment effect with 95% CIs, and the estimates of the tau 2 and I 2 statistics.

For dichotomous data, the number of events in the control and intervention groups was used to calculate the Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RR). For the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial (NNTB) or harmful (NNTH) outcome, the recommendations given by Altman were followed. When we observed a treatment effect, we reported the NNTH or NNTB with 95% CIs. NNTB and NNTH are presented in the GRADE tables in the full Cochrane review. When possible, we performed analysis based on intention to treat (ITT). When information for an ITT analysis was not available, we used the results provided by the authors.

We undertook the following sensitivity analysis to investigate whether our conclusions were robust to methodological decisions made by the review authors:

### Pelvic inflammatory disease in a pediatric emergency department: epidemiology and treatment [^3950feb9]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Most adolescent cases of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) are diagnosed in the emergency department (ED). An important step to prevent PID-related morbidity among this high-risk population is to quantify prevalence and microbial patterns and identify testing and treatment gaps.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional study of all visits by adolescents to an urban children's ED with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis of PID in 2012. We used standard descriptive statistics to quantify PID diagnoses, sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing, and treatment.

Results

Pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed in more than 9% of women with a chief complaint of abdominal/pelvic pain. Most diagnosed cases underwent some STI testing, and 40% tested positive. Seventy percent of cases received antibiotics recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Conclusions

There is a high prevalence of PID among adolescents in the pediatric ED. Rates of STI testing and appropriate treatment reveal gaps in diagnosis and management, representing a lost opportunity for identification and treatment of PID/STIs among high-risk adolescents.

### Newest approaches to treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease: a review of recent randomized clinical trials [^0dddb4ff]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) should provide high rates of clinical and microbiological cure for a range of pathogens and should ultimately prevent reproductive morbidity. Between 1992 and 2006, 5 randomized clinical trials of moxifloxacin (1 trial), ofloxacin (1 trial), clindamycin-ciprofloxacin (1 trial), and azithromycin (2 trials) treatment among women with mild to moderate PID were found to have clinical cure rates of 90%-97%. Trials of ofloxacin and clindamycin-ciprofloxacin reported rates of cure of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infection of 100%, although microbiological cure data for other pathogens were not presented. One azithromycin trial reported a 98% eradication of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma hominis, and anaerobes. Moxifloxacin exhibited high eradication rates for N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, M. hominis, Mycobacterium genitalium, and gram-negative anaerobes. Clinical cure rates from 2 doxycycline-metronidazole trials were low (35% and 55%). Although a handful of studies have shown that monotherapies for PID achieve high rates of clinical cure, the efficacy of these regimens in treating anaerobic PID and in preventing adverse reproductive sequelae is not fully elucidated.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease in the adolescent: understanding diagnosis and treatment as a health care provider [^0ef43ac3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a common clinical syndrome with highest rates in adolescents, but no studies have singularly focused on this population in relationship to established guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. The study objective was to assess knowledge of diagnosis and treatment criteria for PID within an adolescent population and to compare factors associated with adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines in outpatient settings.

Methods

Data were collected as part of a retrospective chart review of evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of sexually transmitted infections in adolescent women in an outpatient setting. Participant charts were eligible for review if they were 12 to 21 years of age and were given an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision/chart diagnosis of PID. Two primary outcome variables were utilized: meeting PID diagnosis guidelines (no/yes) and correct treatment for subject meeting criteria with guidelines (no/yes). The study controlled for race, age, medical venue, and current/past infection with gonorrhea/chlamydia.

Results

Subjects (n = 150) were examined for the primary outcome variables; 78% (117/150) met at least 1 criterion for PID diagnosis. Nearly 75% (111/150) had cervical motion tenderness, 34% (51/150) adnexal tenderness, and 5% (7/150) had uterine tenderness; nearly 11% (16/150) were positive for all 3 criteria. Symptoms associated with PID were compared for subjects meeting diagnosis criteria versus subjects not meeting diagnosis criteria: abdominal pain and vomiting were significantly associated with PID diagnosis at P < 0.05.

Conclusions

Our findings show that PID diagnosis/treatment often does not follow guidelines in the adolescent population. Pelvic inflammatory disease and cervicitis appear to be confused by providers in the diagnosis process, and educational tools may be necessary to increase the knowledge base of practitioners in regard to PID.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^3763f632]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) — etiology, prevention, and diagnosis: Sexually transmitted organisms, especially Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, often are implicated, yet among women diagnosed with acute PID approximately 50% have a positive test for either organism as the proportion attributable to them is decreasing. Data indicate that Mycoplasma genitalium might have a role in PID pathogenesis and might be associated with milder symptoms, although one study failed to demonstrate a substantial increase in PID after detection of M. genitalium in the lower genital tract. Screening and treating sexually active women for chlamydia and gonorrhea reduces their risk for PID, whereas whether PID incidence is reduced by identifying and treating women with bacterial vaginosis is unclear and whether screening women for M. genitalium reduces PID is unknown. Diagnostic accuracy is limited because acute PID is difficult to diagnose and women often have subtle or nonspecific symptoms or are asymptomatic; a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic PID has a positive predictive value for salpingitis of 65%–90% compared with laparoscopy, and the positive predictive value depends on the epidemiologic characteristics of the population.

Differences between the Cochrane review and the current review

The current review is an abridged version of a Cochrane systematic review and presents the main findings and an enhanced discussion section. The secondary outcomes presented in the Cochrane review were microbiological clearance of C. trachomatis, microbiological clearance of N. gonorrhoeae, laparoscopic evidence of resolution of PID based on physician opinion, length of stay (for inpatient care) and rate of fertility. The results were similar for studies that reported microbiological clearance of C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae, with clearance occurring in over 90% of women irrespective of regimen used. Length of stay varied across the studies, ranging from 3 days to 18 days. No data were found for laparoscopic evidence of resolution of PID and for rate of fertility.

### Improving adolescent pelvic inflammatory disease follow-up from the emergency department: randomized controlled trial with text messages [^8a5fe52b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend follow-up within 72 hours of diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease because patients with inadequate treatment are at increased risk of acute and chronic complications. Follow-up rates in adolescents after diagnosis range between 10% and 16%. The primary objective is to assess the effect of text message reminders to adolescent patients receiving a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease on obtaining follow-up care within 72 hours of emergency department (ED) discharge.

Methods

This was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial of adolescents receiving a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease in the ED. Patients received standard discharge instructions or standard discharge instructions plus text message reminders. Patients in the text message group received daily, tailored text messages for 4 days, with a reminder to schedule and attend primary care provider follow-up. The primary outcome was follow-up within 72 hours of ED discharge.

Results

Ninety-five patients (48 standard; 47 text message) were randomized. Three patients were excluded, leaving 92 patients (46 standard; 46 text message) for analysis. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. Follow-up was 15.2% in the standard group and 43.5% in the text message group. Patients receiving text message reminders were more likely to follow up compared with the standard group (relative risk 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 5.7). The absolute efficacy difference was 28.3% (95% CI 9.5% to 46.9%), yielding number needed to treat of 4 (95% CI 2.2 to 9.5).

Conclusion

Personalized text message reminders were efficacious in improving follow-up for adolescents after ED diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^a8f0db26]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Anaerobic bacteria are commonly identified in the fallopian tubes of women with PID, and most treatment guidelines include metronidazole to provide adequate microbiological cover. On meta-analysis we found that the addition of a nitroimidazole (metronidazole) did not improve short-term clinical outcomes of either mild-to-moderate or severe PID, which suggests that the other components of treatment regimens may be adequate. This is potentially important since nitroimidazoles commonly cause gastrointestinal side effects and may limit adherence to therapy. Nevertheless, some studies used antimicrobials with anaerobic cover, such as amoxicillin+clavulanate. The only study, in this systematic review, that did not use any antibiotic with anaerobic coverage found that women who did not receive nitroimidazole were more likely to experience clinical cure than those who received nitroimidazole. Of note, the study conducted by Burchell et al had a small sample size and lacked information to assess risk of bias. We were not able to assess long-term outcomes such as infertility or chronic pelvic pain, and it remains uncertain whether the use of nitroimidazoles affects the risk of these sequelae.

One previous meta-analysis, published in 1993, formed the basis for the CDC guidelines. The authors reported pooled clinical cure rates ranging from 75% to 94%, which is similar to our updated review with overall rate of cure of 81%. The uncertainty in using nitroimidazoles when treating PID is reflected in the current guidelines. The 2015 US CDC PID guidelineadvises that metronidazole be considered to provide additional anaerobic cover but does not mandate its use. The 2017 European IUSTI PID guidelineand the 2018 BASHH PID guidelinerecommend the use of metronidazole but advise that it can be discontinued in those with mild to moderate symptoms if they develop drug-related side effects. Our analysis does not support the routine use of metronidazole in the treatment of women with mild to moderate PID and can be used to inform future guideline revisions.

An important limitation of this systematic review was the potential for measurement bias introduced by using the investigators' definitions of cure. This approach was necessary because of the wide variation in methods used and lack of a widely accepted objective outcome measure. The short-term follow-up in most studies prevented the identification of long-term sequelae. In addition, the inaccuracy of clinical diagnosis for PID and the wide variety of assessment criteria used for clinical cure may have reduced the power of the analysis to detect a clinically relevant effect. Some studies identified PID and endometritis separately, but these were pooled for our analysis. Data were lacking for several of our secondary outcomes. None of the included studies reported data on fertility or laparoscopic evidence of PID resolution, and data were very scant on length of hospital stay.

Microbiological clearance of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae and clinical resolution of symptoms are the usual outcomes used in clinical practice and the current review reflects this. The utility of other biological markers (eg, mediators of inflammation, 'new' bacteria) is being explored, but their use as outcome measures is not yet established even in a research setting. Bacterial sequencing and 16S ribosomal RNA are also experimental, and their role in the diagnosis, or as prognostic markers, remains uncertain.

Increasing resistance in N. gonorrhoeae has implications for the treatment of gonococcal PID and strongly suggests that only parenteral third-generation cephalosporins should be used in this situation, but this accounts for a very small proportion of PID overall. Studies have demonstrated that women with PID are often coinfected with other micro-organisms such as Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis, C. trachomatis and anaerobes. There is increasing recognition that M. genitalium is an important cause of PID, although only in a minority of women. However, few published studies (and no RCTs) have addressed this. The utility of azithromycin as empirical treatment for M. genitalium is limited by increasing rates of resistance, and treatment with moxifloxacin is currently recommended for this group of patients. T. vaginalis has been associated with endometritis, but its role in PID remains uncertain. Bacterial vaginosis is not commonly associated with PID in prospective studies, although subgroups of women with bacterial vaginosis may be at higher risk, especially if coinfected with N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis.

### ZY5301 tablet vs placebo for treatment of chronic pelvic pain after pelvic inflammatory disease: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^36ac20a6]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a common reproductive health condition among women of reproductive age. It refers to the infection-induced inflammation of the upper female genital tract and includes any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvic peritonitis. In the US, approximately 1 million women experience PID annually, and approximately 2.5 million women of reproductive age have had a PID diagnosis.

Improper or inadequate treatment may increase the risk of serious potential sequelae of PID. Between 10% and 20% of women with PID are subsequently infertile, and 40% develop chronic pelvic pain (CPP). The Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Evaluation and Clinical Health study showed that nearly one-third of women with PID developed CPP after 3 years of follow-up and that more than one-half experienced highly intense pain. In addition to bodily pain, women with CPP concurrently experience reductions in physical function, general health, vitality, social functioning, and mental health.

The management of CPP is difficult as no established treatments are available. Chronic pelvic pain is not associated with an infectious inflammation; thus, it is not sensitive to antibiotic treatment. Finite evidence has supported the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, for CPP, while evidence-based therapy still remains limited.

Ajuga decumbens Thunb. (jingucao) is a medicinal plant native to China that is popularly used to treat chronic pelvic inflammation and hysteromyoma. Its main bioactive components are iridoid glycosides, such as 8-O-acetylharpagide and harpagide, which have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activities. Jincaopian (ZY5301) is an effective part preparation extracted from A decumbens Thunb. which is rich in iridoid glycosides. Pharmacologic studies have shown that ZY5301 can significantly inhibit the increase in uterine swelling caused by chronic PID in rats and significantly inhibits pathologic changes, such as endometrial glandular epithelial hyperplasia, thickening, and inflammatory infiltration (Jianrong Li, PhD, unpublished data, 2012). In pharmacokinetics studies in rats, results showed that the iridoid glycosides were quickly absorbed orally in a dose-dependent manner.

### Toward improving the diagnosis and the treatment of adolescent pelvic inflammatory disease in emergency departments: results of a brief, educational intervention [^d658aea5]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the utility of an abbreviated teaching tool (ATT) in improving emergency medicine pediatricians' knowledge of the diagnosis and the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Methods

An 18-question internet-based survey, which included questions about the diagnosis and the treatment of PID, was administered to members of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Emergency Medicine. Participants were randomized to receive either a weblink to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted disease treatment guidelines (weblink group) or a 1-page ATT that summarized the CDC guidelines (ATT group) to assist with completion of the survey. We compared the accuracy of responses between the 2 groups.

Results

Two hundred thirty-seven subjects responded to the survey (109 from the weblink group and 128 from ATT group). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to sex, geographic location, practice setting, years of experience, or reported frequency of recent PID diagnoses. Ninety-seven percent of the ATT group correctly identified the appropriate antibiotic regimen in compliance with the CDC guidelines compared with 61% of the weblink group (OR, 19.4; 95% confidence interval, 6.6–76.9); the ATT group was also more likely to correctly identify appropriate treatment options overall (OR, 9.6; 95% confidence interval, 4.9–19.3).

Conclusions

Although the overall PID knowledge in our sample was low, the physicians with access to a 1-page teaching tool summarizing the CDC treatment recommendations for PID performed significantly better when asked questions involving PID treatment as compared with providers with access to the CDC Web site. Further studies should investigate whether access to a similar tool can improve patient care.

Clinical cure in severe PID

One trial compared azithromycin versus doxycycline in severe PID. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the rates of cure between regimens using azithromycin or doxycycline to treat severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05; 309 women, 1 study; low-quality evidence).

Two studies compared quinolones versus cephalosporins, with no clear evidence of a difference in the rates of cure between regimens (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.23; 313 women, 2 studies; I² = 7%; low-quality evidence).

Eleven studies evaluated nitroimidazole in severe PID, and all studies used metronidazole. The difference in clinical cure rates between women treated with metronidazole and women not treated with it was small and was compatible with no effect (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01; 1383 women, 11 trials; I² = 3%; moderate-quality evidence; figure 3).

Two studies compared clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinolone in severe PID. There was no clear evidence of a difference between these regimens in the rates of cure for severe PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19; 151 women, 2 studies; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence).

The use of clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporin in severe PID was evaluated in 10 studies. There was no clear evidence of a difference between these regimens in the rates of cure of severe PID (moderate-quality evidence; figure 4).

Pelvic infection presents a serious problem for the practicing physician and the radiologist who is called to determine the origin and extent of the inflammatory process. Pelvic infection may mimic clinically other pelvic inflammatory processes and imaging based on the various aspects of it may provide information to distinguish pelvic infection from other pelvic pathological conditions. This article reviews the various imaging modalities involved in the radiological management of pelvic infection, as well as their findings, with special attention to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Clinical cure in mild-moderate PID

Two trials compared azithromycin versus doxycycline in mild-moderate PID. There was no clear evidence of a difference between azithromycin and doxycycline regimens (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.55; 243 women, 2 studies; I² = 72%; very low-quality evidence). Sensitivity analysis limited to the study at low risk of bias indicated that azithromycin was superior to doxycycline in achieving cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.67; 133 women, 1 study; moderate-quality evidence).

Three studies compared quinolones versus cephalosporins. There was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10; 459 women, 3 studies; I² = 5%; low-quality evidence).

Clinical cure in mild-moderate PID was evaluated in five studies comparing nitroimidazoles versus no nitroimidazoles. In all the studies the nitroimidazole used was metronidazole. There was no conclusive evidence of a difference in effectiveness between metronidazole versus no use of metronidazole in mild-moderate PID (moderate-quality evidence; figure 2). Sensitivity analysis restricted to the two studies at low risk of bias did not substantially change the main findings (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.15; 1201 women, 2 studies; I² = 32%; high-quality evidence).

### Clinical predictors of endometritis in women with symptoms and signs of pelvic inflammatory disease [^2a5c4bb5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Careful detection and treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease are essential for the prevention of adverse sequelae. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic test characteristics of clinical criteria for the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease.

Study Design

We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline characteristics of 651 patients enrolled in a multicenter randomized treatment trial for pelvic inflammatory disease. Clinical and laboratory findings were recorded for all patients, and endometrial sampling was performed. We calculated sensitivity and specificity and performed receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and multivariate logistic regression, using histologic endometritis as the criterion standard.

Results

The minimal criteria for pelvic inflammatory disease, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had a sensitivity of 83%, in comparison with a 95% sensitivity for adnexal tenderness (P = 0.001). Of the supportive clinical criteria, the finding most highly associated with endometritis was a positive test result for Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (adjusted odds ratio, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.89–6.63). A multivariate logistic regression model indicated that combinations of criteria significantly improve the prediction of endometritis.

Conclusion

Sensitivity can be maximized by using the presence of adnexal tenderness as a minimal criterion for the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease, and supportive criteria are helpful in estimating the probability of endometritis.

### Randomised controlled trial of screening for Chlamydia trachomatis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease: the POPI (prevention of pelvic infection) trial [^8807f3e3]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The risk of clinical pelvic inflammatory disease over 12 months in women screened for C trachomatis was non-significantly reduced by 35%. The overall incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease was, however, low (1.6%). In 137 women with chlamydial infection at baseline, 9.5% in the deferred screening control group developed pelvic inflammatory disease compared with only 1.6% in the screened group. Over 90% (67/74) of control women with chlamydial infection at baseline did not develop clinical pelvic inflammatory disease; and most cases (79%, 30/38) of pelvic inflammatory disease, including 10 cases of chlamydia positive pelvic inflammatory disease, occurred in women who were negative for chlamydia at baseline, suggesting these were incident infections.

Strengths and limitations of the study

This is the first trial of chlamydia screening to obtain samples for delayed chlamydia testing from the control women. Analysis of these samples enabled us to provide novel data on the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease in untreated women positive for chlamydia in the community, which can now be used for modelling and cost effectiveness studies. Secondly, this is the first UK study to provide prospective data on the overall risk of clinical pelvic inflammatory disease in a large cohort of sexually active young women in the community. Thirdly, this is the most robust trial to date. Randomisation was done blind and after recruitmentand the main outcome was assessed blind. The 94% follow-up was a major achievement in this young, mobile, mainly inner city population, requiring repeated telephone calls and emails. We also obtained data on independent chlamydia testing and treatment in both groups. Participants came from a wide range of backgrounds and included 1124 sexually active teenagers of whom 46% came from ethnic minorities. As in the English national chlamydia screening programme, we used self taken samples and routine management of infected women. Vaginal swabs are more sensitive than urine samples for the detection of chlamydia.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) — anaerobic coverage, early initiation, and hospitalization criteria: Addition of metronidazole to intramuscular (IM) or oral PID regimens more effectively eradicates anaerobes, and until non-anaerobic regimens are proven equivalent, using regimens with anaerobic activity should be considered; treatment should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. For women with mild or moderate clinical severity, parenteral and oral regimens appear to have similar efficacy. Hospitalization should be based on provider judgment and whether any of the following are present: Surgical emergencies (e.g., appendicitis) cannot be excluded; Tubo-ovarian abscess; Pregnancy; Severe illness, nausea and vomiting, or oral temperature > 38.5°C (101°F); Unable to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regimen; No clinical response to oral antimicrobial therapy.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^d0642289]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Quality of the evidence

Most of the 37 included studies had unclear or high risk of bias in most domains, and only three were at low risk of bias in most domains. The overall quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency and serious imprecision. The only high-quality evidence was for the sensitivity analysis regarding the use (or not) of nitroimidazole. There was moderate-quality evidence in the sensitivity analysis regarding the use of azithromycin in mild-moderate cases of PID, in comparisons between the use or not of nitroimidazole for curing mild-moderate or severe PID, and in comparisons between clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporins for curing severe PID.

### Results of a randomized controlled trial of a brief behavioral intervention for pelvic inflammatory disease in adolescents [^a61b15ae]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this research was to examine the effectiveness of a brief behavioral intervention, provided at the time of diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease, on subsequent behaviors by patients who were urban adolescents in a community in which sexually transmitted infection was prevalent.

Methods

121 adolescents aged 15 to 21 years with mild to moderate pelvic inflammatory disease were enrolled in a randomized trial. All participants received standardized care, completed baseline audio computerized self-interviews, received full courses of medication at discharge, and were interviewed after the 2-week treatment course. The intervention group also watched a 6-minute intervention video.

Main Outcome Measures

Medication completion, temporary sexual abstinence during the 14-day treatment period, partner notification, partner treatment, and return for 72-hour follow-up were studied. Data were evaluated using multivariate regression analysis.

Results

Of the participants, 61% were located and could participate in the 2-week interview by the disease intervention specialist. The intervention participants had higher rates of 72-hour follow-up (32% vs. 16%) and partner treatment (71% vs. 53%) in bivariate analyses at a P = 0.1 level. There were no differences in medication completion (66% vs. 66%), sexual abstinence (78% vs. 89%), or partner notification (88% vs. 92%). Only the partner-treatment finding persisted in multivariate models (AOR = 3.10; 95% CI, 1.03–9.39, P = 0.045).

Conclusions

Adolescent girls randomized to a community-specific video intervention at diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease were three times more likely to have their partners treated than those in the control group. Given the value of partner treatment in secondary prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, this video may be an essential component of discharge programming in urgent care settings. Additional structural supports may be necessary to facilitate improved adherence to other key adherence behaviors.

### Randomised controlled trial of screening for Chlamydia trachomatis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease: the POPI (prevention of pelvic infection) trial [^e7b94134]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether screening and treating women for chlamydial infection reduces the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease over the subsequent 12 months.

Design Randomised controlled trial.

Setting Common rooms, lecture theatres, and student bars at universities and further education colleges in London.

Participants 2529 sexually active female students, mean age 21 years (range 16–27).

Intervention Participants completed a questionnaire and provided self taken vaginal swabs, with follow-up after one year. Samples were randomly allocated to immediate testing and treatment for chlamydial infection, or storage and analysis after a year (deferred screening controls).

Main outcome measure Incidence of clinical pelvic inflammatory disease over 12 months.

Results Baseline prevalence of chlamydia was 5.4% (68/1254) in screened women and 5.9% (75/1265) in controls. 94% (2377/2529) of women were followed up after 12 months. The incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease was 1.3% (15/1191) in screened women compared with 1.9% (23/1186) in controls (relative risk 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 1.22). Seven of 74 control women (9.5%, 95% confidence interval 4.7% to 18.3%) who tested positive for chlamydial infection at baseline developed pelvic inflammatory disease over 12 months compared with one of 63 (1.6%) screened women (relative risk 0.17, 0.03 to 1.01). However, most episodes of pelvic inflammatory disease occurred in women who tested negative for chlamydia at baseline (79%, 30/38). 22% (527/2377) of women reported being tested independently for chlamydia during the trial.

Conclusion Although some evidence suggests that screening for chlamydia reduces rates of pelvic inflammatory disease, especially in women with chlamydial infection at baseline, the effectiveness of a single chlamydia test in preventing pelvic inflammatory disease over 12 months may have been overestimated.

Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00115388.

### A randomized controlled trial of ceftriaxone and doxycycline, with or without metronidazole, for the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease [^3cc3240c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anaerobic organisms are important pathogens in acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The currently recommended PID regimen of a single dose of ceftriaxone and doxycycline for 14 days has limited anaerobic activity. The need for broader anaerobic coverage is unknown and concerns have been raised about metronidazole tolerability.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscular single dose and doxycycline for 14 days, with or without 14 days of metronidazole in women with acute PID. The primary outcome was clinical improvement at 3 days following enrollment. Additional outcomes at 30 days following treatment were the presence of anaerobic organisms in the endometrium, clinical cure (absence of fever and reduction in tenderness), adherence, and tolerability.

Results

We enrolled 233 women (116 to metronidazole and 117 to placebo). Clinical improvement at 3 days was similar between the 2 groups. At 30 days following treatment, anaerobic organisms were less frequently recovered from the endometrium in women treated with metronidazole than placebo (8% vs 21%, P < .05) and cervical Mycoplasma genitalium was reduced (4% vs 14%, P < .05). Pelvic tenderness was also less common among women receiving metronidazole (9% vs 20%, P < .05). Adverse events and adherence were similar in each treatment group.

Conclusions

In women treated for acute PID, the addition of metronidazole to ceftriaxone and doxycycline was well tolerated and resulted in reduced endometrial anaerobes, decreased M. genitalium, and reduced pelvic tenderness compared to ceftriaxone and doxycycline. Metronidazole should be routinely added to ceftriaxone and doxycycline for the treatment of women with acute PID.

Intrauterine devices (IUDs) and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) — risk and management: The risk for PID associated with IUD use is primarily confined to the first 3 weeks after insertion; if an IUD user receives a diagnosis of PID, the IUD does not need to be removed, the woman should receive treatment according to these recommendations and should have close clinical follow-up, and if no clinical improvement occurs within 48–72 hours of initiating treatment, providers should consider removing the IUD; a systematic review demonstrated that treatment outcomes did not differ between women with PID who retained the IUD and those who had the IUD removed, with studies primarily including copper-containing or other nonhormonal IUDs and no studies available regarding treatment outcomes among women using levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs.

### Failure of cefoxitin and doxycycline to eradicate endometrial Mycoplasma genitalium and the consequence for clinical cure of pelvic inflammatory disease [^a80ef52e]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

Recommended PID treatment regimens are based on clinical trial data demonstrating overall high rates of clinical cure. PID is well recognised though as having a polymicrobial aetiology, and not all microbial infections may respond equally well to the same antimicrobial. In our study of women with clinically suspected PID, we found M genitalium to be associated with endometritis and short-term PID treatment failure, as evidenced by persistent endometritis and continued pelvic pain. We conclude that cefoxitin and doxycycline, a Center for Disease Control recommended PID treatment regimen, is ineffective for the treatment of M genitalium upper genital tract infection.

Use of alternate or additional antimicrobial therapy should also be considered. Third, use of even these minimum clinical criteria may exclude some women with PID. Clinicians should not withhold therapy from a woman in whom they suspect PID because of failure to meet these criteria. VII. TREATMENT management. Practitioners should explain to women the nature of their disease and should encourage them to comply with therapy and prevention recommendations. A single intramuscular injection of cefoxitin or ceftriaxone, even in conjunction with oral doxycycline for 10–14 days, will provide less complete antimicrobial coverage for a shorter duration than regimens recommended for inpatients. Theoretically, outpatient management could, therefore, reduce the likelihood of successful eradication of upper-genital-tract pathogens and potentially increase the likelihood of late sequelae. PID therapy regimens are designed to provide broad-spectrum coverage of likely etiologic pathogens.

In addition to considering microbial etiology, selection criteria for a treatment regimen should also include institutional availability, cost-control efforts, patient acceptance, and regional differences in antimicrobial susceptibility. The treatment regimens that follow are recommendations, and the specific antibiotics named are examples. Each of these regimens provides broad coverage against polymicrobial infection and has been shown in numerous studies to be highly effective in achieving clinical cures. However, data are lacking on the efficacy of these regimens, as well as other regimens, in preventing late sequelae. Cefotetan has properties similar to those of cefoxitin and requires less frequent dosing.
2. Outpatient Management Recommended regimen Cefoxitin 2 g IM plus probenecid, 1 g orally, concurrently or ceftriaxone 250 mg IM or equivalent cephalosporin plus Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times a day for 10–14 days or Tetracycline 500 mg orally 4 times a day for 10–14 days.

Alternative Regimen for Patients Who Do Not Tolerate Doxycycline/tetracycline * Substitute erythromycin 500 mg orally 4 times a day for 10–14 days. * Rationale These empiric regimens provide broad-spectrum coverage against the common etiologic agents of PID. Notably, these regimens were particularly designed to treat persons with chlamydial and gonococcal infections; few data are available on the efficacy of these regimens for treating persons with PID, particularly nonchlamydial/nongonococcal PID.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) — oral administration and completion of therapy: Because of the pain associated with intravenous (IV) infusion, doxycycline should be administered orally when possible. Oral and IV administration of doxycycline and metronidazole provide similar bioavailability, and oral metronidazole is well absorbed and can be considered instead of IV for women without severe illness or tubo-ovarian abscess when possible. After clinical improvement with parenteral therapy, transition to oral therapy with doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day and metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day is recommended to complete 14 days of antimicrobial therapy.

### Efficacy of a technology-enhanced community health nursing intervention vs standard of care for female adolescents and young adults with pelvic inflammatory disease: a randomized clinical trial [^bb69bb26]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Study Procedures

At baseline, participants completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview and were randomized to intervention and standard of care control groups based on a computer-generated block randomization sequence that was generated by the study's data analyst (S.C.) and sealed in an envelope until sequential enrollment. Although PID is a polymicrobial illness, the hallmark of assessment and treatment of patients is based on the effective treatment of N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis as commonly known pathogens. All participants provided self- or practitioner-collected vaginal swabs to test for STIs, including N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis infections, and received a full course of medications per the CDC STI treatment guidelines, that were dispensed through their practitioner with routine discharge instructions. All patients received a single intramuscular injection of 250 mg of ceftriaxone per their routine clinical care and received twenty-eight 100-mg doxycycline tablets to take 1 tablet orally twice daily for 14 days. Other medications were available when practitioners requested them (eg, 500 mg of metronidazole twice daily for 14 days) to dispense at discharge with doxycycline. All participants were provided with standard discharge instructions per institutional PID treatment guidelines, and control participants were asked to arrange a 72-hour visit with their primary care practitioner or with the Title X program offered through the institutional adolescent and young adult clinic.

### Randomised controlled trial of screening for Chlamydia trachomatis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease: the POPI (prevention of pelvic infection) trial [^3655e7f8]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Only two trials have been carried out on chlamydia screening to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease in non-pregnant women. These were done in the United States and Denmark and started in 1990 and 1997. The trial by Scholes et al involved 2607 women from a health maintenance organisation. However, over a third of the women (n = 364) in the intervention group were not screened, and these women had a low rate of pelvic inflammatory disease (0.5%, 2/364) leading to a relative risk of pelvic inflammatory disease in those allocated to screening compared with usual care of 0.44 (95% confidence interval 0.20 to 0.90). Pelvic inflammatory disease is polymicrobial, but in many cases no pathogens are isolated. If chlamydial infection is implicated in only about 30% of cases of pelvic inflammatory disease, even if screening and treatment prevented all cases of pelvic inflammatory disease due to chlamydia, it would be unlikely to halve the overall risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. Recently, the findings by Scholes et al have been suggested as fortuitous.

In a later trial in 1700 female high school students, Ostergaard et al found that 2.1% of those in the home sampling group and 4.2% in the usual care group reported treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease when interviewed after a year. Ascertainment of pelvic inflammatory disease was, however, unblinded and nearly 50% of the women were lost to follow-up. In addition, reports by the women might be unreliable, as masked analysis of clinical data in our trial confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease in only 11 of the 21 women whose questionnaires reported that they had had pelvic inflammatory disease. Finally, the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease in our trial was slightly lower than the 2.3% found in similar aged women attending English and Welsh general practices. The women in our study with pelvic inflammatory disease were assessed by doctors in genitourinary medicine, and both coding and diagnosis may be more reliable. It is, however, likely that the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease would be higher in those lost to follow-up, sexually active teenagers aged < 16, or those not in education.

### Comparing ceftriaxone plus azithromycin or doxycycline for pelvic inflammatory disease: a randomized controlled trial [^b44f0b37]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the equivalence of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline or azithromycin for cases of mild pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Methods

Patients with PID received an intramuscular injection of 250 mg of ceftriaxone, and were randomly assigned to receive 200 mg/d of doxycycline for 2 weeks, or 1 g of azithromycin per week, for 2 weeks. The degree of pain was assessed on days 2, 7, and 14 and clinical cure was assessed on day 14.

Results

From 133 patients eligible for the study, 13 were excluded for having conditions other than PID, 11 were lost on follow-up, and three had oral intolerance to the antibiotics, yielding 106 for protocol analysis. No significant difference was observed regarding the degree of pain between the doxycycline and azithromycin groups. Clinical cure per protocol was 98.2% (56 of 57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9–0.99) with azithromycin, and 85.7% (42 of 49; 95% CI, 0.72–0.93) with doxycycline (P = 0.02). In a modified intention to treat analysis, clinical cure was 90.3% (56 of 62; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96) with azithromycin, and 72.4% (42 of 58; 95% CI, 0.58–0.82) with doxycycline (P = 0.01); a relative risk of 0.35, and a number needed to treat of six for benefit with azithromycin.

Conclusion

When combined with ceftriaxone, 1g of azithromycin weekly for 2 weeks is equivalent to ceftriaxone plus a 14-day course of doxycycline for treating mild PID.

### Trends in illness severity and length of stay in inner-city adolescents hospitalized for pelvic inflammatory disease [^5b906af6]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) changed their guidelines for treatment of adolescents with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), no longer recommending hospitalization of all teenagers.

Study Objectives

(1) To determine the proportion of adolescents with PID who were admitted for failed outpatient treatment after the CDC guideline change. (2) To determine if adolescents admitted for PID after the guideline change needed longer hospital stays and/or were more likely to be "very ill" [as measured by inflammation markers, e.g. fever] or to have tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) than those admitted before the change.

Design

Retrospective chart review

Setting/Participants

All 12-21-year-old females with the diagnosis of PID admitted to an adolescent inpatient unit in an inner-city teaching hospital during a two-year period before [T1 = 1995–1997 (54 cases)] and after [T2 = 1998–2000 (91 cases)] the CDC guideline change.

Interventions

None

Main Outcome Measures

Reason for admission (failed outpatient treatment; TOA; or admission at the time of diagnosis of PID); clinical toxicity at admission, and length of hospital stay (LOS).

Results

During T2, 22% of PID admissions were for failure of outpatient therapy. However, those admitted after failure of outpatient therapy (n = 20) in T2 were less likely to be "very ill" than those who were admitted at the time of PID diagnosis in either T1 or T2 (n = 123) [RR:0.30; 95% CI:0.09–0.94]. Mean LOS for females admitted to the adolescent unit with all diagnoses other than PID did not change between T1 and T2 but mean LOS for those diagnosed with PID decreased significantly from 6.3 ± 3.7 days to 4.7 ± 2.7 days, respectively (P = 0.002). LOS for PID was longer for younger (< 16 years; 8.20 ± 4.5 days) than older (≥ 16 years; 5.0 ± 2.8 days) girls (P = 0.02) and for adolescents with TOA (7.9 ± 5.0 days) than for those without (5.3 ± 2.9 days) (P = 0.05).

Conclusion

At our medical center, after the CDC guideline change many adolescents with PID were admitted because of failure of outpatient therapy but they were not sicker than those admitted at the time of diagnosis and overall LOS for PID was shorter. These findings are reassuring because they suggest that an initial trial of outpatient therapy for PID is unlikely to harm adolescents and may lead to significant cost savings.

### Cervicitis in adolescents: do clinicians understand diagnosis and treatment? [^517e7192]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Cervicitis is widespread, but no studies have examined cervicitis in accordance with established guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. Study objectives were to describe adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of cervicitis within an adolescent population and to compare factors associated with adherence to guidelines in a primary care setting and the Emergency Department.

Methods

Data were collected as part of a retrospective chart review of evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of STI in adolescent women in an outpatient setting. Participant charts were eligible for review if they were 12–21 years of age and were given an ICD-9 and chart diagnosis of cervicitis. Two primary outcome variables: meeting cervicitis guidelines and correct treatment among those meeting cervicitis guidelines (no/yes) were utilized; the study controlled for age, race, venue, past infection with chlamydia or gonorrhea.

Results

Subjects (n = 365) were examined for the primary outcome variables and 75.1% (274/365) met at least one criterion for cervicitis. Of these, 166 (60.9%: 166/274) subjects were found to meet criteria for cervicitis alone, versus subjects meeting criteria for both cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (39.4%: 108/274). The majority, 89.3%, (326/365) were treated for both chlamydia and gonorrhea, but only 64.7% (211/326) were treated correctly for both infections.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that knowledge deficits exist in diagnosis and treatment of cervicitis in adolescent patients and in differentiating between cervicitis and PID. Educational tools, simulated patient exercises, and order sets may be warranted for quality improvement to allow for improved care of this at risk sexually active population.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^e7a56364]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper part of the female genital tract, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, or adjacent pelvic structures causing peritonitis that may spread from the pelvis to the abdomen. The cause is ascending bacterial infection from the vagina in 85% of cases, most commonly from sexually transmitted pathogens (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis). Endogenous vaginal and cervical flora, especially anaerobes, cause PID in most of the remaining cases. Most cases are treated as outpatients with antibiotics alone. Indications for hospitalization include failure of outpatient management, severe illness, and pregnancy (owing to the risk of pregnancy loss). Pelvic (tubo-ovarian) abscess may be an indication for surgery.

Trauma, a major global public health problem, can be associated with high morbidity and mortality depending on mechanism, injury pattern, time to stabilization, and host frailty regardless of socioeconomic status. Both blunt and penetrating mechanisms may result in bowel injury; motor vehicle crashes are the most common of blunt intestinal injury. followed by falls. The small intestine is more likely than colon to be injured by either mechanism. Infection is considered established (as opposed to contamination by enteric contents) after 12 h for colon injury and 24 h for other locations; within those time frames only surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (maximum 24 h; ideally a single dose) is required, even if the colon is lacerated. Blunt hollow viscus injury may have a more insidious presentation in this setting, possibly resulting in delayed diagnosis and intervention and consequent adverse outcomes.

### Evidence for a role of Mycoplasma genitalium in pelvic inflammatory disease [^5941002c]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Mycoplasma genitalium is a common sexually transmitted pathogen frequently identified among women with pelvic inflammatory disease, the infection and inflammation of a woman's upper genital tract. Although Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae frequently cause pelvic inflammatory disease, up to 70% of cases have unidentified etiology. This review summarizes recent evidence for M. genitalium's role in pelvic inflammatory disease and subsequent sequelae.

Recent Findings

PCR studies have demonstrated that M. genitalium is associated with clinically suspected pelvic inflammatory disease, acute endometritis, and adnexitis, independent of gonococcal and chlamydial infection. Most studies have been cross-sectional, although one prospective investigation suggested that M. genitalium was associated with over a 13-fold risk of endometritis. Whether or not M. genitalium upper-genital-tract infection results in reproductive morbidity is unclear, although it has been serologically associated with tubal-factor infertility. Several lines of evidence suggest that M. genitalium is likely resistant to many frequently used pelvic inflammatory disease treatments. Correspondingly, M. genitalium has been associated with treatment failure following cefoxitin and doxycycline treatment for clinically suspected pelvic inflammatory disease.

Summary

Strong evidence suggests that M. genitalium is associated with pelvic inflammatory disease. Further study of M. genitalium upper-genital-tract infection diagnosis and treatment is warranted.

### Treatment of mild-to-moderate pelvic inflammatory disease with a short-course azithromycin-based regimen versus ofloxacin plus metronidazole: results of a multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^a3f4db53]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

A multicentre, randomised non-inferiority trial compared the efficacy and safety of 14days of ofloxacin and metronidazole (standard-of-care (SoC)) versus a single dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone followed by 5days of azithromycin and metronidazole (intervention arm (IA)) in women with mild-to-moderate pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Methods

Women with a clinical diagnosis of PID presenting at sexual health services were randomised to the SoC or IA arms. Treating clinicians and participants were not blinded to treatment allocation but the clinician performing the assessment of primary outcome was blinded. The primary outcome was clinical cure defined as ≥ 70% reduction in the modified McCormack pain score at day 14–21 after starting treatment. Secondary outcomes included adherence, tolerability and microbiological cure.

Results

Of the randomised population 72/153 (47.1%) reached the primary end point in the SoC arm, compared with 68/160 (42.5%) in the IA (difference in cure 4.6% (95% CI -15.6% to 6.5%). Following exclusion of 86 women who were lost to follow-up, attended outside the day 14–21 follow-up period, or withdrew consent, 72/107 (67.3%) had clinical cure in the SoC arm compared with 68/120 (56.7%) in the IA, giving a difference in cure rate of 10.6% (95% CI -23.2% to 1.9%). We were unable to demonstrate non-inferiority of the IA compared with SoC arm. Women in the IA took more treatment doses compared with the SoC group (113/124 (91%) vs 75/117 (64%), p = 0.0001), but were more likely to experience diarrhoea (61% vs 24%, p < 0.0001). Of 288 samples available for analysis, Mycoplasma genitalium was identified in 10% (28/288), 58% (11/19) of which had baseline antimicrobial resistance-associated mutations.

Conclusion

A short-course azithromycin-based regimen is likely to be less effective than the standard treatment with ofloxacin plus metronidazole. The high rate of baseline antimicrobial resistance supports resistance testing in those with M. genitalium infection to guide appropriate therapy.

### Randomised controlled trial of screening for Chlamydia trachomatis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease: the POPI (prevention of pelvic infection) trial [^33901b34]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

†Abdominal pelvic pain with features of PID, which may have responded to antimicrobial therapy, but no record of cervical excitation or uterine or adnexal tenderness; or long standing abdominal pain consistent with endometriosis, but some features of PID — for example, uterine tenderness, and unable to confirm if antimicrobial therapy had a benefit. 1

Rates of pelvic inflammatory disease were examined in the 137 women with chlamydial infection at baseline who were followed up for 12 months. Seven of 74 women in the deferred screening group developed clinical pelvic inflammatory disease (incidence 9.5%, 4.7% to 18.3%). All seven women were tested for C trachomatis at the time pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed and five tested positive. By comparison, only one of 63 (1.6%) screened and treated women positive for chlamydia developed clinical pelvic inflammatory disease (relative risk 0.17, 0.03 to 1.01). Initial treatment for chlamydial infection in this woman was confirmed by telephone but she developed symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease and tested positive for chlamydia 26 weeks after recruitment. On the 12 month questionnaire she reported three sexual partners in the previous year and no use of condoms.

Most cases of pelvic inflammatory disease (79%, 30/38) occurred in women who tested negative for chlamydia at baseline. Chlamydia test results at the time pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed were available for 26 (of 38) women, of whom 16 tested positive for chlamydial infection. Ten of these 16 women were negative for chlamydia at baseline. Seventy per cent (21/30) of women with pelvic inflammatory disease who completed the 12 months' questionnaire reported having had two or more sexual partners during the year. The groups showed a slight imbalance for reported symptoms but similar sexual behaviour during the follow-up period (table 4).

Table 4

Independent testing during follow-up

Overall, 527 (22%) participants reported having been tested independently for chlamydia (figure); 15% (n = 38) of the control women and 10% (n = 27) of the screened women said they tested positive. Those women in the deferred screening group (blind to group allocation and baseline chlamydia status) who were positive for chlamydia at baseline were more likely than those who were negative to report having been tested independently (43%, 29/67 v 24%, 229/968; P < 0.001).

### Adherence to oral therapies in pelvic inflammatory disease [^d0689751]. Journal of Women's Health (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess adherence to oral therapies in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Methods

Medication adherence to oral doxycycline therapy (100 mg) was measured using electronic event monitoring (EEM) among adult women with PID. Subjects (n = 91), who were predominantly black and with a high school or lower educational attainment, were randomly selected from the Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Evaluation and Clinical Health (PEACH) Study, a trial in which subjects were randomized to either (1). initial inpatient then outpatient or (2). fully outpatient treatment with doxycycline and cefoxitin. Summary statistics calculated within treatment groups and in the cohort as a whole included the percentage of administrations taken, percentage of days with correct dosage, percentage of days with no drug taken, time elapsed until the first drug holiday, and percentage of optimal dosing intervals.

Results

Study subjects took an average of 70% of prescribed doses, took the prescribed two daily doses for less than half of their outpatient days, took an unscheduled drug holiday for almost 25% of their outpatient days, and took only 16.9% of their doses within the optimal timing interval. In general, working, not bleeding with sex, and not drinking hard liquor were positively associated with measures of adherence. Adherence estimates were similar among women in the inpatient and outpatient groups after hospital discharge.

Conclusions

The disturbing rates of time interval adherence, even after hospitalization, suggest the need to determine the effectiveness of antibiotic regimens involving shorter courses and longer dosing intervals.

### Prevalence of pelvic inflammatory disease in sexually experienced women of reproductive age-United States, 2013–2014 [^0e7274b3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

PID can result from untreated bacterial infections, including chlamydia and gonorrhea, both of which are treatable and preventable. Each case of PID results in an estimated average cost of $3,202. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the most commonly reported STIs in the United States, with approximately 1.5 million chlamydia and approximately 400,000 gonorrhea infections reported in 2015. Most chlamydia and gonorrhea infections are asymptomatic in women and many go undiagnosed and untreated. Results from randomized controlled trials suggest that chlamydia screening is associated with a decreased incidence of PID. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that all sexually active women aged < 25 years and older women at increased risk for infection be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea.

Using nationally representative data, this study found a substantial prevalence of PID in the United States. Lifetime prevalence of PID was highest in women with sexual behaviors and a sexual health history putting them at increased risk for STIs, including having had a prior STI diagnosis, and differed by race/ethnicity in those without a prior STI diagnosis. Given the potential for asymptomatic infections to lead to PID and the costs associated with treatment, it is important for clinicians to adhere to U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines for chlamydia and gonorrhea screening in an effort to decrease the PID burden in sexually experienced women of reproductive age nationwide.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) with HIV infection — clinical features and management: More comprehensive observational and controlled studies have demonstrated that women with HIV infection and PID coinfection have similar symptoms compared with women without HIV, except they are more likely to have a tubo-ovarian abscess, and women with HIV responded equally well to recommended parenteral and IM or oral antibiotic regimens as women without HIV; microbiologic findings were similar except women with HIV had higher rates of concomitant M. hominis and streptococcal infections, and these data are insufficient for determining whether women with HIV infection and PID coinfection require more aggressive management.

### Sexually transmitted infections part 2: discharge syndromes and pelvic inflammatory disease [^ab3013ff]. Pediatrics in Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect young people, with more than half of the infections occurring in youth aged 15 to 25 years. (1)(2) This review, the second in a 2-part series on STIs, focuses on infections that may cause abnormal vaginal or penile discharge, including trichomonas, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Most infected persons, however, are asymptomatic. Nucleic acid amplification tests are the most sensitive and specific for the detection of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis, and they can be performed on provider- or patient-collected swabs. Providers should have a low threshold for diagnosing and treating PID because untreated PID can have serious long-term complications for young women. Indications for hospitalization for PID include the presence of a tubo-ovarian abscess, severe illness with systemic symptoms, pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and failure to respond to outpatient oral treatment (within 48–72 hours) or inability to tolerate the oral treatment.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^7eb65c8d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

These guidelines for the treatment of persons who have or are at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were updated by CDC after consultation with professionals knowledgeable in the field of STIs who met in Atlanta, Georgia, June 11–14, 2019. The information in this report updates the 2015 guidelines. These guidelines discuss 1) updated recommendations for treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis; 2) addition of metronidazole to the recommended treatment regimen for pelvic inflammatory disease; 3) alternative treatment options for bacterial vaginosis; 4) management of Mycoplasma genitalium; 5) human papillomavirus vaccine recommendations and counseling messages; 6) expanded risk factors for syphilis testing among pregnant women; 7) one-time testing for hepatitis C infection; 8) evaluation of men who have sex with men after sexual assault; and 9) two-step testing for serologic diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus. Physicians and other health care providers can use these guidelines to assist in prevention and treatment of STIs.

### Physician specialty influences care of pelvic inflammatory disease [^781bcd9f]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Background

CDC guidelines recommend Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and HIV testing, as well as specific antibiotic regimens in the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), although latitude in adhering to these guidelines is common. We hypothesized that adherence to CDC guidelines for antibiotic regimens and laboratory testing, coverage for anaerobic organisms, and the use of diagnostic imaging techniques do not differ significantly between practitioners with emergency medicine (EM) versus obstetrics and gynecology (OB-GYN) training.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a retrospective medical chart review on patients (N = 351) discharged with a diagnosis of PID over a 20-month period at two neighboring emergency care facilities-one with EM-trained providers and the other with OB-GYN-trained providers.

Results

Adjusted for demographic predictors and chief complaint, there was no significant difference in adherence to N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis antibiotic coverage guidelines between the two facilities (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.34; 95% CI 0.66–2.74), using the OB-GYN facility in the numerator of the AOR. Anaerobic coverage was significantly more common at the OB-GYN facility (AOR 9.11; 95% CI 5.36–15.48). Both sites had very low rates of adherence to CDC laboratory testing guidelines with overall rates of adherence at 4.0% (95% CI 1.9%-5.9%). Utilization of diagnostic tests differed greatly between facilities: ultrasound utilization was 66.7% (95% CI 58.2%-75.2%) at the OB-GYN facility and 39.7% (95% CI 33.4%-45.9%) at the EM facility.

Conclusions

The diagnostic pathway for PID and adherence to guidelines differ significantly depending on physician specialty and practice environment, suggesting the need for further standardization, perhaps with cross-disciplinary training.

### Identification of novel microbes associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility [^d0e9a65f]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2016). Low credibility.

That infertility was only marginally associated with chlamydial PID and not associated with gonococcal PID suggests that, in contrast to older studies that strongly implicated these bacteria in infertility, women in our study received timely and effective antibiotics for these pathogens. Indeed, approximately 90% of our patients were free of gonorrhoea/chlamydia at the 30-day follow-up. Moreover, the combination of gonorrhoea/chlamydia plus fastidious BV-associated bacteria produced no additional degree of persistent endometritis and long-term PID sequelae beyond the effect from BV-associated bacteria alone.

Currently, the approach for PID treatment is empiric, using broad spectrum antibiotics to target a range of pathogens but largely directed towards eliminating N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis. However, approximately 60% of women on our cohort had non-gonococcal, non-chlamydial PID. Fastidious BV-associated bacteria, commonly found in the endometrium at baseline, often persisted after CDC-recommended PID treatment as did endometritis. A sizeable proportion of women receiving timely, standard PID treatment may thus have ongoing upper genital tract inflammation as a result of continued infection with previously unrecognised pathogens. Such treatment failure appears to eventuate recurrent PID and infertility among some women. Replication of our results would dictate that optimal diagnosis and treatment regimens for PID be re-evaluated.

Key messages

Current pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) treatment regimens use broad spectrum antibiotics to target a range of pathogens, but largely directed towards eliminating Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis.
Among women treated with cefoxitin and doxycycline, Sneathia sanguinegens / amnionii, bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria 1 and Atopobium vaginae were associated with persistent endometritis, recurrent PID and infertility.
Optimal antibiotic regimens for PID may require coverage for novel bacterial vaginosis-associated microbes.

### Medical treatment of pouchitis: a guide for the clinician [^d471b1ec]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

When determining how to treat pouchitis, it is important to consider alternative etiologies that may mimic idiopathic pouchitis such as infection (particularly cytomegalovirus and Clostridiodes difficile), ischemia, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), pre-existing versus de novo Crohn's disease, cuffitis, postsurgical or mechanical disorders (pelvic sepsis, leak, fistulae, pouch prolapse, obstructions), and functional disorders (dyssynergic defecation, reduced pouch compliance, irritable pouch syndrome) (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Pouch conditions. (a) Normal pouch body. (b) Pouchitis. (c) Tip of J sinus tract. (d) Perianal fistula at anal verge. (e) Cuffitis. (f) Ischemic pouchitis. (g) Pre-pouch Crohn's ileitis. (h) Pouch prolapsed.

Multiple sub-classifications exist within the diagnosis of pouchitis. Pouchitis can be acute, with symptoms lasting less than 4 weeks, or chronic, with symptoms lasting more than 4 weeks. Chronic pouchitis frequently encompasses multiple chronic inflammatory complications of the pouch including chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis (CADP), chronic antibiotic-refractory (CARP) pouchitis, and Crohn's disease or Crohn's-like disease of the pouch. It is important to note, though there are some features that suggest Crohn's disease of the pouch, there is not a consistent definition for Crohn's disease of the pouch. Treatments for various types of chronic pouchitis frequently overlap.

Currently, there are no medications with approved indications for pouchitis. As such, the treatment of pouchitis is entirely off-label. Just as the therapeutic armamentarium for inflammatory bowel disease continues to expand, so too does the number of possible treatments for pouchitis. This paper is intended to be a practical review of therapies used for the management of the various forms of pouchitis and cuffitis.

### Vaginal and rectal microbiome contribute to genital inflammation in chronic pelvic pain [^c46d1cc4]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common clinical complaint defined by the pain of the pelvis experienced for greater than or equal to 6 months that substantially burdens a patient's overall quality of life by affecting physical, emotional, and sexual health. The etiology of CPP can be multifactorial, involving multiple organ systems, making it difficult to diagnose and treat. A common cause of CPP is endometriosis. However, not all women with endometriosis have CPP. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory condition defined by endometrium-like tissue outside the uterine cavity.

Endometriosis is clinically suspected based on symptoms, physical exam findings, and imaging studies. However, there are currently no validated, non-invasive diagnostic tests for the disease, and definitive diagnosis relies on surgical excision of suspected lesions with histopathology confirmation. Frequently, there is considerable delay in endometriosis diagnosis after the onset of pain, with symptomatic patients undergoing evaluation by multiple physicians for 7–10 years before proper diagnosis and treatment. Accurate, non-invasive diagnosis and treatments for CPP with and without endometriosis is a major challenge in the field.

Decades of research have tried to identify diagnostic and therapeutic targets for endometriosis focused on inflammatory and immune markers in the serum or peritoneal and cervicovaginal fluid. Unfortunately, no single biomarker or panel has yet been approved for diagnosis in the USA. However, one novel area of investigation that may offer potential targets for diagnosing and treating CPP with and without endometriosis is the microbiome. The female reproductive tract and gut microbiome have become an area of interest related to benign and malignant gynecologic disease. Previous research has observed that the microbiome is associated with gynecologic conditions, including bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections, polycystic ovary syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome. Emerging research into the relationship between the microbiome and endometriosis suggests alterations in the microbiome of the lower and upper reproductive tract, the gastrointestinal system, and within the peritoneal cavity. Microbial associations with endometriosis may drive pathogenesis in chronic pelvic pain and endometriosis-associated pain by inducing inflammation. However, prior research is limited in investigations of microbial relationships related to CPP alone and how that may differ from patients with CPP and endometriosis. Furthermore, investigating these interactions can lead to therapeutic targets for symptom management.
