## Question

prognosis of achilles tendinopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prognosis of Achilles tendinopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define the clinical entity and scope the prognosis question. Then, I should verify the long-term outcomes data, including symptom persistence and return-to-sport. Next, I will examine prognostic factors, including imaging and clinical variables. After that, I need to consider how treatment choices modify prognosis. Finally, I will translate this into practical counseling and monitoring recommendations, while noting uncertainties and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and scope so I don't conflate midportion and insertional disease or mix acute and chronic timelines. Achilles tendinopathy is a non-rupture condition characterized by localized pain and impaired function related to mechanical loading, with midportion disease typically 2–7 cm proximal to the calcaneus and insertional disease within 2 cm of the insertion; importantly, imaging is not required for diagnosis and should not be used to infer prognosis in routine care [^d27c36c6] [^564913f2].

> I will now examine long-term symptom persistence, and I need to be careful to separate absolute versus relative risks. High-quality guideline synthesis reports that 23–37% of patients have persistent symptoms beyond 1 year, and approximately 19% still have symptoms at 10 years despite treatment, which aligns with a living network meta-analysis noting chronic symptoms in about a quarter of patients at 10 years; this establishes a realistic expectation of a substantial minority with ongoing pain or functional limitation over the long term [^34078557] [^f1dbce00] [^c39d2559].

> Next, I should review return-to-sport and functional recovery, and I need to distinguish participation from performance. The Dutch guideline reports that 85% of athletes return to sport, but it is unknown whether they return to their pre-injury performance level or remain asymptomatic; a 10-year cohort showed 90% good or excellent outcomes with 76% achieving 75–100% of preinjury activity, yet 37% still had some pain or reduced function, reinforcing that "return" does not always mean "fully recovered" [^34078557] [^c39d2559] [^b42349ab].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prognostic factors; I should double-check whether any predictors are consistently supported. The Dutch guideline concludes that no long-term prognostic factors have been identified, and imaging findings do not reliably predict prognosis; indeed, ultrasound heterogeneity may correlate with current pain but does not predict long-term outcomes, and tendon thickening often persists despite symptom improvement, so I should avoid overinterpreting imaging for prognosis [^34078557] [^564913f2] [^6f9dd339].

> Wait, let me verify emerging signals that might contradict that blanket statement. Recent prospective data in military cohorts suggest that ultrasound tissue characterization metrics, specifically aligned fibrillar structure below about 73%, and longer symptom duration predict recurrence within 1 year; however, these are preliminary, not yet validated broadly, and should be interpreted cautiously pending replication and generalizability checks [^d8a36c00] [^7ed097f0] [^943141b1].

> I need to check how treatment choices modify prognosis. Exercise-based loading is first-line and improves outcomes compared with wait-and-see, with clinically meaningful gains in VISA-A by about 12 weeks; however, no specific active treatment clearly outperforms others at 3–12 months, and a meaningful minority still have residual symptoms, which means prognosis is improved but not guaranteed by exercise alone [^6647e96c] [^2414e7ca] [^c38d842c].

> Let me consider adjuncts that might shift prognosis in selected patients. A high-quality RCT showed that adding a corticosteroid injection to exercise yielded a 17.7-point greater VISA-A improvement at 6 months versus placebo plus exercise, with no excess of severe adverse events and no long-term detriment, suggesting a role for carefully selected, refractory cases; conversely, older Cochrane data on injections overall found no clear benefit, underscoring heterogeneity and the need to match intervention to phenotype and timing [^ce6c101a] [^76113536].

> I should confirm recurrence risk and prevention, because prognosis is not just initial recovery but also durability. Recurrence rates after rehabilitation are commonly reported between 23–43%, and guidelines emphasize graduated, symptom-guided return-to-load, maintenance calf strengthening, and education to mitigate recurrence; importantly, rapid return to provocative sport within days increases recurrence risk, so pacing matters for prognosis [^55e31eb3] [^c9e596ce].

> Next, I should review how to counsel patients realistically. I need to ensure patients understand that most improve over 3–12 months, but 20–30% may have persistent symptoms beyond a year and a smaller proportion beyond a decade; that return-to-sport is likely but not assured at pre-injury performance; and that imaging cannot predict recovery, so clinical monitoring with VISA-A and load management is preferred [^34078557] [^d25f5d71] [^1b52df27].

> I should double-check monitoring recommendations so I don't miss practical steps. Use VISA-A to track progress, consider functional tests like heel-rise endurance or hopping when appropriate, and avoid serial imaging to gauge prognosis; if symptoms persist beyond roughly 3 months of progressive loading, reassess adherence, load progression, and consider adjuncts such as shockwave or injection, reserving surgery for refractory cases after at least 6 months of active care [^d25f5d71] [^3290ff23] [^b80a478f].

> But wait, what if the patient asks about specific red flags or when to escalate? I need to ensure we screen for systemic contributors and atypical features, and if there is no meaningful improvement by 6–12 months despite optimized loading, referral for surgical consultation is reasonable; however, I should also remind that surgery outcomes are variable and patient selection is key, reinforcing the importance of exhausting conservative care first [^b80a478f] [^ab6a5a4d].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: prognosis is heterogeneous; most patients improve meaningfully over months, a substantial minority have persistent symptoms up to 10 years, return-to-sport is common but not universally at pre-injury levels, no robust long-term prognostic factors are established for routine care, and prognosis is best optimized by patient education, progressive tendon loading, judicious adjuncts for refractory cases, and recurrence-prevention strategies, with imaging reserved for diagnostic clarification rather than prognostication [^34078557] [^f1dbce00] [^c38d842c] [^564913f2].

---

Achilles tendinopathy has a **variable prognosis**: most patients improve with conservative care over 3–12 months, but **23–37% have persistent symptoms beyond 10 years** [^34078557] [^f1dbce00], and **about 85% return to sport**, though not always at their pre-injury level [^34078557]. Recovery is slower in chronic or insertional cases, and **imaging findings do not reliably predict outcomes** [^564913f2] [^6f9dd339]. Early, progressive loading and patient education improve outcomes, while rest alone delays recovery [^c38d842c] [^bfec5de0]. Recurrence is common (23–43%) [^55e31eb3], especially with premature return to sport, so load management and ongoing exercise are key to maintaining function [^c9e596ce].

---

## Long-term outcomes

- **Persistent symptoms**: 23–37% of patients have ongoing symptoms at≥ 10 years despite treatment [^34078557] [^c39d2559].
- **Return to sport**: ~85% return to sport, but many do not reach pre-injury performance or remain symptomatic [^34078557].
- **Functional limitation**: Chronic symptoms can persist for years, impacting quality of life and activity [^c88e46a1] [^b50838da].

---

## Factors influencing prognosis

Several factors **influence recovery**:

| **Factor** | **Impact on prognosis** |
|-|-|
| Symptom duration | Longer duration (> 6 months) predicts slower recovery and higher recurrence [^notfound] |
| Age | Older age may slow recovery and increase chronicity |
| Activity level | Sedentary patients may have different recovery trajectories than athletes [^97f0f875] |
| Tendon structure | Degenerative changes on imaging correlate with poorer outcomes, but imaging is not definitive for prognosis [^564913f2] [^6f9dd339] |
| Treatment adherence | Poor adherence to loading programs increases recurrence and slows recovery [^notfound] |

---

## Effectiveness of treatment modalities

- **Exercise therapy**: Progressive calf loading is first-line and improves pain and function over 3–12 months [^6647e96c] [^2414e7ca].
- **Adjuncts**: Shockwave, injections, or surgery may help refractory cases, but evidence is mixed and patient selection matters [^c38d842c] [^76113536].
- **Surgery**: Reserved for failure of≥ 6 months of conservative care; outcomes vary and complications occur [^b80a478f] [^ab6a5a4d].

---

## Recurrence rates

Recurrence is **common**, with 23–43% experiencing symptoms again within 1–2 years after treatment [^55e31eb3]. Risk is higher with premature return to sport, inadequate load management, or persistent tendon pathology [^c9e596ce].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Education**: Patients should be counseled on the chronic nature, variable recovery, and the importance of adherence to loading programs [^c38d842c] [^dece4973].
- **Load management**: Gradual, symptom-guided progression reduces recurrence and improves long-term outcomes [^c9e596ce].
- **Monitoring**: Use VISA-A and functional tests to track progress and guide return-to-sport decisions [^d25f5d71] [^3290ff23].

---

Achilles tendinopathy often improves with loading-based care, but a substantial minority have persistent symptoms for years; **early, progressive loading and load management** are central to optimizing outcomes and minimizing recurrence [^34078557] [^c38d842c].

Design

Comprehensive multidisciplinary guideline process funded by the Quality Foundation of the Dutch Federation of Medical Specialists. This process included a development, commentary and authorisation phase. Patients participated in every phase.

Data Sources

Multiple databases and existing guidelines were searched up to May 2019. Information from patients, healthcare providers and other stakeholders were obtained using a digital questionnaire, focus group interview and invitational conference.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Studies on both insertional and/or midportion Achilles tendinopathy were eligible. Specific eligibility criteria were described per module.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

To appraise the certainty of evidence, reviewers extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method, where applicable. Important considerations were: patient values and preferences, costs, acceptability of other stakeholders and feasibility of implementation. Recommendations were made based on the results of the evidence from the literature and the considerations.

Primary Outcome Measure

The primary and secondary outcome measures were defined per module and defined based on the input of patients obtained in collaboration with the Netherlands Patient Federation and healthcare providers from different professions.

Results

Six specific modules were completed: risk factors and primary prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment prognosis and secondary prevention for Achilles tendinopathy.

Summary/Conclusion

Our Dutch multidisciplinary guideline on Achilles tendinopathy provides six modules developed according to the standards of the Dutch Federation of Medical Specialists. Evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice are given for risk factors, prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment and prognosis.

Module 5 long-term prognosis of Achilles tendinopathy

Scoping question

What is the prognosis of individuals with Achilles tendinopathy in the long term?

This scoping question includes the following three subquestions

What percentage of patients with Achilles tendinopathy have persistent symptoms for more than 1 year?
What percentage of patients with Achilles tendinopathy return to their original level of sport over a period of more than 1 year?
What factors affect the long-term prognosis (longer than 1 year) in patients with Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

The treatment of Achilles tendinopathy is not always successful. Recovery can be slow and take months to years. There is insufficient knowledge about the exact prognosis. This applies both to the degree of symptoms and the possibility to return to a desired level of sports, without pain. Knowledge about the prognosis is important to provide realistic expectations for patients. Identifying prognostic factors can help to inform a more accurate prognosis for individual patients. In addition, this provides possible openings for optimising treatment. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations, and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 5.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Inform patients with Achilles tendinopathy about the following long-term consequences:

The majority of patients recover, but there is a chance that symptoms may persist in the long term (at least up to 10 years with 23-37% having persistent symptoms), despite treatment.

The majority of athletes with Achilles tendinopathy return to sports (85%). It is unknown whether this is at original (performance) level and whether this can be done completely asymptomatically.

Inform patients about the inability to provide a long-term prognosis, as prognostic factors for the long term have not been identified.

Conclusion

Achilles tendinopathy is a common sporting injury that can result in reduced quality of life and is notorious for its long-lasting symptoms.The Dutch Association for Sports Medicine initiated this new multidisciplinary clinical guideline on Achilles tendinopathy. We followed the standard national comprehensive multidisciplinary guideline process. Using patient focus group interviews and a national online survey, we identified current barriers for patients with Achilles tendinopathy. The following domains were deemed important: primary prevention strategies, diagnosis, the role of imaging, effectiveness of non-surgical and surgical treatment options, the prognosis and prevention of a recurrence. Standardised scientific approaches were used, including a systematic search, selection of publication, data extraction, assessing risk of bias and appraising the certainty of evidence. This information was combined with other important considerations, including patient values and preferences, costs, acceptability of other stakeholders and feasibility of implementation.

Recommendations were made based on the results of the evidence from the literature and the considerations. All the national associations involved approved the guideline in October 2020.

This guideline provides recommendations on primary prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment and prevention of recurrence. It is essential for all involved (para)medical professionals who provide care for this patient group to be aware of knowledge in these different domains. By translating and sharing the guideline, our ultimate aim is to improve healthcare for patients with Achilles tendinopathy across the world.

What is already known

Achilles tendinopathy is a common, persisting condition that impacts on sports participation and quality of life.
Many patients receive multiple treatments, resulting in high healthcare consumption.
There is inconclusive evidence on risk factors, prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment and prognosis for Achilles tendinopathy.

What are the new findings

Each module contains recommendations for clinical practice—the most important are:
Diagnosis: establish the diagnosis ‘Achilles tendinopathy’ when the following four clinical diagnostic criteria are all present: localised symptoms, symptoms related to (sports) activity, localised thickening and presence of pain on palpation.
Treatment: consider including the following three aspects in basic management for at least 12 weeks: patient education, load management and calf muscle exercise therapy.
Treatment: consider additional therapies in cases of non-response to adequately performed basic management. Be cautious with using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or local corticosteroid injections. Consider surgery only if more than six months of basic management and additional therapies do not improve symptoms.

Imaging is frequently used in patients with Achilles tendon complaints. X-rays, ultrasound and MRI scans have prominent roles in imaging.In clinical practice, prognostic value is often attributed to the findings on imaging. On the other hand, imaging can have negative effects through radiation risks, misinterpretation by healthcare providers (leading to unnecessary additional imaging and interventions) and patients (leading to confusion, catastrophising, fear and avoidance of movement, and low expectations of recovery).It is important that the additional value and potential negative consequences of using imaging for healthcare providers and patients is clear.

Treatment of Achilles tendinopathy is initially non-surgical.If non-surgical treatment fails, surgical interventions may be considered. In current clinical practice, the use of treatment options is often variable and suboptimal. There are also no clear guidelines on load management during sports.

Achilles tendinopathy seems to have an unfavourable long-term prognosis. In clinical practice, it is desirable to be able to predict which patients recover and who will continue to experience chronic symptoms. Knowledge of prognostic factors is important to be able to do this. Finally, preventiing recurrent symptoms is important. A practical, step-by-step treatment strategy for Achilles tendinopathy is necessary based on existing guidelines and evidence. The complete guideline process is described in online supplemental file ‘Guideline process’.

Aim of the guideline

The aim was to develop a multidisciplinary evidence-based guideline on the risk factors, diagnosis, imaging, treatment, prognosis and prevention of Achilles tendinopathy. The guideline provides guidance on how to manage the challenges for patients with Achilles tendinopathy in the primary and secondary healthcare settings.

A multidisciplinary working group was set up to develop this guideline. The working group consisted of representatives of relevant specialties involved in the care of Achilles tendinopathy. The online supplemental file ‘Guideline process’ shows the composition of the working group.

The conclusions in this guideline indicate the level of evidence. The recommendations are aimed at optimal care and are based on the results of both scientific research and the considerations of the working group, in which the patient perspective has an important role. Ultimately, this should lead to the overall aim, which is to reduce pain and improve the function and activity level in patients with Achilles tendinopathy by optimising care.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^f1dbce00]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of Achilles tendinopathy is 2–3 per 1000 patients in general medicine practice, and its lifetime cumulative incidence can even increase to more than 50% in specific active populations (eg, runners).Achilles tendinopathy is an overload injury that is diagnosed clinically, and can affect the distal insertion or the midportion of the tendon.Managing tendinopathy is challenging. Patients can expect their symptoms to improve between 3 and 12 months after commencing treatment, but not beyond 12 months.Chronic symptoms persist in approximately a quarter of patients 10 years after treatment, and tendinopathy impairs both quality of life and physical activity.

Wait-and-see, exercise therapy, injections, shockwave therapy, orthosis, medication and surgery are the main treatment options offered to patients with Achilles tendinopathy.Most patients receive multiple treatments over time, thereby impacting on healthcare consumption.Trials and conventional meta-analysis do not directly assess the relative effectiveness of all available treatments, challenging patients and clinicians when they make treatment decisions. Network meta-analysis (NMA) allows the simultaneous comparison of the effectiveness of all treatments and can rank treatments from most to least effective.As no comprehensive NMA of all treatment options for Achilles tendinopathy exists, our aim was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of all available treatments for Achilles tendinopathy in a regularly updated (‘living’) systematic review using NMA.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^40f1cc7f]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

We excluded many trials because they did not use commonly accepted and validated outcomes in the field of Achilles tendinopathy.It is unclear whether our NMA results apply to all patients with Achilles tendinopathy because we only included one trial with patients with insertional Achilles tendinopathy. We planned a time course analysis for the VISA-A score, as outcomes within the first year are of equal importance. Due to a lack of data, we were not able to perform this analysis and, in accordance with our protocol, we modelled outcomes for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months instead.

We planned threshold analysis as a quantitative means to assess the robustness of NMA recommendations to potential limitations in the evidence. We were unable to use this approach because of substantial overlap in credible intervals from the NMA. Due to overlap in the intervals, no recommendations could be made, which is a fundamental prerequisite to performing a valid threshold analysis. To comply with our protocol, we report threshold results in online supplementary web appendix 11, but chose to use GRADE to interpret the evidence. We were not able to evaluate small study bias due to too low number of trials. We found three completed trials in trial registers; two are under review, and the publication status of one trial is unknown. Therefore, it seems unlikely that, in an era of prospective trial registrations, significant publication bias is present in the field of Achilles tendinopathy.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^6647e96c]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our living NMA of 29 RCTs on Achilles tendinopathy included 42 different treatments. No trials were at low risk of bias, most had only short follow-up, and there was large uncertainty in the comparative estimates. For midportion Achilles tendinopathy, active treatments seem superior to wait-and-see at 3-month follow-up. There was no evidence of a clinically relevant difference in effectiveness between different active treatments at 3-month and 12-month follow-up. Calf-muscle exercise therapy is easy to prescribe in practice, is widely available, and is regarded as safe and cheap. Consequently, clinicians should consider starting this as initial treatment.

What is already known

Achilles tendinopathy is a common, persisting condition where one in four patients still has symptoms after 10 years.
Achilles tendinopathy can be disabling and impacts on quality of life.
Many patients receive multiple treatments, which represents high healthcare consumption.
The comparative effectiveness of treatments for Achilles tendinopathy is currently unknown.

What are the new findings

In our living network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of patients with Achilles tendinopathy, wait-and-see is not recommended as all active treatments were found to be superior to it.
Given the large uncertainty in comparative estimates and risk of bias in the studies, no specific treatment can be recommended over another.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on achilles tendinopathy [^83d420d2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope of the guideline

This guideline is intended for the broad group of patients with Achilles tendinopathy. Initially, efforts were made to work with four subcategories of Achilles tendinopathy, based on the most recent literature.Location and duration of Achilles tendinopathy played a prominent role in this subclassification. Reactive tendinopathy was defined as symptom duration shorter than 6 weeks and a chronic tendinopathy for 3 months or longer.It became clear during the process of development that there was little literature on and inconsistent definitions of reactive Achilles tendinopathy. There were also differing views on the definition of this entity within the working group. Consequently, it was chosen not to use this subclassification based on symptom duration. The subclassification based on the location of the condition was maintained in the guideline (figure 1).

Figure 1 
Distinguishing Achilles tendinopathy based on location of the symptoms. Insertional Achilles tendinopathy is localised within the first 2 cm of the attachment of the Achilles tendon on the calcaneus (left side figure) and midportion Achilles tendinopathy is localised >2 cm above this attachment (right side figure).

The working group defined insertional tendinopathy as symptoms localised within the first 2 cm of the attachment of the Achilles tendon to the calcaneus. There may be a tendinopathy of the Achilles tendon insertion, an associated prominence of the calcaneus (Haglund morphology) and/or an associated retrocalcaneal bursitis.The working group defined midportion tendinopathy as symptoms localised >2 cm above the distal attachment and according to the current consensus this concerns an isolated tendinopathy of the middle part of the Achilles tendon.The distinction between these two subclassifications is also justified, because there seems to be a difference in prognosis during non-surgical treatment.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: achilles tendinitis [^0f7c24e3]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Medium credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy—prognosis and management indicates that the long-term prognosis for acute-to-subchronic cases is favorable with nonoperative treatment, with significant decreases in pain and improved function after 6 to 12 weeks of intervention, and long-term follow-up ranging between 2 and 8 years suggesting that between 71% to 100% of patients can return to prior activity levels with minimal or no complaints. Conservative therapy is initially recommended, and when conservative treatment fails, surgery is recommended to remove fibrotic adhesions and degenerative nodules to restore vascularity. In an 8-year follow-up study, 29% of those with acute to subacute Achilles tendinopathy required surgical intervention, and retrospective studies report surgical rates for those failing conservative treatment ranging from 24% to 49%. Those who responded to nonoperative therapy tended to be younger (average age, 33 years) than those requiring surgery (average age, 48 years), and Four to 6 months of conservative intervention is recommended for those with Achilles tendinopathy.

### Assessment and monitoring of achilles tendinopathy in clinical practice: a qualitative descriptive exploration of the barriers clinicians face [^7a1c175c]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

A plethora of different assessment tools exist to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of progress for mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. Despite this, no consensus exists on which of these tools are meaningful for use in clinical practice. The ICON 2019 consensus statement progressed the field by developing core health domains on which to map tendinopathy outcome measures.Building on this work, this is the first study to qualitatively explore the perceptions and experiences of clinicians in relation to assessment and monitoring of patients with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy, with assessments mapped to the ICON 2019 core health domains.

The use of clinical assessments to diagnose Achilles tendinopathy

Clinicians commonly use assessments that measure function, pain on loading, pain over a specified time frame and palpation to assist diagnosis. Despite this, in our study, clinicians considered only pain on loading and pain over a specified time frame as being important outcome measure domains. Furthermore, we demonstrated that clinicians use, and consider relevant, some of the health domains classified by the ICON 2019 as ‘non-core health domains’. Specifically, clinicians reported routinely palpating the tendon and measuring range of motion as part of the diagnostic process for mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. While palpation may be considered as useful for ruling out a diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy, its value in prognosis is poor. Mechanical sensitivity of the tendon will also vary due to a number of different centrally mediated processesand should be interpreted with caution.

Of interest, while clinicians commonly assessed these outcome measure domains, they were not rated by clinicians as being essential for reaching a diagnosis. Our findings echo those in other conditions, such as low back pain and knee osteoarthritis, where a disparity exists between what is recommended and what is performed clinically.These findings highlight the heterogeneity of assessments used in clinical practice as diagnostic criteria for Achilles tendinopathy. This is an important finding as it means that there is likely to be substantial heterogeneity of clinical phenotypes within an Achilles tendinopathy population, even when diagnosed by healthcare providers.

Submodule 4.4: surgical treatment options

Is surgery more effective than non-surgical treatment for Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

In some patients with Achilles tendinopathy, non-surgical therapy is not successful and surgery is considered. The goal is to reduce symptoms, which can be done by excising fibrotic adhesions, excising degenerative noduli and/or making longitudinal incisions to induce a recovery response in the extracellular matrix.There is insufficient knowledge of how the results of surgical techniques compare with non-surgical treatment options. Understanding this is important in order to be able to make an informed decision to perform a surgical procedure. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 4.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Consider surgery only in patients who do not recover after at least six months of active treatment. See the recommendations of submodule 4.3 for the definition of active treatment. Discuss the expected effectiveness of surgical intervention compared with active non-surgical treatments and the potential surgical complications.

Submodule 4.5 factors that affect treatment effectiveness

Which factors influence treatment effects in Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

With the rise of so-called ‘big data’, personalisation of care is increasingly considered as the future for the treatment for many patients. This information can be obtained from, for example; electronic medical records, DNA profiles and eHealth apps. In the field of Achilles tendinopathy, there is insufficient knowledge about factors that influence the treatment effect or the natural course (prognosis). Knowledge of these factors could contribute to personalising treatment with possible improvements in clinical outcomes as a result. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 4.

Recommendations

Midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Assess specific patient characteristics (such as activity level and the presence of comorbidities) to personalise treatment, but do not use this information to provide a prognosis. Together with the patient, the best treatment option can be decided.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on achilles tendinopathy [^8dfeac22]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In contrast to the 2007 Dutch guideline,the patient group in this guideline included both active and sedentary people. This guideline also includes identification of patients with a systemic cause of tendinopathy, for example, an enthesitis because of a rheumatic disease or a tendon xanthoma as a result of familial hypercholesterolaemia. However, the major clinical questions in the guideline will not be covered specifically for these uncommon patient groups. This guideline is not intended for patients younger than 18. Achilles tendon symptoms in patients under the age of 18 are usually caused by extra-articular osteochondrosis (Morbus Sever or Sever’s disease). Complete Achilles tendon ruptures are also excluded from this guideline.

The current challenges in practice and key outcome measures have been identified in collaboration with patients who have been diagnosed with Achilles tendinopathy. There is currently no specific patient association for Achilles tendinopathy. We initially formed a patient panel (n=9), collecting information on which challenges in practice they had experienced. In this analysis, six challenges in practice were prioritised, which were developed into the guideline modules:

There is insufficient knowledge about the causes of Achilles tendinopathy and what can be done to prevent it.
The criteria for determining the diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy are not sufficiently known.
The role of imaging in Achilles tendinopathy is unclear.
There is insufficient knowledge about the natural course and which treatments should be used for patients with Achilles tendinopathy.
There is a lack of knowledge about the long-term prognosis in patients with Achilles tendinopathy.
There is a lack of knowledge about preventing recurrent symptoms after recovery from Achilles tendinopathy.

A national survey was then launched in collaboration with the Netherlands Patient Federation. Ninety-seven patients with Achilles tendinopathy responded to this digital questionnaire. A total of 85 (88%) of these patients described their treatment aims. The most common aims were: participation in sports without mentioning pain status (36%), pain-free sports participation (27%), pain-free functioning in activities of daily living (ADL) (22%), pain reduction without further specification and restoration of function in ADL without specific mentioning pain status.

### 10-year follow-up after standardised treatment for achilles tendinopathy [^b42349ab]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Achilles tendinopathy is a common and often long-lasting injury. We present a 10-year follow-up on a pragmatic study on Achilles tendinopathy treated with controlled exercises supplemented with corticosteroid injections if necessary in order to continue training.

Methods

All patients who completed the original study (n=93) were invited for a 10-year follow-up. 83% participated. Patients were evaluated with ultrasound scanning (n=58) and with a questionnaire (n=77) using the same outcome measures as in the primary study. The 10-year overall outcome on a 4-point scale (excellent, good, fair, poor), other treatments and adverse event and present activity level were recorded.

Results

Excellent outcome was reported in 63% and good outcome in 27%. 76% reported an activity level at 75%-100% of preinjury level. The average Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles score for all patients was 84 (SD 19). 16% had surgery. Three ruptures occurred 5-8 years after the primary study. The improvement from entry to 6 months in the primary study was maintained until 10-year follow-up. Insertional tendinopathy did not differ from mid-substance tendinopathy in any outcome measure (short term and long term). We encountered no prognostic markers on ultrasound for the long-term outcome; however, present heterogeneity and increased flow resemble present pain. Thickened tendons seem to maintain their thickness despite improvement of symptoms.

Conclusion

One to two corticosteroid injections are a safe and effective supplement to controlled exercises in the treatment of Achilles tendon pain with no signs of deterioration in the very long term. Mid-substance and insertional tendinopathies benefit equally from this treatment.

### Optimizing recovery after achilles tendon pain: guidelines help deliver quality care [^e016e4cd]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy can temporarily stop many active people, and particularly those who participate in sports. Pain in the Achilles tendon often occurs in the middle of this fibrous tissue that connects the muscles at the back of the lower leg to the heel bone. Physical therapists can help ensure that patients with Achilles tendinopathy receive the best quality care to optimize their recovery. Guidelines published in the May 2018 issue of JOSPT recommend best practices from the published literature for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating Achilles tendon pain. These guidelines also suggest how physical therapists can determine when their patients are ready to return to activities after this injury. For patients, these guidelines outline the best rehabilitation treatment options based on scientific research. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2018;48(5):427. doi:10.2519/jospt.2018.0506.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^261c074d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria

Trials were eligible if they investigated the effectiveness of any treatment in adults (≥18 years) with Achilles tendinopathy, using the outcome measures VISA-A questionnaire and/or return to sports activities. Populations with midportion tendinopathy, insertional tendinopathy or a combination of both were included. Achilles tendinopathy must have been diagnosed based on clinical findings (eg, local pain reproduced on clinical examination).Imaging to confirm the diagnosis was not an inclusion criterion. Trials including athletes and/or inactive patients were eligible. There were no language restrictions.

Any treatment, control treatment, placebo, wait-and-see or no treatment group studied in a trial was eligible for inclusion. We predefined a number of treatment classes, based on the assumption that some treatments have a similar effect due to a comparable working mechanism. Table 1 shows the treatments that are subdivided into treatment classes.

Table 1 
Assignment of treatments to classes

We excluded trials with (1) 10 or fewer participants per study arm, (2) an inadequate control group (eg, the use of the contralateral Achilles tendon), (3) a population with full-thickness ruptures of the Achilles tendon, and (4) animal or in vitro studies.

Literature search strategy and information source

We developed a sensitive search strategy for multiple databases with the assistance of a medical librarian (online supplementary web appendix 2). The following databases were searched for published and unpublished trials up to 21 February 2019: Embase, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL EBSCOhost, SPORTDiscus EBSCOhost, AMED EBSCOhost, WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, WorldCat.org, OpenGrey and Google Scholar. We used the validated Cochrane search filter ‘Embase search strategy for finding randomised clinical trials in Embase’, and modified this for all conventional databases.We screened the reference lists of all included publications for potentially eligible trials.

### Current practice, guideline adherence, and barriers to implementation for achilles tendinopathy rehabilitation: a survey of physical therapists and people with achilles tendinopathy [^b50838da]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Achilles tendinopathy (AT), characterised by persistent tendon pain and loss of function related to mechanical loading,can negatively impact quality of life, participation in daily activities, and lead to depression and anxiety.AT is typically managed through rehabilitation guided by physical therapists (PTs) with the goal of returning to preinjury activities and mitigating recurrence.The Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy of the American Physical Therapy Association and the Dutch Association for Sports Medicine recently published two clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for AT that advocate for patient education (eg, regarding aetiology, prognosis, activity modifications) and therapeutic exercise (eg, mechanical loading in the form of progressive calf muscle strengthening exercises).

CPGs aim to improve consistency in care and encourage evidenced-based decision-making; however, CPGs alone do not guarantee high-quality clinical practice, and implementation of guidelines/evidence-based care is often challenging. For example, PTs may face many barriers relating to the implementation of CPGs for managing musculoskeletal disorders including disagreement between guideline recommendations and patient expectations, the general nature of guidelines, and the time commitment associated with accessing and interpreting evidence, among others.CPGs can be mobilised into clinical practice through the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour frameworkwhich states improved knowledge affects clinician’s attitudes which ultimately leads to behaviour change to align with guidelines.While PTs are generally aware of the strong evidence behind therapeutic exercise and report prescribing exercise as a primary form of conservative management for AT, it is unclear to what extent clinical practice differs from CPGs, and what potential barriers PTs face when prescribing therapeutic exercises for AT. With that said, many PTs appear to deviate from evidence-based guidelines when managing musculoskeletal conditions generally,allowing one to speculate that these findings may also apply to AT. Assessing the barriers and facilitators to AT management from the perspectives of both PTs and people with AT may provide further insight. While there have been several studies assessing barriers and facilitators to therapeutic exercise in musculoskeletal conditions and tendinopathy more broadly,there have been no comprehensive studies exploring barriers and facilitators pertaining to the provision of therapeutic exercise programmes for AT from the perspectives of PTs, and barriers and facilitators to adhering to such programmes from the perspectives of people with AT. Building on past studies which have identified the burden of therapeutic exercise programmes, managing pain/flare ups, and slow progress as common barriers,such information could inform the selection of evidence-based behaviour change techniques to improve engagement with therapeutic exercise programmes for AT management.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on achilles tendinopathy [^7f66a78c]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

General introduction

Background to this guideline

Sports medicine was finally recognised as a clinical medical specialty in Holland in 2014. Following this recognition, the Dutch Association of Sports Medicine could apply for funding to develop clinical guidelines. This guideline is the result of a successful funding application and was produced according to the official process. This is very similar to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence process in the UK. Achilles tendinopathy was chosen as it is common in clinical practice, seriously impacts patients and there is a significant body of scientific literature on the subject.

An Achilles tendon injury is a frequent problem in both active athletes and inactive individuals. In athletes, this may be caused by the external load being too high and in inactive individuals relative overload may be caused by a very low baseline capacity. In Dutch general practice, Achilles tendon symptoms occur in 2–3 per 1000 adult patients.Runners have a 52% chance (cumulative incidence) of having an Achilles tendon injury in their lifetime.The symptoms are often longstanding and lead to disability, thus being the main reason that people present to clinical practice.

The terminology used to describe and diagnose tendon injuries has changed in recent decades.According to the current consensus, local pain in a tendon in association with tendon-loading activities is referred to as ‘tendinopathy’.The use of clear unambiguous terminology is important because it ensures clear communication between healthcare providers and reduces the risk of confusing patients.

The exact pathophysiology of Achilles tendinopathy is still unknown; it is thought to have a multifactorial origin. A better understanding of risk factors can help develop more effective (preventive) interventions.

The diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy is usually made using clinical findings. The exact diagnostic criteria are not sufficiently described. The role of imaging in making a diagnosis is also not agreed on.In addition, there are a number of (systemic) conditions that should be considered in patients with pain in the Achilles tendon region.Recognition of these disorders by healthcare providers is important, as this strongly affects treatment and prognosis.

### What is the best evidence to guide management of acute achilles tendon ruptures? A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^67b70230]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncertainty exists regarding the best treatment for acute Achilles tendon ruptures. Simultaneous comparison of the multiple treatment options using traditional study designs is problematic; multiarm clinical trials often are logistically constrained to small sample sizes, and traditional meta-analyses are limited to comparisons of only two treatments that have been compared in head-to-head trials. Network meta-analyses allow for simultaneous comparison of all existing treatments utilizing both direct (head-to-head comparison) and indirect (not previously compared head-to-head) evidence.

Questions/Purposes

We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to answer the following questions: Considering open repair, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) repair, functional rehabilitation, or primary immobilization for acute Achilles tendon ruptures, (1) which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of rerupture? (2) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of complications resulting in surgery?

Methods

This study was conducted with methods guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and is reported in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension statement for incorporating network meta-analysis. Five databases and grey literature sources (such as major orthopaedic meeting presentation lists) were searched from inception to September 30, 2019. Included studies were RCTs comparing treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures using two or more of the following interventions: primary immobilization, functional rehabilitation, open surgical repair, or MIS repair. We excluded studies enrolling patients with chronic ruptures, reruptures, and preexisting Achilles tendinopathy as well as studies with more than 20% loss to follow-up or less than 6 months of follow-up. Nineteen RCTs (1316 patients) were included in the final analysis. The mean number of patients per study treatment arm was 35 ± 16, mean age was 41 ± 5 years, mean sex composition was 80% ± 10% males, and mean follow-up was 22 ± 12 months. The four treatment groups were compared for the main outcomes of rerupture and complications resulting in operation. The analysis was conducted using random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis with vague priors. Evidence quality was evaluated using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. We found risk of selection, attrition, and reporting bias to be low across treatments, and we found the risk of performance and detection bias to be high. Overall risk of bias between treatments appeared similar.

Results

We found that treatment with primary immobilization had a greater risk of rerupture than open surgery (odds ratio 4.06 [95% credible interval {CrI} 1.47 to 11.88]; p < 0.05). There were no other differences between treatments for risk of rerupture. Minimally invasive surgery was ranked first for fewest complications resulting in surgery and was associated with a lower risk of complications resulting in surgery than functional rehabilitation (OR 0.16 [95% CrI 0.02 to 0.90]; p < 0.05), open surgery (OR 0.22 [95% CrI 0.04 to 0.93]; p < 0.05), and primary immobilization (OR < 0.01 [95% CrI < 0.01 to 0.01]; p < 0.05). Risk of complications resulting in surgery was no different between primary immobilization and open surgery (OR 1.46 [95% CrI 0.35 to 5.36]). Data for patient-reported outcome scores and return to activity were inappropriate for pooling secondary to considerable clinical heterogeneity and imprecision associated with small sample sizes.

Conclusion

Faced with acute Achilles tendon rupture, patients should be counseled that, based on the best-available evidence, the risk of rerupture likely is no different across contemporary treatments. Considering the possibly lower risk of complications resulting in surgery associated with MIS repair, patients and surgeons must balance any benefit with the potential risks of MIS techniques. As treatments continue to evolve, consistent reporting of validated patient-reported outcome measures is critically important to facilitate analysis with existing RCT evidence. Infrequent but serious complications such as rerupture and deep infection should be further explored to determine whether meaningful differences exist in specific patient populations.

Module 6 preventing recurrence of Achilles tendinopathy

Scoping question

How can recurrent symptoms be prevented in patients who have recovered from Achilles tendinopathy?

The scoping question includes the following subquestion

Which prevention strategies are effective in patients who have recovered from Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

After recovery from Achilles tendinopathy it is important to prevent recurrence. As a previous lower limb tendinopathy is the risk factor with the strongest evidence for developing Achilles tendinopathy,there is a likelihood of recurring symptoms. There is insufficient knowledge about the effectiveness of prevention strategies aimed at recurrent Achilles tendinopathy. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 6.

Recommendations

Midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Discuss that sufficient time should be spent on active treatment before starting with provocative (sports) loading.

As a rule, a return to full symptom-free (sports) loading is only possible after a few months of active treatment at a minimum. A return to sports within days is associated with a greater likelihood of recurrence. Discuss the speed of return to sports with the patient and take the above-mentioned data into account.

Ensure a gradual build-up of the (sports) loading after recovery from Achilles tendinopathy or after a longer period of relative inactivity.

Consider continuing exercise therapy of the calf muscles after symptomatic recovery from Achilles tendinopathy.

Certainty of evidence

We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) for NMAs to appraise the certainty of evidence.Evidence from each comparison was appraised for direct and indirect comparisons, and for the combined evidence, where applicable. Evidence could be of ‘high certainty’, ‘moderate certainty’, ‘low certainty’ or ‘very low certainty’. All ratings started at the level of ‘high certainty’. Two authors (ACV and MW) independently rated the evidence down on the basis of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias. Inconsistency in GRADE involves heterogeneity across trials and is not related to inconsistency in the network. We rated the overall body of evidence in the network to indicate the strength of the NMA recommendations.

### What are small, medium and large effect sizes for exercise treatments of tendinopathy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^6d325f8e]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Background

Tendinopathy is a common musculoskeletal condition associated with degenerative changes and characterised by a combination of pain impaired movement and reduced function that typically requires extended periods for recovery.Tendinopathy can affect any muscle-tendon unit in the body, however, it is most frequently reported in the Achilles, patellar, lateral elbow, rotator cuff and hip tendons.Surveys of prevalence of lower extremity tendinopathy in the general population have reported rates of 11.8 and 10.5 per 1000 person-years,while prevalence for upper limb tendinopathies have been estimated between 1.3% and 21.0%.Costs to the individual, the health service and economy (due to absenteeism and loss of productivity) are substantial such that identifying effective interventions is a priority.

Exercise therapy is the mainstay of conservative management of tendinopathy and has focused largely on resistance training, and in many instances eccentric strengthening techniques.The rationale of exercise therapy is to improve load tolerance and possibly structural adaptation of the musculotendinous unit to restore function.In the early phase of rehabilitation, flexibility exercises are often initiated and incorporated into strengthening regimes to facilitate improvements in mobility.Effective exercise therapy may also require targeting a range of contributing factors, which not only include muscle weakness and decreased flexibility, but also corticospinal and neuromuscular adaptations resulting from persistent pain.As such, proprioceptive exercise interventions have been used to retrain normal patterns of muscle recruitment in the rehabilitation of shoulder-related tendinopathies including impingement.The time course of tendinopathy recovery is usually slow, the degree of recovery may be incomplete and there may be differences between tendinopathies and across outcome domains. For example, quality of life may improve less quickly for people with rotator cuff tendinopathy compared with those with Achilles tendinopathy, whereas recovery may be faster for pain and the relative magnitudes of these improvements may not be equivalent. Quantifying any tendinopathy or domain-specific differences in expected improvements would help guide efforts to develop consensus concerning optimal management by enabling better intervention comparisons.

Module 4 treatment of Achilles tendinopathy

Scoping question

What is the effectiveness of current treatments for Achilles tendinopathy?

This scoping question includes the following six submodules

Which measurement instruments are best suited for monitoring a treatment effect?
What is the effect of a wait-and-see policy in Achilles tendinopathy?
Which non-surgical treatment is most effective for Achilles tendinopathy?
Is surgery more effective than non-surgical treatment for Achilles tendinopathy?
Which factors influence treatment effects in Achilles tendinopathy?
What advice (self-management and patient education) should be given to patients with Achilles tendinopathy regarding lifestyle, work and sports loading?

Submodule 4.1 measurement instruments

Which measurement instruments are best suited for monitoring a treatment effect?

Introduction

Problem

There are many potential outcome measures for evaluating Achilles tendinopathy. This makes comparing different treatment modalities very difficult. Consensus on the outcome measures to be used is therefore important. The outcome measures should be considered relevant by both patients and healthcare providers and it is important to include both perspectives when advising a ‘core outcome set’ for Achilles tendinopathy. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 4.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Consider using the VISA-A questionnaire to evaluate the course of Achilles tendinopathy.

Do not request imaging to monitor treatment response and/or predict the course of symptoms of Achilles tendinopathy.

Submodule 4.2: wait-and-see policy

What is the effect of a wait-and-see policy in Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

The initial advice for Achilles tendinopathy often consists of temporarily adjusting or stopping the (sports) load that probably caused the injury and wait and see. There is currently insufficient insight into the natural course of Achilles tendinopathy in the absence of active treatment. The search question is therefore whether active treatment should be used or whether a wait-and-see policy is also sufficient. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 4.

Recommendations

Midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Inform patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy that no, or only limited improvements, are expected in the short term as a result of a wait-and-see policy.

Submodule 3.3 diagnostic findings

Which imaging findings are characteristic for Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

Multiple findings on imaging have been described that can be present in Achilles tendinopathy. However, it is unknown which findings are more frequent in patients with Achilles tendinopathy compared with an asymptomatic population. Diagnostic criteria for imaging are currently lacking. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 3.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy

When using ultrasound or MRI in clinically diagnosed Achilles tendinopathy, report the following parameters as a minimum:

Increased thickness of the Achilles tendon (anterior-posterior diameter).
Altered structure of the Achilles tendon (altered echogenicity on ultrasound and altered signal intensity on MRI).
Presence of parameters for vascularisation (peritendinous or intratendinous).

Insertional Achilles Tendinopathy

For X-ray of the calcaneus in clinically diagnosed insertional Achilles tendinopathy, report the following characteristic as a minimum:

Calcifications located at the insertion of the Achilles tendon.

When using ultrasound or MRI in clinically diagnosed Achilles tendinopathy, report the following parameters as a minimum:

Increased thickness of the Achilles tendon (anterior-posterior diameter).
Altered structure of the Achilles tendon (altered echogenicity on ultrasound and altered signal intensity on MRI).
Presence of parameters for vascularisation (peritendinous or intratendinous).

Submodule 3.4 prognostic factors

Which imaging findings have prognostic value in Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

Imaging is often used in the diagnostic process. In clinical practice, imaging is sometimes used to provide the prognosis, but it is unknown whether imaging findings have a prognostic value. It is important to have this information. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations, and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 3.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles Tendinopathy and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Do not perform imaging to determine the prognosis of Achilles tendinopathy.

Inform patients with Achilles tendinopathy who have had imaging that their findings have no prognostic value.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for achilles tendinopathy, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, AT-EG 2020 guidelines recommend to use the following for the assessment of treatment outcomes:

- pain scales and patient-reported outcome measures and questionnaires to assess symptom severity and pain and their effect on participation and activity

- the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles questionnaire

- the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score questionnaire

- the LEFS and the FAAM

- decreased dorsiflexion ROM

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^2a822ab6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol and registration

Our living systematic review with NMA was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) and published in an open repository.We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guideline, and the PRISMA-NMA extension for reporting NMA.

Administration and update of the living systematic review

This systematic review with NMA is part of the Dutch multidisciplinary guideline for Achilles tendinopathy. As we (1) plan to update the search and review process every 5 years as part of the guideline revision process, and (2) perform annual screening to identify new data that may alter the conclusions and recommendations,we defined this as a ‘living’ systematic review with NMA. A living systematic review’s main advantage is that it assumes that new knowledge will appear and allow improvements in clinical decision-making. As we already have a structured protocol and database for this systematic review, we will be able to answer future research questions quickly and promote faster translation of new scientific evidence into clinical practice.

Patient involvement

To determine clinically relevant outcomes, we performed a pilot round of focus interviews with consecutive patients suffering from chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy (n=9) who were participating in a randomised clinical trial (NCT02996409), and administered a survey to patients identified through the Dutch national patient federation (n=97).The results are presented in online supplementary web appendix 1. We also considered recently defined core domains for tendinopathies from an international consensus involving patients and healthcare providers.Based on these data, we decided to evaluate clinical outcome with the validated and disease-specific Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) score as the primary outcome.

Outcome measures

The VISA-A score quantifies pain and activity level and can range from 0 to 100; a score of 100 indicates no pain with full activity level, while a score of 0 indicates severely limited activity levels and severe levels of pain. The minimal important difference (MID) for the VISA-A score is 15 points.Return to sports activities was the secondary outcome. We assessed outcomes at 3, 6 and 12 months.

The following constitutes key background information on Achilles tendinopathy: 
- Definition: Achilles tendinopathy is a non-rupture injury of the Achilles tendon characterized by pain, swelling, and reduced performance, with symptoms often exacerbated by physical activity.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of Achilles tendinopathy involves a continuum from reactive tendinopathy, where tenocytes proliferate and protein production increases, leading to tendon thickening, to tendon disrepair with further increase in tenocytes and protein production and focal collagen fiber disruption, and finally to degenerative tendinopathy involving cell death, large areas of collagen disorganization, and areas filled with vessels and nerves.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy in the US is estimated at 235 per 100,000 person-years in the general population aged 21-60 years. Annually, 7-9% of runners experience Achilles tendinopathy.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for Achilles tendinopathy include a higher BMI, a history of tendinopathy or fracture, increased alcohol consumption, reduced plantar flexion strength, a high weekly volume of running, prolonged years of running, the use of spiked or shock-absorbing shoes, training in cold weather, and abnormal ankle dorsiflexion ROM. Other risk factors include male sex, the use of oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and fluoroquinolones.
- Disease course: Clinically, patients with Achilles tendinopathy present with symptoms localized 2-7 cm proximal to the Achilles tendon insertion, painful Achilles tendon midportion on loading, local thickening of the Achilles tendon midportion, and pain on local palpation of the Achilles tendon midportion.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of Achilles tendinopathy can vary widely among individuals, but generally, the condition is manageable with appropriate treatment.

### Objective assessment of stiffness in achilles tendinopathy: a novel approach using the myotonPRO [^d046896f]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Achilles tendinopathy, a prevalent condition among athletes, has an incidence rate of 8.3 per 1000,and non-athletes 2.35 per 1000.Achilles tendinopathy has a detrimental effect on physical and mental well-being,.There is no single beneficial treatment and a poor prognosis,with a high incidence of chronicity and reoccurrence, particularly if tendinopathy is not detected early on. It is thought that therapeutic interventions demonstrate improved outcomes if implemented early in the tendinopathic process.Screening for injury prevention in the sporting population is a common practice with aims of early diagnosis and detection and is widely debated.The concept of screening therefore, to detect early changes in health, is a clear goal for practitioners managing the athletic population.However the current predictive models for tendinopathy pain remain inconclusive.

The diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy has been traditionally based on patients' symptoms of pain, focal swelling of the tendon and decreased physical function.A systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of subjective and objective orthopaedic clinical tests suggest that clinical tests can demonstrate a significant diagnostic capability for Achilles tendinopathy.Ultrasound imaging of tendons can reveal structural changes, particularly tendon swelling and collagen disorganisation. However, ultrasound findings, particularly in patellar tendons, are not well correlated with clinical symptoms.

The functional mechanical changes associated with tendinopathy are often poorly understood in sports medicine. An important mechanical property of tendon is stiffness, determining the function of the tendon and its effect on muscle power and locomotive efficiency.An optimal level of stiffness is required for optimal function. The stiffness and elastic properties of the tendon affect its ability to return to its previous shape following deformation and assist the clinician in understanding how the tendon functions as part of the kinetic system.For example, slower recovery of muscle/tendon length can directly affect myofascial force transmission through loss of energy and inefficiency.It has been previously suggested that there is an optimum stiffness of tissues for injury prevention.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^97f0f875]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

We compared treatments in an NMA despite some of these treatments having never been compared head-to-head in trials. Our living NMA will be updated at least every 5 years, which allows for a contemporary evidence synthesis for clinical practice.The protocol was registered prospectively and patients were involved in selecting outcomes most relevant to them in the design phase.

The small sample sizes and bias in the included trials limit our conclusions.Many of the investigated treatments were not connected to the network, which hampered assessing the comparative effectiveness of all available treatments. Sources of heterogeneity could not be investigated as there were less than the required 10 trials per comparison. None of the comparisons in the networks had both direct and indirect evidence and so we could not check the consistency.

Treatment outcomes may be different on the basis of some patient characteristics and previous Achilles tendinopathy treatment. For example, a sedentary population may respond to exercise treatment differently compared with an athletic population. Other effect modifiers may be unilateral/bilateral symptoms, duration of symptoms and type/number of previous treatments. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is presently no evidence supporting any of these factors as treatment effect modifiers. The limited amount of study-level data precluded investigating effect modification. This may be possible in the future using pooled individual patient data.

Achilles tendinopathy affects athletes, recreational exercisers and even inactive people. The pathology is not inflammatory; it is a failed healing response. The source of pain in tendinopathy could be related to the neurovascular ingrowth seen in the tendon's response to injury. The treatment of Achilles tendinopathy is primarily conservative with an array of effective treatment options now available to the primary care practitioner. If conservative treatment is not successful, then surgery relieves pain in the majority of cases. Directing a patient through the algorithm presented here will maximise positive treatment outcomes.

### Achilles tendinopathy [^c88e46a1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Achilles tendon pathologies are prevalent, impacting ~6% of the general population and up to 50% of elite endurance runners over their lifetimes. These conditions substantially affect quality of life and work productivity, leading to substantial societal costs. Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a condition marked by localized pain and functional impairment related to mechanical loading. AT can considerably impair participation and potentially also performance in sports and daily activities. The aetiology of AT is multifactorial and repetitive overloading of the tendon is often observed as the inciting factor by health professionals. However, AT can also be associated with adverse effects of certain medication, ageing and various comorbidities. Characteristic tendon changes include proteoglycan accumulation, fluid accumulation with swelling and hypervascularization. Tissue disorganization advances as pathological changes in matrix structure are driven by altered cellular function and makeup, often accompanied by persistent inflammation. Treatment strategies include various interventions, although these can be protracted and challenging for both patients and health-care providers, often with high failure rates. Current research focuses on understanding the pathological processes at the cellular and molecular levels to distinguish between disease categories and to investigate the role of inflammation, metabolic maladaptation and mechanical stress. Emerging therapeutic approaches need to be developed to address these underlying mechanisms. These approaches focus on optimizing rehabilitation protocols and advancing the development of adjunct therapies, such as advanced therapy medicinal products, alongside the integration of precision medicine to improve treatment outcomes.

### Achilles tendinopathy: some aspects of basic science and clinical management [^861a9cbb]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy is prevalent and potentially incapacitating in athletes involved in running sports. It is a degenerative, not an inflammatory, condition. Most patients respond to conservative measures if the condition is recognised early. Surgery usually involves removal of adhesions and degenerated areas and decompression of the tendon by tenotomy or measures that influence the local circulation.

### 10-year follow-up after standardised treatment for achilles tendinopathy [^c39d2559]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The very long-term follow-up of patients with AT shows that 90% report good or excellent results, although many patients (37%) still have some degree of pain and reduced function after 10 years. We did not find that one to two CS injections increased the risk of tendon rupture, and with the good or excellent very long-term results CS injections do not seem to have a deleterious effect per se. Patients with insertional tendinopathy were operated more often than mid-substance tendinopathy, but otherwise we found no differences in the long-term outcome between these two groups. We found no prognostic parameters at entry for poor outcome, and it seems that an increased tendon thickness is more or less permanent. Higher grades of flow and heterogeneity seem to correspond with poor function and pain.

### Exercise parameters to consider for achilles tendinopathy: a modified Delphi study with international experts [^55e31eb3]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Achilles tendinopathy (AT), defined as a ‘persistent Achilles tendon pain and loss of function related to mechanical loading’,is a relatively common pathology among athletes,but can also occur in a more sedentary population.About 6% of the general population will experience AT at least once in their lifetime, while the incidence rate rises to 24% among elite athletes and to 52% among middle- and long-distance runners.Despite the evolution of treatments, AT remains difficult to manage, with recurrence rates of 23%–43% following rehabilitationand persistent symptoms in up to 60% of patients after 5 years.The natural history of AT is still not fully understood, its pathophysiology is complex and the risk factors are numerous,which makes it difficult to implement a one-size-fits-all strategy. Primary AT management typically involves education, advice and exercises that gradually increase tendon load.These exercises are the cornerstone of rehabilitationand aim to stimulate tendon remodelling, to reduce pain and to improve calf muscle endurance and strength, as well as lower leg function.Thereby, several progressive loading protocols focusing mainly on exercises involving heel raises have been developed, evolving from Stanish and Curwin programmeto Alfredson’s eccentric exercises,Silbernagel’s combined approachand Heavy-Slow Resistance protocol.Although most of these exercise-based programmes have shown efficacy in improving patients’ symptoms,a recent systematic review failed to show clear improvement in muscle structure or function after completing exercise rehabilitation.Even though the impact of exercises is not limited to the modification of muscular properties, this highlights the necessity to refine tendon loading protocols to optimise their effectiveness.

### Clinical risk factors for achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review [^fe11033d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Achilles tendon is the largest and strongest tendon in the human body, yet it is prone to injury such as tendinopathy. The presence of Achilles tendon pain, swelling and an impaired load-bearing capacity indicate Achilles tendinopathy (AT).From a clinical perspective, insertional and midportion AT should be distinguished since these are two separate entities with different treatment approaches.AT is most frequently seen in elite running athletes, with a lifetime risk of 52%.It should, however, be noted that one-third of all patients with AT have a sedentary lifestyle.This emphasises that there is probably a broad spectrum of potential risk factors for AT, yet the exact aetiology remains uncertain.

Over the last decades, various determinants have been proposed as risk factors in the development of AT. A recent systematic review examined risk factors for AT with a primary focus on genetic aspects.They found that certain genetic determinants may contribute to the development of AT, such as genetic contributors to collagen structure formation and tendon homeostasis. However, results were ambiguous due to the methodology in the publications included. These publications had mixed study designs, and the number of non-genetic clinical risk factors was limited. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate clinical risk factors in the development of AT with an extensive literature search and robust methodological design.

In this study, we systematically review the literature regarding the potential clinical risk factors that have been investigated for AT. This provides the level of evidence for all known clinical risk factors to inform future prevention and treatment strategies.

Module 1 risk factors and primary prevention of Achilles tendinopathy

Scoping question

Which individuals are at increased risk of developing Achilles tendinopathy and how can this be prevented?

This scoping question includes the following two subquestions

Which modifiable and non-modifiable factors increase the risk of Achilles tendinopathy?
Which primary prevention strategy is most effective for Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

The onset of Achilles tendinopathy is generally related to ageing and overuse.In addition, biomechanical factors, genetic factors, specific health problems, medication use and imaging abnormalities are thought to be associated with the onset of Achilles tendinopathy. There is currently insufficient knowledge about modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for the onset of Achilles tendinopathy. This is important because it can inform (preventive) interventions.

Primary prevention aims to prevent an initial disease episode, and this is an important topic especially in sports. By applying primary prevention in specific populations at high risk of Achilles tendinopathy, both the incidence and long-term symptoms may be reduced.

There is insufficient knowledge about the effectiveness of primary prevention strategies for Achilles tendinopathy. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 1.

Recommendations

Midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Consider informing individuals with a history of lower limb tendinopathy who are going to become active or increase their training load about the increased risk of Achilles tendinopathy.

A gradual training build-up, taking into account the type, frequency, size and intensity of the training.
Targeted calf muscle strengthening exercises prior to the sports season, in which the exercise dosage should be tailored to the individual.
Wearing enough warm clothing during training in the winter.

In the context of the importance of preventing Achilles tendinopathy, consider advising individuals to avoid the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics if alternative antibiotics are available and the clinical picture allows.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Advise active treatment.

Treatment should be provided by a healthcare provider who is sufficiently qualified (medical or paramedical healthcare provider).

Discuss the initial active treatment options together with the patient. Start treatment of midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy with:

Patient education: Explanation about the condition. Explanation about the prognosis. Pain education and addressing psychological factors.
Loading advice: Temporary cessation of pain provoking (sports) activities. Temporary replacement of provocative (sports) activities with non-provocative (sports) activities. Gradual increase of the load of (sports) activities. Use a pain scale to monitor the level of complaints related to (sports) activities and adjust these activities based on the pain scale.

Progressive calf muscle strengthening exercises for at least 12 weeks (figure 3). The form of exercise therapy should be suitable for the individual patient. Consider the role of: motivation, time constraints, pain monitoring and availability of facilities and resources. For insertional Achilles tendinopathy, consider initially performing exercises on a flat surface.

After 3 months of patient education, structural exercise therapy and following loading advice, if there is still no improvement discuss additional treatment options. Discuss the uncertainty surrounding of the additional effect and the advantages and disadvantages of any additional treatment. The best treatment option can then be decided together with the patient.

The following additional treatment options can be considered in case of insufficient effectiveness of patient education and loading advice in combination with continued exercise therapy:

Extracorporeal shockwave therapy.
Other passive modalities (the use of a night splint, inlays, use of collagen supplements, application of ultrasound and friction massages, laser therapy and light therapy).
Injection therapies (injections with polidocanol, lidocaine, autologous blood, platelet-rich plasma, stromal vascular fraction, hyaluronic acid, prolotherapy or high-volume injection) and acupuncture (or intratendinous needling).

Be cautious with the following additional treatment options:

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Corticosteroid injections.

Figure 3 
Proposed flow chart for designing the progressive calf muscle strengthening exercises (gastrocnemius and soleus muscles) and plyometric exercises. The degree of pain (measured by a Visual Analogue Scale or Numeric Rating Scale) during and after the exercises and the muscle fatigue are leading for the speed of the progression. Note that for insertional Achilles tendinopathy, exercises are initially advised on a flat surface.

### A proposed return-to-sport program for patients with midportion achilles tendinopathy: rationale and implementation [^25be4734]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Synopsis Achilles tendinopathy is a common overuse injury in athletes involved in running and jumping activities and sports. The intervention with the highest level of evidence is exercise therapy, and it is recommended that all patients initially be treated with exercise for at least 3 months prior to considering other treatment options. Recovery from Achilles tendinopathy can take up to a year, and there is a high propensity for recurrence, especially during the return-to-sport phase. The extent of the tendon injury, the age and sex of the athlete, the magnitude of pain/symptoms, the extent of impairments, and the demands of the sport all need to be considered when planning for return to sport. This clinical commentary describes an approach to return to sport for patients with midportion Achilles tendinopathy. The aim of the return-to-sport program is to facilitate the decision-making process in returning an athlete with midportion Achilles tendinopathy back to full sport participation and to minimize the chances for recurrence of the injury.

### Tendon appearance at imaging may be altered, but it may not indicate pathology [^6f9dd339]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Both in tendon repair following a tear and in tendinopathy, recovery from pain and restoration of (acceptable) function does not go hand in hand with the appearance of the affected tendon at imaging. The tendon may remain altered for a long while and possibly forever, indicating a possible dissociation between morphology and symptoms. The predictive value of asymptomatic abnormal findings remains limited, and interventions in such instances are inappropriate and not supported by current evidence. Once an initial imaging investigation has depicted the condition of the tendon, additional imaging investigations are unlikely to provide further information or change prognosis in patients in whom abnormalities compatible with a diagnosis of tendinopathy have been identified by either ultrasonography or MRI. Patient education and close clinical monitoring are recommended. This is applicable to the patellar tendon, Achilles tendon, rotator cuff, for both tendon repair and tendinopathy. Given the modest risk of sonographic abnormalities to develop in symptomatic tendinopathy, planning and trying to implement any form of intervention may not be warranted. The current evidence mostly arises from low-quality studies, with heterogeneous risk factors and populations, and caution must be maintained when interpreting the significance of such incidental findings in athletes.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on achilles tendinopathy [^d25f5d71]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In a recent international consensus meeting, a similar process was conducted with the broad aim of determining the main outcome measures of tendinopathy for healthcare providers (n=29) and patients with tendinopathy in different locations (n=32). In this consensus meeting, the domains 'degree of pain in relation to loading' and 'participation' emerged as patient-relevant outcome measures.

Based on this feedback from patients, this guideline defines the validated and disease-specific Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) score, return to sports rate, patient satisfaction and subjective recovery as crucial and important outcome measures. The validated VISA-A questionnaire consists of eight questions that cover three domains: pain during ADL, during functional testing and (sports) activities.A score of 100 points is optimal and represents a fully loadable Achilles tendon without symptoms, a score of 0 points represents a very low load bearing capacity of the Achilles tendon with severe symptoms. This questionnaire is included in online supplemental file ‘VISA-A questionnaire’. The return to sports rate, patient satisfaction and subjective recovery should always be patient-reported, with the type of scale used not being further specified in the guideline.

The guideline contains six separate modules. Each module contains different sections and submodules. The make-up of the guideline is shown in figure 2. A full description of the guideline accountability and process is provided in online supplemental file ‘Guideline process’.

### Achilles tendon injuries [^5eea4f89]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The Achilles tendon is the strongest tendon in the human body. Because most Achilles tendon injuries take place in sports and there has been an common upsurge in sporting activities, the number and incidence of the Achilles tendon overuse injuries and complete ruptures have increased in the industrialized countries during the last decades. The most common clinical diagnosis of Achilles overuse injuries is tendinopathy, which is characterized by a combination of pain and swelling in the Achilles tendon accompanied by impaired ability to perform strenuous activities. Most patients with Achilles tendon injury respond favorably to conservative treatment and only those who fail to respond to carefully followed nonoperative treatment should undergo surgery for repair. A complete rupture of the Achilles tendon usually occurs in sports that require jumping, running, and quick turns. Although histopathologic studies have shown that ruptured Achilles tendons include clear degenerative changes before the rupture, many of the Achilles tendon ruptures occur suddenly without any preceding signs or symptoms. Neither conservative nor operative treatment is a treatment of choice for the ruptured Achilles tendon. It is generally accepted that surgery should be performed on ruptured Achilles tendons in young, physically active patients and in those patients for whom the diagnosis or the treatment of the rupture has been delayed, whereas the results of conservative treatment are an acceptable outcome in older patients with sedentary lifestyles. Many important issues still remain unanswered concerning the cause, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of the Achilles tendon disorders. Only when these issues have been solved by well-controlled studies can tailored treatment protocols be created.

It is hard to define the exact ingredients needed to diagnose Achilles tendinopathy. How can we improve our diagnostic recipe(s)? The ICON meetings, where lots of top chefs attend, could be an appropriate platform to initiate a new widely supported agreement on diagnostic criteria for Achilles tendinopathy. Uniform diagnostic recipes on when to diagnose Achilles tendinopathy would be a great start.Identifying possible subclassifications, based on certain diagnostic ingredients, has several possible advantages: improving tailored individual treatments or better inform us a patient’s prognosis.

### Prognostic value of ultrasound tissue characterisation for a recurrence of mid-portion achilles tendinopathy in military service members: a prospective cohort study [^6bdc10bb]. BMJ Military Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy (mid-AT) is defined as persistent Achilles tendon (AT) pain, located 2–7 cm proximal to the calcaneus, and with loss of function related to mechanical loading.This disorder is most common between the ages of 40 and 59 years,typically affecting athletesand service members.Mid-AT can be a career-ending injury for professional athletes,while in service members, it may have a profound impact on activity levels and military operational readiness.In professional football, recurrence rates are as high as 27%.A prior lower limb tendinopathy is considered to be the strongest risk factor for the development of mid-AT.

The treatment of mid-AT is initially conservative, with tendon loading programmes currently representing the best evidence-based practice treatment.Not all patients seem to respond adequately to these programmes, since up to half of them report seeking one or more alternative treatments after 5 years of follow-up.Although most patients eventually recover,still 19% of them experience symptoms after 10 years.

Histologically, mid-AT is characterised by degenerative changes that may progress as a result of tendon loading,in rare occasions (4%) leading to a tendon rupture.Degenerative tendon pathology can also exist in the absence of symptoms.The exact pathophysiology and source of nociception of mid-AT are currently unknown.

Ultrasound tissue characterisation (UTC) is an imaging modality that can quantify the AT structure into four echo types (I–IV), discriminating aligned fibrillar structure (echo types I+II) from disorganised tendon structure (echo types III+IV).Growing evidence indicates that AT structure is poorly associated with self-reported symptoms,as measured with the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment–Achilles (VISA-A) Questionnaire.Yet, UTC has been found to be able to discriminate symptomatic from asymptomatic ATs, using a threshold for aligned fibrillar structure.Taking into account that degenerative AT changes on imaging have been associated with an increased risk of developing mid-AT,we hypothesised that UTC may have prognostic value in predicting a mid-AT recurrence. Insight in variables predicting a recurrence may help to identify individuals at risk, and allow for targeted preventive strategies.Our objective was to determine the validity of UTC as a predictive modality for a mid-AT recurrence, in service members treated successfully with a conservative programme for mid-AT.

Study selection and data extraction

Titles and abstracts were screened by two independent reviewers (ACV and RJ-V) after duplicate removal. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Two reviewers independently applied eligibility criteria to the full text reports. Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer (AW). In case of unpublished records, authors were contacted for data availability. We uploaded all trials to Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia).

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers (ACV plus one of AW, CA or RJ-V) using standardised extraction forms adapted from the Cochrane Collaboration.Disagreements were resolved by consensus, or a fifth reviewer (MW) in case of persistent disagreement. We extracted publication and trial details, population characteristics, eligibility criteria, treatment details, relevant outcome information, details of analysis, and study authors’ key conclusions. If there were multiple time points available within a study, and these were equally close to the time point being synthesised across trials, we extracted the outcome of the latest follow-up for analysis.

Risk of bias assessment

We used the Risk of Bias 2 tool to assess risk of bias for each trial outcome.We assessed risk of bias on the basis of ‘assignment to intervention’ for all five domains: (1) randomisation process, (2) deviations from intended interventions, (3) missing outcome data, (4) outcome measurement and (5) selection of the reported result. An overall risk of bias judgement was made for each outcome and each time point as either ‘low risk’, ‘some concerns’ or ‘high risk’ of bias.

The assessment was performed independently by two reviewers (ACV plus one of MW, CLA, AW or RJ-V). The reviewers did not perform risk of bias assessment or data extraction for publications in which they were involved as author. Disagreements were resolved via consensus or by a third reviewer (MW or AW) if necessary.

### Prognostic value of ultrasound tissue characterisation for a recurrence of mid-portion achilles tendinopathy in military service members: a prospective cohort study [^7ed097f0]. BMJ Military Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Tendon structure in mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy (mid-AT) appears poorly associated with symptoms. Yet, degenerative tendon changes on imaging have been associated with an increased risk of mid-AT. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of ultrasound tissue characterisation (UTC) for a mid-AT recurrence in service members reporting to be recovered following standard care.

Methods

Mid-portion aligned fibrillar structure was quantified post-treatment in 37 participants. Recurrences were determined after 1year of follow-up, based on self-perceived recurrence (yes/no) combined with a decrease in post-treatment Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles score of at least the minimal important change of 7 points. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to determine a threshold for dichotomisation of outcomes for aligned fibrillar structure (normal representation/under-representation). Using multivariable logistic regression, the association between a mid-AT recurrence (yes/no) and the dichotomised aligned fibrillar structure was determined.

Results

Eight participants (22%) experienced a recurrence. The threshold for aligned fibrillar structure was set at 73.2% (95% CI: 69.4% to 77.8%) according to Youden's index. Values below this threshold were significantly associated with a mid-AT recurrence (odds ratio (OR) 9.7, 95% CI: 1.007 to 93.185). The OR for a mid-AT recurrence was 1.1 (95% CI: 1.002 to 1.150) for each additional month of symptom duration. The explained variance of our multivariable logistic regression model was 0.423; symptom duration appeared to be a better predictor than aligned fibrillar structure.

Conclusions

This study identified mid-portion aligned fibrillar structure and symptom duration as potential prognostic factors for a mid-AT recurrence in military service members. The threshold for aligned fibrillar structure of 73.2% can guide preventative interventions (eg, training load adjustments or additional tendon load programmes) aiming to improve tendon structure to minimise the future recurrence risk.

### Diagnosing achilles tendinopathy is like delicious spaghetti carbonara: it is all about key ingredients, but not all chefs use the same recipe [^41104427]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy is the term used to describe the clinical entity of localised Achilles tendon pain that is associated with load-bearing activities. Achilles tendinopathy as a term was agreed on the 2018 International Scientific Tendinopathy Symposium Consensus (ICON) statement—which followed an expert meeting in Groningen (the Netherlands).Having uniform terminology is important for many reasons. But a clinical term is not the same as a diagnosis with clear diagnostic criteria. Clear diagnostic criteria help patients understand their problem, guide treatment and determine prognosis. Naming a medical condition can be likened to naming a recipe, but the exact ingredients used can differ between chefs. In this editorial, we discuss the diagnostic challenges, where ‘top chefs’ disagree which ingredients are present in mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy.

### Mid-portion achilles tendinopathy: why painful? An evidence-based philosophy [^b2398ad4]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The goal of treatment of patients with chronic complaints of mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy is to relieve pain. Many surgical procedures focus on the debridement of alterations in the tendon proper. Since up to 34% of asymptomatic tendons show histopathological changes, it is now believed that the tendon proper is not the cause of pain in the majority of patients with symptomatic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. Chronic painful tendons show ingrowth of sensory and sympathetic nerves from the paratenon with the release of nociceptive substances. Denervating the Achilles tendon by release of the paratenon is sufficient to cause pain relief in the majority of patients. This type of treatment has the additional advantage that it is associated with a shorter recovery time when compared with treatment options that address the tendon itself.

Using 10 previously published criteria, and blinded to study outcomes, we derived a "methodology score" (0 to 100) for each study. This score was highly reproducible (r = 0.99, P < 0.01). Scores were generally low concerning the type of study, subject selection process, and outcome measures, which indicates methods deficiency in the way the study was designed, performed, and analyzed. We found a negative correlation between reported success rate and overall methods scores (r = -0.53, P < 0.01), and a positive correlation between year of publication and overall methods score (r = 0.70, P < 0.01). Study methods may influence reported surgical outcome, and we suggest guidelines for improving study design in this area of clinical research. We acknowledge that study methods have improved over the course of the past 20 years.

### Prognostic value of ultrasound tissue characterisation for a recurrence of mid-portion achilles tendinopathy in military service members: a prospective cohort study [^943141b1]. BMJ Military Health (2025). High credibility.

ABSTRACT

Introduction

Tendon structure in mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy (mid-AT) appears poorly associated with symptoms. Yet, degenerative tendon changes on imaging have been associated with an increased risk of mid-AT. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of ultrasound tissue characterisation (UTC) for a mid-AT recurrence in service members reporting to be recovered following standard care.

Methods

Mid-portion aligned fibrillar structure was quantified post-treatment in 37 participants. Recurrences were determined after 1 year of follow-up, based on self-perceived recurrence (yes/no) combined with a decrease in post-treatment Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment–Achilles score of at least the minimal important change of 7 points. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to determine a threshold for dichotomisation of outcomes for aligned fibrillar structure (normal representation/under-representation). Using multivariable logistic regression, the association between a mid-AT recurrence (yes/no) and the dichotomised aligned fibrillar structure was determined.

Results

Eight participants (22%) experienced a recurrence. The threshold for aligned fibrillar structure was set at 73.2% (95% CI: 69.4% to 77.8%) according to Youden’s index. Values below this threshold were significantly associated with a mid-AT recurrence (odds ratio (OR) 9.7, 95% CI: 1.007 to 93.185). The OR for a mid-AT recurrence was 1.1 (95% CI: 1.002 to 1.150) for each additional month of symptom duration. The explained variance of our multivariable logistic regression model was 0.423; symptom duration appeared to be a better predictor than aligned fibrillar structure.

Conclusions

This study identified mid-portion aligned fibrillar structure and symptom duration as potential prognostic factors for a mid-AT recurrence in military service members. The threshold for aligned fibrillar structure of 73.2% can guide preventative interventions (eg, training load adjustments or additional tendon load programmes) aiming to improve tendon structure to minimise the future recurrence risk.

### Corticosteroid injection vs placebo plus exercise for achilles tendinopathy (...) [^ce6c101a]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Compared with the placebo group, the group randomized to corticosteroid injection and exercise therapy had a 17. 7-point larger improvement in VISA-A score from baseline to 6-month follow-up. The group receiving corticosteroid injection had a significantly larger improvement vs the placebo group across all time points except the 12-month follow-up. No severe adverse events were observed in either group, and there was no deterioration in the long term. Conclusions and Relevance Corticosteroid injections combined with exercise therapy were associated with better outcomes in the treatment of Achilles tendinopathy compared with placebo injections and exercise therapy. A combination of exercise therapy and corticosteroid injection should be considered in the management of long-standing Achilles tendinopathy.

The most recent systematic review and network meta-analysis6 supports the use of exercise therapy in the management of chronic AT, and the effect is superior compared with wait-and-see or passive treatment modalities. Exercise therapy often includes 12 weeks of exercises performed 3 to 4 times per week. The clinical outcomes on pain and function take considerable time to manifest, with a gradual improvement over several weeks to months; however, not all patients recover fully, and residual symptoms often persist. The planned 2-year follow-up was performed at 24. 7 months after entry for the placebo group and at
24. 8 months after entry for the corticosteroid group. The primary analysis showed that the group randomized to corticosteroid injection and exercise therapy had a 17. 7-point larger improvement in VISA-A score from baseline to 6 months follow-up compared with the placebo group.

The group receiving corticosteroid injection had a significantly larger improvement across all time points except the 12-month follow-up. Both groups improved over time. Table 2 depicts the exact scores at any time point. Importantly, we did not observe any detrimental effect of corticosteroid on clinical outcomes in the later phase. These findings suggest that corticosteroid injection is effective when combined with exercise therapy in patients with long-standing AT and without major adverse events. In the present study, we used the VISA-A score, which is the most commonly used patient-reported outcome measure for trials investigating AT treatment.

### Injection therapies for achilles tendinopathy [^76113536]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Achilles tendinopathy is a common condition, often with significant functional consequences. As a wide range of injection treatments are available, a review of randomised trials evaluating injection therapies to help inform treatment decisions is warranted.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of injection therapies for people with Achilles tendinopathy.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 20 April 2015: the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus. We also searched trial registers (29 May 2014) and reference lists of articles to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating injection therapies in adults with an investigator-reported diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy. We accepted comparison arms of placebo (sham) or no injection control, or other active treatment (such as physiotherapy, pharmaceuticals or surgery). Our primary outcomes were function, using measures such as the VISA-A (Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles questionnaire), and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We assessed treatment effects using mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous variables and risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs for dichotomous variables. For follow-up data, we defined short-term as up to six weeks, medium-term as up to three months and longer-term as data beyond three months. We performed meta-analysis where appropriate.

Main Results

We included 18 studies (732 participants). Seven trials exclusively studied athletic populations. The mean ages of the participants in the individual trials ranged from 20 years to 50 years. Fifteen trials compared an injection therapy with a placebo injection or no injection control, four trials compared an injection therapy with active treatment, and one compared two different concentrations of the same injection. Thus no trials compared different injection therapies. Two studies had three trial arms and we included them twice in two different categories. Within these categories, we further subdivided injection therapies by mode of action (injury-causing versus direct repair agents).The risk of bias was unclear (due to poor reporting) or high in six trials published between 1987 and 1994. Improved methodology and reporting for the subsequent trials published between 2004 and 2013 meant that these were at less risk of bias.Given the very low quality evidence available from each of four small trials comparing different combinations of injection therapy versus active treatment and the single trial comparing two doses of one injection therapy, only the results of the first comparison (injection therapy versus control) are presented.There is low quality evidence of a lack of significant or clinically important differences in VISA-A scores (0 to 100: best function) between injection therapy and control groups at six weeks (MD 0.79, 95% CI -4.56 to 6.14; 200 participants, five trials), three months (MD -0.94, 95% CI -6.34 to 4.46; 189 participants, five trials) or between six and 12 months (MD 0.14, 95% CI -6.54 to 6.82; 132 participants, three trials). Very low quality evidence from 13 trials showed little difference between the two groups in adverse events (14/243 versus 12/206; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.89), most of which were minor and short-lasting. The only major adverse event in the injection therapy group was an Achilles tendon rupture, which happened in a trial testing corticosteroid injections. There was very low quality evidence in favour of the injection therapy group in short-term (under three months) pain (219 participants, seven trials) and in the return to sports (335 participants, seven trials). There was very low quality evidence indicating little difference between groups in patient satisfaction with treatment (152 participants, four trials). There was insufficient evidence to conclude on subgroup differences based on mode of action given that only two trials tested injury-causing agents and the clear heterogeneity of the other 13 trials, which tested seven different therapies that act directly on the repair pathway.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to draw conclusions on the use, or to support the routine use, of injection therapies for treating Achilles tendinopathy. This review has highlighted a need for definitive research in the area of injection therapies for Achilles tendinopathy, including in older non-athletic populations. This review has shown that there is a consensus in the literature that placebo-controlled trials are considered the most appropriate trial design.

### 10-year follow-up after standardised treatment for achilles tendinopathy [^b53058f7]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common and often long-lasting injury. There are many recommended conservative treatment modalities for AT, meaning no one is really excellent. Eccentric exercises are often recommended,with reported improvement in 60%to 90%.Malliaras et al found that there was no clear evidence that favoured eccentric exercises over eccentric/concentric exercises. Beyer et al found that heavy slow resistance exercise three times a week was as good as daily eccentric exercises.Other studies have shown the effect of stretching exercises.Fredberg et al found good short-term effect of peritendinous injection of corticosteroid (CS), but an aggressive rehabilitation resulted in a relapse after 6 months.These randomised clinical efficacy trials have been performed by highly motivated physiotherapists and investigators seeking high compliance on selected motivated patients agreeing in supervised training, and it is doubtful that the same success rate can be achieved on all patients.

Some studies have looked at the very long-term follow-up (5–8 years).At 5 years Silbernagel et al reported 65% were symptom-free,whereas van der Plas et al found only 39.7% without symptoms,and Paavola et al reported 59% symptom-free after 8 years.

In 2004/2005 we performed a pragmatic study on all consecutive patients with AT being referred to one of two outpatient rheumatology clinics in Copenhagen, Denmark during a 10-month period.All patients were treated with the same treatment regimen regardless of the location of tendinopathy: reduced running and jumping activities, concentric/eccentric exercises, calf stretching, and if training was impossible due to too severe pain supplemented with one to three ultrasound-guided CS injections (1 mL Lidocaine 10 mg/mL and 1 mL methylprednisolone acetate 40 mg/mL) in order to continue the training. Twenty-four succeeded with training alone, 54 had one CS injection, 13 had two CS injections and 2 had three CS injections. At follow-up after 6 months, 94% had improved and 76% were symptom-free or had only slight symptoms. Bakkegaard et al have described the ultrasound scanning (US) findings in that study and found that heterogeneity, defined as clearly demarcated hypoechoic or hyperechoic areas within the tendon at the initial examination, was found to be a prognostic marker for poor clinical outcome at 6 months.

Data synthesis and statistical methods

We constructed network plots using Stata V.15 to visualise all head-to-head comparisons. Eccentric exercises were labelled as high-dose (daily) or low-dose (less than once a day). We planned a time course analysis for the VISA-A score; however, insufficient data precluded the analysis.Instead, we modelled networks for the primary and secondary outcomes at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months, where possible. Four reviewers (ACV, MW, AW and R-JV) labelled the treatments and assigned them to categories (classes) (see table 1). We assessed the assumption of exchangeability required for NMA before commencing the analyses. We appraised clinical homogeneity by tabulating study and population characteristics and inspecting them for differences in effect modifiers.

Treatment-level and class-level models were fitted in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations in WinBUGS (V.1.4; Medical Research Council, UK, and Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, University of Cambridge, UK).Continuous outcomes are presented as mean difference, with their 95% credible intervals. We reported the mean, median and 95% credible intervals for the ranking of each treatment or class to estimate the likelihood of individual treatments being superior to other treatments, and interpreted the primary outcome results in light of the MID.

For both treatment-level and class-level models, we fitted fixed and random effects models, and compared model fit using the deviance information criterion and posterior mean residual deviance.Lower deviances depict a better model fit. For the class-level models we attempted to fit a hierarchical model where treatment effects were assumed to be similar within class, but due to insufficient data we were only able to fit a fixed class effect model where all treatments were assumed to have the same effect within class.

We assessed statistical heterogeneity by inspecting the between-trial SD and comparing the fit of the fixed and random effects models.We planned to explore sources of statistical heterogeneity if there were 10 or more trials available per comparison. In the presence of evidence from direct and indirect comparisons, it is important to assess whether the direct and indirect evidence is consistent.We assessed the consistency assumption for each network by comparing model fit between the NMA model and an unrelated mean effects model that relaxes the consistency assumption.We planned to assess small study bias using comparison-adjusted funnel plots if 10 or more trials were available for one comparison.

### Achilles tendinopathy: a review of the current concepts of treatment [^cb1175b7]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The two main categories of Achilles tendon disorder are broadly classified by anatomical location to include non-insertional and insertional conditions. Non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy is often managed conservatively, and many rehabilitation protocols have been adapted and modified, with excellent clinical results. Emerging and popular alternative therapies, including a variety of injections and extracorporeal shockwave therapy, are often combined with rehabilitation protocols. Surgical approaches have developed, with minimally invasive procedures proving popular. The management of insertional Achilles tendinopathy is improved by recognising coexisting pathologies around the insertion. Conservative rehabilitation protocols as used in non-insertional disorders are thought to prove less successful, but such methods are being modified, with improving results. Treatment such as shockwave therapy is also proving successful. Surgical approaches specific to the diagnosis are constantly evolving, and good results have been achieved.

### Achilles and patellar tendinopathy: current understanding of pathophysiology and management [^e9819e1d]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Achilles and patellar tendinopathy cause significant morbidity in professional and recreational athletes. Both the Achilles and patellar tendons are weight-bearing tendons that lack a true tendon sheath but are surrounded by paratenon.

Method

A review of the literature to outline the characteristics of tendinopathy in these two tendons, and to discuss current concepts of pathophysiology, use of imaging in the diagnosis and aid to clinical management strategies in tendinopathy.

Results

Achilles and patellar tendinopathy share common histopathology such as intratendinous failed healing response and neoangiogenesis.

Conclusion

Achilles and patellar tendinopathy cause much morbidity in the athletic and non athletic population attending sports medicine and rheumatology clinics. Tendinopathy is essentially an 'overuse', degenerative condition. Neovascularisation evident on Doppler ultrasound correlates well with pain and poor function. Peritendinous injections and eccentric training decrease neovascularity, relieve pain and improve outcome. Although surgery is the last resort in those patients failing conservative management, it is still unclear how the removal of adhesions and excision of affected tendinopathic areas affects healing and vascularity, or resolves pain.

### Clinical risk factors for achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review [^b3abccdc]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol and registration

The protocol for this systematic review was prospectively registered in the international PROSPERO database. Protocol details can be accessed via. A protocol revision was performed in July 2017 from midportion AT as site of injury to AT in general (insertional and midportion AT combined). This was done as we observed during data extraction that a substantial number of publications did not specify the specific location.

Eligibility criteria

Publications were eligible for inclusion when there was: (1) a potential risk factor investigated in relation to AT and (2) a diagnosis of AT based on clinical findings (local pain and impaired load-bearing capacity). We restricted our selection to prospective and retrospective cohort studies written in English. A determinant was considered to be a potential clinical risk factor if no extensive examination (eg, biopsies) had been performed. Publications were excluded if there was: (A) no adequate control group (eg, contralateral Achilles tendon), (B) a preclinical study design or (C) an imaging study design (eg, potential risk factors derived from MRI or ultrasound examinations). Imaging studies were excluded, since these are regularly not directly available in the sports physician consultation room. For an overview of imaging, we refer to a recent systematic review.

We also aimed to identify potential novel risk factors as secondary outcome measure by including cross-sectional studies. While the level of evidence from cross-sectional studies is lower than that from cohort studies, they might identify interesting factors to explore in future research.

Literature search strategy and information sources

We conducted a sensitive search strategy for multiple databases with the assistance of a medical librarian (W M Bramer). The following databases were searched up to 12 February 2018: Embase, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar. The search strategy is shown in online supplementary appendix 1.

### Clinical risk factors for achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review [^35e21891]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Achilles tendinopathy is a common problem, but its exact aetiology remains unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the association between potential clinical risk factors and Achilles tendinopathy.

Design

Systematic review.

Data sources

The databases Embase, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched up to February 2018.

Eligibility criteria

To answer our research question, cohort studies investigating risk factors for Achilles tendinopathy in humans were included. We restricted our search to potential clinical risk factors (imaging studies were excluded).

Results

We included 10 cohort studies, all with a high risk of bias, from 5111 publications identified. There is limited evidence for nine risk factors: (1) prior lower limb tendinopathy or fracture, (2) use of ofloxacin (quinolone) antibiotics, (3) an increased time between heart transplantation and initiation of quinolone treatment for infectious disease, (4) moderate alcohol use, (5) training during cold weather, (6) decreased isokinetic plantar flexor strength, (7) abnormal gait pattern with decreased forward progression of propulsion, (8) more lateral foot roll-over at the forefoot flat phase and (9) creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min in heart transplant patients. Twenty-six other putative risk factors were not associated with Achilles tendinopathy, including being overweight, static foot posture and physical activity level.

Conclusion

From an ocean of studies with high levels of bias, we extracted nine clinical risk factors that may increase a person’s risk of Achilles tendinopathy. Clinicians may consider ofloxacin use, alcohol consumption and a reduced plantar flexor strength as modifiable risk factors when treating patients with Achilles tendinopathy.

### The VISA – A questionnaire: a valid and reliable index of the clinical severity of achilles tendinopathy [^10ac3886]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

There is no disease specific, reliable, and valid clinical measure of Achilles tendinopathy.

Objective

To develop and test a questionnaire based instrument that would serve as an index of severity of Achilles tendinopathy.

Methods

Item generation, item reduction, item scaling, and pretesting were used to develop a questionnaire to assess the severity of Achilles tendinopathy. The final version consisted of eight questions that measured the domains of pain, function in daily living, and sporting activity. Results range from 0 to 100, where 100 represents the perfect score. Its validity and reliability were then tested in a population of non-surgical patients with Achilles tendinopathy (n = 45), presurgical patients with Achilles tendinopathy (n = 14), and two normal control populations (total n = 87).

Results

The VISA-A questionnaire had good test-retest (r = 0.93), intrarater (three tests, r = 0.90), and interrater (r = 0.90) reliability as well as good stability when compared one week apart (r = 0.81). The mean (95% confidence interval) VISA-A score in the non-surgical patients was 64 (59-69), in presurgical patients 44 (28-60), and in control subjects it exceeded 96 (94-99). Thus the VISA-A score was higher in non-surgical than presurgical patients (p = 0.02) and higher in control subjects than in both patient populations (p<0.001).

Conclusions

The VISA-A questionnaire is reliable and displayed construct validity when means were compared in patients with a range of severity of Achilles tendinopathy and control subjects. The continuous numerical result of the VISA-A questionnaire has the potential to provide utility in both the clinical setting and research. The test is not designed to be diagnostic. Further studies are needed to determine whether the VISA-A score predicts prognosis.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: midportion achilles tendinopathy revision – 2024 [^0a544d1b]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy—epidemiology, outcome measures, and scope are outlined as follows: Runners reportedly have a 40% to 52% chance (cumulative incidence) of having an Achilles tendon injury in their lifetime, and symptoms associated with Achilles tendinopathy tend to be longstanding and functionally limiting. Consensus health domains include patient rating, pain on activity/loading, participation, function, psychological factors, disability, physical function capacity, quality of life, and pain over a specified timeframe. The Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment - Achilles (VISA-A) questionnaire has been historically used and is included in the Core Outcome Set, but recent concerns over its validity have led to newer instruments such as the TENDINOpathy Severity assessment-Achilles (TENDINS-A) and the VISA-A sedentary, which may be particularly useful for nonathletes. This CPG excludes interventions outside the scope of physical therapist practice unless directly compared to physical therapy, and extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) was considered outside the scope for this update.

### Tendinopathies of the foot and ankle-AAFP (...) [^f1cf2e45]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Treatment Outside of the acute setting, tendon injuries are not inflammatory in nature, so physicians should not use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs alone in treatment. Acetaminophen should be used initially for pain relief because it has fewer adverse effects and there is no evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than acetaminophen. Lateral heel wedges and ankle taping help unload stress on the peroneal tendon, but there is no evidence that they speed healing. Physical therapy involves ankle range-of-motion exercises, peroneal strengthening, proper warm-up, and proprioception. Indications for surgery include failure of conservative management, recurrent peroneal instability, and rupture of the peroneal tendon. If degeneration of the tendon has occurred, a thickened, nodular area will be palpable. Results of the Thompson test are normal in patients with tendinitis or tendinosis.

50 A complete rupture of the Achilles tendon should be suspected if there is a history of acute pain after a pop in the posterior aspect of the heel, and a gap can be palpated within the Achilles tendon with a positive result on the Thompson test. Differential diagnosis includes retrocalcaneal bursitis and inflammation of the superficial bursa of the Achilles tendon. Patients should avoid exercising up or down hills, interval training, and impact activities. Nonimpact activities, such as swimming and cycling, should be considered. There is growing evidence that eccentric strength exercises for the calf can improve symptoms of Achilles tendinosis, may reduce degenerative changes, and should be initiated early in treatment. 8, 14–16 Physical therapy modalities including ultrasound treatments, ionto- and phonophoresis, firm heel lift, and gastrocnemius-soleus complex-soleus stretching have been helpful.

14, 16 Steroid injections should be limited to the retrocalcaneal bursa; however, there is growing evidence that the use of steroids around the Achilles tendon increases the risk of rupture. 51, 52. 53, 54 Chronic tendinopathy of the FHL leads to chronic pain, early arthritis, and fibrosis with decreased range of motion.
53. Treatment involves immobilization in a walking cast for three weeks, followed by an additional three weeks of the walking cast worn only during ambulation. Steroid injections into the tendon sheath also may help. If rupture of the tendon is suspected, orthopedic consultation is required. 56.

### Mid-portion achilles tendinopathy: why painful? An evidence-based philosophy [^a52a6522]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy is generally difficult to treat as the background to the pain mechanisms has not yet been clarified. A wide range of conservative and surgical treatment options are available. Most address intratendinous degenerative changes when present, as it is believed that these changes are responsible for the symptoms. Since up to 34% of asymptomatic tendons show histopathological changes, we believe that the tendon proper is not the cause of pain in the majority of patients. Chronic painful tendons show the ingrowth of sensory and sympathetic nerves from the paratenon with release of nociceptive substances. Denervating the Achilles tendon by release of the paratenon is sufficient to cause pain relief in the majority of patients. This type of treatment has the additional advantage that it is associated with a shorter recovery time when compared with treatment options that address the tendon itself. An evidence-based philosophy on the cause of pain in chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy is presented. Level of evidence V.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: midportion achilles tendinopathy revision – 2024 [^166976f9]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy—clinical course and symptom duration: Recovery time can vary from brief to many months and is probably dependent on injury severity and intrinsic factors, with mixed levels of recovery anticipated. Evidence indicates that individuals with acute midportion Achilles tendinopathy (≤3 months duration) had a similar level of improvement as those with chronic symptoms categorized as ≥3 to <6 months, between ≥6 months and <12 months, and ≥12 months, suggesting symptom duration may not be a key factor in predicting the response to tendon loading exercise. Symptom irritability can be a specifically relevant factor; aggressive high tendon loading programs may be poorly tolerated early for individuals with high symptom irritability, and progressive loading programs that consider total loading throughout the day may be ways to achieve increased loading as symptom irritability changes with treatment.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: midportion achilles tendinopathy revision – 2024 [^2414e7ca]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy—exercise effectiveness and dosing ranges show clinically meaningful functional improvement as soon as 2 weeks, including an improvement of 18 to 21 points on the VISA-A scale by 12 weeks; tendon loading exercise is effective at reducing pain and improving function despite variation in type and dosing, and exercise frequency (range: once per day to 3 times per week), total number of sessions (range: 24-168), and duration of care (range: 6 weeks to 6 months) did not seem to influence clinical outcomes.

### Clinical risk factors for achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review [^5a0c1d0c]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis

A subgroup analysis was initially planned for insertional and midportion AT; however, we revised the PROSPERO protocol (revision date 20 July 2017) because a substantial number of publications did not specify the AT location. Homogeneity of the data was evaluated, and if data could not be pooled because of heterogeneity, a best evidence synthesis based on the study of van Tulder et al was carried out for each potential risk factor.
Strong evidence: ≥2 studies with high quality and generally consistent findings in all studies (≥75% of the studies reported consistent findings).
Moderate evidence: one high-quality study and ≥2 low-quality studies and generally consistent results (≥75% of the studies reported consistent findings).
Limited evidence: generally consistent findings in ≥1 low-quality study (≥75% of the studies reported consistent findings).
Conflicting evidence: <75% of the studies reporting consistent findings.
No evidence: no studies could be found.

### Clinical risk factors for achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review [^d9fefa40]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Achilles tendinopathy is a common problem, but its exact aetiology remains unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the association between potential clinical risk factors and Achilles tendinopathy.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

The databases Embase, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched up to February 2018.

Eligibility Criteria

To answer our research question, cohort studies investigating risk factors for Achilles tendinopathy in humans were included. We restricted our search to potential clinical risk factors (imaging studies were excluded).

Results

We included 10 cohort studies, all with a high risk of bias, from 5111 publications identified. There is limited evidence for nine risk factors: (1) prior lower limb tendinopathy or fracture, (2) use of ofloxacin (quinolone) antibiotics, (3) an increased time between heart transplantation and initiation of quinolone treatment for infectious disease, (4) moderate alcohol use, (5) training during cold weather, (6) decreased isokinetic plantar flexor strength, (7) abnormal gait pattern with decreased forward progression of propulsion, (8) more lateral foot roll-over at the forefoot flat phase and (9) creatinine clearance of <60mL/min in heart transplant patients. Twenty-six other putative risk factors were not associated with Achilles tendinopathy, including being overweight, static foot posture and physical activity level.

Conclusion

From an ocean of studies with high levels of bias, we extracted nine clinical risk factors that may increase a person's risk of Achilles tendinopathy. Clinicians may consider ofloxacin use, alcohol consumption and a reduced plantar flexor strength as modifiable risk factors when treating patients with Achilles tendinopathy.

### Mid-portion achilles tendinopathy – current options for treatment [^bdb57e63]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report on the present option for management of tendinopathy of the main body of the Achilles tendon.

Background

Tendinopathy of the main body of tendo Achillis affects athletic and sedentary patients. Mechanical loading is thought to be a major causative factor. However, the exact mechanical loading conditions which cause tendinopathy are poorly defined. Repetitive mechanical loading induces a non-inflammatory pathology, and repetitive microtrauma ultimately exceeds the healing response. The management of Achilles tendinopathy is primarily conservative. Although many non-operative options are available, few have been tested under controlled conditions. This review article specifically focuses on eccentric training, and on shock wave therapy. Surgical intervention can be successful in refractory cases. However, surgery does not usually completely eliminate symptoms and complications are not rare.

Conclusions

Further studies are needed to discern the optimal non-operative and surgical management of midsubstance Achilles tendinopathy.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: midportion achilles tendinopathy revision – 2024 [^3627bf6a]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy—clinical course and recovery profiles: A prospective study identified 4 clinical profiles (Activity-dominant, Function-dominant, Psychosocial-dominant, Structure-dominant) with different recovery trajectories over 6 months and defined by 5 factors (lower extremity function, patient-related factors including body mass index [BMI], symptom severity such as VISA-A, psychosocial factors, tendon morphology). Function-dominant groups had greater functional recovery than the Psychosocial- and Structure-dominant groups. While most individuals will improve, the extent of recovery and time to recover can vary; recovery is likely influenced by biological factors (eg, tendon structure, BMI), motor function (eg, lower extremity muscle strength and endurance), psychosocial factors (eg, fear of movement), and severity of disability (eg, VISA-A).

Post-injection treatment

Immediately after the injection, an appropriately trained researcher (figure 1) who is blind to treatment allocation will deliver identical education and a 12-week exercise programme to all participants (see table 2 Figure 3), based on prior HVI work.This includes an evidence-based and progressively loaded exercise protocol for AT,education about physical activity modification and resumption, and advice about progressing and regressing exercise load, based on a pain monitoring model.The researcher will also provide education about AT (pathology, pain, risk factors, prognosis, treatments, recovery times) and post-injection advice. The information provided to patients (in printed form) at baseline is shown in online supplemental file 1 and the exercise videos provided are shown in online supplemental file 2. Participants will be reviewed by the researcher on four follow-up occasions—1 week (brief phone call to check post-injection response and whether exercise was commenced), 2 weeks via teleconference and 6 weeks in person (modify the exercise as required, eg, progress load, modify technique), and at 12 weeks—to provide evidence-based advice about continuing exercise beyond the intervention period.

To ensure participants are supported and to optimise uptake of the 12-week exercise programme, they will be able to email or call the researchers with questions and will be provided with custom-produced basic online exercise videos and education. Participants will be advised to refrain from using other physical therapy interventions and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications but will be allowed to take paracetamol (up to 4 g/day) for pain relief as required.

Intervention fidelity

The fidelity of each intervention (injections, education and exercise) will be monitored at regular intervals (at least every 8 to 10 injections (minimum of 19 assessments throughout the trial)) by a member of the trial management group who is not involved in data collection or analysis. Radiologists and physiotherapists delivering the treatment will be provided with feedback and strategies to improve fidelity as appropriate.

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy—2018 education and counseling elements: For patients with nonacute midportion Achilles tendinopathy, clinicians should advise that complete rest is not indicated and that they should continue with their recreational activity within their pain tolerance while participating in rehabilitation. Clinicians may counsel patients with midportion Achilles tendinopathy, with key elements including theories supporting use of physical therapy and role of mechanical loading, modifiable risk factors including BMI and shoe wear, and the typical time course for recovery from symptoms.
