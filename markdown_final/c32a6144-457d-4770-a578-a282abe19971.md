## Question

If treponema IGg and treponema antibodies are positive what does that indicate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a scenario where both Treponema-specific IgG and a separate Treponema antibody test are positive, and what steps to take next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what each test detects and whether they are duplicative or complementary. Then, I should verify the testing algorithm used by the laboratory to avoid misclassification. Next, I will correlate with clinical history and risk to estimate pretest probability. After that, I need to check for discordant results and, if present, resolve them with a second treponemal assay and a quantitative nontreponemal test. Finally, I will consider special situations like HIV coinfection, pregnancy, and neurosyphilis, and then outline treatment and follow-up plans based on likely stage and prior therapy history.

> Let me first confirm what these results mean. Treponema-specific IgG assays detect antibodies to T. pallidum antigens and typically remain reactive for life after infection, so a positive IgG indicates current or past infection but cannot by itself distinguish active from treated disease. Similarly, a generic "Treponema antibody" result is almost certainly a treponemal test and likewise reflects lifetime seroreactivity, so both positives together are concordant but redundant for determining activity [^115Kq5vW] [^1174SiHU].

> Wait, let me verify the testing algorithm because interpretation hinges on it. In a reverse-sequence workflow, an initial automated treponemal screen is followed by a quantitative nontreponemal test; if the nontreponemal test is nonreactive, a second treponemal assay with different antigens should be performed to adjudicate discordance, whereas in a traditional workflow, a reactive nontreponemal test is confirmed with a treponemal assay; I need to ensure which pathway was used here to avoid premature conclusions [^115bRucN] [^114KDEjc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about activity. I should confirm whether a quantitative nontreponemal test was done and what the titer shows. A reactive RPR or VDRL with a measurable titer supports active infection, whereas a nonreactive nontreponemal test with a reactive treponemal test could reflect treated infection, very early primary disease before seroconversion, or a false-positive treponemal screen. I should double-check the lab report for the nontreponemal titer and timing of symptoms or exposure [^1174SiHU] [^1146BUgA].

> I need to check the clinical context next. If there is a documented history of prior adequate treatment and the current nontreponemal test is nonreactive or at a low, stable baseline, this pattern is consistent with adequately treated, past infection. If there is no prior treatment, this likely represents untreated infection. If there was recent treatment, I should confirm that the nontreponemal titer is declining appropriately and reassess for reinfection if the titer rises fourfold or new risk exposures are reported [^1174SiHU] [^116e1xhx].

> But wait, what if the nontreponemal test is nonreactive despite both treponemal tests being positive? I should confirm with a second treponemal assay using different antigens, preferably TP-PA, to exclude a false-positive screen, and repeat the nontreponemal test in 2–4 weeks if early infection is suspected, because seroconversion can lag in primary syphilis. If the second treponemal test is negative and risk is low, no treatment is indicated, but if risk is high, I should repeat the nontreponemal test and treat if seroconversion occurs [^1174SiHU] [^115bRucN].

> Let me consider special populations. In people with HIV, treponemal tests remain reliable for diagnosis, but prozone can occur and serologic responses may be atypical. I should ensure quantitative nontreponemal testing is performed and interpreted with the same method over time, and manage discordant results per the same reverse-sequence principles with clinical correlation [^116e1xhx] [^115XLxa1]. In pregnancy, universal screening with both treponemal and nontreponemal tests is recommended, and maternal treponemal IgG crosses the placenta, so neonatal evaluation must rely on infant nontreponemal titers and clinical assessment rather than treponemal tests alone [^116wvepj] [^114gxzV7]. If neurosyphilis is suspected, I should confirm CSF analysis with CSF VDRL and cell count/protein rather than relying on CSF treponemal tests alone, given limited specificity and the possibility of blood contamination [^1171X8f7].

> I should confirm the immediate next steps. I need to obtain a quantitative nontreponemal test if not already done, review prior syphilis treatment records, perform a focused exam for primary, secondary, or tertiary manifestations, and assess HIV status and pregnancy; if the nontreponemal test is reactive, I should treat according to stage, and if it is nonreactive, I should perform a second treponemal test and repeat the nontreponemal test in 2–4 weeks if early infection is possible before deciding on treatment [^1174SiHU] [^114KDEjc].

> Let me think about treatment and follow-up. Benzathine penicillin G remains first-line for all stages, with stage-specific regimens. After treatment, I should monitor with the same quantitative nontreponemal test at defined intervals until seroreversion or a low, stable titer is achieved, recognizing that treponemal tests are not used to monitor response and that a fourfold decline is expected in early disease, whereas late latent disease may show minimal or no titer decline and still be cured [^1174SiHU] [^112dRLSz] [^1179fBnf].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought both positive treponemal results might directly indicate active infection, but I should correct that. Treponemal tests remain positive for life in most patients, so activity must be inferred from the nontreponemal titer and clinical context, not from treponemal results alone. Therefore, the key discriminator is the quantitative RPR or VDRL and the trajectory of titers over time, not the mere presence of treponemal antibodies [^115Kq5vW] [^1174SiHU].

> In summary, dual treponemal positivity confirms exposure to T. pallidum but does not establish activity. I need to obtain a quantitative nontreponemal test, reconcile with prior treatment history, and, if discordant, adjudicate with a second treponemal assay and repeat nontreponemal testing when early infection is suspected before committing to treatment and staging the disease appropriately [^114KDEjc] [^1174SiHU].

---

A positive Treponema IgG with a positive Treponema antibody test indicates **current or past syphilis infection** [^112dmXW2] and **cannot distinguish active from treated disease** [^115Kq5vW]. To determine activity, order a **quantitative nontreponemal test (RPR or VDRL)** [^1174SiHU]; a reactive nontreponemal test with a positive treponemal test indicates active infection, while a nonreactive nontreponemal test suggests past or treated infection [^116PWKkv] [^1146BUgA]. If results are discordant, repeat testing in 2–4 weeks [^1146BUgA] and correlate with clinical history and risk factors [^1173eFEr].

---

## Interpretation of positive treponemal tests

Treponemal tests (EIA/CIA, TPPA, FTA-ABS) detect **antibodies specific to Treponema pallidum** [^115Kq5vW] and typically remain positive for life, even after successful treatment [^1174SiHU]. Thus, a positive treponemal test indicates current or past infection but **does not distinguish active from treated disease** [^112dmXW2].

---

## Role of nontreponemal tests

Nontreponemal tests (RPR, VDRL) detect antibodies to cardiolipin and are **used to assess disease activity and treatment response** [^112Ugc9y]. Titers rise with active infection and typically decline after treatment [^116e1xhx]; a fourfold decline is considered a successful response [^116juTPx].

---

## Clinical interpretation of combined results

| **Treponemal test** | **Nontreponemal test** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Positive | Positive | Active syphilis infection |
| Positive | Negative | - Past or treated infection <br/> - Very early infection (before seroconversion) <br/> - False-positive treponemal test |
| Negative | Positive | - Biological false-positive <br/> - Early infection (before treponemal seroconversion) |

---

## Recommended next steps

- **Perform a quantitative nontreponemal test (RPR or VDRL)** to assess disease activity and guide management [^1174SiHU].
- **If the nontreponemal test is negative**, repeat testing in 2–4 weeks if early infection is suspected, and correlate with clinical history and risk factors [^1146BUgA].
- **If results remain discordant**, consider confirmatory testing with a different treponemal assay or molecular methods (PCR) if available [^116WcRNP].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Active infection**: Treat according to stage and clinical context [^115B3dvk]; penicillin G is first-line therapy [^112dmXW2].
- **Past or treated infection**: No further treatment unless there is clinical suspicion of reinfection or treatment failure [^111f8PqE].
- **Follow-up**: Monitor nontreponemal titers to assess treatment response and detect reinfection [^112dRLSz].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **False positives**: Treponemal tests can be false-positive due to cross-reactivity or laboratory error; confirmatory testing and clinical correlation are essential [^114mWtrJ].
- **False negatives**: Early infection may yield negative results before seroconversion; repeat testing is recommended if suspicion remains high [^115kRHaF].
- **HIV coinfection**: Serologic responses may be atypical; interpret results cautiously and consider alternative diagnostic methods if needed [^116e1xhx].

---

A positive Treponema IgG with a positive Treponema antibody test indicates current or past syphilis; **confirm activity with a quantitative nontreponemal test** [^1174SiHU] and correlate with clinical history to guide management.

### Screening for syphilis: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^1171hMYF]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Screening for syphilis infection is currently recommended for high-risk individuals, including those with previous syphilis infection, an infected sexual partner, HIV infection, or more than 4 sex partners in the preceding year.

Objective

To update a 2004 systematic review of studies of syphilis screening effectiveness, test accuracy, and screening harms in nonpregnant adults and adolescents.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through October 2015 and Ovid MEDLINE (January 2004 to October 2015), with updated search through March 2016.

Study Selection

English-language trials and observational studies of screening effectiveness, test accuracy, and screening harms in nonpregnant adults and adolescents.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

One investigator abstracted data, a second checked data for accuracy, and 2 investigators independently assessed study quality using predefined criteria.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Transmission of disease, including HIV; complications of syphilis; diagnostic accuracy; and harms of screening.

Results

No evidence was identified regarding the effectiveness of screening on clinical outcomes or the effectiveness of risk assessment instruments; the harms of screening; or the effectiveness of screening in average-risk, nonpregnant adolescents or adults or high-risk individuals other than men who have sex with men (MSM) or men who are HIV positive. Four non-US studies indicated higher rates of syphilis detection with screening every 3 months vs 6 or 12 months for early syphilis in HIV-positive men or MSM. For example, there was an increased proportion of asymptomatic, higher-risk MSM in Australia (n = 6789 consultations) receiving a diagnosis of early syphilis when tested every 3 months vs annually (53% vs 16%, P = .001), but no difference among low-risk MSM. Treponemal and nontreponemal tests were accurate in asymptomatic individuals (sensitivity > 85%, specificity > 91%) in 3 studies but required confirmatory testing. Reverse sequence testing with an initial automated treponemal test yielded more false reactive test results than with rapid plasma reagin in 2 studies, one with a low-prevalence US population (0.6% vs 0.0%, P = .03) and another in a higher-prevalence Canadian population (0.26% vs 0.13%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Screening HIV-positive men or MSM for syphilis every 3 months is associated with improved syphilis detection. Treponemal or nontreponemal tests are accurate screening tests but require confirmation. Research is needed on the effect of screening on clinical outcomes; effective screening strategies, including reverse sequence screening, in various patient populations; and harms of screening.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV-associated late latent syphilis — serologic response monitoring is advised using non-treponemal tests at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, aiming for at least a four-fold decline in titer if initially high (≥ 1:32) within 12 to 24 months; most with low initial titers may remain serofast without a four-fold decline, and sustained clinical symptoms or a sustained four-fold increase in non-treponemal titers should prompt consideration of treatment failure or re-infection.

The pooled sensitivity for prospective studies was 87.7% (95% CI, 71.8–97.2%) and the pooled specificity was 96.7% (95% CI, 91.9–99.2%) (Table 2). For the 4 prospective studies identified in the literature, the sensitivity was lower than that in all of the 5 FDA studies and with wide CIs. We pooled the results from those 4 prospective studies identified from the literature in a random-effects model and found a sensitivity of 68.6% (95% CI, 35.0–90.9%) and a specificity of 95.2% (95% CI, 84.4–99.2%). In addition, we pooled the results from just the prospective CLIA and FDA studies using a random-effects model and found the sensitivity to be 95.2% (95% CI, 83.6–99.7%) and the specificity to be 96.8% (95% CI, 87.1–99.8%).

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^114KDEjc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

This report provides new CDC recommendations for tests that can support a diagnosis of syphilis, including serologic testing and methods for the identification of the causative agent Treponema pallidum. These comprehensive recommendations are the first published by CDC on laboratory testing for syphilis, which has traditionally been based on serologic algorithms to detect a humoral immune response to T. pallidum. These tests can be divided into nontreponemal and treponemal tests depending on whether they detect antibodies that are broadly reactive to lipoidal antigens shared by both host and T. pallidum or antibodies specific to T. pallidum, respectively. Both types of tests must be used in conjunction to help distinguish between an untreated infection or a past infection that has been successfully treated. Newer serologic tests allow for laboratory automation but must be used in an algorithm, which also can involve older manual serologic tests. Direct detection of T. pallidum continues to evolve from microscopic examination of material from lesions for visualization of T. pallidum to molecular detection of the organism. Limited point-of-care tests for syphilis are available in the United States; increased availability of point-of-care tests that are sensitive and specific could facilitate expansion of screening programs and reduce the time from test result to treatment. These recommendations are intended for use by clinical laboratory directors, laboratory staff, clinicians, and disease control personnel who must choose among the multiple available testing methods, establish standard operating procedures for collecting and processing specimens, interpret test results for laboratory reporting, and counsel and treat patients. Future revisions to these recommendations will be based on new research or technologic advancements for syphilis clinical laboratory science.

### Gamete and embryo donation guidance [^114EVmPc]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Gamete and embryo donation — management of donor laboratory results states that a positive test should be verified before notifying the potential donor, and individuals who initially test positive (except for treated syphilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or Chlamydia trachomatis) are not eligible for nondirected donations; for syphilis screening, those who are positive or reactive on a nontreponemal test and negative or nonreactive on a specific treponemal confirmatory test may be determined eligible, whereas a donor positive or reactive on a specific treponemal confirmatory test or on a treponemal screening test is not eligible; donors positive for syphilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or Chlamydia trachomatis should be treated, retested, and deferred for 12 months, with no further deferral if treatment occurred > 12 months ago and was successful; individuals with active CMV infection, defined by positive culture or paired sera showing a four-fold rise in IgG with IgM at least 30% of the IgG level, should be excluded, though insemination with semen from a CMV-seropositive man without active infection is permissible when the female partner is also CMV-seropositive or after informed consent from a seronegative woman, and the associated risk of newborn CMV infection is approximately 1%.

Table 3
Cross-reactivity analysis of three commercial IgG T. pallidum immunoassays with serum samples from individuals affected by unrelated infections

The assessment of imprecision between all three commercial tests is shown in a Venn diagram in Figure 2. The highest Cohen's kappa index (κ) was obtained for ELISA + VDRL [κ = 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96–1.00)], followed by ELISA + FTA-ABS [κ = 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93–0.99)] and FTA-ABS + VDRL [κ = 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91–0.98)]. In general, all tests showed high diagnostic performance in serologic recharacterization and discriminated well between positive and negative samples for syphilis.

Figure 2.
Venn diagram evaluating the imprecision of three commercial IgG T. pallidum immunoassays for the diagnosis of syphilis using anti- T. pallidum -positive samples (all clinical stages; n = 187).

The performances of the traditional and reverse algorithms were also evaluated. In the traditional algorithm, the VDRL test result excluded the disease in four (2.1%) of 187 anti- T. pallidum -positive samples. Subsequently, five (2.7%) and 177 (97.3%) samples tested negative and positive, respectively, using the FTA-ABS test. All five samples that tested negative with the FTA-ABS test proved positive when tested with the ELISA. Using the reverse algorithm, the FTA-ABS test diagnosed seven (3.7%) anti- T. pallidum -positive samples as negative. The other 180 correctly diagnosed anti- T. pallidum -positive samples were tested with the VDRL test, which confirmed positivity in 178 (98.9%) samples. Two anti- T. pallidum -positive samples that tested negative by the VDRL test proved positive by the ELISA. Diagnostic parameters were compared regarding sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, but no differences were found between the two screening algorithms (Figure 3). Almost perfect agreement was found between the traditional and reverse algorithms (κ = 0.97 [95% CI, 0.94–0.99]).

### Clinical test performance of a rapid point-of-care syphilis treponemal antibody test: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111AUT92]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Most (4/5) of the laboratory-based studies were from the FDA clearance application and all used sera. The pooled sensitivity from the laboratory evaluations was 98.5% (95% CI, 92.1–100%) and the pooled specificity was 95.9% (95% CI, 81.5–100.0%) (Table 3). The laboratory study identified in the literature had the lowest sensitivity compared with the FDA laboratory evaluations.

Of the prospective studies, 4 had reference testing algorithms that included or were stratified by nontreponemal test results (Table 4). Each study used rapid plasma reagin (RPR), a nontreponemal test, in their diagnostic algorithm: Matthias et al and Nakku-Joloba et al had data available on RPR reactivity such that we were able to stratify the results to define positivity as those both RPR and treponemal reference test reactive and nonreactive as those both RPR and treponemal reference test nonreactive in Table 4. Fakile et al also defined positivity as both RPR and treponemal reference test reactive and defined negative as those RPR and treponemal reference test nonreactive, RPR reactive and treponemal reference as nonreactive, or RPR nonreactive and treponemal reference test reactive. The CLIA waiver study used an antitreponemal chemiluminescent immunoassay (CIA) as a screening test and confirmed it with RPR. If the RPR was nonreactive, the T. pallidum particle agglutination assay was used as the tiebreaker. With those reference algorithms, sensitivity improved to a pooled sensitivity of 97.0% (95% CI, 94.8–98.6%).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112dQCGL]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Reverse-sequence algorithm — most people who have reactive treponemal tests will have reactive tests for the remainder of their lives, regardless of adequate treatment or disease activity and do not predict treatment response. Some laboratories have initiated a reverse-sequence screening algorithm using treponemal EIA or CIA as a screening test, followed by a reflex-quantitative nontreponemal test if the EIA or CIA is positive. This reverse-sequence algorithm can identify people previously treated for syphilis, those with untreated or incompletely treated syphilis, and those with false-positive results that can occur with a low likelihood of infection. People with a positive treponemal screening test should have a standard quantitative nontreponemal test with titer performed reflexively by the laboratory to guide patient management decisions. In the reverse-sequence screening strategy, having a positive treponemal EIA or CIA and a negative reflex-quantitative nontreponemal test requires a second treponemal test (based on different antigens from the initial test) to confirm the results of the positive initial treponemal test.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^1135ReBz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Following presentation of the published test performance data at the national consultation, it was noted that many of the treponemal immunoassays had little or no data on test performance published in the peer-reviewed literature. Therefore, for the treponemal immunoassays, we obtained 510(k) Premarket Notification data submitted to the FDA and also abstracted these data into the Tables of Evidence.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^1114fkEy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL from 1960 to 30 June 2017. Following the consultation in November 2017, we subsequently updated the literature search from July 2017 to September 2018 using the following search terms: (Treponema pallidum OR Neurosyphilis OR Syphilis) AND (sero-diagnos* OR serodiagnos* OR (serolog* AND (test* OR exam* OR assay* OR screen* OR lab* OR diagnos* OR nontreponemal OR treponemal OR algorithm* OR antibody titer) OR serofast)). The search was limited to human studies published in English.

The initial search yielded n = 4851 nonduplicated abstracts. We excluded n = 4504 abstracts that were not relevant to the key question: studies of nontreponemal testing only, animal studies, direct detection studies, review articles, guidelines, letters to the editor, and other publications that were not primary research studies. We reviewed 347 abstracts, and further excluded n = 230 studies that described obsolete tests only, tests not approved by the FDA, those that used a gold standard based exclusively on non-FDA approved tests, studies of prevalence or laboratory technique only (no test performance), any duplicate publications, and abstracts without a full manuscript. After exclusions, 117 full papers were reviewed for potential inclusion, 81 studies with either descriptive data on use of treponemal tests or actual test performance data were abstracted into Tables of Evidence (Supplementary Table)

Studies with test performance data were prioritized according to their relevance to the key question (Supplementary Table). Studies of high relevance were those with clinically characterized specimens, stratified by stage of syphilis (with/without use of dark-field microscopy for diagnosis of primary syphilis), and included studies that utilized syphilis specimens from commercial or CDC serum banks. Studies of moderate relevance were those with clinically characterized specimens but no stratification by stage (all patients with syphilis analyzed together). Lower relevance studies were those that used a laboratory reference standard only (single or multiple tests) without clinical characterization, and also include studies where clinical characterization could not be assessed or was not performed uniformly across specimens. Studies of high and moderate relevance were abstracted into tables of test performance, and the range of sensitivity and specificity estimates from all studies was abstracted. If only a single study was available for a particular assay, the proportions (n/N) and 95% confidence intervals were abstracted.

### Is serological testing a reliable tool in laboratory diagnosis of syphilis? Meta-analysis of eight external quality control surveys performed by the German infection serology proficiency testing program [^1156mc97]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

The accuracy of diagnostic tests is critical for successful control of epidemic outbreaks of syphilis. The reliability of syphilis serology in the nonspecialist laboratory has always been questioned, but actual data dealing with this issue are sparse. Here, the results of eight proficiency testing sentinel surveys for diagnostic laboratories in Germany between 2000 and 2003 were analyzed. Screening tests such as Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (mean accuracy, 91.4% [qualitative], 75.4% [quantitative]), Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (mean accuracy, 98.1% [qualitative], 82.9% [quantitative]), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (mean qualitative accuracy, 95%) were more reliable than Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) testing (mean accuracy, 89.6% [qualitative], 71.1% [quantitative]), the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) (mean accuracy, 88% [qualitative], 65.8% [quantitative]), and immunoblot assays (mean qualitative accuracy, 87.3%). Clearly, immunoglobulin M (IgM) tests were more difficult to manage than IgG tests. False-negative results for samples that have been unambiguously determined to be IgM and anti-lipoid antibody positive accounted for 4.7% of results in the IgM ELISA, 6.9% in the VDRL test, 18.5% in the IgM FTA-ABS, and 23.0% in the IgM immunoblot assay. For negative samples, the mean percentage of false-positive results was 4.1% in the VDRL test, 5.4% in the IgM ELISA, 0.7% in the IgM FTA-ABS, and 1.4% in the IgM immunoblot assay. On average, 18.3% of participants misclassified samples from patients with active syphilis as past infection without indicating the need for further treatment. Moreover, 10.2% of laboratories wrongly reported serological evidence for active infection in samples from patients with past syphilis or in sera from seronegative blood donors. Consequently, the continuous participation of laboratories in proficiency testing and further standardization of tests is strongly recommended to achieve better quality of syphilis serology.

Diagnosis — Serologic testing strategy involves screening for nontreponemal antibodies with confirmation of reactive tests by treponemal-based assays; a serologic diagnosis is based on nontreponemal tests (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] and rapid plasma reagin [RPR]), followed by confirmation with treponemal tests including T. pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) and enzyme immunoassays (EIAs).

### The laboratory diagnosis of syphilis [^113GVPW5]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Syphilis is a multisystem infection caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Currently, cases of possible syphilis are commonly investigated using the treponemal serological tests T. pallidum IgG chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) and the T. pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA). The nontreponemal rapid plasma reagin (RPR) flocculation test is used to assess disease activity. There has been a resurgence of syphilis diagnoses in Australia. Large foci of infection have been identified in isolated communities. The remoteness of these locations, in conjunction with the particular sociocultural characteristics of the population, pose unique challenges to the traditional diagnostic and treatment paradigms for syphilis. As a consequence of this increased incidence of syphilis, there has been interest in the utility of point-of-care tests (POCTs), nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), the role of IgM testing in suspected congenital syphilis, and the laboratory investigation of possible neurosyphilis. This review looks at the current status of traditional serological assays and provides an update on more recent methods. It assesses the published literature in this area and makes recommendations for the rational use of pathology testing to aid in the diagnosis of the many facets of syphilis.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^115Kq5vW]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Treponemal tests target specific T. pallidum antigens, either intact or sonicated T. pallidum or defined recombinant proteins; these tests were traditionally used to confirm that a reactive nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) test is the result of T. pallidum infection. Treponemal antibodies generally persist after treatment and cannot be used to distinguish between a current infection or a previously treated infection. None of the nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) or treponemal tests can distinguish infections caused by other T. pallidum subspecies. Multiple capillary whole blood immunoassays for which the specimen is collected by skin puncture have been developed as rapid tests and might offer diagnostic utility in clinical, public health, or nonclinical settings. Direct detection tests of T. pallidum are limited to darkfield microscopic examination of lesion fluids, staining of lesion fluid or exudate smears or tissue sections obtained by biopsy for treponemal spirochetes, or amplification of specific nucleic acid sequences by validated laboratory-developed tests.

### Mathematical modeling of programmatic requirements for yaws eradication [^114ghqcF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

We modeled a range of estimates of R 0 from 1.08 to 3.32 based on seroprevalence data and expert opinion. Given the substantial influence of these estimates on the likely outcome of community mass treatment, further studies to better understand disease transmission and how this varies within and between endemic communities would be of value. Ideally, these studies would obtain community-level, age-specific seroprevalence data that could be used to calculate the force of infection. No perfect serologic marker can be used for this task. Traditional treponemal serology combines a treponemal test, which reflects lifetime exposure but remains positive for life, with a nontreponemal test, the titer of which rises and falls after treatment. It is therefore not possible to use seroprevalence data to distinguish persons who have been infected many times from those who have been infected once, and seroprevalence estimates are likely to underestimate the actual force of infection. For this study, we calculated the force of infection while relying on treponemal serology alone, which should provide a more accurate estimate of the force of infection than if we used dual-positive serology.

Traditional and Reverse Algorithms for Syphilis Screening

The traditional algorithm for syphilis serologic screening begins with a nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) test, and any reactive specimens are tested for confirmation by a treponemal test (Figure 3). This sequence has been widely used for decades because nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests were relatively inexpensive and treponemal tests were manual, labor intensive, more costly, and limited in number. However, automated treponemal immunoassays, which were originally cleared by FDA for blood bank screening, are now cleared by FDA for clinical screening, leading to the reverse sequence algorithm. Initial screening with an automated treponemal test of a sample with a positive result must be followed by a quantitative nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) test. When the reverse sequence algorithm is used, any discordant results should be adjudicated by a second treponemal assay (e.g. TPPA) that has a different format and includes different antigens.

### Syphilis testing, typing, and treatment follow-up: a new era for an old disease [^1139mB3Z]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The past 15 years have seen a dramatic increase in syphilis diagnoses in several regions including China, North America, Western Europe and Australia. Worldwide, the disease remains prevalent, contributing to substantial adult morbidity and neonatal mortality. Testing and treatment strategies are largely informed by data from the early antibiotic era, but increasing use of molecular diagnostics and new screening strategies could improve the management of syphilis substantially.

Recent Findings

The review explores new testing strategies for syphilis, including the importance of screening test selection and advances in point-of-care diagnostics. It then examines molecular studies of Treponema pallidum, covering typing; macrolide resistance; association between genotype and phenotype and the use of PCR in testing and monitoring strategies.

Summary

Clinicians should be aware of testing strategies employed by their laboratories to ensure optimal sensitivity and specificity. Locally available T. pallidum PCR assays may improve the diagnosis of early disease and inform antibiotic choice. Robust serologic follow-up is still required, but predictors of potential treatment failure, including PCR-measured bacterial load, have been identified. Re-treatment should be considered for patients in the serofast state. The publication of T. pallidum genomes would allow further and more detailed study of strains and disease pathogenesis.

We evaluated a prototype immunochromatographic strip (ICS) test for qualitative detection of Treponema pallidum antibodies in 353 sera from 157 patients. For sera from 43 syphilis patients, the ICSs were reactive, while for sera from 114 patients without syphilis, including 22 with biologically false-positive Rapid Plasma Reagin test results, the ICSs were nonreactive. The ICS test may expand the available options for serological testing for syphilis.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Syphilis serologic testing algorithm — treponemal screening with EIA/CIA: Some laboratories use an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA) as a screening test followed by a reflex-quantitative, non-treponemal test; if the treponemal screen is positive and the reflex non-treponemal test is negative, the laboratory should perform a second treponemal test to confirm the initial positive. If the second treponemal test is positive, persons with a history of previous treatment appropriate for the stage of syphilis will require no further treatment unless sexual risk history suggests likelihood of re-exposure, in which case a repeat non-treponemal test 2 to 4 weeks after the most recent possible exposure is recommended to evaluate for early infection. Those without a history of treatment for syphilis should be offered treatment; unless history or physical examination suggests a recent infection, previously untreated persons should be treated for late latent syphilis. If the second treponemal test is negative and the risk of syphilis is low, no treatment is indicated; if risk is high, a repeat non-treponemal test in 2 to 4 weeks is recommended to evaluate for early infection. In the absence of neurologic signs or symptoms, risk of neurosyphilis is low in persons with a reactive treponemal test and a non-reactive, non-treponemal test; examination of CSF is not recommended.

### How to interpret syphilis testing [^111YmFtC]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Rates of syphilis, including congenital syphilis, have been rising worldwide. Syphilis is particularly difficult to diagnose given its non-specific symptoms and the inability to culture Treponema pallidum on regular media. Therefore, various diagnostic methods and complementary testing algorithms have been devised with the aim of accurately diagnosing syphilis. These diagnostic methods include direct detection techniques, useful in diagnosing early primary syphilis before seroconversion, and serological testing divided into treponemal (TT) and non-treponemal (NTT) tests. TTs detect Treponema pallidum -specific antibodies but cannot differentiate active from past infections, while NTT titres correlate with disease activity. In neonates being evaluated for congenital syphilis, maternal antibody transfer complicates this interpretation, necessitating careful correlation with clinical findings and maternal history. We explore these aforementioned tests with cases highlighting how they can be used and interpreted in different clinical scenarios.

### Syphilis [^112dmXW2]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Syphilis is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum that is endemic in low-income countries and occurs at lower rates in middle-income and high-income countries. The disease is of both individual and public health importance and, in addition to its direct morbidity, increases risk of HIV infection and can cause lifelong morbidity in children born to infected mothers. Without treatment the disease can progress over years through a series of clinical stages and lead to irreversible neurological or cardiovascular complications. Although syphilis is an ancient disease and the principles of recommended management have been established for decades, diagnosis and management are often challenging because of its varied manifestations and difficulty in interpretation of serological tests used to confirm diagnosis and evaluate response to therapy. In North America and western Europe, incidence of syphilis has increased dramatically in the past decade among men who have sex with men, particularly those with coexistent HIV infection. Only one drug, penicillin, is recommended for syphilis treatment and response to therapy is assessed based on changes over months in serological test titres. Treatment for patients who cannot receive penicillin and management of patients who do not serologically respond to treatment are common clinical problems.

### Novel Treponema pallidum serologic tests: a paradigm shift in syphilis screening for the 21st century [^1176XFWj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The mainstay of diagnosis for Treponema pallidum infections is based on nontreponemal and treponemal serologic tests. Many new diagnostic methods for syphilis have been developed, using specific treponemal antigens and novel formats, including rapid point-of-care tests, enzyme immunoassays, and chemiluminescence assays. Although most of these newer tests are not yet cleared for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration, their performance and ease of automation have promoted their application for syphilis screening. Both sensitive and specific, new screening tests detect antitreponemal IgM and IgG antibodies by use of wild-type or recombinant T. pallidum antigens. However, these tests cannot distinguish between recent and remote or treated versus untreated infections. In addition, the screening tests require confirmation with nontreponemal tests. This use of treponemal tests for screening and nontreponemal serologic tests as confirmatory tests is a reversal of long-held practice. Clinicians need to understand the science behind these tests to use them properly in syphilis management.

### Treponema-specific tests for serodiagnosis of syphilis: comparative evaluation of seven assays [^115EPYXf]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of syphilis is challenging and often relies on serologic tests to detect treponemal or nontreponemal antibodies. Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Association of Public Health Laboratories proposed an update to the syphilis serology testing algorithm, in which serum samples are first tested using a treponema-specific test and positive samples are analyzed with a nontreponemal assay. The goal of this study was to compare the performance of seven treponemal assays (BioPlex 2200 syphilis IgG [Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA], fluorescent treponemal antibody [FTA] assay [Zeus Scientific, Raritan, NJ], Treponema pallidum particle agglutination [TP-PA; Fujirebio Diagnostics, Malvern, PA], Trep-Sure enzyme immunoassay [EIA; Phoenix Biotech, Oakville, Ontario, Canada], Trep-Chek EIA [Phoenix Biotech], Trep-ID EIA [Phoenix Biotech], and Treponema ViraBlot IgG [Viramed Biotech AG, Planegg, Germany]) using serum samples (n = 303) submitted to our reference laboratory. In addition to testing with these 7 assays, all samples were tested by a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) assay and a treponemal IgM Western blot assay (Viramed ViraBlot). Compared to the FTA assay as the gold standard, the evaluated treponemal tests demonstrated comparable levels of performance, with percent agreement ranging from 95.4% (95% confidence interval, 92.3 to 97.3) for the Trep-Sure EIA to 98.4% (96.1 to 99.4) for the Trep-ID EIA. Compared to a "consensus of the test panel" (defined as at least 4 of 7 treponemal tests being in agreement), the percent agreement ranged from 95.7% (92.7 to 97.5) for Trep-Sure to 99.3% (97.5 to 99.9) for Trep-ID. These data may assist clinical laboratories that are considering implementing a treponemal test for screening or confirmatory purposes.

### Clinical development and performance of the first to know syphilis self-test for over-the-counter usage: arapid test for treponemal antibody [^115sN1hJ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The laboratory diagnosis of syphilis is complex and necessitates a combination of clinical and laboratory criteria to differentiate current or past infection and absence of infection. Culture for T. pallidum is cumbersome and is available only in selected research laboratories, and there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared PCR test for syphilis at present. Darkfield microscopy is a direct detection test for T. pallidum that can diagnose early primary syphilis (sensitivity 75% to 100%); however, it requires samples from moist lesions or exudates, along with highly trained technicians and specialized equipment. It is not recommended for secondary syphilis due to low sensitivity. Serological testing remains the mainstay for diagnosing syphilis infection. Serology is divided into two different types of tests: non-treponemal tests (NTTs), such as the rapid plasma regain [RPR] test and the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and treponemal tests (TTs), such as the T. pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) and Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption (FTA-ABS). While TT is often positive for life, NTT titers usually decrease after treatment. However, in certain cases, especially in late stages of syphilis, non-treponemal antibodies may persist at low levels for extended periods. The traditional NTTs are cost-effective and useful for initial screening and monitoring of syphilis treatment; however, they can be affected by false-positive and false-negative results. TTs provide higher specificity and sensitivity for confirming syphilis but cannot effectively monitor the disease activity after treatment or differentiate between active and past infections. Thus, both TTs and NTTs have inherent limitations due to variability in their diagnostic performance, hampering syphilis control and prevention efforts in real-world settings. A single serologic NTT or TT is not sufficient for diagnosis, and therefore a combination of positive TT and reactive NTT is required for the diagnosis of syphilis infection. In the past, syphilis screening mainly followed a traditional testing algorithm, starting with NTT, and the positive results required further confirmation through more specific TTs. With increased availability of various treponemal-specific immunoassays including enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIAs), recently, many laboratories are increasingly adopting a "reverse sequence screening" algorithm, which begins the screening with a TT, followed by confirmation of the reactivity with an NTT. When the NTT is non-reactive, a second but different treponemal test is performed to determine if the first treponemal test was a false positive. Regardless of which algorithm is used, it is important to consider the sensitivity and specificity of these assays in clinically characterized sera, stratified by the stage of syphilis, and all screening results must be correlated with clinical diagnosis, which includes patients' symptoms, previous history, and sexual risk factors to make an accurate diagnosis.

### It is time to use treponema-specific antibody screening tests for diagnosis of syphilis [^116VwAbu]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Assays that detect treponema-specific antibodies, which are either automated or can be done as point-of-care tests, have been developed, some of which are FDA approved. These assays have the advantage of being easily performed and demonstrate high sensitivity, both key features of an infectious disease screening test. As a result, many high-volume clinical laboratories have begun to offer a reverse syphilis testing algorithm where a treponema-specific test is used for screening, followed by a nontreponemal test (i.e., rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) to assess disease activity and treatment status. Concerns about physicians being able to understand and apply this new testing algorithm have been expressed (8). In this point-counterpoint, Michael Loeffelholz of the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston explains why his laboratory has adopted this reverse algorithmic approach. Matthew Binnicker of the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, explains why the reverse algorithm may not be suitable for all clinical laboratories and every clinical situation.

The sensitivity of manual treponemal tests in primary syphilis has been estimated from studies that used reference standards such as darkfield microscopy (,–), clinical findings, or stored serum collected from patients staged as having primary syphilis, although the criteria used to stage the disease were not fully described (Supplementary Table 2). MHA-TP had a sensitivity of 53.0%, 72.5%, and 88.6% in studies that used darkfield microscopy as the reference standard. In studies that used stored sera collected from patients who were clinically classified as having primary syphilis, MHA-TP had a sensitivity of 45.9%, 64% and, 88.6%. A 2019 study involving 959 patients, 55 of whom were classified as having primary syphilis (on the basis of serology, physical findings, and positive or negative darkfield microscopy) reported a sensitivity of 78.2% (95% CI = 65.0%–88.2%) and 94.5% (95% CI = 84.9%–98.9%) for FTA-ABS and TPPA, respectively. Other studies with fewer patients, different reference standards, or both are more difficult to compare; sensitivities of FTA-ABS and TPPA have ranged from 88.4% to 100% and 86.2% to 100%, respectively, for primary syphilis (,–).

Congenital syphilis diagnosis in neonates — The standard serologic tests for syphilis are based on measurement of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, and because IgG in an infant reflects transplacental passively transferred maternal antibody, interpretation of reactive serologic tests for infants is difficult; all infants born to women with reactive nontreponemal and treponemal test results should be evaluated with a quantitative nontreponemal test (e.g. Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] slide test, rapid plasma reagin [RPR], the automated reagin test) from the infant and compared with the same test done at the same laboratory on the mother's serum; umbilical cord specimens should not be tested because of potential maternal blood contamination; specific treponemal tests such as fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) and T. pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) are not necessary to evaluate congenital syphilis in the neonate; there is no commercially available IgM test recommended for diagnostic use; some laboratories use treponemal tests for initial screening and nontreponemal tests for confirmation of positive specimens, however such an approach with congenital syphilis has not been published.

For each study identified from the literature review, based on the reported data, we manually retrieved or calculated the crude percent estimates of subjects with both reactive treponemal and reactive non-treponemal tests among subjects with reactive treponemal (Category 2) and among subjects with reactive non-treponemal (Category 3) tests and corresponding 95% CIs for the assessed outcomes. We summarized the percent estimates using random effects models, which take into account the presence of between-study heterogeneity into the calculations. This approach was chosen over a fixed effects model since the underlying syphilis prevalence and other factors were different in each population studied.

Treponemal Tests and Reverse Sequence Algorithm

The majority of patients who have reactive treponemal tests will have reactive tests for the remainder of their lives, regardless of adequate treatment or disease activity. However, 15%–25% of patients treated during the primary stage revert to being serologically nonreactive after 2–3 years. Treponemal antibody titers do not predict treatment response and therefore should not be used for this purpose.

Clinical laboratories sometimes screen syphilis serologic samples by using automated treponemal immunoassays, typically by EIA or CIA. This reverse sequence algorithm for syphilis testing can identify persons previously treated for syphilis, those with untreated or incompletely treated syphilis, and those with false-positive results that can occur with a low likelihood of infection. Persons with a positive treponemal screening test should have a standard quantitative nontreponemal test with titer performed reflexively by the laboratory to guide patient management decisions. If the nontreponemal test is negative, the laboratory should perform a treponemal test different from the one used for initial testing, preferably TP-PA or treponemal assay based on different antigens than the original test, to adjudicate the results of the initial test.

If a second treponemal test is positive (e.g. EIA reactive, RPR nonreactive, or TP-PA reactive), persons with a history of previous treatment will require no further management unless sexual history indicates a reexposure. In this instance, a repeat nontreponemal test 2–4 weeks after a confirmed medical history and physical examination is recommended to evaluate for early infection. Those without a history of treatment for syphilis should be offered treatment. Unless a medical history or results of a physical examination indicate a recent infection, previously untreated persons should be treated for syphilis of unknown duration or late latent syphilis.

If the second treponemal test is negative (e.g. EIA reactive, RPR nonreactive, TP-PA nonreactive) and the epidemiologic risk and clinical probability for syphilis are low, further evaluation or treatment is not indicated.

Multiple studies demonstrate that high quantitative index values or high signal-to-cutoff ratio from treponemal EIA or CIA tests correlate with TP-PA positivity, which might eliminate the need for additional confirmatory testing; however, the range of index values varies among different treponemal immunoassays, and the values that correspond to high levels of reactivity with confirmatory testing might differ by immunoassay (,–).

We reviewed relevant syphilis diagnostic literature and conducted a meta-analysis to address the question, "What is the sensitivity and specificity of the Syphilis Health Check, a rapid qualitative test for the detection of human antibodies to Treponema pallidum". The Syphilis Health Check is the only rapid syphilis test currently cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis using Bayesian bivariate random-effects and fixed-effect models to create pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the Syphilis Health Check. We identified 5 test evaluations published in the literature and 10 studies submitted to the FDA and for a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments waiver application. The pooled sensitivity (95% CI) from the laboratory evaluations (n = 5) was 98.5% (92.1–100%), while pooled specificity was 95.9% (81.5–100.0%). The pooled sensitivity for prospective studies (n = 10) was 87.7% (71.8–97.2%), while pooled specificity was 96.7% (91.9–99.2%). Using nontreponemal supplemental testing, the sensitivity improved to a pooled sensitivity of 97.0% (94.8–98.6%). The Syphilis Health Check may provide accurate detection of treponemal antibody.

### Evaluation of an enzyme immunoassay technique for detection of antibodies against Treponema pallidum [^113ZuaEH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

In the present study, the performance of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique (Eti-syphilis-G and Eti-syphilis-M; DiaSorin) for detection of Treponema pallidum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies for the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis was evaluated. Four hundred forty-one samples were studied. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were 100 and 93%, respectively, compared with the results of a microhemagglutination assay for Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP) and 99.4 and 100%, respectively, compared with the results of the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-Abs) test. The results of the ELISA technique were concordant with those of MHA-TP for 98% of the samples tested, while the rate of concordance with the FTA-Abs test was 99.5%. The sensitivities of the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, MHA-TP, and the ELISA in the different phases of syphilis compared with the results of the FTA-Abs test were 92, 88, and 100%, respectively, for patients with primary syphilis; 100% for all tests evaluated for patients with secondary syphilis; 97.2, 99.4, and 100%, respectively, for patients with latent syphilis; and 57.9, 92.6, and 97.9%, respectively, for patients with past treated syphilis. The RPR test was reactive with 12 samples that were negative by all the specific tests. IgM antibodies were most frequently detected by the ELISA for IgM antibodies (32.8%) than by the FTA-Abs for IgM antibodies (28.4%). Detection of these antibodies by the FTA-Abs test and the ELISA for IgM antibodies decreased with the stage of disease (72 and 88%, respectively, for patients with primary syphilis to 17 and 19%, respectively, for patients with early latent syphilis). The high sensitivity and specificity of this ELISA technique during all stages of syphilis, together with the fact that it is a simple, objective, and easily automated method, lead us to believe that it could be used as a screening test for syphilis.

### Serological testing for syphilis in the differential diagnosis of cognitive decline and polyneuropathy in geriatric patients [^1169FTzD]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In the 19th century, neurosyphilis was the most frequent cause of dementia in Western Europe. Now dementia caused by syphilis has become rare in Germany. We studied whether routine testing of patients with cognitive abnormalities or neuropathy for antibodies against Treponema pallidum has therapeutic consequences in geriatric patients.

Methods

A Treponema pallidum electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (TP-ECLIA) is routinely performed in all in-patients treated at our institution with cognitve decline or neuropathy and no or insufficient previous diagnostic workup. Patients with a positive TP-ECLIA treated from October 2015 to January 2022 (76 months) were retrospectively evaluated. In cases of positive TP-ECLIA, further specific laboratory investigations were performed to assess whether antibiotic therapy was indicated.

Results

In 42 of 4116 patients (1.0%), TP-ECLIA detected antibodies directed against Treponema in serum. Specifity of these antibodies was ensured by immunoblot in 22 patients (11×positiv, 11×borderline values). Treponema-specific IgM was detectable in the serum of one patient, in 3 patients the Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test, a modified Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL), in serum was positiv. CSF analysis was performed in 10 patients. One patient had CSF pleocytosis. In 2 other patients, the Treponema-specific IgG antibody index was elevated. 5 patients received antibiotic therapy (4×ceftriaxone 2 g/d i.v., 1×doxycycline 300 mg/d p.o.).

Conclusion

In approx. 1‰ of patients with previously undiagnosed or not sufficiently diagnosed cognitive decline or neuropathy, the diagnostic workup for active syphilis resulted in a course of antibiotic treatment.

### Clinical development and performance of the first to know syphilis self-test for over-the-counter usage: arapid test for treponemal antibody [^1115DHXr]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Concurrent positivity in both RPR and treponemal tests is typically associated with active syphilis infections. In the present study, notably, the First To Know Syphilis Test was positive in 95.2% of the cases that were positive by both treponemal and RPR tests. This finding suggests its strong potential to detect most of the active infections, although as a treponemal test, it cannot distinguish between active and past infections on its own, and the diagnosis requires a combination of treponemal and non-treponemal tests. It has been shown that the sensitivity of treponemal tests increases with higher RPR titers. Consistently, analysis of the First To Know Test in relation to RPR titers revealed that the test sensitivity increased with higher RPR titers, reaching 100% at titers of 1:8 and above. These findings suggest that the First To Know Test is effective across a broad range of RPR titers, with particularly enhanced sensitivity in cases more likely to reflect infectious syphilis. These results, coupled with the data demonstrating its ability to detect all known positive samples from clinically staged syphilis patients, highlight the potential of this OTC test as a rapid screening tool capable of detecting most active infections and different disease stages across various clinical and community settings. This is consistent with the test's design to detect all antibody types, treponemal IgM, IgG, and IgA, which vary in their temporal expression during infection. While these findings are promising, further studies are needed to comprehensively evaluate its performance specifically in active syphilis cases.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: a retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^114dRP6p]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent review suggested that the sensitivity and specificity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and chemiluminescent assays (CLIAs) may be comparable to agglutination assays. Updated national guidelines in regions where TPPA has been discontinued suggest that confirmatory testing may be performed with treponemal ELISA/CLIA. However, to maximize specificity, testing and confirmation with two treponemal assays with different antigens is recommended. There are many commercially available treponemal ELISA/CLIA, most using recombinant treponemal antigens (Tp15, Tp17, and Tp47) to detect IgM and/or IgG antibodies. However, since most of these assays share a common antigen (Tp17), selecting a confirmatory test with distinct antigens can be difficult. Additionally, these assays often require significant specimen volumes, making them impractical as a third test in syphilis serology, particularly in pediatric testing, where sample volumes are often low. Further, many of these assays require expensive instruments, making them unfeasible for smaller clinical laboratories due to high initial costs and ongoing maintenance.

Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the performance of alternative syphilis confirmatory assays, including four Treponema pallidum hemagglutination tests (TPHAs) and one T. pallidum IgG ELISA, to address knowledge gaps in confirmatory testing pathways. Our work provides valuable data on the performance of syphilis serology assays, helping to improve testing strategies and address limitations in current diagnostic practices.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^115vMLz9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

This report provides new CDC recommendations for tests that can support a diagnosis of syphilis, including serologic testing and methods for the identification of the causative agent Treponema pallidum. These comprehensive recommendations are the first published by CDC on laboratory testing for syphilis, which has traditionally been based on serologic algorithms to detect a humoral immune response to T. pallidum. These tests can be divided into nontreponemal and treponemal tests depending on whether they detect antibodies that are broadly reactive to lipoidal antigens shared by both host and T. pallidum or antibodies specific to T. pallidum, respectively. Both types of tests must be used in conjunction to help distinguish between an untreated infection or a past infection that has been successfully treated. Newer serologic tests allow for laboratory automation but must be used in an algorithm, which also can involve older manual serologic tests. Direct detection of T. pallidum continues to evolve from microscopic examination of material from lesions for visualization of T. pallidum to molecular detection of the organism. Limited point-of-care tests for syphilis are available in the United States; increased availability of point-of-care tests that are sensitive and specific could facilitate expansion of screening programs and reduce the time from test result to treatment. These recommendations are intended for use by clinical laboratory directors, laboratory staff, clinicians, and disease control personnel who must choose among the multiple available testing methods, establish standard operating procedures for collecting and processing specimens, interpret test results for laboratory reporting, and counsel and treat patients. Future revisions to these recommendations will be based on new research or technologic advancements for syphilis clinical laboratory science.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116e1xhx]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Traditional algorithm — syphilis serologic testing in people with HIV emphasizes paired testing and consistent methods: Rapid treponemal assays are available to screen for syphilis; however, these tests can not differentiate recent or past infection, so testing with a nontreponemal test is indicated to inform further patient management, and use of only one type of serologic test (nontreponemal or treponemal) is insufficient for diagnosis and can yield false-negative or false-positive results. Individuals with a reactive nontreponemal test should always receive a treponemal test to confirm the syphilis diagnosis, and nontreponemal test antibody titers can correlate with disease activity and are used for monitoring treatment response. Sequential serologic tests should be performed using the same testing method (VDRL or RPR), preferably by the same laboratory; VDRL and RPR are equally valid assays, quantitative results from the two tests cannot be compared directly, and RPR titers frequently are slightly higher than VDRL titers. Nontreponemal test titers usually decrease after treatment and can become nonreactive with time, but antibodies might decrease less than fourfold after treatment or might decline appropriately but fail to serorevert and persist; atypical nontreponemal serologic test results might occur regardless of HIV status. When serologic tests do not correspond with clinical findings indicative of primary, secondary, or latent syphilis, presumptive treatment is recommended for people with risk factors for syphilis, and use of other tests (e.g., biopsy for histology and immunostaining and PCR of lesion) should be considered; for most people with HIV, serologic tests are accurate and reliable for diagnosing syphilis and evaluating response to treatment.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1147h6yf]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for syphilis, more specifically with respect to patients with congenital syphilis, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend to do not offer routine treatment in patients with unlikely congenital syphilis. Obtain serologic monitoring in infants with reactive non-treponemal tests to ensure the non-treponemal test returns to negative. Consider administering benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg as a single IM injection, particularly if follow-up is uncertain and the neonate has a reactive non-treponemal test.

### Screening for syphilis infection in nonpregnant adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^117NZuKb]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Syphilis screening tests — methods and application in low-risk populations are described: "Currently syphilis screening tests rely on detection of antibodies rather than direct detection of the organism that causes syphilis, Treponema pallidum". "A traditional screening algorithm is a 2-step process" using an initial nontreponemal test (VDRL or rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) followed by a confirmatory treponemal antibody detection test (T pallidum particle agglutination [TP-PA]). "A more recently developed reverse sequence algorithm uses an automated treponemal test (eg, enzyme-linked or chemiluminescence immunoassay) for the initial screening, followed by a nontreponemal test for reactive samples". For nonpregnant persons "who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection", "the yield of screening is likely low" and "screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment".

### Improving the coverage and accuracy of syphilis testing: the development of a novel rapid, point-of-care test for confirmatory testing of active syphilis infection and its early evaluation in China and South Africa [^1166UWnb]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Third, current treponemal serological tests for syphilis use native or recombinant Treponema pallidum antigens to detect IgM and IgG antibodies to treponemal components. They are more sensitive than non-treponemal tests for all stages of syphilis but cannot distinguish active from past-treated infection and therefore, cannot be used to monitor the effectiveness of syphilis treatment. Our study findings showed that the TP-IgA POCT is highly sensitive, able to distinguish between active and past infections and can potentially be used for monitoring treatment outcomes. It will also be of interest to determine the persistence of IgA antibodies in patients with non-venereal treponemal infections such as non-venereal trepanematoses, which may confound results especially in young subjects from endemic regions. These particular applications of the TP-IgA POCT, however, need to be further examined in prospective, longitudinal field studies with a final manufactured version of the device. Future studies should also evaluate diagnostic performance of the test for congenital syphilis and in individuals who have become reinfected as people with repeated episodes of syphilis (e.g. key population at high risk of STIs such as men who have sex with men) may have different immunological responses compared to those with initial infection.

The present studies have some limitations. First, for the China study we were unable to source the DPP tests to perform a head-to-head comparison with the TP-IgA POCT in identifying active and/or past/treated syphilis from a pool of pre-characterised stored plasma samples as originally planned. This makes us unable to draw conclusion on the potential advantage of the TP-IgA POCT compared to the DPP test in distinguishing between active syphilis and past/treated infections. Future study to directly compare the two tests for this purpose is needed. Second, for the South Africa study, there was a low prevalence of active and/or past/treated syphilis among the study population and no clinical data were collected so that the categorisation of syphilis status was solely based on serological tests, which introduces some uncertainty and limits the generalisation of study findings. Third, both studies were conducted in a laboratory environment with trained technical staff and using venous blood (either fresh or plasma) rather than finger-prick samples that would be more likely to be used in field settings. Therefore, future studies are needed to examine diagnostic accuracy of the TP-IgA POCT, as performed by health care worker in clinical settings, with different sample types.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^113ZfvZu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We conducted a systematic review of relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address the question, "What is the sensitivity and specificity of the treponemal tests currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the diagnosis of syphilis (by stage)?" There were 16 treponemal assays evaluated: 13 immunoassays and 3 manual assays (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test [FTA-ABS], microhemagglutination assay for Treponema pallidum antibodies [MHA-TP], Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay [TP-PA]). MHA-TP and FTA-ABS were less sensitive in primary and secondary syphilis than TP-PA; TP-PA is the most specific manual treponemal assay. There is insufficient evidence to recommend one particular treponemal immunoassay (eg, enzyme immunoassays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, microbead immunoassays) over another based on published performance data. For diagnosis of neurosyphilis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) TP-PA has similar performance to CSF FTA-ABS in studies with patients with definitive or presumptive neurosyphilis. However, CSF treponemal testing has limitations in its sensitivity and specificity and should be interpreted within the context of the clinical scenario, additional CSF test results and syphilis prevalence.

### Syphilis infection prevalence in the middle east and north Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113yVSsU]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the complexities and limitations in interpreting these serological test results, each category was assigned a general interpretation, for epidemiological relevance. As such, the following categories, based on different serological test results combinations, were used for infection type: 1) probable current (active) syphilis infection (positive both treponemal and non-treponemal tests), 2) possible current infection, unspecified (positive non-treponemal test, irrespective of treponemal test result if done), 3) lifetime syphilis infection (positive treponemal test, irrespective of non-treponemal test result if done), and 4) unclear if the diagnostic test used was not reported or not adequately described. These categories, their description, interpretation in terms of syphilis diagnosis, and limitations in this interpretation are further described in Table S2.

Whenever available in a report, we extracted all prevalence measures corresponding to these infection/serological test categories. Consequently, one report could contribute prevalence measures for more than one syphilis infection type. This approach enabled us to utilize the maximum information possible from the testing done in each study.

Ideally, probable current syphilis infection diagnosis (category 1) would entail non-treponemal antibody titers to disentangle individuals with a past, adequately treated infection. However, this information was rarely reported in the studies we identified. Most countries of the MENA region are low- or middle-income countries with limited resources and inadequate laboratory capacity where qualitative non-treponemal tests are most commonly used. It was therefore not possible to include antibodies titers as part of the classification of diagnostics in our study. A positive result on both non-treponemal and treponemal tests without titers is considered, as per WHO screening guidelines, the indicator of choice for probable current syphilis infection, and is the definition used in previous global systematic reviews.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^1173eFEr]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

No published data are available that examined whether reversion to a nonreactive treponemal test occurs with an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or a chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIA) after treatment for syphilis. Treponemal tests, unlike nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests, cannot be used to monitor response to therapy because they remain reactive indefinitely. In patients with a history of treated syphilis and reactive treponemal test results, additional treponemal testing is not helpful for detecting reinfection and is not recommended. In this case, nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) testing titers along with clinical history of syphilis, physical examination, and sexual risk assessment, including contact history, must be used to determine infection status.

Manual treponemal tests include FTA-ABS, TPPA, Captia Syphilis IgG EIA, Trep-Sure EIA, and Zeus Scientific EIA. Manual assays are typically used as reflex tests to confirm reactive nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) specimens in the traditional testing algorithm. The FTA-ABS test is based on florescence microscopy and uses a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antihuman immunoglobulin to detect antibody binding to whole T. pallidum that has been fixed on a glass slide. TPPA is an indirect agglutination assay with T. pallidum antigens bound to gelatin particles.

The manual TPHA and MHA-TP tests are no longer available for in vitro diagnostics in the United States but are still used in certain international settings. TPHA and MHA-TP are indirect agglutination with T. pallidum antigens bound to avian or ovine erythrocytes. MHA-TP is a microplate version of TPHA.

As of December 31, 2021, a total of 12 FDA-cleared automated treponemal immunoassays were available for clinical use, including EIA, CIA, and multiplex flow (microbead) immunoassays (MFIA). In contrast to the manual assays, the treponemal immunoassays are often run as the initial test in a reverse sequence screening algorithm. All FDA-cleared treponemal tests can be performed on serum; certain tests also can be performed on plasma, including heparin, EDTA, and citrate plasma. Certain laboratories also have also validated use of treponemal tests with dried blood spots (DBS); however, no available tests have been cleared by FDA for this specimen type, nor have data been published on DBS specimens collected in the United States to aid in the diagnosis of syphilis.

### Sexually acquired syphilis: laboratory diagnosis, management, and prevention [^115B3dvk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The methods used for the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis include direct detection of Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum and serologic testing. Serologic testing relies on both nontreponemal and treponemal tests. In newly developed reverse-sequence screening algorithms, treponemal tests are performed before nontreponemal tests. The management of syphilis requires appropriate staging, treatment, and follow-up of patients along with the prompt reporting of infections to public health authorities to assist with prevention and control efforts. Benzathine penicillin G remains the treatment of choice for all stages of syphilis. Screening of populations at higher risk for syphilis is recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Preventive Services Task Force, and the World Health Organization. The second article in this continuing medical education series reviews the testing for and the management of sexually acquired syphilis.

### An evaluation of a novel dual treponemal / nontreponemal point-of-care test for syphilis as a tool to distinguish active from past treated infection [^112kwTiW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Most syphilis point-of-care (POC) tests detect treponemal antibodies, which persist after successful treatment. Subsequent POC tests are positive, despite no active infection, and can lead to unnecessary treatment. We evaluated a new POC test, incorporating a nontreponemal component, to distinguish active from past infection.

Methods

Sera stored at 2 Australian laboratories were tested with DPP Screen and Confirm Assay. Treponemal and nontreponemal test lines were compared to corresponding conventional treponemal and nontreponemal reference test results: immunoassays and rapid plasma reagin (RPR), respectively, with RPR quantification by endpoint titration. POC test outcome concordance with conventional test results was assessed according to serological and clinical categories.

Results

Among 1005 serum samples tested, DPP treponemal line sensitivity was 89.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 87.3%-91.9%) and specificity was 99.3% (95% CI, 97.0%-99.9%). DPP nontreponemal line sensitivity was 94.2% (95% CI, 91.8%-96.0%) and specificity was 62.2% (95% CI, 57.5%-66.6%). DPP test outcome (pair of test lines) was concordant with both reference test results for 94.3% of 404 high-titer infections, 90.1% of 121 low-titer infections, 27.5% of 211 past/treated infections, and 78.1% of 242 infections classified as not syphilis. Among 211 past/treated infections, 49.8% were incorrectly identified as active infection and a further 22.8% as not syphilis.

Conclusions

DPP test use would result in identification of > 93% of active syphilis infections, whereas just over half of past infections would be diagnosed as past or not syphilis, avoiding unnecessary treatment compared with other POC tests. This may be at the expense of missing some active infections; thus, its potential benefits will depend on the prevalence of past vs active infection in a population.

### Refining timely diagnosis of early syphilis by using Treponema pallidum PCR or IgM immunoblotting next to conventional serology for syphilis [^112KiXRY]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

IgM immunoblotting.

Because not all cases with suspected syphilis present with an ulcer, PCR cannot always be performed. Thus, we assessed whether an IgM immunoblot could supplement conventional serology to aid the diagnosis.

A subset of the test population (84/182 consultations [46%]) described above was additionally tested with an IgM immunoblot. We determined that both positive and indeterminate IgM blots should be considered positive, as this yielded highest sensitivity; 6/8 patients (75%) with indeterminate IgM blots had a clinical diagnosis of syphilis. Here, indeterminate blots are referred to as positive. One patient had a positive treponemal IgM/IgG screening result without confirmation with the nontreponemal tests, IgM immunoblot, or PCR. There was no follow-up consultation; therefore, the diagnosis remained uncertain. This patient was excluded from further analyses.

Initial analysis revealed that 2 of 14 samples tested for cross-reactivity showed a positive IgM immunoblot, i.e. 1 positive for EBV and 1 positive for CMV, with both being heterophile antibody positive. This is known to give nonspecific IgM reactivity in the IgM immunoblot.

Table 3 depicts the results of the IgM immunoblot in cases with either primary syphilis or reinfection, based on clinical assessment, IgG serology, and PCR. The characteristics of the IgM blot relative to the diagnosis are as follows: sensitivity, 80% (40/50 cases); specificity, 94% (31/33 cases); PPV, 95% (40/42 cases); NPV, 76% (31/41 cases). When the results are separated into those for suspected primary infections versus reinfections, the characteristics are as follows: for suspected primary infections, sensitivity, 91% (30/33 cases); specificity, 94% (30/32 cases); PPV, 94% (30/32 cases); NPV, 91% (30/33 cases); for reinfections, sensitivity, 59% (10/17 cases); specificity, 100% (1/1 case); PPV, 100% (10/10 cases); NPV, 13% (1/8 cases).

### Positive serological tests for syphilis and administration of intravenous immunoglobulin [^112ZotAK]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2007). Low credibility.

We report the case of a man who tested positive for syphilis following the intravenous administration of human normal immunoglobulin as part of the treatment of Guillain-Barré syndrome. The chronology of the testing suggested the passive acquisition of treponemal antibody. This phenomenon is not widely documented in the medical literature, but is a theoretical risk of treatment, and serves as a reminder to be cautious in the interpretation of such serological tests.

### Metaanalysis of the performance of a combined treponemal and nontreponemal rapid diagnostic test for syphilis and yaws [^114sT84v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

RDTs for treponemal infections are a relatively recent development; they allow wider access to diagnostic testing, particularly for communities where routine laboratory facilities are not available. RDTs facilitate improved screening, diagnosis, and treatment of syphilis in women presenting to antenatal clinics in low-resource settings and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with mother-to-child transmission of syphilis. For yaws, a RDT would be of value due to the low positive predictive value of clinical diagnosis alone. Validation and roll-out of a RDT would lead to improved epidemiological data on yaws worldwide, which is a priority in facilitating eradication.

A major limitation to most treponemal RDTs is that they are based on detection of treponemal-specific antibodies and therefore cannot distinguish between current and past infection. Resulting false positives lead to overtreatment of syphilis, as well as problems in interpreting epidemiological data for both syphilis and yaws. The Dual Path Platform (DPP-RDT) Syphilis Screen & Confirm test kit (Chembio, Medford, New York) is the first commercial RDT to give both a "treponemal" result and a "nontreponemal" result. Therefore, it can assist in distinguishing between current and past infection, which may make it a more useful test in clinical practice. The kit is a lateral flow assay that detects both immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies against a recombinant T. pallidum antigen and a nontreponemal antigen. Several recent publications have reported on the performance of this assay, noting good test performance; however, variations have been noted in the sensitivity and specificity of the nontreponemal component of the test in particular. To provide more accurate estimates of performance, we conducted an individual patient-level metaanalysis on the performance of the DPP-RDT for the diagnosis of both syphilis and yaws.

### Clinical test performance of a rapid point-of-care syphilis treponemal antibody test: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115B2Ge6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We reviewed relevant syphilis diagnostic literature and conducted a meta-analysis to address the question, "What is the sensitivity and specificity of the Syphilis Health Check, a rapid qualitative test for the detection of human antibodies to Treponema pallidum". The Syphilis Health Check is the only rapid syphilis test currently cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis using Bayesian bivariate random-effects and fixed-effect models to create pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the Syphilis Health Check. We identified 5 test evaluations published in the literature and 10 studies submitted to the FDA and for a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments waiver application. The pooled sensitivity (95% CI) from the laboratory evaluations (n = 5) was 98.5% (92.1–100%), while pooled specificity was 95.9% (81.5–100.0%). The pooled sensitivity for prospective studies (n = 10) was 87.7% (71.8–97.2%), while pooled specificity was 96.7% (91.9–99.2%). Using nontreponemal supplemental testing, the sensitivity improved to a pooled sensitivity of 97.0% (94.8–98.6%). The Syphilis Health Check may provide accurate detection of treponemal antibody.

1 Introduction

Syphilis is a curable sexually transmitted infection (STI), caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum (TP). Globally, an estimated six million new cases of syphilis are diagnosed annually, most of the infections occur in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) and congenital syphilis is not uncommon. An analysis on trend over time of syphilis in 132 countries showed that between 2012 and 2016, the prevalence of active syphilis in women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) had increased in 78 countries, of which 10 (13%) were substantive (≥ 10% proportionally, ≥ 0.10% percentage-point absolute difference and non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals in 2012 and 2016) whilst among 54 countries with observed decreased prevalence only five (9%) countries experienced a substantive decrease.

Treatment of syphilis is relatively simple, effective and inexpensive with one dose of Benzathine penicillin. However, diagnosis of active syphilis, particularly in LMICs, is often challenging due to the persistence of IgG antibodies to TP after prior treated syphilis infections, which necessitates a combination of treponemal (e.g. TPHA, TPPA) and non-treponemal (e.g. RPR) tests to distinguish active from past treated infections. Availability and introduction of point-of-care tests (POCTs) has increased access to testing for syphilis; however, current POCTs for serological diagnosis of syphilis only detect IgG or both IgG and IgM antibodies specific to TP. It is known that serological tests based on IgG cannot distinguish between active and treated infections, and IgM tests can be highly sensitive in symptomatic patients but have suboptimal sensitivity in asymptomatic cases.

### Pruritic, erythematous, arcuate, and serpiginous smooth plaques [^112R8QUn]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which lab test can be used to monitor treatment response?
A. Rapid plasma reagin
B. Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS)
C. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels
D. Treponema pallidum enzyme immunoassay (IgG)
E. Chemiluminescence immunoassay

Answers:
A. Rapid plasma regain – Correct. Nontreponemal tests such as rapid plasma regain, venereal disease research laboratory, and toluidine red unheated serum tests are traditionally used as initial screening tests but also as the main way of monitoring a patient's response to treatment due to their quantitative results. Successful therapy will be indicated by a decline in antibody titers.
B. FTA-ABS – Incorrect. FTA-ABS is a qualitative treponemal test, thus providing no useful tracking of treatment response. The FTA-ABS assay is thought to be most sensitive in primary syphilis.
C. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels – Incorrect. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels correlate with disease severity and activity in response to treatment in sarcoidosis, not syphilis.
D. Treponema pallidum enzyme immunoassay (IgG) – Incorrect. The T. pallidum enzyme immunoassay is also a treponemal test that has become a favorite of large laboratories as a screening test due to its lower cost compared with the others.
E. Chemiluminescence immunoassay – Incorrect. The chemiluminescence immunoassay is also a treponemal test. All treponemal tests are based upon the detection of antibodies directed against specific treponemal antigens and thus tend to be more specific than nontreponemal tests.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for syphilis, more specifically with respect to laboratory follow-up, serology, IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain serum testing at 1 month, 3 months, and every 6 months subsequently, ideally using the same non-treponemal test and performed in the same laboratory, continued until the non-treponemal test becomes negative or reaches a low plateau (1:1–1:4 sustained for 1 year in the absence of ongoing risk).

Syphilis testing interpretation in infants with or exposed to HIV — Treponemal tests should not be used to evaluate treatment response because results can remain positive despite effective therapy or be related to maternal infection. Passively transferred maternal treponemal antibodies can be present in infants until age 15 months, and a reactive treponemal test after age 18 months is diagnostic of congenital syphilis; if the nontreponemal test is non-reactive at that time, no further evaluation or treatment is necessary, whereas infants with a reactive nontreponemal test at age 18 months should be fully (re)evaluated and (re)treated for congenital syphilis (AIII).

### Clinical test performance of a rapid point-of-care syphilis treponemal antibody test: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115tngTH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The Syphilis Health Check (Diagnostics Direct, LLC, Stone Harbor, NJ) is a rapid qualitative test for detection of human antibodies to T. pallidum in serum, plasma, or whole blood. The test utilizes antihuman immunoglobulins gold conjugate and highly purified T. pallidum recombinant proteins for specific detection of anti– T. pallidum antibodies. That test detects both immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM using TP-15, TP-17, and TP-44 recombinant syphilis antigens. The test works by lateral flow of the sample through the absorbent device where, in the presence of T. pallidum antibodies, the antihuman immunoglobulins/protein dye conjugate binds to the human immunoglobulins forming an antigen–antibody complex. That complex produces a pink-colored band to indicate a reactive result. In the absence of anti– T. pallidum antibodies, no line is present in the reaction zone to indicate a nonreactive result. A reagent control mechanism is included in the test in which unbound conjugate binds to the reagents in the control zone producing a pink-colored band. This band must be present for the test to be valid.

To review the performance of the Syphilis Health Check we conducted a meta-analysis that combines data from all available evaluations of the Syphilis Health Check. We created pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity for the rapid test.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syphilis, more specifically with respect to confirmatory testing, IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that chemiluminescence immunoassay and treponemal enzyme immunoassay have suboptimal specificity, resulting in a low positive predictive value in low-prevalence population. Obtain additional reflex confirmatory testing by Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test or Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test if chemiluminescence immunoassay or treponemal enzyme immunoassay tests are used.

Purpose Of Review

Syphilis is rising globally, with resultant increases in morbidity and mortality that disproportionately impact underserved populations. Appropriate screening and testing for syphilis with accurate, reliable, affordable, and timely assays is crucial for combating this epidemic. This review provides a brief overview of laboratory methods for syphilis diagnosis, with a focus on recent updates in diagnostics and directions for future research.

Recent Findings

Syphilis can be complex and time-consuming to diagnose and stage appropriately. The historic use of darkfield microscopy for diagnosis has been eclipsed by algorithms that include both nontreponemal and treponemal antibody tests for screening and confirmation of active Treponema pallidum infection. Newer diagnostic modalities include nucleic acid amplification assays (NAATs) and point-of-care testing (POCT), which hold promise for increasing identification of active syphilis but have notable limitations. More work is needed to develop accurate, reliable, affordable, and expeditious tests to optimize syphilis diagnosis.

Summary

Algorithms utilizing a combination of serological treponemal and nontreponemal assays remain standard of care for the diagnosis of syphilis, but recently developed NAATs and POCT assays present opportunities to increase syphilis detection. Further research is warranted to improve upon these testing modalities and explore other markers that could aid in syphilis diagnosis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syphilis, more specifically with respect to confirmatory testing, IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain a reflex quantitative non-treponemal test (reaching at least 1:8–1:16 dilution) on the same serum in patients tested positive on a treponemal test used alone for primary screening.

Syphilis diagnostic modalities — PCR and serologic tests: Some laboratories provide locally developed and validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the direct detection of T. pallidum, and a presumptive serologic diagnosis is possible using non-treponemal tests such as VDRL and RPR and treponemal tests including FTA-ABS, TP-PA, enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIA), immunoblots, and rapid treponemal assays; serologic diagnosis traditionally involves screening for non-treponemal antibodies with confirmation by treponemal-based assays.

### Syphilis laboratory guidelines: performance characteristics of nontreponemal antibody tests [^112Ugc9y]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Since Treponema pallidum cannot be cultured, and direct detection methods are not routinely available in most clinical settings, the detection of nonspecific or nontreponemal and treponemal antibodies forms the mainstay of syphilis laboratory diagnoses. Of note, the terms "nonspecific" or "nontreponemal" antibodies would be more accurately termed "antiphospholipid" antibodies, since they represent host antibodies made in response to phosphatidylcholine taken up from mammalian tissue by T. pallidum. However, these terms are commonly used in the literature and in clinical practice, so we have elected, for clarity, to use them in this document. For further discussion of treponemal-specific antibodies, please see Park et al in this issue. Antiphospholipid antibodies are used in combination with treponemal antibodies in the clinical context to help diagnose infections with T. pallidum. The primary antiphospholipid antibody tests in current use are the rapid plasma reagin (RPR), the venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) and, to a much lesser extent, the toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST) and unheated serum reagin. Both nonautomated and automated platforms are available to detect these antibodies. Nontreponemal tests are generally performed on serum, but some may also be performed on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to aid in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Finally, nontreponemal antibody titers are used to monitor treatment responses, although this is not the focus of this review.

The diagnosis of any syphilis stage relies on a clinical evaluation of patient symptoms and medical history, as well as on an interpretation of laboratory tests. As syphilis rates continue to rise throughout the United States, there is a need to systematically identify the performance characteristics of nontreponemal tests to aid laboratorians as they seek to provide support to clinicians for syphilis diagnoses. We sought to review the literature to address this question: what are the performance characteristics, stratified by the stage of syphilis, for nontreponemal serologic tests?

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for syphilis, more specifically with respect to management of treatment failure or reinfection, IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that the serological response of non-treponemal tests in late (latent) syphilis is often absent. Avoid obtaining follow-up after treatment in HIV-negative patients with late latent syphilis with a reactive non-treponemal test remaining stable in a low titer range.

### Syphilis infection prevalence in the middle east and north Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116PWKkv]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In a recent global systematic review of syphilis prevalence among MSM, only 31 out of 345 data points were based on quantitative syphilis diagnostic methods with titers cutoffs. While these showed slightly lower prevalence estimates than those from qualitative methods, the sensitivity analysis conducted by the authors showed that this bias did not appreciably influence the overall estimates of current syphilis infection. It is, therefore, possible that the impact of this misclassification bias on our prevalence estimates of probable current syphilis infection may not be appreciable. In the absence of a practical gold standard for syphilis diagnosis, a positive result on both a treponemal and non-treponemal test, even without antibody titers cutoff, remains the standard diagnostic strategy for probable current syphilis infection.,

Misclassification bias can also affect the other infection type categories. Individuals classified as having a possible current, unspecified infection based on only a reactive non-treponemal test may include biological false positives caused by febrile illnesses, connective tissue diseases, pregnancy, malaria, tuberculosis, and others, given there was no confirmation of syphilis infection with a treponemal test in this category. This can lead to an overestimation of the prevalence of current infection. Similarly, individuals classified as having a lifetime syphilis infection based on only a reactive treponemal test may include both current and past infections, and would need further serological testing using quantitative non-treponemal tests. Cross-reactivity with antibodies against other non-venereal treponematoses, particularly in Horn of Africa countries, may also exist, as current serological diagnostics may not distinguish between syphilis and other endemic treponematoses such as yaws, bejel, and pinta(Table S2). As such, while our categorization of syphilis based on test results is unambiguous, it is the interpretation of these test results in terms of infection type and history that should be considered within the context of these limitations.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for syphilis, more specifically with respect to management of treatment failure or reinfection, IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that a negative non-treponemal test can be obtained in a substantial number of (but not in all) patients treated for early syphilis after 1–2 years. Regard a negative non-treponemal test after treatment as the best confirmation of cure. Obtain a strict follow-up in patients with persistent low titers (≤ 4) in a non-treponemal test (serofast state), but regard these patients as successfully treated in the absence of ongoing risk. Consider performing CSF assessment to detect asymptomatic neurosyphilis in patients with persistent high titers of non-treponemal test (≥ 8).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111f8PqE]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Syphilis in people with HIV — treponemal-positive follow-up and treatment states that with a positive treponemal test in someone previously treated appropriately, they will require no further treatment unless sexual risk history suggests likelihood of re-exposure or there is a sustained fourfold increase in nontreponemal antibody titers; in such cases, a repeat nontreponemal test 2 to 4 weeks after the most recent possible exposure is recommended to evaluate for early infection. Those without prior treatment should be offered treatment and, unless history or physical exam suggests recent infection, previously untreated people should be treated for late latent syphilis. If a second treponemal test is negative and risk is low, no treatment is indicated, whereas if risk is high, treatment should be considered. High quantitative index values or high signal-to-cutoff ratios on treponemal enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA) correlate with TP-PA positivity and might eliminate the need for additional confirmatory testing, although index value ranges and corresponding thresholds may differ by immunoassay.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^115KhZF7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

We conducted a systematic review of relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address the question, "What is the sensitivity and specificity of the treponemal tests currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the diagnosis of syphilis (by stage)?" There were 16 treponemal assays evaluated: 13 immunoassays and 3 manual assays (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test [FTA-ABS], microhemagglutination assay for Treponema pallidum antibodies [MHA-TP], Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay [TP-PA]). MHA-TP and FTA-ABS were less sensitive in primary and secondary syphilis than TP-PA; TP-PA is the most specific manual treponemal assay. There is insufficient evidence to recommend one particular treponemal immunoassay (eg, enzyme immunoassays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, microbead immunoassays) over another based on published performance data. For diagnosis of neurosyphilis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) TP-PA has similar performance to CSF FTA-ABS in studies with patients with definitive or presumptive neurosyphilis. However, CSF treponemal testing has limitations in its sensitivity and specificity and should be interpreted within the context of the clinical scenario, additional CSF test results and syphilis prevalence.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syphilis, more specifically with respect to confirmatory testing, IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend to repeat the non-treponemal test quantitatively (if not initially done) in patients with positive or discrepant results if both a treponemal test and a non-treponemal test are used for primary screening tests, such as enzyme immunoassay/ELISA/chemiluminescence immunoassay/Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test/Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test plus VDRL/RPR.

### Molecular and direct detection tests for Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum: a review of the literature, 1964–2017 [^115kRHaF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The number of primary and secondary cases of syphilis caused by infection with Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (herein T. pallidum) has steadily increased in the United States since the early 2000s. This has resulted in a nearly 73% increase in the overall number of cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2017 as compared to 2013, and is apparent across sexual behaviors, ethnicities, and gender, leading to a more than 40% increase in congenital syphilis cases over the past year. In the absence of treatment, syphilis can progress through multiple stages and present with a variety of different clinical manifestations, collectively making laboratory testing, alongside a careful clinical evaluation, invaluable for establishing the diagnosis. Diagnostic testing for syphilis can be challenging, however, as the organism cannot be grown in routine culture and there is no single assay with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to identify all stages of disease. Currently, diagnosis remains primarily dependent on serologic evaluation for antibodies to T. pallidum using both treponemal and nontreponemal assays, via either a traditional or reverse algorithmic approach. Although serologic testing is associated with high sensitivity (> 95%) during secondary and later stages of disease, the ability of these assays to detect cases of primary infection is significantly diminished, with studies suggesting that 14% to 46% of patients with primary syphilis may be seronegative depending on the method used. Additional limitations of serologic testing include lifelong seropositivity using treponemal assays and the possibility of serofast status, positive results by nontreponemal assays in successfully treated patients, further complicating the interpretation of results.

Serological testing

Remnant samples were retrieved from −20°C storage, thawed, tested using the alternative treponemal serological tests, and interpreted as per the manufacturer's instructions for use (IFU) by two scientists trained in serological testing. Treponemal serology assays included three commercially available TPHA assays (i) Fortress Diagnostics TPHA Hemagglutination, Antrim, United Kingdom (UK); (ii) Randox Syphilis SYP-TPHA, Antrim, UK; (iii) Arlington Scientific TPHA Test, Springville, USA; and a commercial T. pallidum ELISA (Anti- Treponema pallidum ELISA IgG, Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany) that utilizes a small sample input volume (10 µL). Key features of these assays are described in Table S3. Samples were tested using the Fortress, Randox, and Arlington TPHA and the Euroimmun Anti- T. pallidum IgG ELISA within one month of thawing from −20°C. Results were read and interpreted by two scientists. Samples in which there was a categorical disagreement in interpretation between scientists, results were discordant with the TPPA or results were equivocal (as defined by the manufacturer's IFU) were resolved by repeat testing of the sample in duplicate, with the majority result from the three tests performed accepted as the result. Samples in which the control well was reactive were repeated in duplicate with the absorption procedure recommended by the manufacturer.

### Timing of primary syphilis treatment and impact on the development of treponemal antibodies: a cross-sectional clinic-based study [^116csVhc]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Serology is negative in a proportion of primary syphilis cases where Treponema pallidum PCR testing is positive. We aimed to identify discordant, T. pallidum PCR-positive, serology-negative primary syphilis cases and any clinical or laboratory factors associated with failure to subsequently seroconvert.

Methods

Serodiscordant primary syphilis cases that were T. pallidum PCR-positive and serology-negative (including rapid plasma reagin, T. pallidum particle agglutination, T. pallidum enzyme immunoassay or T. pallidum chemiluminescence assay) were identified from the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre electronic records between April 2011 and December 2019. Clinical and laboratory associations were examined.

Results

There were 814 primary syphilis cases in the study period and 38 (4.7%) were serodiscordant, 35 in men who have sex with men. Thirty-two had follow-up serology performed a median of 24 days later, of which 16 (50%) seroconverted, mostly (81%) within 6weeks. Failure to seroconvert was significantly associated with treatment on day 1. Of the 12 cases treated on day 1, 10 (83%) failed to seroconvert compared with 6 of 20 (30%) among those who were treated after day 1.

Discussion

Earlier treatment of primary syphilis can prevent the development of serological markers. T. pallidum PCR can identify primary syphilis lesions before the development of serological markers and improve diagnosis of early primary syphilis lesions. Serology alone will miss a proportion of primary syphilis infections and should be repeated if a diagnosis of syphilis is being considered.

### Screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^116wvepj]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Syphilis screening tests in pregnancy — Screening should include both a treponemal and nontreponemal test, with initial screening followed by a nontreponemal test for reactive samples; discordant results in the reverse sequence are resolved with a second confirmatory treponemal test (TP-PA preferred). Point-of-care tests for antibodies to T pallidum are available that can be performed in a clinical setting or at home using fingerstick blood samples that do not require laboratory processing, but it is unclear how results from these tests alone, without additional confirmatory testing, should guide treatment decisions.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Acquired syphilis — diagnosis requires that a reactive nontreponemal test must be confirmed by a specific treponemal test such as FTA-ABS or TP-PA; treponemal tests usually remain positive for life, even with successful treatment, the prozone phenomenon is more likely in HIV-infected patients, and treponemal antibody titers do not correlate with disease activity and should not be used to monitor treatment response.

### Using treponemal assay signal strength cutoff ratios to predict syphilis infection [^111bvyJd]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Syphilis screening with the reverse algorithm, a treponemal test for screening followed by a nontreponemal test if reactive, is increasingly being used. That algorithm has several advantages, including use of an automated screening test, saving on laboratory time and costs, as well as detection of very early syphilis infection. However, under that algorithm, in situations where the treponemal result is positive and the nontreponemal result is nonreactive a second treponemal test must be performed, which may actually lead to inefficiencies in the laboratory. In this issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, Y. F. Fakile et al. (J Clin Microbiol 56:e01165–17, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01165-17) report the results of their study, which demonstrates the capability of signal strength ratio cutoffs for automated treponemal immunoassays to predict the outcome of repeat treponemal testing. Their findings suggest that anti-treponemal signal strength ratio values above a cutoff value can be used in lieu of repeat treponemal tests.

INTRODUCTION

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum. In 2019, the estimated global prevalence of syphilis was 49.7 million, a 61% increase from 1990. Rates of syphilis have risen significantly in many high- and middle-income countries over the past decade. In England, notifications more than doubled between 2013 and 2022 (6.2–15.4 per 100,000), while they more than tripled in Australia and the United States (US) (7.6–24.3 per 100,000 and 5.5–17.7 per 100,000, respectively). Rates of congenital syphilis have also surged, with a 755% increase reported in the US between 2012 and 2021. Syphilis can present with numerous symptoms and lead to severe conditions including neurosyphilis. In pregnancy, syphilis infection can be transmitted vertically, causing neonatal morbidity and mortality.

Serological testing is the primary method for diagnosing syphilis, involving multiple tests to screen, confirm, and stage the infection. The reverse screening algorithm is commonly used in high-volume laboratories. This algorithm begins with a sensitive treponemal antibody immunoassay. If this assay is positive, it is followed by non-treponemal antibody tests. If the treponemal and non-treponemal results are discordant, a second confirmatory treponemal test is performed. In the United Kingdom and Australia, if the screening treponemal antibody result is positive, national guidelines recommend concurrent performance of non-treponemal and treponemal tests. The Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay is considered the preferred assay for confirmatory treponemal testing in international guidelines. However, due to regulatory restrictions, this test has been withdrawn from some regions, including Europe and Australia. This has necessitated rapid updates to guidelines and evaluations of alternative tests and diagnostic algorithms. Although the TPPA remains available in other regions including the US, there is currently only one TPPA manufacturer worldwide. As such, there are potential weaknesses in the supply chain for this important test.

### Recommendations for practices using gestational carriers: a committee opinion [^114feQiR]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). High credibility.

Infectious disease eligibility — individuals found to be positive for syphilis, N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be treated, retested, and deferred from use as a GC until after documentation that treatment was successful and no longer considered to be infectious before being reconsidered; individuals with false-positive results for syphilis using non-treponemal assays that are confirmed to be negative using a treponemal-based assay are eligible to be used as GCs; and women or their partners who test positive for active infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) (positive urine or throat culture or paired serum samples demonstrating a 4-fold rise in IgG antibody and IgM antibody at least 30% of the IgG level) should be excluded from serving as a carrier until signs of active infection are no longer present.

### Anti-Treponema pallidum IgA response as a potential diagnostic marker of syphilis [^11224tap]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Serological tests for syphilis detect mainly total Ig, IgM or IgG antibodies. We aimed to evaluate the specific IgA response in syphilis patients according to disease stage.

Methods

A serum IgA-enzyme immunoassay was developed using commercially available microplates coated with recombinant treponemal antigens and an anti-IgA-conjugate. To define a cut-off, we used 91 syphilis positive and 136 negative sera previously defined by the rapid plasma reagin and the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination results. Then we determined the intra- and inter-assay precisions, diagnostic sensitivity according to the clinical stage (in 66, 55 and 42 sera from primary, secondary and latent syphilis patients, respectively) and specificity (in 211 sera from people with conditions different to syphilis). IgA values were further measured in 71 sera from patients with previously treated syphilis.

Results

The newly developed IgA-enzyme immunoassay showed a good discrimination between negative and positive samples with intra- and inter-assay variation coefficients < 20%. The sensitivity was 80.3% (95% CI, 70.0–90.6), 100.0% (95% CI, 99.1–100.0) and 95.2% (95% CI, 87.6–100.0) in primary, secondary and latent syphilis, respectively, and the specificity was 98.1% (95% CI, 96.0–100.0). Further, IgA values were negative in 61.3% (38/62) of patients with previously treated syphilis.

Discussion

Our findings suggest serum IgA as a sensitive and specific marker of syphilis and its detection could be used as a screening assay for active infection. Further evaluation is needed in prospective longitudinal field studies.

### Screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^117Y4hdh]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Practice considerations — population and screening approach — This recommendation applies to all adolescents and adults who are pregnant, whether or not risk factors for syphilis are present. Screening for syphilis involves a blood test that detects antibodies that may reflect infection with Treponema pallidum, the organism that causes syphilis. Treponemal tests, such as the T pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) test, detect an antibody response to antigens specific to T pallidum, whereas nontreponemal tests, such as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory or rapid plasma reagin test, detect antibodies that may reflect tissue damage. A 2-step process is used to improve diagnostic accuracy; a traditional screening algorithm is a 2-step process that begins with a non-treponemal test followed by a confirmatory treponemal test for persons with positive nontreponemal test results, and a reverse sequence algorithm uses an automated treponemal test.

INTRODUCTION

Syphilis is a chronic bacterial infection caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (T. pallidum). It can be transmitted sexually by direct contact with syphilitic mucosal lesions (e.g. chancroid and condyloma lata) or via vertical transmission from mother to fetus during pregnancy. The disease represents a massive public health problem worldwide, with approximately 6.3 million new cases per year among women and men aged 15–49 years and an estimated global prevalence of 0.5% from 2012 to 2016. It is also the leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. In 2016, the estimated global prevalence of syphilis was 473 cases per 100,000 live births. The infection is divided into different stages according to clinical findings: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary syphilis. –

Treponema pallidum cannot be cultured, and Food and Drug Administration-approved PCR is not available for T. pallidum and is not sensitive enough. Therefore, diagnosis is performed by serologies or dark-field microscopy. Dark-field examination of lesion exudate or tissue in the early stages of syphilis may lead to or support a diagnosis. However, because of its complexity, it is rarely performed today. Instead, serology is usually used. Serology is divided into two different tests: nontreponemal tests (NTTs) and treponemal tests (TTs). A single serologic NTT or TT is not sufficient for diagnosis. The reason for this is the high rate of false-positive results among persons without syphilis or with previously treated syphilis and false-negative results among persons tested during primary syphilis. Therefore, a correct diagnosis requires a combination of diagnostic tests and careful clinical assessment.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^1171X8f7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

With regard to neurosyphilis, diagnostic criteria of the included studies were diverse and included various combinations of signs/symptoms with abnormal white blood cell count/protein and/or reactive CSF VDRL. As T. pallidum IgG can cross the intact blood–CSF barrier, reactive treponemal tests in the CSF are not specific for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Although the CSF TP-PA and CSF FTA-ABS demonstrated similar sensitivity and specificity, Harding et al found that a negative CSF treponemal test may not rule out neurosyphilis among patients with a high pretest probability (patients with syphilis and neurologic symptoms). Therefore, CSF treponemal tests have limitations with both sensitivity and specificity, and results need to be evaluated within the context of the clinical scenario, additional CSF testing (eg, VDRL, cell count, protein), and syphilis prevalence.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: a retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^117TYMu9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Here, we demonstrate that several commercial TPHAs have analytical performance characteristics comparable to those of Serodia TPPA. Importantly, when compared with active untreated syphilis status, three of the commercial TPHAs included in this study had equivalent sensitivity to the TPPA and two had a specificity of > 99%. By contrast, the PPA of the T. pallidum IgG ELISA was < 95% compared to the Serodia TPPA and had a clinical sensitivity < 95%, including for diagnosis of primary, secondary, and late latent disease. The detailed laboratory validation of the single TPHA available in our setting demonstrated excellent PPA and comparable NPA compared to TPPA across a range of clinical sera, plasma, and quality assurance samples, including a specific cross-reactivity panel. It also performed well in the assessment of reproducibility, repeatability, and inter-reader variability, with only a small number of samples recording a final equivocal result.

### Syphilis [^1146BUgA]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

What should I do with inconclusive results?

Generally, inconclusive results arise in early infection or from waning antibody levels in late infection. The most common combinations are:

A positive RPR with negative treponemal screening (EIA/CLIA) and confirmatory tests (TPPA) suggests the RPR result is a false positive
A positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with negative confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR is likely a false positive but could indicate early infection
A positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with indeterminant confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR could represent waning antibody levels after a previous, treated infection or a new infection.

When results are inconclusive, clinicians should inquire about previous syphilis infection and treatment, and, if early syphilis is possible, retest in two to four weeks. If results are unchanged, interpretation is based on history — consider the possibility of late untreated infection, treated infection, or non-venereal treponemal disease in adults from endemic countries in South and Central America, South-East Asia, and Africa.

CONCLUSION

We conclude that all tests were able to discriminate positive and negative samples, regardless of the diagnostic algorithm. Based on the performance parameters, we demonstrated the diagnostic suitability of the ELISA and VDRL test for the diagnosis of the different stages of syphilis (primary, latent, and secondary). It is also important to emphasize that the tests need to be improved in terms of eliminating false positives (cross-reactivity) with treponemal tests (ELISA and FTA-ABS) to achieve higher diagnostic accuracy.
