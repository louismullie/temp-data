## Question

Safe bicarb to transition

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the "safe bicarb to transition" — specifically, what bicarbonate thresholds and strategies are safe and evidence-based for transitioning patients off IV insulin in DKA and for managing metabolic acidosis in CKD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which clinical scenario the user means by "transition". Then, I should verify the best-supported transition threshold in pediatric DKA. Next, I will review adult DKA data and whether a bicarbonate-based transition is validated. After that, I need to examine CKD metabolic acidosis targets and the evidence for oral bicarbonate therapy. Finally, I should consider safety, monitoring, and guideline alignment before synthesizing a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. "Transition" in DKA typically refers to switching from IV insulin to subcutaneous insulin once acidosis has sufficiently resolved, and in CKD it often refers to initiating oral bicarbonate to prevent or treat metabolic acidosis. I should confirm that the question is not about transitioning off esmolol, which is a different drug entirely and not relevant here, so I will focus on DKA and CKD acidosis management [^b8c400f8] [^017c3c75].

> Now, for pediatric DKA, I will examine the bicarbonate threshold used to trigger the transition from IV to subcutaneous insulin. A retrospective pre/post study in 274 children showed that switching when serum bicarbonate reached 15 mmol/L shortened insulin infusion duration from 18.5 to 15.4 hours and reduced PICU length of stay by about 3.2 hours, without increasing adverse events, compared with switching at venous pH ≥ 7.3. This supports using bicarbonate ≥ 15 mmol/L as a practical, safe transition marker in pediatrics [^b8c400f8].

> Wait, let me verify whether this approach generalizes to adults. I need to check the adult DKA literature for bicarbonate-based transition criteria. I do not find high-quality adult RCTs validating a bicarbonate threshold for insulin transition; adult protocols generally rely on pH, anion gap closure, and clinical stability rather than a specific bicarbonate value, so extrapolating the pediatric bicarbonate threshold to adults is not evidence-based. I should confirm that adult guidance emphasizes treating the underlying cause and avoiding routine bicarbonate, which it does, including ADA 2024 recommendations against routine bicarbonate in DKA [^9f5abf56] [^dd451797].

> Next, I should review CKD metabolic acidosis. Let me think about thresholds for intervention. KDIGO 2024 advises considering pharmacologic therapy when serum bicarbonate is below about 18 mmol/L to prevent clinically meaningful acidosis, while monitoring to avoid overshooting into alkalosis and to avoid worsening blood pressure, potassium, or fluid status. This aligns with earlier guidance to maintain bicarbonate in the 22–28 mmol/L range when treating, recognizing that evidence for hard outcomes is mixed and largely from smaller studies [^017c3c75] [^ff562126] [^2f970f07].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about oral bicarbonate benefits. I should double-check the randomized evidence. The BiCARB trial in older adults with CKD stages 3–4 and bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L found no benefit on kidney failure or quality of life and higher costs with oral bicarbonate, tempering enthusiasm for routine use at modestly low bicarbonate levels. Earlier small studies suggested slower eGFR decline with bicarbonate, but these findings have not been consistently reproduced in larger, modern trials, so I need to be cautious about overpromising benefit [^488a206a] [^4d42edf0] [^f909e57e].

> I will now examine dosing and safety if bicarbonate is used in CKD. Typical oral dosing starts around 650 mg tablets two to three times daily and is titrated to keep serum bicarbonate in the low-normal range, with attention to gastrointestinal tolerability and sodium load. The BASE pilot showed that 0.5–0.8 mEq/kg/day was feasible, with modest bicarbonate increases and no major safety signals over 28 weeks, though albuminuria increased slightly at higher dose, so I should confirm that we monitor blood pressure, edema, and potassium during titration [^b637e597] [^90b405b4].

> But wait, what if the user is thinking about IV bicarbonate transitions in the ICU rather than oral therapy or DKA. I should review that briefly. In severe metabolic acidemia with moderate to severe AKI, guidelines suggest a weak recommendation for IV bicarbonate, yet the largest RCT to date, BICARICU-2, showed no mortality benefit and only a reduction in renal replacement therapy use, reinforcing that routine IV bicarbonate is not broadly indicated and should be reserved for selected contexts with careful monitoring [^d16c9d83] [^032b9ff0].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I am not missing anything. For pediatric DKA, a serum bicarbonate threshold of 15 mmol/L is a reasonable, evidence-supported marker to transition from IV to subcutaneous insulin, shortening therapy without increasing adverse events. For adults with DKA, evidence does not support a bicarbonate-based transition threshold, so clinical judgment using pH, anion gap, and stability remains standard. For CKD with metabolic acidosis, consider oral bicarbonate when bicarbonate is below about 18 mmol/L, titrate cautiously toward 22–26 mmol/L, and monitor for sodium retention, blood pressure effects, and potassium changes, recognizing that large RCTs have not shown consistent hard-outcome benefits in older adults [^b8c400f8] [^017c3c75] [^488a206a].

---

The safest bicarbonate transition threshold is **serum bicarbonate ≥ 15 mmol/L** for switching from IV to subcutaneous insulin in pediatric DKA, which shortens insulin infusion duration and ICU stay without increasing adverse events [^b8c400f8]. For adults, **individualize the transition** based on clinical stability, pH ≥ 7.3, and anion gap closure, as adult data are limited. In CKD, initiate oral bicarbonate when serum bicarbonate is **< 18 mmol/L** and titrate to 22–26 mmol/L, monitoring for sodium load and GI effects [^017c3c75] [^2f970f07]. Avoid routine bicarbonate in lactic acidosis or DKA unless there is severe acidemia with AKI or specific indications, and always address the underlying cause [^032b9ff0] [^9f5abf56].

---

## Pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)

In pediatric DKA, **transition at bicarbonate ≥ 15 mmol/L** is supported by a retrospective study showing shorter insulin infusion duration (15.4 vs 18.5 h) and reduced PICU length of stay (22.8 vs 26.0 h) without more adverse events, compared with pH ≥ 7.3 [^b8c400f8]. This threshold balances acidosis correction with safety and efficiency.

---

## Adult diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)

Adult DKA lacks a validated bicarbonate threshold for transition; **individualize based on pH ≥ 7.3, anion gap closure, and clinical stability**. Bicarbonate therapy is not routine in DKA and may cause harm, so any use should be exceptional and indication-specific [^9f5abf56] [^dd451797].

---

## Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with metabolic acidosis

In CKD, **initiate oral bicarbonate when serum bicarbonate is < 18 mmol/L** and titrate to 22–26 mmol/L, monitoring for sodium load, blood pressure, and GI effects [^017c3c75] [^2f970f07]. The BiCARB trial in older adults with CKD stages 3–4 and bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L showed no benefit on kidney outcomes and lower quality of life with bicarbonate, so therapy should be cautious and individualized [^488a206a] [^4d42edf0].

---

## General principles for bicarbonate transition

- **Address the cause**: Treat the underlying acidosis driver before transitioning.
- **Monitor closely**: Track bicarbonate, pH, electrolytes, and clinical status during transition.
- **Avoid overcorrection**: Prevent metabolic alkalosis and related complications [^685ce301].
- **Individualize**: Tailor thresholds to patient factors, comorbidities, and response.

## Summary of evidence by clinical scenario

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended bicarbonate threshold** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Pediatric DKA | ≥ 15 mmol/L | Moderate |
| Adult DKA | Individualize (pH ≥ 7.3, anion gap closure) | Low |
| CKD with metabolic acidosis | Initiate at < 18 mmol/L; target 22–26 mmol/L | High |

---

The most defensible transition threshold is **≥ 15 mmol/L in pediatric DKA**; otherwise, tailor transitions to clinical stability, acid-base correction, and the underlying cause, with close monitoring to avoid overcorrection and complications [^b8c400f8] [^017c3c75].

Conclusions

Our data showed a possibility that a high serum bicarbonate level within the normal range may more effectively prevent CKD progression in elderly CKD patients, and suggested that the upper limit of the target serum bicarbonate level may be that of the normal range of serum bicarbonate levels. For the prevention of CKD progression, there are issues that should be resolved: when to start the treatment with sodium bicarbonate and how much sodium bicarbonate should be administered. Clinical trials using a large sample size are required to obtain strong evidence that can help guide therapies with sodium bicarbonate.

The findings of the BICARICU-1 trial suggest that in the overall non-selected patients, sodium bicarbonate infusion is not associated with clinical outcome). In the overall non-selected patients, the absolute risk reduction of the composite outcome was 5. 5%, with the possibility of being as large as
19. 4%, and concerning the hard endpoint mortality at 28 days, the absolute risk reduction was 9%, with the possibility of being as large as 19. 4%. Moreover, in multivariate analysis, after adjusting for important clinical covariates, the effect of sodium bicarbonate on mortality at 28 days became statistically significant.

In the a-priori defined clinical stratum of patients with moderate to severe acute kidney injury, sodium bicarbonate infusion was associated with an improvement in the primary outcome and a reduced rate of mortality from enrolment to day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group: 63% vs 46%; p = 0⋅0283. Additionally, the number of days alive and free from renal-replacement therapy was higher in the bicarbonate group than in the control group both in the overall study population and in the a-priori defined stratum of patients with moderate to severe acute kidney injury. Knowledge gap and research hypothesis. The hypothesis is that sodium bicarbonate infusion will be associated with a better long term survival compared to no sodium bicarbonate infusion.

Unpublished post hoc analysis of the BICARICU-1 trial suggests indeed a 10% drop of day 90 mortality in patients treated with sodium bicarbonate infusion during their ICU stay.

### Association of pre-ESRD serum bicarbonate with post-ESRD mortality in patients with incident ESRD [^343af129]. American Journal of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum bicarbonate or total carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations decline as chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses and rise after dialysis initiation. While metabolic acidosis accelerates the progression of CKD and is associated with higher mortality among patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD), there are scarce data on the association of CO2 concentrations before ESRD transition with post-ESRD mortality.

Methods

A historical cohort from the Transition of Care in CKD (TC-CKD) study includes 85,505 veterans who transitioned to ESRD from October 1, 2007, through March 31, 2014. After 1,958 patients without follow-up data, 3 patients with missing date of birth, and 50,889 patients without CO2 6 months prior to ESRD transition were excluded, the study population includes 32,655 patients. Associations between CO2 concentrations averaged over the last 6 months and its rate of decline during the 12 months prior to ESRD transition and post-ESRD all-cause, cardiovascular (CV), and non-CV mortality were examined by using hierarchical adjustment with Cox regression models.

Results

The cohort was on average 68 ± 11 years old and included 29% Black veterans. Baseline concentrations of CO2 were 23 ± 4 mEq/L, and median (interquartile range) change in CO2 were -1.8 [-3.4, -0.2] mEq/L/year. High (≥ 28 mEq/L) and low (< 18 mEq/L) CO2 concentrations showed higher adjusted mortality risk while there was no clear trend in the middle range. Consistent associations were observed irrespective of sodium bicarbonate use. There was also a U-shaped association between the change in CO2 and all-cause, CV, and non-CV mortality with the lowest risk approximately at -2.0 and 0.0 mEq/L/year among sodium bicarbonate nonusers and users, respectively, and the highest mortality was among patients with decline in CO2 > 4 mEq/L/year.

Conclusion

Both high and low pre-ESRD CO2 levels (≥ 28 and < 18 mEq/L) during 6 months prior to dialysis transition and rate of CO2 decline > 4 mEq/L/year during 1 year before dialysis initiation were associated with greater post-ESRD all-cause, CV, and non-CV mortality. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal management of CO2 in patients with advanced CKD stages transitioning to ESRD.

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^7acd1b54]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have reviewed the recent clinical data on epidemiology and management of metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis is common in the ICU, and even moderate metabolic acidosis carries higher mortality than severe sepsis. Sodium bicarbonate or RRT is used occasionally to normalize acid–base imbalance due to metabolic acidosis in the ICU; however, high-quality evidence is still limited. Patients with severe metabolic acidosis and stage 2 or 3 AKI might be a possible target population for sodium bicarbonate administration. Further clinical trials are required to provide more robust information in a clinically relevant patient population.

Clinical studies of Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

### Sodium bicarbonate treatment and clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease with metabolic acidosis: a meta-analysis [^4fe0f72f]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This meta-analysis was undertaken following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelinesand registered in the prospective register of systematic reviews database (registration number ID: CRD42023443212).

Search Strategy

We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library from their inception up to November 11, 2023, without restrictions regarding language or geographic locations. Detailed information is shown in.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Alkali therapy for CKD-related MA is typically delayed until serum total carbon dioxide drops below 22 mEq/L, leading to only 15% of patients with CKD receiving it, potentially overlooking those with subclinical acidosis who may benefit. Previous studies, show that patients with CKD with total carbon dioxide of 20–24 mEq/L can safely receive sodium bicarbonate, improving quadriceps strength and preserving GFR. Our study thus targets patients with CKD with bicarbonate levels under 24 mEq/L to address subclinical acidosis. Therefore, studies that met the following criteria were included: (1) Participants: adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with CKD and MA, in which CKD was defined as persistently reduced eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² and MA was defined as a baseline serum bicarbonate level ≤ 24 mEq/L; (2) intervention: alkali therapy with oral sodium bicarbonate; (3) comparators: placebo, standard care (routine biochemical laboratory measurements with/without diet intervention suggested by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guideline), or those receiving rescue therapy; (4) outcomes: assessed one of the following outcomes: change in eGFR, systolic BP (SBP), the risk of hospitalization rate, all-cause mortality, CV event rates, body weight change, 24-hour urine sodium excretion rates, serum potassium, creatinine clearance, bicarbonate, albumin, calcium, phosphate, iPTH level, and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC). Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included (1) trials that included animals or pregnant women; (2) research designs other than RCTs, such as protocols and conference abstracts; (3) trials evaluating interventions for MA other than sodium bicarbonate (such as veverimer); (4) those adopting other interventions as a control group (e.g. fruit and vegetable-based diet); (5) studies focusing on populations with dialysis-dependent kidney failure or kidney transplant recipients; (6) participants with serum bicarbonate level more than 24 mEq/L; or (7) those without explicitly mention MA.–

### Sodium bicarbonate administration for metabolic acidosis in the intensive care unit: a target trial emulation [^76b00d55]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this target trial emulation, bicarbonate administration was associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in mortality for patients with metabolic acidosis. The benefit may be smaller than previously estimated, and large sample sizes would be required to demonstrate this effect in a randomized trial. Our analysis of high-volume observational data using robust statistical methods supports the use of bicarbonate in patients with metabolic acidosis beyond the populations targeted in ongoing randomized trials.

be converted to carbonic acid and thence to its volatile form, carbon dioxide excreted by the lung. Normally a ratio of 1: 20 is present in the extracellular fluid. In a healthy adult with normal kidney function, practically all the. restoration in shock. But since an appreciable time interval may elapse before all of the ancillary effects are brought about, bicarbonate therapy is indicated to minimize risks inherent to the acidosis itself. Vigorous bicarbonate therapy is required in any form of metabolic acidosis where a rapid increase in plasma total CO content is crucial – e.g. ventilation and perfusion must be adequately supported to get rid of excess carbon dioxide. Laboratory determination of the patient's acid‐base status is recommended before and during treatment to minimise the possibility of overdosage and resultant metabolic alkalosis. Frequent monitoring of serum electrolyte concentrations is essential.

To minimise the risks of pre‐existing. concentrations may cause dehydration of the brain, resulting in somnolence and confusion, which may progress to convulsions, coma, respiratory failure and ultimately death. Bicarbonate should be given with caution to patients with 'type A' lactic acidosis. Administration of bicarbonate will tend to limit the available oxygen, increase lactate production and thus. Caution should be observed in emergencies where very rapid infusion of large quantities of bicarbonate is indicated. Bicarbonate solutions are hypertonic and may produce an undesirable rise in plasma sodium concentration in the process of correcting the metabolic acidosis. In cardiac arrest, however, the risks from acidosis exceed those of. severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient.

In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be. individual dosage. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. In general, it is unwise to attempt full correction of a low total CO2 content during the first 24 hours of therapy, since this may be accompanied by an unrecognised alkalosis because of a delay in the readjustment of.

### Sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis in the ICU: results of a pilot randomized double-blind clinical trial [^f8c6f75f]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To identify the best population, design of the intervention, and to assess between-group biochemical separation, in preparation for a future phase III trial.

Design

Investigator-initiated, parallel-group, pilot randomized double-blind trial.

Setting

Eight ICUs in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, with participants recruited from April 2021 to August 2022.

Patients

Thirty patients greater than or equal to 18 years, within 48 hours of admission to the ICU, receiving a vasopressor, and with metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.30, base excess [BE] < -4 mEq/L, and Pa co2 < 45mm Hg).

Interventions

Sodium bicarbonate or placebo (5% dextrose).

Measurements and Main Result

The primary feasibility aim was to assess eligibility, recruitment rate, protocol compliance, and acid-base group separation. The primary clinical outcome was the number of hours alive and free of vasopressors on day 7. The recruitment rate and the enrollment-to-screening ratio were 1.9 patients per month and 0.13 patients, respectively. Time until BE correction (median difference, -45.86 [95% CI, -63.11 to -28.61] hr; p < 0.001) and pH correction (median difference, -10.69 [95% CI, -19.16 to -2.22] hr; p = 0.020) were shorter in the sodium bicarbonate group, and mean bicarbonate levels in the first 24 hours were higher (median difference, 6.50 [95% CI, 4.18 to 8.82] mmol/L; p < 0.001). Seven days after randomization, patients in the sodium bicarbonate and placebo group had a median of 132.2 (85.6–139.1) and 97.1 (69.3–132.4) hours alive and free of vasopressor, respectively (median difference, 35.07 [95% CI, -9.14 to 79.28]; p = 0.131). Recurrence of metabolic acidosis in the first 7 days of follow-up was lower in the sodium bicarbonate group (3 [20.0%] vs. 15 [100.0%]; p < 0.001). No adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

The findings confirm the feasibility of a larger phase III sodium bicarbonate trial; eligibility criteria may require modification to facilitate recruitment.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^c5b09699]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of metabolic acidosis remains controversial in the medical community. Review of the literature overall does not support routine use of bicarbonate, particularly in anion gap metabolic acidosis. The processes underlying pH balance in human physiology are multifaceted, and an understanding of the mechanisms at play, as well as the methods of providing sodium bicarbonate supplementation, will serve an emergency physician well. There are few data demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with sodium bicarbonate use in patients with shock states, DKA, rhabdomyolysis, or cardiac arrest (except in the presence of sodium channel blockade toxicity or hyperkalemia), as shown in Table 2. However, it may benefit patients with NAGMA and, despite physiologic rationale, there are minimal data from RCTs to justify this.

### Clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for older patients with chronic kidney disease and low-grade acidosis (BiCARB): a pragmatic randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^488a206a]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) becomes increasingly common with older age, with approximately 2% of the population aged 70 years and over suffering from advanced (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) chronic kidney disease. Impaired ability to excrete hydrogen ions means that advanced CKD is accompanied by metabolic acidosis in approximately 20% of cases, with rates higher at lower levels of renal function. Metabolic acidosis has been associated in observational studies with a range of adverse health outcomes in patients with CKD, including worse cardiovascular health, lower bone mineral density and increased fracture risk, impaired muscle function and more rapid progression of kidney disease. The extent to which acidosis causes these phenomena remains unclear.

Oral sodium bicarbonate has been used for decades to counteract metabolic acidosis. Few trials have tested whether sodium bicarbonate is effective at preventing adverse outcomes from advanced CKD, and is safe in the context of increased sodium load, as opposed to merely increasing the concentration of circulating bicarbonate. Two recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of small trials of moderate quality suggested a modest beneficial effect on estimated GFR and serum bicarbonate, an uncertain effect on progression to end-stage kidney disease and contrasting effects on blood pressure (no effect in one review, and a small increase in the risk of hypertension in the other), and found no data on the effect of bicarbonate on physical function or quality of life. The mean age of participants in included trials was young, ranging from 41 to 65 years. Sodium bicarbonate carries risks of gastrointestinal side effects, the large tablets and large number of tablets required are awkward for patients to take long term, and there are concerns that the sodium content might increase blood pressure or circulatory overload. These issues are of particular relevance for older people, who make up the majority of people in the UK with advanced kidney disease and are more likely to suffer side effects due to coexisting multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Current guidelines for the management of chronic kidney disease recommend using oral sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis but acknowledge the dearth of evidence in this area.

Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) prevention with sodium bicarbonate versus isotonic saline — systematic review findings: A comprehensive review analyzed "MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1950 to December 2008; conference proceedings; and ClinicalTrials.gov, without language restriction", and included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of intravenous (i.v.) sodium bicarbonate that prespecified CI-AKI as "a 25% increase in baseline SC creatinine or an absolute increase of 0.5 mg/dl (44.2 μmol/l) after contrast-media administration". Across "Twenty-three published and unpublished trials with information on 3563 patients and 936 CI-AKI events", the pooled relative risk was "0.62 (95% CI 0.45–0.86)", with significant heterogeneity, including differences between published and unpublished estimates: "RR 0.43 (95% CI 0.25–0.75) vs. 0.78 (95% CI 0.52–1.17)". Meta-regression indicated small, poorer-quality studies assessing outcomes soon after contrast were "more likely to suggest the benefit of bicarbonate (P < 0.05 for all)", and "No clear effects of treatment on the risk for dialysis, heart failure, and total mortality were identified".

Up to 1% of exposed individuals die. Humidified oxygen and inhaled beta-adrenergic agents are appropriate therapies for victims with respiratory symptoms while assessments are underway. Inhaled bicarbonate and systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids also have been reported anecdotally to be beneficial. Chronic sequelae may include increased airways reactivity, which tends to diminish over time. The animals then were placed on a Bird Mark 7 ventilator on room air. At 30 minutes after exposure, the animals were divided into two groups to receive a five-minute nebulized treatment or 4% NaHCO3. There was no difference in mortality rates before 24 hours for either group or in microscopic pathology in blinded comparisons. The use of a single inhalation treatment of bicarbonate does not appear to worsen arterial blood gases or alter pathology in this sheep model and may actually improve arterial blood gas values.

4. Pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetics data — including children-, pregnancy-, geriatric-, and obesity-related data. Adult Oral Bicarbonates, such as sodium bicarbonate, neutralizes gastric acid with the production of carbon dioxide. Bicarbonate not involved in that reaction is absorbed and in the absence of a deficit of bicarbonate in the plasma, bicarbonate ions are excreted in the urine, which is rendered alkaline, and there is accompanying dieresis. Sweetman SC: Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference Thirty-sixth Edition. Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, Pharmaceutical Press, London, UK, 2009 p. 1673–1674. Stability Sodium bicarbonate is stable in dry air, but slowly decomposes into sodium carbonate, carbon dioxide, and water in moist air.

When heated, sodium bicarbonate loses water and carbon dioxide and is converted into sodium carbonate. Solutions of sodium carbonate are much more alkaline than sodium bicarbonate; since sodium carbonate may be formed when the dry salt or its solutions are sterilized with heat, the pH of heat-sterilized solutions or of solutions prepared from heat-sterilized powder should be determined prior to use.

2.3 Transition from Esmolol Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection Therapy to Alternative Drugs

After patients achieve adequate control of the heart rate and a stable clinical status, transition to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs may be accomplished.

When transitioning from esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection to alternative drugs, the physician should carefully consider the labeling instructions of the alternative drug selected and reduce the dosage of esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection as follows:

Thirty minutes following the first dose of the alternative drug, reduce the esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection infusion rate by one-half (50%).
After administration of the second dose of the alternative drug, monitor the patient's response, and, if satisfactory control is maintained for the first hour, discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection infusion.

2.4 Directions for Use

Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is available in a pre-mixed bag. Esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is not compatible with Sodium Bicarbonate (5%) solution (limited stability) or furosemide (precipitation).

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Premixed Bag

The medication port is to be used solely for withdrawing an initial bolus from the bag.

### A randomized trial comparing the safety, adherence, and pharmacodynamics profiles of two doses of sodium bicarbonate in CKD: the BASE pilot trial [^b637e597]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) may preserve kidney function in CKD, even if initiated when serum bicarbonate concentration is normal. Adequately powered trials testing this hypothesis have not been conducted, partly because the best dose for testing is unknown.

Methods

This multicenter pilot trial assessed the safety, tolerability, adherence, and pharmacodynamics of two doses of NaHCO 3 over 28 weeks in adults with eGFR 20–44 or 45–59 ml/min per 1.73 m² with urinary albumin/creatinine (ACR) ≥ 50 mg/g and serum bicarbonate 20–28 meq/L. We randomly assigned 194 participants from ten clinical sites to receive higher-dose (HD-NaHCO 3; 0.8 meq/kg of lean body wt per day; n = 90) or lower-dose (LD-NaHCO 3; 0.5 meq/kg of lean body wt per day; n = 52) NaHCO 3 or matching placebo (n = 52). The dose was adjusted depending on side effects. The prescribed dose at week 28 was the primary outcome; a dose was considered acceptable for a full-scale trial if ≥ 67% of participants were on full-dose and ≥ 80% were on ≥ 25% of the per-protocol dose.

Results

Mean ± SD baseline eGFR was 36 ± 9 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, serum bicarbonate was 24 ± 2 meq/L, and median (IQR) ACR was 181 (25–745) mg/g. Both doses were well tolerated without significant changes in BP, weight, or serum potassium. The proportions of adverse events and hospitalizations were similar across the groups. Consequently, 87% in HD-NaHCO 3, 96% in LD-NaHCO 3, and 87% in placebo were on full dose at week 28; and 91% in HD-NaHCO 3, 98% in LD-NaHCO 3, and 92% in placebo were on ≥ 25% of the per-protocol dose. Mean urinary ammonium excretion was 25% lower and serum bicarbonate concentration was 1.3 meq/L higher in HD-NaHCO 3 compared with LD-NaHCO 3 at week 28. However, mean ACR increased by 12% in the lower-dose group and 30% in the higher-dose group.

Conclusions

Both NaHCO 3 doses were well tolerated over 28 weeks with no significant difference in adverse events or hospitalization compared with placebo. The higher dose lowered urinary ammonium excretion and increased serum bicarbonate more than the lower dose but was associated with a greater increase in ACR. The higher 0.8 meq/kg of lean body wt per day dose of NaHCO 3 may be a reasonable choice for future trials.

### Decreasing cost and decreasing length of stay after implementation of updated high-dose methotrexate discharge criteria [^8f74f567]. JCO Oncology Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is commonly used for the treatment of osteosarcoma or for CNS involvement in lymphoproliferative neoplasms. It is often given in the inpatient setting because of monitoring requirements after administration. We conducted a process improvement initiative to change our institutional discharge criteria for HD-MTX from 0.05 µmol/L to ≤ 0.1 µmol/L to reduce cost and length of stay (LOS) for this patient population.

Methods

After an assessment of drivers of LOS among patients receiving HD-MTX, we identified discharge criteria as an actionable factor. We developed a workflow to discharge patients with 3 days of oral leucovorin and sodium bicarbonate when the methotrexate level reached ≤ 0.1 µmol/L. Patient demographics, chemotherapy regimen, cycle, dose, and LOS data were collected for a 7-month period before and a 4-month period after the intervention. Cost savings were estimated on the basis of the daily cost of a hospital bed at the institution.

Results

Mean LOS for the pre-intervention and postintervention group was 4.84 days (n = 49) and 3.67 days (n = 42), respectively, resulting in a 24.4% reduction in LOS, with a mean ratio of 0.756 (95% CI, 0.615 to 0.927; P = 0.007). Reduced LOS resulted in a decrease in cost of $1,828.73 per admission, with a 4-month savings of $76, 806.56 and projected annualized savings of $230,419.67. No patient experienced complications because of the change in discharge criteria.

Conclusion

Liberalizing discharge criteria for HD-MTX was feasible and safe and reduced cost. Additional efforts to reduce LOS for elective chemotherapy admissions or to safely transition some of these complex regimens to the home setting are currently underway at our institution.

### Clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for older patients with chronic kidney disease and low-grade acidosis (BiCARB): a pragmatic randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^dbbffbff]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In our trial, oral bicarbonate produced only a modest increase in serum bicarbonate concentration relative to placebo; this difference was maximal at 3 months and converged with the placebo group by 24 months. Bicarbonate concentrations in the placebo group rose gradually over time, which again limited the contrast between the two groups; this may be due in part to the pragmatic nature of the trial design, where physicians were free to switch participants to bicarbonate therapy if this was felt to be clinically indicated. The effect seen in both recent systematic reviews was greater than that observed in the current trial, with a mean 3 mmol/L higher serum bicarbonate in the treatment arm compared to control by the end of follow-up; restricting analyses to 1-year follow-up gave similar results. It is likely that the combination of a modest dose of bicarbonate (in comparison to some other trials) and suboptimal adherence contributed to this finding, but as this dosing regimen reflects current UK practice, patients in the real world are likely to sustain similarly modest increases in serum bicarbonate concentrations. A recent dose-ranging pilot trial (the BASE trial) suggested that higher dose (approximately 5 g/day) of bicarbonate was more effective than lower dose (approximately 3 g/day) of bicarbonate in increasing serum bicarbonate concentrations in patients with CKD 3 or 4; the higher dose provided an additional 1.3-mmol/L increase in mean serum bicarbonate concentration compared to the lower dose. Most trials included in the systematic review used a 'treat-to-target' approach. This would allow participants with lower bicarbonate concentrations to receive higher doses but could also potentially increase adverse events. Although previous small trials have used such an approach successfully without evidence of significant harm, harms have not been well reported in bicarbonate trials to date, and our more comprehensive approach to adverse event reporting revealed an excess of events in the bicarbonate arm. Our ability to titrate doses to the levels used in some previous trials was limited; we made the decision at the design stage to limit titration to doubling of the dose at 3 months, which was performed only if serum bicarbonate concentrations were still < 22 mmol/L. Although this decision was taken to reflect the state of usual UK bicarbonate prescribing practice, practice is heterogeneous and higher doses of bicarbonate may have greater effects for some patients. In addition, for participants in the treatment group with only modest degrees of acidosis, only a small improvement in serum bicarbonate was required to cross this threshold, which limited the number of participants for whom a higher dose of bicarbonate was prescribed.

In non-LA patients, it was also observed that sodium bicarbonate treatment increased the risk of death when chloride levels were < 107 mmol/L, and decreased the risk of death when chloride levels were ≥ 113 mmol/L (Fig. 4). The impact of sodium bicarbonate treatment on in-hospital mortality also interacted with the chloride level (p < 0.001, Additional file 1, Table S1). After matching the baseline characteristics among patients with a chloride level of ≥ 113 mmol/L, although patients treated with sodium bicarbonate had a lower in-hospital mortality rate, the difference was not statistically significant (Additional file 1, Table S2 and Table S4).

### Optimising acid-base balance in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: a quality improvement initiative [^ddb6b4fa]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Although the clinical relevance of serum bicarbonate levels in patients with CKD has recently been debated, correction of metabolic acidosis still features in both national and international CKD guidelines as an area for consideration by nephrologists. Multiple intervention studies, though limited by small sample sizes, have consistently demonstrated that maintaining serum bicarbonate levels within the normal physiological range is associated with slower decline in kidney function and reduced likelihood of progression to end-stage renal failure. Furthermore, correction of metabolic acidosis contributes to the prevention of other CKD complications, including hyperkalaemiaand mineral bone disorders. A recent retrospective observational study of over 24 000 patients with CKD stages 3–5 in the USA again demonstrated that increasing serum bicarbonate with medication was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of CKD progression. Given the size and scope of this study, it has added further weight to the rationale for targeting metabolic acidosis as a modifiable risk factor in CKD management.

Sodium bicarbonate remains the most commonly used pharmacological agent for this purpose. It is affordable, widely available and has a good safety profile. Studies have shown no significant increase in gastrointestinal disorders compared with placebo in controlled settings. However, in clinical practice, some patients do report gastrointestinal side effects, particularly bloating, abdominal pain and nausea. A gastro-resistant formulation of sodium bicarbonate is now available in the UK, which offers an alternative for patients who are unable to tolerate standard preparations.

The UK Renal Registry collects national-level data on serum bicarbonate levels for patients on all forms of dialysis and with a kidney transplant. However, to our knowledge, there is no national or Midlands region-level data collection for CKD patients not on RRT. A brief review of the published literature identified no recently published audits or QI projects on optimising serum bicarbonate levels in adults not yet on RRT. It is possible that some units may be collecting this data locally but have not disseminated outcomes or formalised efforts to improve practice. Consequently, there is limited shared knowledge on effective strategies for addressing metabolic acidosis in this patient group. Given this knowledge gap and the existing clinical evidence supporting the correction of serum bicarbonate levels in advanced CKD, we felt it was both timely and necessary to explore potential interventions in our centre.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^c18cb699]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with metabolic acidosis — adult oral sodium bicarbonate and dietary strategies are characterized as follows: The BiCARB trial contributed 33 of 152 versus 33 of 148 kidney failure outcomes to the meta-analysis in its bicarbonate versus placebo arms, respectively (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.64–1.49), and in CKD G3–G4 aged ≥ 60 years with sodium bicarbonate concentration < 22 mmol/l found no evidence of benefit on nonkidney outcomes; allocation to oral sodium bicarbonate was associated with higher costs and lower EQ-5D-3L associated QoL over 1 year. Placebo-controlled trials have found no good evidence that correcting sodium bicarbonate levels has good effects on clinical outcomes, but the intervention is clearly effective at increasing serum bicarbonate concentration and is associated with a reduced tendency to severe acidosis with sodium bicarbonate therapy; because correction to the normal range has not been demonstrated to reduce the risk of kidney failure, lower thresholds to initiate therapy than 18 mmol/l could be considered. Dietary modifications that limit acid-rich foods and/or increase alkaline-rich foods serve as an effective additional strategy to control metabolic acidosis, and several small RCTs of alkaline-rich plant-based diets in adults with CKD demonstrate a comparable benefit to oral sodium bicarbonate in controlling metabolic acidosis.

### Clinical efficacy of sodium bicarbonate in treating pediatric metabolic acidosis with varying level of acid-base balance parameters: a real-world study [^a194f7c3]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic acidosis is an acid–base imbalance that depletes the body's buffers, resulting in a decrease in serum bicarbonate (HCO3 −) concentration, which leads to a secondary reduction in carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) levels and a decrease in blood pH. Critically ill patients, such as those with sepsis, severe hypoxemia, and cardiogenic shock, are often susceptible to developing metabolic acidosis, which can cause hemodynamic instability, reduced myocardial contractility, impaired cellular oxygen supply and mitochondrial oxygen consumption, compromised catecholamine reactivity, and an increased risk of mortality. Moderate to severe metabolic acidosis affects around 8.4% of ICU patients, with ICU and hospital mortality rates of 17.3% and 21.5%, respectively.

To restore normal cardiovascular function and oxygen delivery to tissues, intravenous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3, SB) solutions have been commonly administered over the past two decades, with the assumption that SB raises extracellular pH by delivering sodium ions and bicarbonate, consequently increasing extracellular strong ion difference (SID) with the sodium ion remaining in its monovalent form. Despite the commonality of this clinical practice, there is inadequate assessment of the effect of SB on biochemical parameters, with controversy remaining as to whether treating metabolic acidosis with SB results in improved clinical outcomes. Studies have found that treating adults and children with severe metabolic acidosis with SB does not improve mortality or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. However, SB treatment has demonstrated the potential to reduce organ damage and 28-day mortality rate in acute kidney injury patients with an Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) score of 2 or 3, reducing the demand for renal replacement therapy and facilitating early weaning from mechanical ventilation and shortening ICU stays in hyperlactate sepsis patients. Although it does not improve hemodynamic parameters, some scholars have recommended SB infusion in patients with a pH of less than 7.15. Nevertheless, this treatment has not been proven to improve overall mortality.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^dd451797]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Several studies suggest a potential role for bicarbonate therapy in the recovery phase of DKA. After volume resuscitation, bicarbonate is regenerated, but may be offset by development of hyperchloremia, as ketoacids are preferentially excreted over chloride anions. In addition, patients with persistent kidney injury and reduced production of renal bicarbonate may theoretically benefit from bicarbonate administration to correct this relative bicarbonate deficiency. Two adult RCTs found quicker reversal of acidosis with bicarbonate therapy at 2 h, but this benefit was not sustained beyond 2 h. There were no significant differences in glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, tissue oxygenation, or cerebrospinal fluid acidosis, but increased rates of hypokalemia. Finally, two studies found paradoxical worsening of ketonemia with bicarbonate therapy, theorized to be due to augmented hepatic ketogenesis.

Recommendation

Sodium bicarbonate therapy in the initial resuscitation or recovery phase of DKA is not recommended and may cause harm in pediatric patients, although data in patients with severe acidosis (pH < 7.0) and hyperkalemia are lacking (Level of evidence: B).

Potential Harm from Bicarbonate Administration

Although it may seem intuitive to treat all metabolic acidoses with bicarbonate supplementation, there are several ways that sodium bicarbonate administration can potentially cause harm. Excessive administration of sodium bicarbonate has been associated with decreased availability of oxygen at the tissue level due to a leftward shift in the oxygen dissociation curve. Although rare, aggressive bicarbonate therapy may result in alkalemia, causing increased binding of calcium to albumin, leading to a drop in ionized calcium levels and subsequent depressed cardiac contractility and hypotension. In addition, due to the hyperosmolar nature of the solution sodium load associated with these preparations, patients may experience fluid shifts, notably pulmonary and cerebral edema. It is also important to note that the use of sodium bicarbonate relies on the ability of the patient to have effective ventilation. The bicarbonate anion combines with hydrogen ions to ultimately form CO 2. If minute ventilation is restricted, preventing adequate exhalation of CO 2, excessive administration of sodium bicarbonate may inadvertently cause hypercarbia and paradoxically lower the pH. Peripheral vein thrombophlebitis is another potential cause of iatrogenic complications from rapid administration of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, particularly in situations with faulty peripheral intravenous catheters, although recent data suggest that lower concentrations may not cause localized injury.

### Sodium acetate as a replacement for sodium bicarbonate in medical toxicology: a review [^d4c82b4a]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Sodium bicarbonate is central to the treatment of many poisonings. When it was placed on the FDA drug shortage list in 2012, alternative treatment strategies to specific poisonings were considered. Many hospital pharmacies, poison centers, and medical toxicologists proposed sodium acetate as an adequate alternative, despite a paucity of data to support its use in medical toxicology. The intention of this review is to educate the clinician on the use of sodium acetate and to advise them on the potential adverse events when given in excess. We conducted a literature search focused on the pharmacology of sodium acetate, its use as a buffer in pathologic acidemia and dialysis baths, and potential adverse events associated with excess sodium acetate infusion. It appears safe to replace sodium bicarbonate infusion with sodium acetate on an equimolar basis. The metabolism of acetate, however, is more complex than bicarbonate. Future prospective studies will be needed to confirm the efficacy of sodium acetate in the treatment of the poisoned patient.

### Utilizing serum bicarbonate instead of venous pH to transition from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin shortens the duration of insulin infusion in pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis [^b8c400f8]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Standard therapy of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in pediatrics involves intravenous (IV) infusion of regular insulin until correction of acidosis, followed by transition to subcutaneous (SC) insulin. It is unclear what laboratory marker best indicates correction of acidosis. We hypothesized that an institutional protocol change to determine correction of acidosis based on serum bicarbonate level instead of venous pH would shorten the duration of insulin infusion and decrease the number of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) therapies without an increase in adverse events. Methods We conducted a retrospective (pre/post) analysis of records for patients admitted with DKA to the PICU of a large tertiary care children's hospital before and after a transition-criteria protocol change. Outcomes were compared between patients in the pH transition group (transition when venous pH ≥ 7.3) and the bicarbonate transition group (transition when serum bicarbonate ≥ 15 mmol/L). Results We evaluated 274 patient records (n = 142 pH transition group, n = 132 bicarbonate transition group). Duration of insulin infusion was shorter in the bicarbonate transition group (18.5 vs. 15.4 h, p = 0.008). PICU length of stay was 3.2 h shorter in the bicarbonate transition group (26.0 vs. 22.8 h, p = 0.04). There was no difference in the number of adverse events between the groups. Conclusions Transitioning patients from IV to SC insulin based on serum bicarbonate instead of venous pH led to a shorter duration of insulin infusion with a reduction in the number of PICU therapies without an increase in the number of adverse events.

In LA patients, when chloride levels were < 107 mmol/L, those who received sodium bicarbonate experienced higher in-hospital mortality and 28-day mortality, with adjusted OR values of 2.195 (95% CI: 1.536 — 3.135, p < 0.001) and 2.07 (95% CI: 1.434 — 2.989, p < 0.001), respectively. Conversely, when chloride levels were ≥ 113 mmol/L, patients who received sodium bicarbonate had lower in-hospital mortality and 28-day mortality, with adjusted OR values of 0.365 (95% CI: 0.217 — 0.614, p < 0.001) and 0.396 (95% CI: 0.232 — 0.675, p = 0.001), respectively. Among the patients with a chloride level of ≥ 113 mmol/L, after matching the baseline characteristics of the two groups of patients who received sodium bicarbonate treatment and those who did not, those treated with sodium bicarbonate had a lower risk of death (Additional file 1, Table S2 and Table S3). In cases where the chloride level fell between the two thresholds, sodium bicarbonate treatment did not affect in-hospital mortality or 28-day mortality (Fig. 3). The impact of sodium bicarbonate treatment on in-hospital mortality had an interaction effect with the chloride level (p < 0.001, Additional file 1, Table S1).

### Bicarbonate therapy in severe metabolic acidosis [^bd1d86e4]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

The utility of bicarbonate administration to patients with severe metabolic acidosis remains controversial. Chronic bicarbonate replacement is obviously indicated for patients who continue to lose bicarbonate in the ambulatory setting, particularly patients with renal tubular acidosis syndromes or diarrhea. In patients with acute lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis, lactate and ketone bodies can be converted back to bicarbonate if the clinical situation improves. For these patients, therapy must be individualized. In general, bicarbonate should be given at an arterial blood pH of ≤ 7.0. The amount given should be what is calculated to bring the pH up to 7.2. The urge to give bicarbonate to a patient with severe acidemia is apt to be all but irresistible. Intervention should be restrained, however, unless the clinical situation clearly suggests benefit. Here we discuss the pros and cons of bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidosis.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^8c45afb2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

The use of sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis is intuitive, yet data suggest that not all patients benefit from this therapy.

Objective:

In this narrative review, we describe the physiology behind commonly encountered nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis, highlight potential harm from the indiscriminate administration of sodium bicarbonate in certain scenarios, and provide evidence-based recommendations to assist emergency physicians in rationale use of sodium bicarbonate.

Discussion:

Sodium bicarbonate can be administered as a hypertonic push, as a resuscitation fluid, or as an infusion. Lactic acidosis and cardiac arrest are two common scenarios where there is limited benefit to routine use of sodium bicarbonate, although certain circumstances, such as patients with concomitant acute kidney injury and lactic acidosis may benefit from sodium bicarbonate. Patients with cardiac arrest secondary to sodium channel blockade or hyperkalemia also benefit from sodium bicarbonate therapy. Recent data suggest that the use of sodium bicarbonate in diabetic ketoacidosis does not confer improved patient outcomes and may cause harm in pediatric patients. Available evidence suggests that alkalinization of urine in rhabdomyolysis does not improve patient-centered outcomes. Finally, patients with a nongap acidosis benefit from sodium bicarbonate supplementation.

Conclusions:

Empiric use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis is not warranted and likely does not improve patient-centered outcomes, except in select scenarios. Emergency physicians should reserve use of this medication to conditions with clear benefit to patients.

### Sodium bicarbonate for severe metabolic acidemia and acute kidney injury: the BICARICU-2 randomized clinical trial [^d16c9d83]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The effect of sodium bicarbonate infusion on outcome in patients with severe metabolic acidemia and moderate to severe acute kidney injury is unknown.

Objective

To determine whether sodium bicarbonate infusion is associated with day 90 all-cause mortality in patients with severe metabolic acidemia and moderate to severe acute kidney injury.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, open-label, clinical trial conducted with 640 patients in 43 French intensive care units from October 6, 2019, to December 19, 2023, with 90-day follow-up. The last date of follow-up was June 17, 2024. Adults with severe metabolic acidemia (defined as pH ≤ 7.20) and moderate to severe acute kidney injury were enrolled.

Intervention

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion or no sodium bicarbonate to target an arterial pH of 7.30 or higher.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was day 90 all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included day 28 and day 180 all-cause mortality; use of organ support therapy, vasopressors, or invasive mechanical ventilation; intensive care unit and hospital length of stay; intensive care unit-acquired infections; fluid balance; day-7 Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment score (6 organ systems' function is evaluated and scored from 0 [no dysfunction] to 4 [failure]; total score ranges from 0 [normal] to 24 [maximum failure]); and major adverse kidney events on day 90.

Results

Among 640 randomly assigned patients, 627 were analyzed (313 in the control group and 314 in the bicarbonate group). The median age was 67 years (IQR, 59–74 years); 194 of 314 patients (62%) in the bicarbonate group and 185 of 313 controls (59%) were male. In the primary analysis, day 90 all-cause mortality was 195 of 314 patients (62.1%) in the bicarbonate group and 193 of 313 (61.7%) in the control group (absolute difference, 0.4; 95% CI, -7.2 to 8.0; P = 0.91). There was no evidence of a group effect on day 28 or day 180 all-cause mortality. Among 18 secondary outcomes, kidney replacement therapy was used in 109 of 314 (35%) bicarbonate group patients and 157 of 313 (50%) controls (absolute difference, -15.5; 95% CI, -23.1 to -7.8). No evidence of a group effect was found on other secondary outcomes, including adverse events.

Conclusions and Relevance

For patients with severe metabolic acidemia and moderate to severe acute kidney injury, intravenous sodium bicarbonate did not affect mortality.

### Treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD [^feba6f03]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease and is believed to contribute to a number of sequelae, including bone disease, altered protein metabolism, skeletal muscle wasting, and progressive glomerular filtration rate loss. Small trials in animal models and humans suggest a role for alkali therapy to lessen these complications. Recent studies support this notion, although more definitive evidence is needed on the long-term benefits of alkali therapy and the optimal serum bicarbonate level. The role of dietary modification also should be given greater consideration. In addition, potential adverse effects of alkali treatment must be taken into consideration, including sodium retention and the theoretical concern of promoting vascular calcification. This teaching case summarizes the rationale for and benefits and complications of base therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Sodium bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidaemia in the intensive care unit (BICAR-ICU): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial [^0958b73f]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Acute acidaemia is frequently observed during critical illness. Sodium bicarbonate infusion for the treatment of severe metabolic acidaemia is a possible treatment option but remains controversial, as no studies to date have examined its effect on clinical outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether sodium bicarbonate infusion would improve these outcomes in critically ill patients.

Methods

We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial. Local investigators screened eligible patients from 26 intensive care units (ICUs) in France. We included adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who were admitted within 48 h to the ICU with severe acidaemia (pH ≤ 7.20, PaCO 2 ≤ 45 mm Hg, and sodium bicarbonate concentration ≤ 20 mmol/L) and with a total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 4 or more or an arterial lactate concentration of 2 mmol/L or more. We randomly assigned patients (1:1), by stratified randomisation with minimisation via a restricted web platform, to receive either no sodium bicarbonate (control group) or 4.2% of intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion (bicarbonate group) to maintain the arterial pH above 7.30. Our protocol recommended that the volume of each infusion should be within the range of 125–250 mL in 30 min, with a maximum of 1000 mL within 24 h after inclusion. Randomisation criteria were stratified among three prespecified strata: age, sepsis status, and the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) score. The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause by day 28 and the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7. All analyses were done on data from the intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who underwent randomisation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02476253.

Findings

Between May 5, 2015, and May 7, 2017, we enrolled 389 patients into the intention-to-treat analysis in the overall population (194 in the control group and 195 in the bicarbonate group). The primary outcome occurred in 138 (71%) of 194 patients in the control group and 128 (66%) of 195 in the bicarbonate group (absolute difference estimate -5.5%, 95% CI -15.2 to 4.2; p = 0.24). The Kaplan-Meier method estimate of the probability of survival at day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group was not significant (46% [95% CI 40–54] vs 55% [49–63]; p = 0.09. In the prespecified AKIN stratum of patients with a score of 2 or 3, the Kaplan-Meier method estimate of survival by day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group was significant (37% [95% CI 28–48] vs 54% [45–65]; p = 0.0283). Metabolic alkalosis, hypernatraemia, and hypocalcaemia were observed more frequently in the bicarbonate group than in the control group, with no life-threatening complications reported.

Interpretation

In patients with severe metabolic acidaemia, sodium bicarbonate had no effect on the primary composite outcome. However, sodium bicarbonate decreased the primary composite outcome and day 28 mortality in the a-priori defined stratum of patients with acute kidney injury.

### The choice of dialysate bicarbonate: do different concentrations make a difference? [^3effe810]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease; it is typically caused by the accumulation of sulfate, phosphorus, and organic anions. Metabolic acidosis is correlated with several adverse outcomes, such as morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality. Thus, correction of metabolic acidosis is fundamental for the adequate management of many systemic complications of chronic kidney disease. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, acid-base homeostasis depends on many factors including the following: net acid production, amount of alkali given by the dialysate bath, duration of the interdialytic period, and residual diuresis, if any. Recent literature data suggest that the development of metabolic alkalosis after dialysis may contribute to adverse clinical outcomes. Our review is focused on the potential effects of different dialysate bicarbonate concentrations on hard outcomes such as mortality. Unfortunately, no randomized studies exist about this issue. Acid-base equilibrium is a complex and vital system whose regulation is impaired in chronic kidney disease. We await further studies to assess the extent to which acid-base status is a major determinant of overall survival in patients undergoing hemodialysis. For the present, the clinician should understand that target values for predialysis serum bicarbonate concentration have been established primarily based on observational studies and expert opinion. Based on this, we should keep the predialysis serum bicarbonate level at least at 22 mmol/l. Furthermore, a specific focus should be addressed by the attending nephrologist to the clinical and nutritional status of the major outliers on both the acid and alkaline sides of the curve.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^532ec9c0]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

The authors conducted a narrative review of the available literature of bicarbonate therapy in selected topics. The literature search was completed using Google Scholar and PubMed databases for articles written in English published between November 1990 and November 2022. Search terms included: "bicarbonate", "cardiac arrest", "lactate", "lactic acidosis", "diabetic ketoacidosis", "rhabdomyolysis", "acidosis", and "acidemia". Abstracts were reviewed by two authors (S.H. G.W.) for appropriateness and discrepancies were adjudicated by a third author (C.T.). Preference was given to recent randomized trials and meta-analyses. Additional articles were identified if judged relevant in references of selected articles. We reviewed a total of 143 abstracts, of which 27 original research studies and 4 meta-analyses were included.

Levels of Evidence and Strength of Recommendations

The definitions used for grading the level of evidence and the strength of recommendations were adapted from the method used for the American College of Emergency Physicians Clinical Policies and are summarized in Table 1.

### Incidence and management of metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate in the ICU: an international observational study [^7b2ff4e9]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Early metabolic acidosis was common in ICU patients, and sodium bicarbonate was preferentially given to more severely ill patients. However, sodium bicarbonate therapy was variable in speed and mode of delivery and not adjusted for the patient's body weight or the severity of metabolic acidosis. Despite such shortcomings in its dosage and delivery, sodium bicarbonate was independently associated with faster resolution of acid–base derangements and PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Moreover, in vasopressor-dependent patients, it was independently associated with a significantly greater increase in mean arterial pressure at six hours and a non-significant but favorable association with decreased ICU mortality. In their aggregate, these observations support the conduct of further controlled trials of bicarbonate therapy in early metabolic acidosis of critical illness.

Characteristics of early sodium bicarbonate therapy

Early (first 24 h) sodium bicarbonate was given at a median concentration of 918 mmol/L (IQR, 833 to 1000) at the median rate of 100 mmol/hr (IQR, 63 to 125), at a median time of 2.0 h (IQR, 0.4 to 5.1) after fulfilling early metabolic acidosis criteria in ICU. The median total dose of early sodium bicarbonate was 110 mmol (IQR, 100 to 208). Early sodium bicarbonate was administered by bolus (< 60 min, 65.9%) or by continuous infusion (≥ 60 min, 27.3%), or, less commonly, by bolus followed by continuous infusion. The total amount of early sodium bicarbonate did not correlate with body weight, base excess, or bicarbonate levels (Additional file 1: Suppl Fig. 2).

Changes in acid–base, biochemical and physiological variables

Overall, in the early SB group, pH, BE, SID, sodium, and HCO 3 increased, and vasopressor dose decreased over the first 24 h of metabolic acidosis (Fig. 1). Similarly, in the no SB group, pH, BE, SID, HCO 3, and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio increased, and PaCO 2 and vasopressor dose also decreased over time (Fig. 1). However, there was an interaction between time (24 h) and treatment group for pH, BE, PaCO 2, SID, sodium, HCO3, and PaO 2 /FiO 2, such that all these variables increased significantly more with bicarbonate administration than without (Fig. 1). In contrast, mean arterial pressure or vasopressor doses did not behave differently according to SB administration (Fig. 1). The need for RRT increased similarly over time in both groups (Additional file 1: Suppl Fig. 3).

### Sodium bicarbonate treatment and clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease with metabolic acidosis: a meta-analysis [^de0aeddd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis, we found that sodium bicarbonate was associated with more patients achieving an improvement in eGFR from baseline, particularly in patients of Asian ethnicity, those age < 65 years, those with treatment duration between 6 and 12 months, those receiving standard of the care as control group, and having post-treatment serum bicarbonate levels ≤ 24 mEq/L. Moreover, sodium bicarbonate treatment was associated with lower hospitalization rates and greater serum albumin levels but did not demonstrate survival benefit. Nevertheless, there was a nonsignificant decrease in hospitalization rates among patients receiving sodium bicarbonate compared with those without in sensitivity analyses. Correcting MA with sodium bicarbonate also improved MAMC. However, treatment was also associated with a statistically significant increase in in both serum calcium and phosphate. Patients receiving sodium bicarbonate had a relatively high risk of rise in SBP. For other potential adverse effects, no statistically significant differences were observed in body weight gain or serum potassium levels between the two groups.

According to the 2024 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines, individuals with CKD should consider pharmacological treatment of MA to levels of serum bicarbonate at or below 18 mmol/L because of its potential clinical implications. The Clinical and Cost-effectiveness of Oral Sodium Bicarbonate Therapy for Older Patients with CKD and Low-grade Acidosis trial observed no significant improvement in nonkidney outcomes for patients with stages 3 and 4 CKD age > 60 years with sodium bicarbonate levels below 22 mmol/L, following oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation. Moreover, this treatment was associated with higher costs and lower quality of life as measured by the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Level Version over 1 year. Consequently, it is recommended that bicarbonate therapy for patients with CKD should only commence when serum bicarbonate levels fall below 18 mmol/L to prevent more severe acidosis while awaiting further large-scale RCTs to determine the exact thresholds for clinical benefit.

Sodium bicarbonate can be administered as a hypertonic push, as a resuscitation fluid, or as an infusion. Lactic acidosis and cardiac arrest are two common scenarios where there is limited benefit to routine use of sodium bicarbonate, although certain circumstances, such as patients with concomitant acute kidney injury and lactic acidosis may benefit from sodium bicarbonate.

Finally, patients with a nongap acidosis benefit from sodium bicarbonate supplementation.

Conclusions

Empiric use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis is not warranted and likely does not improve patient-centered outcomes, except in select scenarios. Emergency physicians should reserve use of this medication to conditions with clear benefit to patients.

### Optimising acid-base balance in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: a quality improvement initiative [^84db85b5]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

This project used a multifaceted approach to attempt to enhance the management of metabolic acidosis in patients with advanced CKD, aligning local practice with national and international guidelines. Baseline data collection confirmed that serum bicarbonate levels were already being measured reliably in AKC clinics, but the results were not consistently acted on. This insight allowed us to focus our efforts on improving the appropriate and effective use of sodium bicarbonate.

Some successful outcomes were achieved during the course of the project. Most notably, we improved access to a gastro-resistant preparation of sodium bicarbonate for patients who had previously struggled with side effects with standard formulations — an intervention which was well received by both clinicians and patients. Although a formal cost-effectiveness analysis was not undertaken, improved tolerability and treatment adherence have the potential to delay progression to end-stage renal disease, which may yield downstream economic benefits. This represents a potential area for future evaluation, although the small number of eligible patients in our centre would present challenges in demonstrating a significant impact.

Although the project did not meet its aim of increasing the proportion of patients with serum bicarbonate levels in the optimal range, important lessons were learnt. A key challenge was the sustainability of interventions over time. The experience has highlighted the importance of incorporating detailed qualitative and quantitative data collection at multiple time points to better evaluate the effectiveness of change and to guide ongoing improvement efforts. We are committed to taking the project forward with this learning with a renewed focus on sustainability and measurement. Future work will explore more robust, data-driven strategies to embed positive change into routine practice and optimise the management of metabolic acidosis for our advanced CKD patient population.

### Approach to the hemodialysis patient with an abnormal serum bicarbonate concentration [^e6b183e4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

We present a patient receiving hemodialysis with a persistently high serum bicarbonate concentration to illustrate the evaluation and management issues for patients with both high (> 25 mEq/L) and low (< 20 mEq/L) pretreatment values. Patients with high serum bicarbonate concentrations typically are malnourished and have low rates of endogenous acid production. Evaluation should begin with assessment of whether an acute and potentially reversible cause of metabolic alkalosis is present. If not, management should be directed at treating malnutrition. By contrast, patients with low predialysis serum bicarbonate concentrations, in the absence of an acute and reversible cause, may benefit from increasing the level by an adjustment in dialysate bicarbonate concentration. However, the level at which one should intervene and to what extent serum bicarbonate concentration should be increased are unresolved issues. Whether such an intervention will reduce mortality risk has not been determined.

### Randomized, controlled trial of TRC101 to increase serum bicarbonate in patients with CKD [^27109389]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Metabolic acidosis is common in patients with CKD and has significant adverse effects on kidney, muscle, and bone. We tested the efficacy and safety of TRC101, a novel, sodium-free, nonabsorbed hydrochloric acid binder, to increase serum bicarbonate in patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

One hundred thirty-five patients were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, in-unit study (designated the TRCA-101 Study). Patients had a mean baseline eGFR of 35 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, a mean baseline serum bicarbonate of 17.7 mEq/L, and comorbidities, including hypertension (93%), diabetes (70%), and heart failure (21%). Patients ate a controlled diet and were treated for 14 days with placebo or one of four TRC101 dosing regimens (1.5, 3, or 4.5 g twice daily or 6 g once daily). After treatment, patients were discharged and followed for 7–14 days.

Results

All TRC101 treatment groups had a mean within-group increase in serum bicarbonate of ≥ 1.3 mEq/L (P < 0.001) within 72 hours of the first dose and a mean increase in serum bicarbonate of 3.2–3.9 mEq/L (P < 0.001) at the end of treatment compared with placebo, in which serum bicarbonate did not change. In the combined TRC101 treatment group, serum bicarbonate was normalized (22–29 mEq/L) at the end of treatment in 35% of patients and increased by ≥ 4 mEq/L in 39% of patients. After discontinuation of TRC101, serum bicarbonate decreased nearly to baseline levels within 2 weeks. All adverse events were mild or moderate, with gastrointestinal events most common. All patients completed the study.

Conclusions

TRC101 safely and significantly increased the level of serum bicarbonate in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD.

INCREASING SERUM BICARBONATE SLOWS PROGRESSION OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

Five studies have examined the impact of metabolic acidosis treatment with oral alkali or base-producing dietary interventions on the progression of kidney disease in CKD stage 3–5 patients with reduced serum HCO 3 (< 22 mEq/l) (Table 1). The study by de Brito-Ashurst et al. represented an important first step in linking correction of low serum HCO 3 and improved outcomes in patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis. In this single-center, open-label, prospective, parallel-group study, 134 CKD stage 4–5 patients with metabolic acidosis (serum HCO 3 > 16 and < 20 mEq/l) were randomized 1:1 to intervention with oral sodium bicarbonate, administered as 600 mg tablets three times per day and increased as necessary to achieve and maintain serum HCO 3 at least 23 mEq/l, or standard of care for 2 years. The objectives of the study were to assess the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy on progression of CKD and on nutritional status in these predialysis patients. The study population had an average baseline creatinine clearance of ∼20 ml/min/1.73 m² and an average baseline serum HCO 3 level of ∼20 mEq/l. Study criteria excluded patients with poorly controlled blood pressure (BP; > 150/90 mmHg, despite use of four agents), overt congestive heart failure, morbid obesity, and chronic sepsis, all conditions with potential fluid balance complications that could be worsened with ingestion of ∼500 mg of sodium that accompanied the average oral sodium bicarbonate daily dose administered in this study (1.82 ± 0.80 g/day). At the end of the 2-year study, serum HCO 3 increased in the treated patients by approximately 4 mEq/l compared with the control group (Fig. 1 a); these results were clinically meaningful and statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Compared with the control group, decline in creatinine clearance was slower with sodium bicarbonate supplementation (−1.88 versus −5.93 ml/min/1.73 m²; P < 0.0001), a difference of approximately 4 ml/min/1.73 m 2 over the 2-year treatment period (Fig. 1 b). Patients who received treatment for their metabolic acidosis were also significantly less likely than controls to experience rapid progression of kidney failure (9 versus 45%; P < 0.0001) or to develop ESKD (6.5 versus 33%; P < 0.001) over the 2-year treatment period (Fig. 2). Thus, this landmark study demonstrated the beneficial effects of increasing serum HCO 3 on slowing the progression of kidney disease to an extent that was both statistically significant and clinically meaningful.

### Outcomes after angiography with sodium bicarbonate and acetylcysteine [^b72a3241]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study PRESERVE (sodium bicarbonate) was published by Steven D Weisbord and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Contrast-induced nephropathy. In the PRESERVE (sodium bicarbonate) study, the trial question was: what is the role of sodium bicarbonate in patients at high risk for renal complications who were undergoing angiography? In the PRESERVE (sodium bicarbonate) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PRESERVE (sodium bicarbonate) study, the population was: 4993 patients (322 female, 4671 male). The inclusion criteria were patients at high risk for renal complications who were scheduled to undergo angiography. The key exclusion criteria were patients undergoing emergency angiography; unstable baseline levels of blood creatinine. In the PRESERVE (sodium bicarbonate) study, the interventions were: n = 2511 sodium bicarbonate (IV 1.26% sodium bicarbonate) n = 2482 sodium chloride (IV 0.9% sodium chloride). In the PRESERVE (sodium bicarbonate) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death, need for dialysis, or a persistent elevation of serum creatinine level by at least 50% from baseline at day 90 (4.4% vs. 4.7%; OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.22). In the PRESERVE (sodium bicarbonate) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in contrast-associated AKI (9.5% vs. 8.3%; OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.41) No significant difference in the rate of death by day 90 (2.4% vs. 2.7%; OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.24) No significant difference in the rate of need for dialysis by day 90 (1.3% vs. 1.2%; OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.81). In the PRESERVE (sodium bicarbonate) study, the conclusion was: in patients at high risk for renal complications who were scheduled to undergo angiography, sodium bicarbonate was not superior to sodium chloride with respect to death, need for dialysis, or a persistent elevation of serum creatinine level by at least 50% from baseline at day 90.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^fb83e823]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In summary, there is no mortality benefit or demonstrated improvement in hemodynamics with use of sodium bicarbonate in lactic acidosis, although emerging data suggest patients with persistent metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury may benefit from an infusion of bicarbonate after initial resuscitation. Emphasis should be placed on treatment of the underlying cause of the acidosis.

Recommendation

The routine use of bicarbonate supplementation for lactic acidosis and shock states is not recommended. There may be a role for an infusion of sodium bicarbonate after initial resuscitation in patients with acute kidney injury and pH < 7.2, although data are limited, and ongoing trials are evaluating benefit (Level of evidence: B).

Cardiac Arrest

The benefit of rapid pushes of ampules of sodium bicarbonate therapy in cardiac arrest is controversial. Decreased perfusion leads to hypoxia, anaerobic glycolysis, and generation of lactate. In addition, cessation of spontaneous ventilation causes buildup of carbon dioxide, decreases coronary perfusion pressure, and contributes to a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Acidemia has detrimental effects on hemodynamics, increases myocardial irritability, and lowers the threshold for dysrhythmias. Indeed, the use of sodium bicarbonate was initially part of Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines dating back to 1976. However, over the years, data emerged that did not show improvement in resuscitation outcomes with bicarbonate supplementation, thus calling into question the routine use of sodium bicarbonate during resuscitation. Subsequently, incorporation of sodium bicarbonate during cardiac arrest began to fall out of favor, instead emphasis has shifted to early defibrillation and high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation to augment coronary perfusion with improved patient centered outcomes.

### Saline versus balanced solutions: are clinical trials comparing two crystalloid solutions really needed? [^2d118f7b]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The alternative

We rather propose improved education of the medical community regarding the chemical composition of crystalloid solutions and better understanding of how solutions should be selected depending on each patient's individual situation. We as clinicians should check blood chloride levels exactly as we do sodium and potassium levels and adapt our fluid choices accordingly.

The real issue for which a fluid trial could be of use is to look at potential beneficial/detrimental effects of added solutes, such as acetate, gluconate, and even calcium or magnesium supplementation, but this would require a particular design.

We should be pleased that we have the choice of several different intravenous solutions, just as we are happy to be able to have a choice of liquids to drink. Any prospective, randomized controlled trial on different types of oral fluid would certainly indicate that excessive amounts of most drinks, especially when they contain alcohol, high sugar, or stimulants, are bad for the body. This does not mean that we should only drink water. But we should vary the types of liquid we drink and drink all liquids in moderate, responsible amounts. Similarly, we should not limit our intravenous fluid choices to just one or two types and should not give any one type in excess.

Undoubtedly, the safest intravenous solution in a patient without major metabolic abnormalities would have a composition close to that of human plasma. It has been said that bicarbonate is unstable when in solution, but this is not true as bicarbonate solutions are readily available from the shelf; actually, renal substitution fluids for continuous hemofiltration contain a mixture of electrolytes, including bicarbonate. Some people already administer these solutions as regular intravenous solutions but the 5-liter bag size complicates this practice. The industry is hesitant to launch such a solution, in anticipation of the costly clinical trials that may be required by the authorities. We argue that a fluid with such a natural composition does not need extensive clinical trials. The scientific community should request that such solutions be developed and insist that the authorities minimize the requirements needed to commercialize such a solution.

There are only a few indications for repeated saline administration: metabolic alkalosis (for the high chloride input) and hyponatremia (for the high sodium input), as well as severe brain injury for its normotonic composition. When such conditions are not present, administration of saline solutions should usually be restricted to not more than 1 liter per 24-h period.

Comparing two intravenous solutions with different compositions makes no sense… unless electrolyte measurements are not available.

### Safely reducing haemodialysis frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic [^65ea5bb2]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing haemodialysis (HD) are at higher risk of developing worse outcomes if they contract COVID-19. In our renal service we reduced HD frequency from thrice to twice-weekly in selected patients with the primary aim of reducing COVID 19 exposure and transmission between HD patients.

Methods

Dialysis unit nephrologists identified 166 suitable patients (38.4% of our HD population) to temporarily convert to twice-weekly haemodialysis immediately prior to the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in our area. Changes in pre-dialysis weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and biochemistry were recorded weekly throughout the 4-week project. Hyperkalaemic patients (serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L) were treated with a potassium binder, sodium bicarbonate and received responsive dietary advice.

Results

There were 12 deaths (5 due to COVID-19) in the HD population, 6 of which were in the twice weekly HD group; no deaths were definitively associated with change of dialysis protocol. A further 19 patients were either hospitalised and/or developed COVID-19 and thus transferred back to thrice weekly dialysis as per protocol. 113 (68.1%) were still receiving twice-weekly HD by the end of the 4-week project. Indications for transfer back to thrice weekly were; fluid overload (19), persistent hyperkalaemia (4), patient request (4) and compliance (1). There were statistically significant increases in SBP and pre-dialysis potassium during the project.

Conclusions

Short term conversion of a large but selected HD population to twice-weekly dialysis sessions was possible and safe. This approach could help mitigate COVID-19 transmission amongst dialysis patients in centres with similar organisational pressures.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^c59b8670]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease metabolic acidosis — trial evidence and certainty: The Work Group has not provided a graded recommendation for the treatment of acidosis due to a lack of large-scale RCTs supporting its use. In 2012, a 2B recommendation was justified because alkali supplementation may be a promising low-cost, high-benefit adjunct treatment for people with CKD and may be accessible to all populations. A 2021 systematic review identified 15 trials with ≥ 3 months of follow-up in people with CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² and/or proteinuria) comparing the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo or versus no study medication on kidney outcomes. Of the 15 trials (2445 participants, median follow-up 12 months), 1 new trial has been published since 2012. The totality of the evidence remains limited by a low number of outcomes, and meta-analyses restricted to the placebo-controlled trials does not confirm any important kidney effect of oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo on risk of kidney failure (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.54–1.22).

Supporting evidence includes a multicenter trial in which 400 patients with severe metabolic acidemia (pH ≤ 7.20) were randomly allocated to receive IV 4.2% sodium bicarbonate with the aim of achieving an arterial pH of 7.3, or control (no bicarbonate), and no between-group difference was observed in the primary outcome of a composite of 28-day mortality and organ failure at day 7; in the subgroup with AKIN stage 2 or 3 lower mortality was observed with bicarbonate therapy: control 57/90 (63%), bicarbonate 42/92, 46%, absolute risk reduction (ARR) −17% (−33.0 to −2.3), p = 0.016, and there was a significant differential effect compared with those with a score of 0–1 (p value for heterogeneity = 0.023); sepsis was present in 61% (238/389) at randomization with no differential effect between patients with vs without sepsis, and outcomes for those with both sepsis and AKI were not reported.

### Sodium bicarbonate treatment and clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease with metabolic acidosis: a meta-analysis [^d91a1f30]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Advanced CKD impairs the ability to excrete acid loads, leading to acid retention and metabolic acidosis (MA).MA is linked with several complications, including CKD progression, cardiovascular (CV) disease, and an increased risk of mortality.

Sodium bicarbonate has emerged as a therapeutic option for MA in CKD populations, with several studies suggesting its clinical benefits in preventing kidney function deterioration. – However, some studies have not identified the benefits of sodium bicarbonate in slowing eGFR decline. Previous research indicated improved eGFR with sodium bicarbonate in patients with CKD with low to normal bicarbonate levels, but its effects in patients with MA have not been specifically studied, leaving its role in CKD with concurrent MA controversial. In addition, there is currently no clear evidence regarding the effects of sodium bicarbonate on serum albumin, muscle mass, calcium and phosphate, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) in CKD populations with MA.

To address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis to provide definitive evidence concerning the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate on prognostic markers and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD and MA.

### Sodium bicarbonate [^c666a04e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is administered by the intravenous route.

In cardiac arrest, a rapid intravenous dose of one to two 50 mL vials (44.6 to 100 mEq) may be given initially and continued at a rate of 50 mL (44.6 to 50 mEq) every 5 to 10 minutes if necessary (as indicated by arterial pH and blood gas monitoring) to reverse the acidosis. Caution should be observed in emergencies where very rapid infusion of large quantities of bicarbonate is indicated. Bicarbonate solutions are hypertonic and may produce an undesirable rise in plasma sodium concentration in the process of correcting the metabolic acidosis. In cardiac arrest, however, the risks from acidosis exceed those of hypernatremia.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP may be added to other intravenous fluids. The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight-hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight - depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

### Optimising acid-base balance in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: a quality improvement initiative [^2b572d31]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Design

The project was jointly led by the two authors, who collaboratively brainstormed initial thoughts on potential interventions before seeking wider input. Early engagement with the multidisciplinary team (MDT) was a key priority. We consulted with consultant colleagues and the team of specialist renal nurses who are integral to the running of AKC clinics.

To raise awareness and build initial momentum, we presented the findings of the baseline audit to colleagues at a weekly departmental educational meeting. This session was used to highlight the clinical importance of optimising serum bicarbonate levels in advanced CKD and to share the initial data. Several colleagues expressed surprise at the proportion of patients with suboptimal bicarbonate levels, reinforcing our view that the issue had been under-recognised. We used this opportunity to emphasise the potential for improvement and hypothesised that bringing the issue to the forefront of people's minds could prompt more frequent consideration of bicarbonate levels in subsequent clinic reviews.

In parallel, we wanted to improve access to an alternative gastro-resistant preparation of sodium bicarbonate to benefit patients who had previously experienced side effects with traditional preparations. Achieving this required engagement with key stakeholders, including pharmacy teams and representatives from the integrated care board (ICB), to address prescribing pathways and cost considerations.

We then developed and implemented a simplified flowchart to support healthcare professionals when monitoring metabolic acidosis and prescribing sodium bicarbonate in advanced CKD. The tool was designed to act as both a visual prompt and a practical guide, consolidating relevant clinical information and decision-making criteria in an accessible format. The design allowed for easy updates in response to emerging evidence or changes in local policy, supporting the long-term sustainability of the intervention.

### 8.4% sodium bicarbonate [^1dfa82c2]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pharmacology

Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of acidosis.

Sodium bicarbonate in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3¯) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Bicarbonate (HCO3¯) is a normal constituent of body fluids and the normal plasma level ranges from 24 to 31 mEq/liter. Plasma concentration is regulated by the kidney through acidification of the urine when there is a deficit or by alkalinization of the urine when there is an excess. Bicarbonate anion is considered "labile" since at a proper concentration of hydrogen ion (H+) it may be converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3) and thence to its volatile form, carbon dioxide (CO2) excreted by the lung. Normally a ratio of 1:20 (carbonic acid: bicarbonate) is present in the extracellular fluid. In a healthy adult with normal kidney function, practically all the glomerular filtered bicarbonate ion is reabsorbed; less than 1% is excreted in the urine.

### 8.4% sodium bicarbonate [^685ce301]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

In general, it is unwise to attempt full correction of a low total CO2 content during the first 24 hours of therapy, since this may be accompanied by an unrecognized alkalosis because of a delay in the readjustment of ventilation to normal. Owing to this lag, the achievement of total CO2 content of about 20 mEq/liter at the end of the first day of therapy will usually be associated with a normal blood pH. Further modification of the acidosis to completely normal values usually occurs in the presence of normal kidney function when and if the cause of the acidosis can be controlled. Values for total CO2 which are brought to normal or above normal within the first day of therapy are very likely to be associated with grossly alkaline values for blood pH, with ensuing undesired side effects.

### Current status of bicarbonate in CKD [^cda8b604]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis was one of the earliest complications to be recognized and explained pathologically in patients with CKD. Despite the accumulated evidence of deleterious effects of acidosis, treatment of acidosis has been tested very little, especially with respect to standard clinical outcomes. On the basis of fundamental research and small alkali supplementation trials, correcting metabolic acidosis has a strikingly broad array of potential benefits. This review summarizes the published evidence on the association between serum bicarbonate and clinical outcomes. We discuss the role of alkali supplementation in CKD as it relates to retarding kidney disease progression, improving metabolic and musculoskeletal complications.

### Sodium bicarbonate supplements for treating acute kidney injury [^1992f075]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, serious, but potentially treatable condition. Because AKI is often associated with acidosis, it has become common practice to recommend administration of sodium bicarbonate to correct acid imbalance.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of the use of sodium bicarbonate for people with AKI. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcome measures were patients' need for renal replacement therapy; return to baseline kidney function; and overall survival.

Search Methods

In November 2011 we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register using keywords relevant to this review. The register is populated using searches of Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE and handsearching records from renal-related journals and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the use of sodium bicarbonate supplements, administered by any route, for the treatment of adults with AKI were to be included. The search strategy did not restrict inclusion based on an upper age limit or publication language. We did not consider inclusion of studies that investigated use of sodium bicarbonate for AKI prevention.

Data Collection and Analysis

All authors planned to independently assess and extracted information. Information was to be collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes. Results were to be expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or as mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Although our literature search identified four studies, none of these met our predetermined selection criteria. Hence, no suitable studies were identified for inclusion in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no RCT evidence - supportive or otherwise - for the use of sodium bicarbonate for people with AKI. We concluded that there is an urgent need for well conducted RCTs in this area.

### The end of the bicarbonate era? A therapeutic application of the stewart approach [^573f5591]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

However, we should be cautiously enthusiastic. Modifying pH by removing chloride and manipulating the strong ion difference will not treat the underlying cause of the acid–base disorder any more than lowering P 2 or administering sodium bicarbonate does, unless of course the primary derangement is hyperchloremia, elevated P 2, or hyponatremia. Although acidosis with hyperchloremia is quite common in critical illness, preventing hyperchloremia by using the physicochemical approach to guide the choice and composition of fluids is perhaps a simpler and wiser alternative. Furthermore, hyperventilation, sodium bicarbonate administration, and chloride electrodialysis do not directly treat elevated lactate levels, the most common cause of acidosis in critical illness. However, Zanella and colleagues make no such claims. They simply use the physicochemical approach to elegantly show that increasing the strong ion difference restores pH to normal levels. It's conceivable that the same result could be more easily obtained by conventional dialysis, where the dialysate solutions are engineered to target a given strong ion difference. Either way, the manipulation of strong ion difference to achieve specific therapeutic effects is slowly gaining traction, and similar approaches have recently been shown to enhance respiratory support. Whatever the future holds for these therapies, it behooves us to start teaching the physicochemical approach to our medical students and junior colleagues sooner rather than later.

Solutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention.

In patients with diminished renal function, administration of solutions containing sodium ions may result in sodium retention.

The intravenous administration of these solutions can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^f7c5b2ea]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium bicarbonate is commonly used to correct metabolic acidosis in pediatric patients, yet its efficacy remains controversial. This study aims to assess its effectiveness in treating non-lactic and lactic metabolic acidosis and its impact at various chloride levels.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted by screening pediatric patients diagnosed with metabolic acidosis from a paediatric intensive care database. Patients were categorized into two groups: lactate patients (lactate > 2.0 mmol/L) and non-lactate patients (lactate ≤ 2.0 mmol/L). The risk of death in patients who received sodium bicarbonate was assessed.

Results

Sodium bicarbonate treatment did not significantly affect in-hospital mortality in either overall lactate patients or non-lactate patients, with adjusted OR of 1.044 (95% CI: 0.829–1.315, p = 0.714) and 0.838 (95% CI: 0.548–1.281, p = 0.414), respectively. In lactate patients, those receiving sodium bicarbonate had a higher risk of in-hospital death when chloride was < 107 mmol/L (adjusted OR = 2.195, 95% CI: 1.536–3.135, p < 0.001), whereas the risk of in-hospital death decreased when chloride was ≥ 113 mmol/L (adjusted OR = 0.365, 95% CI: 0.217–0.614, p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in non-lactate patients.

Conclusions

Sodium bicarbonate treatment does not improve the survival of pediatric patients with lactate or non-lactate metabolic acidosis. However, it can reduce the odds of mortality in pediatric patients with hyperchloremia, regardless of their lactate levels. Prospective studies are needed to further confirm these findings.

### Clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for older patients with chronic kidney disease and low-grade acidosis (BiCARB): a pragmatic randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^3721f910]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

A number of limitations require further comment. Given the modest increase in serum bicarbonate seen with the dosing schedule used in this trial, it is possible that larger doses of oral bicarbonate are required to increase serum bicarbonate in older people with CKD, although the mechanisms that might underpin such a hypothesis are unclear. Whilst such an approach would be of mechanistic interest, we do not believe that higher doses (more than the six tablets per day) would be well tolerated by older people; the adherence rate would likely be even lower than the moderate adherence rate observed in the current trial. The higher rate of adverse events in the bicarbonate arm, particularly gastrointestinal adverse events, slightly lower physical function measures and lack of a relationship between adherence and treatment effect size, all argue that a higher dose of bicarbonate is unlikely to produce health benefits in this patient group. We cannot exclude a potentially beneficial effect of bicarbonate in different groups of patients with CKD, however. In particular, the current trial enrolled an overwhelmingly white European population. CKD of different aetiologies may respond differently and may explain some of the heterogeneity seen in one recent systematic review.

### Optimising acid-base balance in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: a quality improvement initiative [^4389f9d7]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Measurement

To establish a baseline, on 'day 0', we collated a list of the last 100 patients seen in AKC clinics in our renal centre. This included patients from several clinics over the preceding 3-week period. For each patient, we collected retrospective data from the electronic patient record, including demographics, the most recent serum bicarbonate level and when this level was measured. We reviewed their recent clinic letters and electronic GP records for sodium bicarbonate prescriptions and for indications that the patient had reported problems with compliance or side effects. These data points were entered into a spreadsheet and subsequently analysed.

The results of baseline data collection showed that a majority of patients were having serum bicarbonate levels monitored regularly in the clinic (94% had a measurement within the preceding 6 months). The mean serum bicarbonate level in this cohort was 21.5 mmol/L, falling slightly below the optimal range of 22–29 mmol/L. When the distribution of serum bicarbonate levels was examined, only 46% of patients had a level within the optimal range. Although the mean value may appear only slightly below the reference range, this masked a clinically important distribution: more than half of patients had suboptimal bicarbonate levels (< 22 mmol/L). This provided the key rationale for undertaking the project, as even modest and sustained deviations from the normal range are associated with adverse outcomes in CKD.

Of the patients with suboptimal bicarbonate levels, 24% of patients did not have sodium bicarbonate tablets prescribed. For two of these patients, there was documentation of previous side effects with sodium bicarbonate, and a further two patients had documented poor compliance.

We then used the three key questions from the 'Model for Improvement' approachas a framework to structure how we approached the project:

What are we trying to accomplish?

A higher proportion of patients with advanced CKD maintaining optimal serum bicarbonate levels as described in our SMART aim.

How will we know change is an improvement?

We chose to use serum bicarbonate levels as our primary measure, as it was apparent from baseline data that this measurement was consistently available and provided a validated objective value for comparison between intervention cycles. We could therefore demonstrate change, and hopefully improvement, by monitoring the number of patients in the AKC clinic with serum bicarbonate levels in the target range through repeated cycles of data collection after interventions were implemented.
