## Question

What can cause vomiting, pale/bloody stool, and blue lips in 18 month old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what can cause vomiting, pale or bloody stool, and blue lips in an 18-month-old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which single condition best explains all three features. Then, I should verify alternative explanations for each symptom and why they are less likely to unify the presentation. Next, I will review the pathophysiology to ensure internal consistency. Finally, I will outline immediate diagnostic steps and management priorities, including when to involve surgery and what not to miss.

> Let me first confirm the most likely unifying diagnosis. Intussusception classically presents with vomiting, abdominal pain or irritability, and blood per rectum, and it can cause pallor or cyanosis from hypovolemia, shock, or ischemia, which aligns with blue lips in a toddler. Importantly, the classic triad is uncommon, so the absence of all three does not exclude the diagnosis, and the age peak includes 18 months, making this the leading consideration here [^c135fcdf] [^f56c41e3] [^5c942d8b].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence linking these features. Multiple series show that vomiting is common, bloody stool is present in a minority but significant subset, and pallor or circulatory compromise can occur with ischemia or shock. One emergency department study found that crying, abdominal mass, pallor, and vomiting together conferred a 95% probability of intussusception, underscoring how systemic signs like pallor or cyanosis accompany the gastrointestinal features in real-world cohorts [^2dcddd17] [^5c942d8b] [^f56c41e3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should consider alternatives for each symptom and see if any single alternative explains all three. For vomiting alone, gastroenteritis, food poisoning, and cyclic vomiting syndrome are common, but they do not explain bloody stool or cyanosis. For bloody stool, infectious dysentery, Meckel's diverticulum, anal fissure, and volvulus are possibilities, yet none of these typically produces central cyanosis. For blue lips, anaphylaxis, methemoglobinemia, and severe anemia or hypoxia are on the list, but they do not unify with vomiting and bloody stool in a single coherent pathway. Thus, intussusception remains the most parsimonious explanation across all three findings [^8c521c48] [^f8346431] [^c135fcdf] [^f646e9e4] [^cc2adbc6].

> I need to check the pathophysiology to ensure internal consistency. Intussusception causes bowel obstruction with venous congestion and ischemia, leading to mucosal bleeding and the characteristic "currant jelly" stool, while pain, vomiting, and systemic signs such as pallor or cyanosis reflect hypovolemia and shock from third-spacing and ischemia. This mechanistic chain plausibly accounts for vomiting, bloody stool, and blue lips in the same patient over time [^c135fcdf] [^fc816311].

> Next, I should review immediate diagnostic steps and what not to miss. Abdominal ultrasound is the first-line test with high sensitivity and specificity for intussusception and should be obtained urgently when suspected. Concurrently, I should assess circulation, obtain IV access, and send labs including CBC, electrolytes, and a type and screen, while preparing for contrast or air enema both for diagnosis and therapeutic reduction. I should also remember that early presentation may precede the classic triad, so a high index of suspicion is warranted even if only vomiting and lethargy are present initially [^4ec6977a] [^fc816311] [^c135fcdf].

> But wait, what if the ultrasound is negative and I still have high suspicion. I should double-check for intermittent intussusception or a lead point, and consider repeating ultrasound if symptoms persist, because the intussusception can be transient. If the child deteriorates with signs of peritonitis or sepsis, surgical consultation should not be delayed while awaiting repeat imaging, as time to reduction correlates with outcomes and the risk of bowel loss rises with delay [^fc816311] [^c135fcdf].

> I will now examine management priorities. Immediate stabilization with isotonic fluids, continuous monitoring, and early involvement of pediatric surgery are essential. If ultrasound confirms intussusception, nonoperative reduction by air or contrast enema is first-line and highly effective, with success rates around 80–90% in experienced hands. If reduction fails or there is perforation, ischemia, or a lead point, operative management is indicated. Throughout, I should reassess for recurrence after successful reduction and counsel caregivers about warning signs [^fc816311] [^c135fcdf].

> Let me reconsider the differential one more time to ensure I am not missing a masquerader. While severe gastroenteritis with dehydration can cause vomiting and pallor, the addition of frank blood in the stool plus central cyanosis pushes me back toward intussusception or another surgical emergency. Likewise, anaphylaxis would typically add urticaria, angioedema, or respiratory compromise rather than isolated bloody stool. Given the totality of findings, intussusception remains the most coherent and time-critical diagnosis to act upon [^8c521c48] [^f646e9e4] [^c135fcdf].

> In summary, I should confirm that the most likely cause of vomiting, pale or bloody stool, and blue lips in an 18-month-old is intussusception, driven by intestinal obstruction, ischemia, and hypovolemia. Urgent bedside ultrasound, prompt resuscitation, and early pediatric surgical involvement are the key next steps, with enema reduction as first-line therapy if confirmed and operative management reserved for failed reduction or complicated cases [^c135fcdf] [^4ec6977a] [^fc816311].

The most likely cause of **vomiting, pale/bloody stool, and blue lips** in an 18-month-old is **intussusception**, a medical emergency in which one segment of bowel telescopes into another, causing obstruction, ischemia, and bleeding [^c135fcdf]. Blue lips indicate **hypoxia or shock** from bowel ischemia and systemic compromise [^d07653b3]. Immediate evaluation with **ultrasound and urgent pediatric surgical consultation** is critical, as delayed treatment increases the risk of bowel necrosis and perforation [^4ec6977a].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical features** | **Likelihood** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Intussusception | Telescoping of bowel causing obstruction, ischemia, and bleeding | - Vomiting <br/> - Pale/bloody stool ("currant jelly") <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Lethargy <br/> - Blue lips (cyanosis) from hypoxia/shock | High |
| Gastroenteritis (severe) | Infection causing vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration | - Vomiting <br/> - Diarrhea (may be bloody in dysentery) <br/> - Dehydration <br/> - Cyanosis in severe cases | Moderate |
| Anaphylaxis | Severe allergic reaction causing vascular collapse | - Vomiting <br/> - Pale skin <br/> - Cyanosis <br/> - Respiratory distress <br/> - Hypotension | Moderate |
| Methemoglobinemia | Elevated methemoglobin causing tissue hypoxia | - Cyanosis <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Chocolate-brown blood <br/> - Pale or gray skin | Low |
| Foreign body ingestion | Obstruction or mucosal injury causing bleeding | - Vomiting <br/> - Bloody stool <br/> - Respiratory distress if airway involved | Low |

## Pathophysiology of intussusception

Intussusception occurs when a proximal bowel segment invaginates into a distal segment, creating a "telescope" that causes obstruction, venous congestion, ischemia, and bleeding. The classic triad of **vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody stool** is present in only a minority of cases, making clinical suspicion essential [^c135fcdf]. Blue lips (cyanosis) reflect **hypoxia and shock** from bowel ischemia, systemic hypoperfusion, and metabolic acidosis [^d07653b3].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

- **Ultrasound**: Highly sensitive and specific for intussusception; shows a "target sign" or "donut sign" [^4ec6977a].
- **Plain abdominal radiography**: May show obstruction but is not reliable for excluding intussusception [^4ec6977a].
- **Contrast enema**: Diagnostic and therapeutic; can reduce the intussusception [^4ec6977a].

---

## Immediate management

- **Stabilization**: Airway, breathing, circulation; IV fluids, oxygen, and nasogastric decompression [^notfound].
- **Ultrasound**: Confirm diagnosis and assess reducibility [^4ec6977a].
- **Contrast enema**: Attempt reduction if feasible; success rates are high [^notfound].
- **Surgery**: Indicated if enema reduction fails, perforation, or peritonitis is present [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent with early diagnosis and treatment**; delayed care increases the risk of bowel necrosis, perforation, and sepsis [^notfound].

---

The most likely cause of **vomiting, pale/bloody stool, and blue lips** in an 18-month-old is **intussusception**, a surgical emergency requiring immediate ultrasound and pediatric surgical evaluation [^c135fcdf].

Recurrent, episodic vomiting in children — diagnostic approach emphasizes that a pattern fulfilling the revised historical criteria listed in Table 1 is likely (about 90%) to be ultimately diagnosed as idiopathic CVS, while clinicians must differentiate individuals with specific and serious underlying causes of vomiting (about 10%) for which prompt treatment may alter outcomes. The principles aim to identify those with a cyclic vomiting pattern between ages 2 and 18 years at the greatest risk for having an organic cause, acknowledging that children younger than 2 years may have CVS, serious underlying metabolic and surgical disorders are more frequent and more difficult to diagnose in that age range. There are no specific laboratory markers to diagnose CVS.

### Vomiting [^e0306294]. Pediatrics in Review (2013). Low credibility.

Vomiting can be the presenting symptom of a variety of disorders, ranging from self-limited diseases to life-threatening diseases. The causes of vomiting vary with age of presentation, and pediatricians should develop the skill to identify serious conditions at the earliest stage based on the age of presentation. Bilious emesis at any age is a sign of intestinal obstruction until proven otherwise and needs immediate attention. Vomiting is not always due to a GI disorder, and pediatricians should look for causes outside the GI tract if no GI disease is identified.

Allergy and anaphylaxis emergency plan — severe symptoms and immediate actions: "Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening, severe allergic reaction. If in doubt, give epinephrine". If a child has "ANY of these severe symptoms after eating the food or having a sting, give epinephrine", including "Shortness of breath, wheezing, or coughing", "Skin color is pale or has a bluish color", "Weak pulse", "Fainting or dizziness", "Tight or hoarse throat", "Trouble breathing or swallowing", "Swelling of lips or tongue that bother breathing", "Vomiting or diarrhea (if severe or combined with other symptoms)", "Many hives or redness over body", or "Feeling of 'doom', confusion, altered consciousness, or agitation". Immediate steps are to "Inject epinephrine right away! Note time when epinephrine was given", "Call 911". and "Ask for ambulance with epinephrine" and "Tell rescue squad when epinephrine was given", then "Stay with child and:

- Call parents and child's doctor.
- Give a second dose of epinephrine, if symptoms get worse, continue, or do not get better in 5 minutes.
- Keep child lying on back. If the child vomits or has trouble breathing, keep child lying on his or her side". "Give other medicine, if prescribed. Do not use other medicine in place of epinephrine", with options including "Antihistamine" and "Inhaler/bronchodilator". In the "SPECIAL SITUATION" where "child has an extremely severe allergy to an insect sting or the following food(s)… Even if child has MILD symptoms after a sting or eating these foods, give epinephrine".

Definitions

Diarrhea was defined by WHO criteria (2005): the passage of unusually loose or watery stools, at least three times in a 24-h period. Persistent diarrhea was defined as diarrhea lasting at least 14 days. Dysentery was defined as observation of blood in stools during acute diarrhea by parents or physicians. "Some dehydration" was defined as the presence of two or more signs from as follows: restless, irritable condition; sunken eyes; thirsty, drinks eagerly; and skin turgor: skin pinch goes back slowly. "Severe dehydration" was defined as the presence of two or more signs from as follows: lethargic or unconscious condition, sunken eyes, drinks poorly or unable to drink, and skin pinch returns very slowly. The numbers of children with severe dehydration were reported separately from those with some dehydration. Temperature gradient was detected by the clinician running their hand down the patient's arm or leg and defined as reduced temperature in distal compared to proximal limbs. Shock was defined as the presence of at least one sign of weak/absent peripheral pulse, conscious level less than alert, cold hands and temperature gradient, or capillary refill time > 3 s. Impaired consciousness was defined as "prostration" (inability to sit unassisted (≥ 1 year), inability to drink or breast feed (< 1 year)) or "coma" (Blantyre coma score ≤ 2). Severe pneumonia was defined using the WHO 2013 syndromic criteria as cough or difficulty breathing plus either lower chest wall indrawing or inability to breastfeed/drink/vomiting everything, impaired consciousness, central cyanosis, or peripheral oxygen saturation < 90% by pulse oximetry. Hypothermia was defined as axillary temperature < 36 °C, and fever as axillary temperature > 37.5 °C. Clinical signs at admission were entered directly into a database by trained clinicians who provided care according to the WHO guidelines. Severe anemia was defined as hemoglobin < 5 g/dl. An abnormal white blood cell count was defined as < 4 or > 12 × 10 9 /L. Biochemical definitions are given in Additional file 1: Table S4.

Ethical considerations

The study was approved by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) National Ethical Review Committee (SCC 2778). Informed consent was given in writing by parents/guardians for their child's participation in the study.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — clinical features and burden include recurrent, discrete, self-limited episodes defined by symptom-based criteria and the absence of positive laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic testing, with intense vomiting and early-morning onset described. A large case series found that although it affects only 5% to 15% of a child's lifetime, it results in 24 days of missed school and an annualized cost of care of $17,035. The vomiting is intense (median 6 times/ hour at peak), often bilious (83% in some series), and episodes often commence in the early morning (eg, 3–4 AM or upon awakening). CVS starts commonly in early childhood, and the vomiting symptoms may abate with the onset of classical migraine headaches during adolescence.

Case presentation

We present a case of 5 year old girl who presented to paediatric outpatient clinic of R.D. Gardi Medical College and C.R. Gardi Hospital, Surasa, Ujjain, India with complains of decreased appetite since past four to five days, yellowish discoloration of sclera noticed since past two days and deep yellow coloured urine since past two days. Patient had no history of clay coloured stools, fever, vomiting, haematemesis, malena or history suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy. The perinatal history was uneventful with no history of umbilical sepsis. The child had no significant past medical history including that of jaundice. Immunization of the child was appropriate for age. At initial examination her anthropometric measurements showed a weight of 15 Kg and a height of 110 cm. The weight-for-age was between 3 rd to 15 th percentiles; height-for-age between 50 th to 85 th percentiles and weight-for-height below 3 rd percentile, according to the WHO Reference Growth Standards 2007. The anthropometric findings were suggestive of acute on chronic malnutrition with stunting. The dietary evaluation revealed a diet inadequate in calories (by one third), proteins (by one fourth) and iron (by half) for her age and sex. The vitals at presentation were heart rate of 120 per minute, respiratory rate of 20 per minute and blood pressure of 98/60 mm of Hg in right in right upper limb in supine position. Four-limb blood pressure measurement was also normal. Icterus was noticed. Examination of ears, nose and throat showed no abnormality. No skin rash was present. No clubbing, cyanosis or oedema of arms or legs was noted. Cardiovascular examination was normal. The lungs were clear on percussion and auscultation. The abdomen was soft with no organomegaly or clinical ascites. A provisional diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis was made based on history, clinical examination and local endemicity of acute viral hepatitis caused by hepatitis A or hepatitis E. Only blood investigation advised was serum bilirubin, which showed total bilirubin 9.29 mg/dl with direct bilirubin of 7.38 mg/dl and indirect bilirubin of 2.41 mg/dl. Patient was treated symptomatically for viral hepatitis and asked to follow up if any danger signs of acute viral hepatitis appear or after 4 weeks. No serological confirmation of viral hepatitis was deemed necessary in view of acute viral hepatitis caused by hepatitis A virus being an endemic disease in the geographic region.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome [^cf40592c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) treatment phases and approach — the clinical course is divided into the episode phase and the well phase; the episode phase includes the prodrome, the vomiting phase, and the recovery phase. Treatment with abortive therapy as early as possible in the prodrome or vomiting phase may terminate the attack, while full-blown vomiting prompts supportive therapy at home or in the hospital. If abortive therapy fails consistently or if episodes are frequent and/or severe, then daily prophylactic therapy to prevent subsequent episodes is recommended. Management requires an individually tailored regimen, and the 2 key treatment arms are prophylactic (or preventive) measures and medications administered between attacks, and acute and supportive interventions given during attacks.

### Haemoptysis caused by the absence of the right pulmonary vein in an 11-year-old child: a case report and literature review [^60f25031]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

An 11-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital with a complaint of intermittent cough and haemoptysis for two months. Haemoptysis presented as the expectoration of bloody sputum, which lasted for 2 days, 4–5 times/day. No other symptoms such as epistaxis, fever, tachypnoea, wheezing, dyspnoea, dizziness, headache, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting or bloody stool were described during the disease course. Eight days before admission, symptoms of cough worsened to more than 10 episodes per day, accompanied by a runny nose, nasal obstruction, yellow phlegm and sometimes blood in the sputum. Blood routine test, biochemistry and coagulation function tests at the local hospital revealed no abnormalities. Chest CT at the local hospital revealed cystic and low attenuation lesions, patchy and flocculent shadows in the right lung, partial bronchial dilatation and interlobular septal thickening of the right lung. In addition, small nodules were observed in the middle lobe of the right lung and lower lobe of the left lung. The boundaries of the nodules were clear, and the maximum diameter was approximately 0.4 cm. The local hospital considered the diagnosis to be "interstitial pneumonia and bronchiectasis with infection". After the anti-infective and haemostatic treatment, the symptoms of cough and haemoptysis were not relieved. Therefore, this patient was admitted to our hospital for further treatment.

The patient was hospitalized for pneumonia once 3 years ago, but the specific diagnosis, treatment process and examination results could not be provided. The patient had a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (> 7 times/year) in the past year. A decreased activity tolerance was reported in 1.5 years. The history of foreign body aspiration, direct contact with tuberculosis patients or hereditary haemorrhagic diseases prior to illness onset was denied. The patient was a full-term baby with a birth weight of 2200 g. There was no birth history of asphyxia or rescue. The growth and development of this patient were similar to those of her peers. She had no family history of similar conditions and denied a family history of genetic or vascular anomalies. Her mother did not have regular antenatal examinations during pregnancy and could not provide the results of prenatal ultrasound.

Symptoms of an overdose of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule include:

a warm feeling or flushing
sweating
restlessness
weakness or dizziness
a fast heart rate
ringing in the ears

What should I avoid while using aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule?

heavy alcohol use. People who drink three or more alcoholic drinks every day have a higher risk of bleeding during treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule, because it contains aspirin.

What are the possible side effects of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule?

Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule may cause serious side effects, including:

increased risk of bleeding. You may bleed more easily during aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule treatment, and it may take longer than usual for bleeding to stop. This can include:
bleeding into your brain (intracranial hemorrhage). This can be a medical emergency. Get medical help right away if you have any of these symptoms while taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule:

severe headache with drowsiness
confusion or memory change
pass out (become unconscious)

bleeding in your stomach or intestine.

stomach pain
heartburn or nausea
vomiting blood or vomit looks like "coffee grounds"
red or bloody stools
black stools that look like tar

### Childhood intussusception in Uzbekistan: analysis of retrospective surveillance data [^5c942d8b]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Results

During 5 years, 67 confirmed cases of IS in children < 24 months of age were identified, corresponding to an incidence of 23 cases [95% CI 13.6–32.4] per 100,000 child-years or approximately 237 cases per year. A slightly higher incidence among children 0–6 months of age that will be targeted by rotavirus vaccination was observed (Table 1). Among confirmed cases, boys (67%) were significantly (p < 0.05) younger than girls (10.4 vs. 15.4 months), and the median age was 12.1 months. We found a biphasic age distribution with the fist peak in children aged 3–6 months and the second peak among those 18 months and older (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Age distribution of intussusception in 67 children aged < 24 months, Bukhara region, Uzbekistan, 2004–2008.

The most frequent symptoms were abdominal pain (97%), palpable intestinal mass (97%), and bile-stained vomiting (80.6%). The lethargy (83.6%) and pallor (64.2%) were also observed frequently. Detection of blood on rectal examination (82.1%) and presence of IS (79.1%) or fluid level and dilated loops on plain abdominal radiography (20.9%) were the main symptoms for diagnosis. A rectal mass was detected in 3 cases (4.5%), and the presence of "red currant jelly" stool was only reported in a single case. The classic triad of vomiting, passage of blood through the rectum and abdominal pain was documented in 8 (11.9%) of 67 children. The clinical presentation at admission also included symptoms of concurrent gastroenteritis in 36% of children and concurrent respiratory symptoms in 49% of cases. We did not detect any significant differences in the distribution of symptoms by age or sex. No statistically significant changes in the monthly occurrence of IS were found despite a potential increase in the number of cases during April and May (Figure 2). Importantly, no increase was observed during autumn when most rotavirus disease occurs in Uzbekistan.

CLINICAL SYNDROMES OF PEDIATRIC DIARRHEAL DISEASE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

As seen by clinical health providers at fixed healthcare facilities in developing countries, almost all cases of pediatric diarrheal illness can be conveniently characterized as falling into 1 of 5 clinical syndromes (Table 1). Approximately 80%–85% of patient episodes present as "simple gastroenteritis" with the subject passing loose or watery stool (often with mucus but not with blood), low-grade fever, occasional vomiting, anorexia, and apparent malaise (Figure 1). Approximately 5%–15% of children present with overt dysentery (gross blood in the diarrheic stools) (Figure 2), often accompanied by fever (sometimes high); many dysenteric patients appear clinically toxic. A small proportion of cases in older children present with profuse watery diarrhea, passing such voluminous "rice water" stools that even older children can rapidly become severely dehydrated (Figure 3). Another few percent of pediatric cases present with a history of apparent simple gastroenteritis that began 14 or more days previously but did not abate; this defines "persistent diarrhea", a syndrome that particularly can have adverse nutritional consequences. Finally, a few percent of children are brought by caretakers for care because of vomiting rather than diarrhea as the main complaint. Few reports have described expanded etiologic analyses in relation to these clinical syndromes.

Table 1.
The 5 Main Clinical Syndromes of Diarrheal Disease Seen Among Infants and Young Children Presenting to Health Centers and Hospitals in Developing Countries

Figure 1.
An infant who presented with diarrheal dehydration consequent to simple gastroenteritis that was not treated promptly or effectively. Loss of turgor of skin over the abdomen is visible as "tenting", following pinching. Simple gastroenteritis caused by many etiologic agents in young infants in developing countries can lead to dehydration. The fundamental reason is that per kilogram of body weight, the daily water and electrolyte requirements of young infants are substantially greater than those of older children. Thus, abnormal losses from diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, accompanied by inadequate fluid intake and lack of prompt and appropriate replacement (as with glucose/electrolyte oral rehydration solution), can lead to moderate and severe dehydration and death.

Recommendations for prophylaxis in cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) state that the task force recommends cyproheptadine or propranolol prophylaxis for children 5 years old and younger, and in the older child (older than 5 years), amitriptyline or propranolol are recommended. The dose can be titrated by increasing it every 1 to 4 weeks to achieve at least an average therapeutic dose for 2 CVS cycles (eg, if monthly, then for 2 months), and if intolerable side effects occur or the drug proves ineffective, switching or dose reduction may be appropriate.

Upper endoscopy in cyclic vomiting syndrome — because endoscopic biopsy usually does not reveal an etiologic cause, the task force did not recommend a routine endoscopy unless patients present with chronic symptoms between episodes that are suggestive of a specific disorder or large amounts of hematemesis warrant endoscopic intervention. If histological evidence of mild to moderate esophagitis is found, then a standard 4- to 6-week course of acid suppression (eg, proton pump inhibitor) is warranted.

### Myocarditis presenting as gastritis in children [^c128965d]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2006). Low credibility.

Vomiting and abdominal pain are common pediatric complaints encountered by emergency physicians. The differential diagnosis of abdominal pain is extensive. Herein, we report 2 cases with fatal myocarditis who initially presented with abdominal pain and vomiting. Both cases were presented with abdominal pain, vomiting, and loose stools. On arrival at our emergency department, hypotension, tachycardia, and cyanotic extremities were found. Their serum troponin-I levels were elevated. The echocardiogram demonstrated poor left ventricular performance and a decreased ejection fraction. In both cases, an arrhythmia and a coma developed within hours and were shortly followed by death. The clinical presentations of acute myocarditis are variable, ranging from an initial mild discomfort to acute progressive heart failure, and at times, even death. Abdominal pain may be a manifestation of systemic disease, an extra-abdominal lesion, or myocarditis. Although myocarditis associated with abdominal pain or vomiting remains a diagnostic challenge to physicians, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children with gastritis and hypotension or who are refractory to rehydration therapy.

### Clinical signs that predict severe illness in children under age 2 months: a multicentre study [^5ac3bc35]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Neonatal illness, particularly in the first week of life, is a leading cause of death worldwide. Improving identification of young infants who require referral for severe illness is of major public-health importance.

Methods

Infants under 2 months of age brought with illness to health facilities in Bangladesh, Bolivia, Ghana, India, Pakistan, and South Africa were recruited in two age-groups: 0–6 days and 7–59 days. A trained health worker recorded 31 symptoms and clinical signs. An expert paediatrician assessed each case independently for severe illness that required hospital admission. We examined the sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratio (OR) for each symptom and sign individually and combined into algorithms to assess their value for predicting severe illness, excluding jaundice.

Findings

3177 children aged 0–6 days and 5712 infants aged 7–59 days were enrolled. 12 symptoms or signs predicted severe illness in the first week of life: history of difficulty feeding (OR 10.0, 95% CI, 6.9–14.5), history of convulsions (15.4, 6.4–37.2), lethargy (3.5, 1.7–7.1), movement only when stimulated (6.9, 3.0–15.5), respiratory rate of 60 breaths per minute or more (2.7, 1.9–3.8), grunting (2.9, 1.1–7.5), severe chest indrawing (8.9, 4.0–20.1), temperature of 37.5 degrees C or more (3.4, 2.4–4.9) or below 35.5 degrees C (9.2, 4.6–18.6), prolonged capillary refill (10.5, 5.1–21.7), cyanosis (13.7, 1.6–116.5), and stiff limbs (15.1, 2.2–105.9). A decision rule requiring the presence of any one sign had high sensitivity (87%) and specificity (74%). After we reduced the algorithm to seven signs (history of difficulty feeding, history of convulsions, movement only when stimulated, respiratory rate of 60 breaths per minute or more, severe chest indrawing, temperature of 37.5 degrees C or more or below 35.5 degrees C), mainly on the basis of prevalence of each sign or symptom, sensitivity (85%) and specificity (75%) were much the same. These seven signs also did well in 7-59-day-old infants (sensitivity 74%, specificity 79%).

Interpretation

A single simple algorithm could be recommended for identifying severe illness in infants aged 0–2 months who are brought to health facilities. Further research is needed on screening newborn children for illness in the community during routine home visits.

### Manifestation of leech infestation as severe gastrointestinal bleeding in a 3-year-old boy: a case report and review of the literature [^c92a8be9]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 3-year-old boy was transferred to our emergency department, which is a referral center, from a primary care hospital near his house. Tarry stool from a week ago and hematemesis that started yesterday were his main complaints. According to the patient's mother, his stool began to darken last week, but they didn't consider it an important issue. Then, 2 days prior to admission, he suddenly vomited blood and was rushed to the nearest local hospital (Fig. 1). At the time, he had a drop in hemoglobin level, which was followed by a blood transfusion, and he also started on ondansetron and pantoprazole. The patient's hemoglobin level was at acceptable levels following transfusion; however, a control complete blood count analysis at 18 hours' post-admission showed a decrease in hemoglobin level. Therefore, after having packed red blood cell transfusion, he was referred to our hospital for further investigation of the underlying disease. The laboratory course of hemoglobin and hematocrit is shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 1
Photos taken of the patient's hematemesis (A, B) and melena (C) by the parents

Fig. 2
Changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels during hospitalization

First evaluation of the patient at the emergency department revealed that he had a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, a pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, a respiration rate of 18, and an oxygen saturation of 98%. His general appearance was slightly pale, but he did not have any complaints of vomiting or diarrhea. There was no evidence of petechiae, purpura, or bruising on his skin. Oropharynx was without inflammation or lesion, and there was no nasal polyp, obstruction, or abnormal discharge from the nasal mucosa. His parents did not declare any history of trauma or bleeding diathesis. Furthermore, the liver and spleen were not palpable on abdominal examination. The digital rectal examination revealed no anal lesion; however, melena was clearly visible. The patient's medical history revealed that he was diagnosed with Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) at the age of two. He was on omeprazole 10 mg orally once a day, but had stopped taking it 2 months prior to admission.

### Just another case of diarrhea and vomiting? [^4dce0acd]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic intussusception is a treatable cause of failure to thrive. It is an uncommon condition often diagnosed late. The presenting features differ from acute intussusception. Chronic intussusception presents with a varying combination of abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss/failure to thrive, diarrhea, and blood per rectum. An abdominal mass may or may not be palpable. The classic triad of abdominal pain, vomiting, and blood per rectum is uncommon. The purpose of this report is to present a small series of 3 cases and review 19 previously reported cases of chronic intussusception.

Pediatric gastroesophageal reflux — "red flag" symptoms and signs suggesting disorders other than GERD (0 to 18 years of age): General features such as weight loss, lethargy, fever, excessive irritability/pain, and dysuria are "suggesting a variety of conditions, including systemic infections", and dysuria "may suggest urinary tract infection, especially in infants and young children". Onset of regurgitation/vomiting " > 6 months or increasing/persisting > 12–18 months of age" is described as "Late onset as well as symptoms increasing or persisting after infancy, based on natural course of the disease, may indicate a diagnosis other than GERD". Neurologic signs including bulging fontanel/rapidly increasing head circumference "may suggest raised intracranial pressure for example due to meningitis, brain tumor or hydrocephalus". Gastrointestinal red flags include persistent forceful vomiting "indicative of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (infants up to 2 months old)", nocturnal vomiting that "may suggest increased intracranial pressure", bilious vomiting "Regarded as symptom of intestinal obstruction", hematemesis that "suggests a potentially serious bleed", rectal bleeding "indicative of multiple conditions", and abdominal distension "Indicative of obstruction, dysmotility, or anatomic abnormalities".

Children with intussusception can present with a wide variety of symptoms, including vomiting, fever, lethargy, and abdominal pain. The classic triad of abdominal pain, hematochezia, and palpable abdominal mass is seen in a few patients.• Early diagnosis of intussusception depends on a high level of clinical suspicion in any child with non specific abdominal findings followed by appropriate radiographic or ultrasonographic evaluation and confirmation with a contrast enema.• Abdominal radiography, although an appropriate component of the initial workup for gastrointestinal symptoms, lacks the sensitivity to reliably exclude the presence of intussusception.• Because ultrasonography is a safe, sensitive, and specific test for the diagnosis of intussusceptions, it should be performed early whenever there is clinical suspicion of intussusception.• Contrast enema is the gold standard for diagnosis and first-line treatment of intussusception. There is an increasing trend for pneumatic reduction of intussusception compared with hydrostatic reduction. Intravenous placement, fluid resuscitation, and notification of the pediatric surgeon should be completed before contrast enema.

### Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of children with acute intussusception: a case series [^f56c41e3]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The typical presentation of intussusception is paroxysmal abdominal pain/crying, abdominal botuliform mass, and bloody stool. However, in this study, only 6% had bloody stools, only 2% had the typical triad of symptoms, and many older children had only abdominal pain without other symptoms or signs. Therefore, paroxysmal abdominal pain/crying should be the main clinical manifestation of acute intussusception and requires vigilance. Kimia et al. argued that bloody stools are of little diagnostic value in acute intussusception. Justice et al. reported that 78% of the children presented with abdominal pain, lethargy, and vomiting. Another study by Kimia et al. reported that the patterns of symptoms vary with age, with the presence of abdominal pain, emesis, bilious emesis, lethargy, rectal bleeding, and irritability being the predictors in children < 24 months old, while male sex was the only predictor in children > 24 months old. Therefore, for children with atypical clinical symptoms but high suspicion of intussusception, auxiliary examinations (such as abdominal ultrasound) can be performed to assist in the diagnosis.

Toddler diarrhoea is a term coined many years ago to describe a young child who passes several loose stools a day but who is otherwise healthy with excellent growth and normal examination. It could be argued that it is not an appropriate diagnostic term as it potentially stops the clinician from thinking about the possible causes of loose stools in this clinical situation. This article, which follows a debate between the authors on the topic at the 2010 Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Annual meeting, discusses the differential diagnoses of a young child presenting with the so-called toddler diarrhoea.

### Epinephrine 0.15 pediatrics [^37dd41b1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

PATIENT INFORMATION

Read this Patient Information leaflet carefully before using the epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. Anyone who may be able to administer the epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector, should know how to use it before you have an allergic emergency.

This information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

What is the most important information I should know about Epinephrine Injection, USP Auto-Injector?

Epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector is a single-dose automatic injection devices (auto-injectors) that contains epinephrine. Epinephrine is a medicine used to treat allergic emergencies (anaphylaxis). Anaphylaxis can be life threatening and, can happen within minutes. If untreated, anaphylaxis can lead to death. This allergic emergency can be caused by stinging and biting insects, allergy injections, foods, medicines, exercise, or unknown causes.

Symptoms of anaphylaxis may include:

trouble breathing
wheezing
hoarseness (changes in the way your voice sounds)
hives (raised reddened rash that may itch)
severe itching
swelling of your face, lips, mouth, or tongue
skin rash, redness, or swelling
fast heartbeat
weak pulse
feeling very anxious
confusion
stomach pain
losing control of urine or bowel movements (incontinence)
diarrhea or stomach cramps
dizziness, fainting, or "passing out" (unconsciousness)
Always carry 2 epinephrine injection, USP auto-injectors with you because sometimes a single dose of epinephrine may not be enough to treat a serious allergic reaction before seeking medical care. You also need to always carry 2 auto-injectors with you if the first auto-injector is activated before the dose can be given. A device that has been activated by accident cannot be used in an allergic emergency (anaphylaxis).
Note: The epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector has been activated when the blue safety top is removed and a "pop" is heard, the orange needle end of the auto-injector is extended, or the medicine viewing window is blocked.
You may not know when anaphylaxis will happen. Talk to your healthcare provider if you need more auto-injectors to keep at work, school, or other locations. If you use 1 epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector to treat an emergency allergic reaction, be sure to replace it so you always carry 2 auto-injectors. Tell your family members, caregivers, and others where you keep your epinephrine injection, USP auto-injectors. Make sure they know how to use it before you need it. You may be unable to speak in an allergic emergency.
When you have an allergic emergency (anaphylaxis) use epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector right away.
Get emergency medical help right away even if you have used the epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector. You can use a second epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector if symptoms continue or come back or if the first auto-injector is activated before the dose can be given. For this reason, you should carry 2 epinephrine injection, USP auto-injectors with you at all times. If you need more than 2 doses for an allergic emergency, they must be given by a healthcare provider.

### Clinical signs and symptoms associated with intussusception in young children undergoing ultrasound in the emergency room [^2dcddd17]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate all patients suspected of having intussusception and identify which signs and symptoms were associated with the disease.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of 553 charts from 2006 to 2010 of patients' age 2 months to 5 years who had an abdominal ultrasound obtained to evaluate for intussusception. Charts were reviewed for signs and symptoms previously shown to be associated with intussusception.

Results

There were 452 patients (mean age, 21.5 months, 43% female) evaluated and 101 (22.3%) were found to have intussusception. Of the 18 signs and symptoms, crying (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.3–8.1), abdominal mass (adjusted OR, 15.7; 95% CI, 4.4–55.3), pallor (adjusted OR, 6.5; 95% CI, 1.8–23.5), and vomiting (adjusted OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4–6.5) were associated with disease confirmation in logistic regression analysis. The presence of all 4 clinical signs/symptoms together resulted in a 95% probability of intussusception. Intussusception was unlikely if all 4 clinical indicators were absent (probability = 1.6%).

Conclusions

The presence of crying, abdominal mass, pallor, and vomiting were clinical indicators of intussusception. Individually, none of these variables were helpful in confirming the diagnosis but in the presence of all 4, there is a 95% probability of having the disease. The absence of all 4 of these made the likelihood of having the disease very low.

### The mucosal microbiota in a young child with severe non-Helicobacter gastritis [^58b23213]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

A 34-month-old boy of Caribbean/Hispanic descent, born abroad and raised in a Houston suburb, following 2 weeks in the Caribbean presented with new-onset painless gagging and vomiting multiple times per day. The emesis contained clear or partially digested food with an occasional bloody tinge. Physical examination and a barium swallow were unremarkable, and trials of ranitidine and proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) were unsuccessful. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy under general anesthesia (Figure 1a–f) revealed mild erythema throughout the distal esophagus, corpus, antrum, and fundus, with prominent antral nodularity and friability. Mild edema was present in the duodenal folds. Biopsies from the fundus (Figure 1g–h) and corpus revealed oxyntic-predominant chronic active gastritis with increased eosinophils. Antral biopsies (Figure 1i–j) revealed severe chronic active gastritis. The esophagus was unremarkable, and duodenal biopsies revealed patchy mild chronic inflammation. Gastrin was focally absent on immunostaining, and there was no evidence of granulomata, giant cells, viral inclusions, or Helicobacter pylori.

Despite sucralfate and PPI, the child's emesis worsened. Stool studies were significant only for occult blood and elevated calprotectin [533, repeat 638 (reference range 0–120) µg/g]. Antibodies for autoimmune gastritis, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and food allergy were negative. A diagnosis of H. pylori gastritis was considered, based on the clinical, endoscopic, and laboratory findings (H. pylori IgG positive; IgM, IgA, and stool antigen negative). The child began anti- Helicobacter therapy with amoxicillin, metronidazole, clarithromycin and PPI. Vomiting immediately improved but resumed six days after completing the 14-day therapy. He then began 14 days of amoxicillin, levofloxacin, bismuth and PPI, again with immediate improvement. Seven weeks later he resumed intractable vomiting with hematemesis and weight loss, prompting repeat upper endoscopy (unchanged from previous) and colonoscopy (grossly and histologically normal).

### Intussusception [^c135fcdf]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children between 3 months and 6 years. Intussusception occurs when a more proximal portion of bowel invaginates into more distal bowel. These patients often present with a wide range of non-specific symptoms, with less than one quarter presenting with the classic triad of vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody stools. Thus, the diagnosis continues to rely on clinical suspicion. This review article discusses the clinical presentation of intussusception and the state-of-the art diagnostic and treatment options, as well as a review of the pertinent literature.

### A multi-country study of intussusception in children under 2 years of age in latin America: analysis of prospective surveillance data [^b5c1ddef]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

We found a relatively high proportion of subjects (27.3%) who experienced IS to have had an upper respiratory tract infection in the 2 weeks before the onset of definite IS. The condition is known to be associated with a number of childhood viral illnesses, in particular with adenovirus, and a link with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection has recently been reported.

The epidemiologic characteristics of definite IS cases in this study were similar to those found in other locations or previously in these countries. The majority of definite IS cases occurred before 1 year of age with a peak around 4–6 months of age, which is similar to that observed in the US and other countries. The excess of male cases has been noted in other studies with male:female ratios of 1.8:1 and 1.4:1 reported from Panama and the US, respectively.

The proportion of children undergoing surgery in the present study (84%) was similar to other Latin American studies, which have reported rates of 78% and 88% in Chile and Venezuela, respectively. However, these rates are much higher than those reported from Hong Kong (23%) and the US (53%). Higher surgery rates in Latin America may be due to delays in seeking medical attention, more severe episodes, or less experience in radiological reduction techniques. Moreover, it seems likely that IS cases that resolved spontaneously were not included, thus possibly leading to an underestimate of the overall rate. The typical clinical presentation (vomiting, pain or irritability, and bloody stools) found in this study is similar to other reports as was the low rate of predisposing conditions, such as Meckel's diverticulum. Of interest, among the 465 subjects for whom the type of vaccine previously administered was known, 27 (5.8%) had received human rotavirus vaccine or placebo because they were participating in an ongoing phase III clinical trial in Latin America. Nevertheless, it seems very unlikely that such a low percentage might have influenced our overall estimates for the occurrence of IS prior to vaccine introduction.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Patients and caregivers should be informed of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of CAMPTOSAR). Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Patients should contact their physician if any of the following occur: diarrhea for the first time during treatment; black or bloody stools; symptoms of dehydration such as lightheadedness, dizziness, or faintness; inability to take fluids by mouth due to nausea or vomiting; or inability to get diarrhea under control within 24 hours.
Patients should be warned about the potential for dizziness or visual disturbances which may occur within 24 hours following the administration of CAMPTOSAR.
Explain the significance of routine blood cell counts. Instruct patients to monitor their temperature frequently and immediately report any occurrence of fever or infection.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy.
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CAMPTOSAR and for 6 months after the final dose.
Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment and for 3 months after the final dose of CAMPTOSAR.
Lactation
Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with CAMPTOSAR and for at least 7 days after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].
Infertility
Advise females and males of reproductive potential that CAMPTOSAR may impair fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
Patients should be alerted to the possibility of alopecia.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^6c72991b]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — benzodiazepine selection, monitoring, and hepatic impairment guidance — states that "no particular benzodiazepine agent is more effective than another, longer-acting benzodiazepines are the preferred agents due to the clinical benefits of their longer duration of action". Clinicians "should monitor patients taking benzodiazepines for signs of over-sedation and respiratory depression", since "Longer-acting agents can accumulate and lead to over-sedation and respiratory depression, particularly in older patients or those with compromised health". In hepatic impairment, "Benzodiazepine accumulation is more likely in patients with impaired hepatic function", and "Medication dose can be reduced or a benzodiazepine with less dependence on hepatic metabolism can be used", but "the start of treatment should not be delayed while waiting for lab test(s) results or if the test(s) are unavailable at the time of presentation". When tests are unavailable and "a patient has signs of significant liver disease, use a benzodiazepine with less hepatic metabolization", with listed signs: "Skin and eyes that appear yellowish (jaundice)… Swelling in the legs and ankles (edema)… Itchy skin… Dark urine color… Pale stool color, or bloody or tar-colored stool… Confusion… Chronic fatigue… Nausea or vomiting". For agitation or confusion, "A reduction in the benzodiazepine dose and the addition of a neuroleptic agent… can be considered if patients are not at an elevated risk of seizure", noting "Some neuroleptic agents have been shown to reduce the seizure threshold".

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — supportive and abortive care during acute episodes recommends placing children in less stimulating environments, replenishing fluids, electrolytes, and energy, and treating symptomatic nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain. Early intervention within the first 2 to 4 hours of onset either at home or at a hospital may be more effective than later intervention. If these are ineffective, then concomitant sedation is recommended. Severe abdominal pains are treated with parenteral acid suppression and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or narcotics.

It was reported that the last vomitus had a greenish tinge to it. In hospital, she had a non-bilious vomit. There was no history of fever, constipation or diarrhoea. Her birth history and medical history were unremarkable. She was noted to be pale, lethargic and quiet on examination. Her vital signs were unremarkable. She had a soft scaphoid abdomen on examination. No masses were palpable. Investigations for sepsis were done and antibiotics started. Results of all the investigations were normal apart from mildly raised blood glucose and neutrophilia. Later on she passed a small amount of blood per rectum. Examination revealed a palpable mass in the epigastrium. An abdominal x-ray was suggestive of intestinal obstruction. Intussusception was confirmed on ultrasound. The intussusception was successfully reduced following surgery.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^8c521c48]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — clinical presentations and likely etiologies are listed as follows: Persistent or chronic diarrhea has likely pathogens including Cryptosporidium spp. Giardia lamblia, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Cystoisospora belli, and Entamoeba histolytica. Visible blood in stool lists STEC (Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli), Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Entamoeba histolytica, noncholera Vibrio species, Yersinia, Balantidium coli, and Plesiomonas as likely pathogens. Fever is not highly discriminatory — viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections can cause fever; in general, higher temperatures are suggestive of bacterial or E. histolytica, and patients infected with STEC usually are not febrile at time of presentation. Severe abdominal pain, often with grossly bloody stools (occasionally nonbloody) and minimal or no fever, lists STEC, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Yersinia enterocolitica as likely pathogens. Persistent abdominal pain and fever lists Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis and may mimic appendicitis. Nausea and vomiting within ≤ 24 hours suggests ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin or Bacillus cereus (short-incubation emetic syndrome). Diarrhea and abdominal cramping lasting 1–2 days suggests ingestion of Clostridium perfringens or B. cereus (long-incubation diarrheal syndrome).

### A case report of one vasovagal syncope patient with third-degree atrioventricular block caused by SCN5A gene mutation and literature review [^7f1e3f49]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A twelve-year-old male patient was admitted to Beijing Children's Hospital of Capital Medical University for chest tightness for 9 days and syncope in July 2018. There was a history of scarlet fever 2 months ago. There were denying history of trauma, transfusion, food or drug allergy and poisoning. The child had a history of carsickness. He experienced syncope during carsickness occurrence, vomiting and sweating before the syncope attack with lips pale. He was unconscious for approximately 1 min. When he recovered to consciousness, his limbs were weak and pale. The child did not have special birth history with normal growth and development. The mother of the child was healthy. While the father had a history of VVS. No protrusion in the precordial region, no diffuse heart beats, no tremor or pericardial friction, no cardiac boundaries were displayed in the physical examination. No heart murmur sound was heard in the auscultation area of each valve. 24-h dynamic electrocardiogram showed that P-P interval and RR interval had their own fixed rules, P wave and QRS wave had no fixed relationship, atrial rate had no fixed relationship with ventricular rate, by which third-degree AVB was diagnosed. Holter records showed ventricular arrest in the child during carsickness when he was attacked by syncope. The child was diagnosed as VVS according to the results of DC and head-up tilt test (head-up tilt test, HUTT). And ECG, echocardiography, MR scan and EEG were normal. A few mintues after the child standing on the tilt bed in HUTT, bradycardia was observed accompanied with syncope aura, such as pale, sweating and weakness. The child recovered after the tilt-bed returned to recumbent position. Laboratory examination: blood routine, liver and kidney function, electrolytes, myocardial enzymes and cTNI (cardiac Troponin I, cTNI) were all normal. Electrophysiological examination indicated that sinus node function was normal. Informed writeen consent was obtained from the guardians, which was obtained in the consent to publish section as detailed in our editorial policies.

### Learning in the lassa belt [^7d7ab3d2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Sara improved somewhat with fluids and Ciprofloxacin. The rigors disappeared and were not replaced by true seizures, but she continued to have fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The emesis was copious and violent, as her family tried to keep her hydrated. We suspected there might be some partially digested blood in the emesis, and we worried about intestinal perforation, which does sometimes occur. We changed her antibiotics when the fevers would not resolve and worried that the facial and cervical swelling — soft rather than matted — could be from subcutaneous emphysema from the violent emesis. At about this time, a local colleague explained to me that this swelling was strongly suggestive of Lassa fever. Sara was swept away into isolation for testing and presumptive treatment. She was positive for Lassa fever and did well. The presentation of a soft, full neck and face became a trigger for me, one I had not previously associated with Lassa fever.

We continued to have Lassa-positive patients, sometimes several in a week, of various ages. There are deaths in the emergency room and in the isolation unit. Edema of the neck is occasionally present. A urinalysis positive for blood is frequently the trigger for isolation and presumptive treatment, but patients in our population also sometimes have schistosomiasis, which is associated with hematuria but not conjunctivitis. The presentation most suspicious of Lassa fever at our hospital tends to be a patient who presents with conjunctivitis, fever, and excessive vomiting. In any season, the vast majority of pediatric patients here are admitted with the diagnosis of "severe malaria and anemia". Often, this proves to be correct.

When another young girl, Quita, was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit from the emergency room with the story of high fevers and jerking, she was diagnosed with presumed cerebral malaria. Her malaria smear was positive with high parasitemia, and her hematocrit was low. It was difficult to elucidate a good history, but in this case, the grandmother admitted to having poured various "country medicines" (herbal concoctions) down the child's nose and mouth in the last few days. When I first saw Quita, she had a gauze-wrapped tongue depressor in her mouth, soaked in blood, and the nurses explained that she had bitten her tongue during a seizure. She had clearly depressed mental status, responsive to voice and pain but in no way appropriate or oriented.

### A curious cause of appendicitis [^a0f440b6]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A previously fit and well 10-year-old boy presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 48-hour history of colicky, central abdominal pain, one episode of loose stool, five episodes of vomiting and anorexia. He had not eaten out, travelled abroad or been around anyone else unwell over the preceding days, and there was no history of upper respiratory tract symptoms, rashes or fever. The boy had no significant medical or surgical history, and he did not take any regular medications. All vaccinations were up-to-date. He had no family history of note and was an only child. As he had a soft, non-tender abdomen, his symptoms were attributed to gastroenteritis. Inpatient treatment was not required as the boy appeared adequately hydrated with normal observations and was tolerating oral fluids. He was, therefore, discharged with the advice to stay well hydrated and to return if symptoms worsened. A stool sample had been requested, but the boy was unable to provide this in the ED. He reattended the following day with constant, right-sided, abdominal pain, and ongoing diarrhoea and vomiting. Examination revealed tenderness which had now localised to the right iliac fossa (RIF) and a temperature of 37.8°C.

Case report

A 17-year-old male was admitted to our hospital due to changes in stool characteristics over a period of 1 month; the patient reported passing shapeless, and bloody stools 2–3 times a day alongside intermittent abdominal colic and abdominal distension. Local colonoscopy revealed multiple colonic polyps, that required further treatment in our hospital. The patient had a history of pulmonary arteriovenous fistula (pAVF), underwent intestinal polypectomy at 2 years of age, and underwent pAVF embolization 5 years ago. The patient reported that he was prone to having his finger, toes, and lips turn blue, which was obvious after substantial activity, and was prone to spontaneous nasal bleeding from childhood. However, the patient did not pay attention to these symptoms and did not seek further treatment. The patient was the only child in his family and his family had no similar diseases. Physical examination (Figure 1) showed clubbed nails on all four limbs, pectus carinatum with lordosis, right lower abdominal tenderness, and no rebound pain. Other vital signs were normal. Laboratory results on admission showed a decreased albumin level and mild anemia (Table 1), and urine and tumor markers showed no obvious abnormalities. Gastroscopy showed telangiectasia of the duodenum and fundus of the stomach [Figure 2(a) and (b)], and multiple colon polyps with a long, stalk-like and lobulated appearance [Figure 2(c) and (d)]. Pulmonary artery computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed multiple pulmonary AVMs in both lungs (Figure 3(a) and (b)). Low-tension CT of the small intestine (Figure 3(c) and (d)) showed multiple polyps and right abdominal intussusception, and a right portal vein right hepatic vein fistula was considered. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography (MRI+MRA) did not find cerebral AVMs.

### Etiological, epidemiological, and clinical features of acute diarrhea in China [^993bb6d6]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Clinical syndrome and signs

Based on 8758 patients with positive detection, different clinical syndrome and clinical signs were observed between patients with a single viral infection or single bacterial infection. More vomiting (z = 14.05, p < 0.001), respiratory symptoms (z = 6.79, p < 0.001), neurological symptoms (z = 3.19, p < 0.01), and less fever (z = −5.58, p < 0.001) were exhibited in those patients with single virus infections. These intergroup differences were consistently observed for children and adults (Supplementary Table 9). To attain a differential diagnosis between bacterial and viral infections with acute diarrhea, a binary eXtreme Gradient Boosting model was applied on 5816 patients with viral single infections and 2942 patients with bacterial single infections. In total, 11 valid variables regarding demographical and clinical symptoms/syndromes were entered into the model, with the season, age, mucous stool, vomiting, respiratory symptoms, mushy stool, bloody stool, watery stool, sex, fever, and neurologic symptoms observed. Among them, the season was the most important predictor with a relative contribution of 37.46%, followed by age (16.73%). The contributions of mucous stool, vomiting, and respiratory symptoms were slightly larger than 5%, and the contribution for each of the others was less than 5%. The area under curve of the model was 0.79 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77‒0.81], accuracy = 74.14%. (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). The mean accuracy of cross-validation was 74.52% and the variance was 4.17%. Based on this multivariate logistic regression model, child patients with acute diarrhea, vomiting, and respiratory symptoms that occurred in the cold season were shown to be likely caused by virus infections, while an adult with mucous or bloody stool, that occurred in warm-season were probably infected with bacteria (Supplementary Table 10).

The Dieulafoy lesion is a rare cause of severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with a significant mortality. Rebleeding from undiscovered lesions is frequent and often fatal. The outcome depends on a high degree of suspicion for the condition. In any age group, the entity may be underdiagnosed rather than truly rare. It is particularly uncommon in infants. The authors report the case of the youngest patient so far to suffer from a Dieulafoy lesion.

### Point-of-care ultrasound may be useful for detecting pediatric intussusception at an early stage [^5a34f000]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical features

The common clinical symptoms of the enrolled patients were abdominal pain/irritability (87.5%), vomiting (52.7%), loose stool (20.2%), fever (19.8%), and bloody stool (15.3%). The intussusception group demonstrated abdominal pain/irritability (92.9%), vomiting (37.1%), and bloody stool (21.4%). Compared to the non-intussusception group, the intussusception group showed more intermittent abdominal pain/irritability (58.6% vs. 33.9%, P < 0.001), but significantly less vomiting (37.1% vs. 58.2%, P = 0.001). Other clinical features, including bloody stool, lethargy, ED visit during night-time (7 pm to 8 am), or duration of symptoms, were not significantly different between the two groups (Table 3).

### Jodhpur disease revisited: a rare cause of severe protein energy malnutrition [^956fcf3f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Case report

A 3.5-year-old unimmunized developmentally normal female child presented with vomiting for 6 months, intermittent fever for 5 months, abdominal distention for 4 months and painful abdomen for 1 month. Vomiting was non bilious, non projectile, 4–5 episodes/day, occurring 1–2 h after meal and contained food particles. Fever was on and off, low-grade, not associated with chills and rigor. Pain was localized to upper abdomen, non colicky, aggravated by food intake, relieved by vomiting or medications. The child had significant weight loss (> 5 kg) during the past 4 months and had received one unit packed red cell transfusion at some other center. There was no history of loose stools at any point of time, constipation, jaundice, bleeding from any site or contact with a tuberculosis patient. On examination, she was malnourished with her weight only 6.5 kg and height 84 cm, both below the 3 rd percentile of WHO standards. She was pale and dehydrated, with sparse and lusterless hair. Abdomen was soft and distended, with tympanic note on percussion, normal bowel sounds and without organomegaly. The rest of the systemic examination did not show any abnormality.

On investigation, her hemogram and chest X-ray were normal, but serum electrolytes were abnormal (hyponatremia with hypokalemia). HIV serology, PPD test and gastric aspirates (n = 3) for tuberculosis were negative. Stool examination was negative for ova, cysts or opportunistic pathogens. X-ray abdomen showed no air-fluid level but only gaseous distention of stomach and intestine. Ultrasound of abdomen showed distended stomach with normal pyloric canal. Barium meal showed grossly distended stomach with slow passage of barium from the antero-pyloric region distally (Fig. 1). Suspecting gastric outlet obstruction, exploratory laparotomy was done that revealed hugely distended stomach with normal smooth muscle thickness but no intra-luminal valve, ring or diaphragm or extra-luminal compression was seen (Fig. 2). Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty was done. Pyloric biopsy showed sub-mucosal edema and mild congestion and no inflammatory cells were seen. The diagnosis of primary acquired gastric outlet obstruction during infancy and childhood (Jodhpur disease) with severe malnutrition was made. The child recovered well postoperatively, became asymptomatic gradually and gained 2.5 kg in one month post surgery.

Case presentation

A full-term neonate, previously well, female, born via normal vaginal delivery with a birth weight of 3100 g, was brought to the emergency department with a 2-day history of fever, progressive abdominal distension and irritability. There was no history of vomiting, diarrhoea, feeding intolerance, lethargy, seizures or respiratory symptoms. The neonate had been passing urine and meconium normally prior to this illness and had no recent exposure to sick contacts or antibiotic use.

On examination, she was febrile (temperature: 38.7°C), irritable and alert. She had a markedly distended and tense abdomen. On auscultation, bowel sounds were hypoactive. There was no palpable abdominal mass, no hepatosplenomegaly and no evidence of abdominal wall erythema or visible peristalsis. Genitalia were normal. There were no signs of jaundice, cyanosis or respiratory distress. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were unremarkable. Neurologically, there were no focal deficits, tone and reflexes were appropriate for age and the anterior fontanelle was soft and flat.

### Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of children with acute intussusception: a case series [^956100cf]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Among the 402 children admitted with acute intussusception, 301 were males, and 101 were females. The average age was 2.4 ± 1.5 years, with the youngest being 2 months old and the oldest 9 years old. Fourteen (3.5%) children were 1–6 months old, 49 (12.2%) were 6–12 months old, 120 (29.8%) were 1–2 years old, 74 (18.4%) were 2–3 years old, 63 (15.7%) were 3–4 years old, 44 (10.9%) were 4–5 years old, and 38 (9.5%) were > 5 years old. The disease onset was most frequent in December (15.2%), but it occurred throughout the year without an obvious central tendency. Most patients did not show an obvious etiology for the disease, while 30 patients (7.5%) had a history of cold food intake, diarrhea, and upper respiratory infection before the onset of the disease. The average time from symptom onset to the initial hospital visit was 13.1 ± 11.0 h, with 277 cases (68.9%) < 12 h, 104 (25.9%) between 12 and 24 h, 18 (4.5%) between 24 and 48 h, and three (0.7%) > 48 h. Among the 402 children, 338 (84.1%) had paroxysmal abdominal pain (young infants presented as paroxysmal crying), and eight patients (2.0%) had a typical triad of intussusception (abdominal pain + bloody stools + abdominal mass). Vomiting occurred in 167 cases (41.5%), bloody stool in 24 (6.0%), and a palpable abdominal mass in 273 (67.9%). The average intussusception depth was 4.0 ± 1.4 cm, with the shortest being 1.1 cm, the longest being 9.0 cm, and the median being 3.9 cm (Table 1).

### Guidance for the primary care provider in identifying infants with biliary atresia by 2–4 Weeks of life: clinical report [^b6f6c279]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Well-child visit between 2 and 4 weeks of life — direct or conjugated bilirubin testing algorithm: At the "By 1 month" visit for a 2- to 4-week-old infant, "Any jaundice in eyes or skin?" leads to "Measure a direct or conjugated bilirubin within 48 hours". If "Direct or conjugated bilirubin level ≥ 1 mg/dL?" then "Contact Gastroenterology urgently"; if the "Direct or conjugated bilirubin level within lab reference range?" the pathway states "No further testing needed". "Stools pale, gray, or white (by inspection or report)?" also directs to "Measure a direct or conjugated bilirubin within 48 hours". The figure notes "Before 2 weeks of life, values are interpreted using the reference range specific to the laboratory performing the test (do not use a fixed cut-off or a bilirubin ratio)". It also specifies "A measurement may not be needed if either of the following is true: (a) Any prior direct or conjugated bilirubin value was within the laboratory's derived reference range. (b) Prior direct or conjugated bilirubin values were all abnormal but both (i) less than or equal to the initial value and (ii) < 1 mg/dL".

### Triage of the pediatric patient in the emergency department: are we all in agreement? [^f8351cd5]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare triage categorization as a measure of perceived patient acuity on presentation to the emergency department by pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) attending physicians, nurses, and pediatric residents with their general emergency medicine (GEM) counterparts.

Methods

A questionnaire that contained 12 pediatric triage scenarios was sent to all PEM attending physicians, triage-trained nurses, and pediatric residents and their GEM counterparts at a large urban hospital with separate pediatric and general emergency departments. Participants were asked to use a 3-tier triage system (emergent, urgent, nonurgent) to assign a triage level for each patient scenario.

Results

The response rate was 99%. The kappa level of agreement was highest (.39) among the PEM physicians. Significantly more GEM attending physicians triaged the following scenarios at a higher acuity level as compared with PEM attending physicians with a trend toward emergent triage: simple febrile seizure, 50% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30%-70%) versus 7.7% (95% CI: 1%-34%); 18-month-old with fever and bumps on lips, 21% (95% CI: 9%-43%) versus 0% (95% CI: 0%-23%); and 15-month-old well-appearing child with high fever, 50% (95% CI: 30%-70%) versus 7.7% (95% CI: 1%-34%). Significant differences were found between GEM and PEM triage-trained nurses only in the 15-month-old high fever scenario and between GEM and pediatric residents in the 15-month-old high fever scenario, the 18-month-old with fever and bumps on lips scenario, and a fever/limp scenario.

Conclusions

The level of agreement of triage assignment within each group was only fair. GEM participants and PEM participants agreed on most scenarios. However, GEM participants were more likely to triage children with certain febrile illnesses at higher acuity levels as compared with their PEM counterparts.

### Double trouble: ten-year-old girl with chronic diarrhea and acute abdominal pain [^fc816311]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 2.
Predisposing Factors for Pediatric Intussusception.

The clinical presentation of intussusception usually reveals waxing and waning crampy abdominal pain associated with typical gastroenteritis symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. The abdominal pain occurs due to peristalsis at the intussuscepted segment that is transiently obstructed. Physical examination may reveal abdominal discomfort in any quadrant, typically without rebound tenderness. Although rarely found, the classic triad of symptoms is abdominal pain, palpable "sausage shaped" mass, and bloody ("currant jelly") stools. If the area is not actively peristalsing, the patient may be asymptomatic. Patients often present dehydrated due to anorexia secondary to pain and/or in shock due to bowel ischemia. Therefore, tachycardia, hypotension, delayed capillary refill, dry mucous membranes, and oliguria could be present in affected children.

Intussusception is diagnosed primarily using ultrasound. Intussusception can only be confirmed when the bowel is actively intussuscepted, although there have been improvements in identifying them due to an increase in point-of-care ultrasounds. Intussusception is classified based on location, which determines therapy. In a large bowel to large bowel intussusception, the mainstay of treatment is nonoperative reduction of the intussusception using air or contrast enemas. However, when the intussuscepted site is more proximal in the small bowel, bowel rest with supportive care is suggested, as it is too proximal for an enema to be effective and most resolve spontaneously. Rarely, the involved area of the small bowel requires surgical intervention if the intussusception does not resolve spontaneously with supportive care.

### Menotropins (menopur) [^99ad66b5]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

What are possible side effects of MENOPUR?

MENOPUR may cause serious side effects, including:

ovaries that are too large. MENOPUR may cause your ovaries to be abnormally large. Symptoms of large ovaries include bloating or pain in your lower stomach (pelvic) area. If your ovaries become too large your healthcare provider may tell you that you should not have intercourse (sex) so you do not rupture an ovarian cyst.
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Using MENOPUR may cause OHSS. OHSS is a serious medical condition that can happen when your ovaries produce too many eggs (overstimulated). OHSS can cause fluid to suddenly build up in the area of your stomach, chest, heart, and cause blood clots to form. OHSS may also happen after you stop using MENOPUR. Stop using MENOPUR and call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have any of the following symptoms of OHSS:
severe pelvic or stomach pain
nausea
vomiting
sudden weight gain
swollen stomach
diarrhea
trouble breathing
decreased or no urine
lung problems. MENOPUR may cause serious lung problems that can sometimes lead to death including fluid in the lungs, trouble breathing, and worsening of asthma.
blood clots. MENOPUR may increase your chance of having blood clots in your blood vessels. Blood clots can cause:
blood vessel problems (thrombophlebitis)
stroke
loss of your arm or leg
blood clot in your lung (pulmonary embolus)
twisting (torsion) of your ovary. MENOPUR may increase the chance of your ovary twisting, if you already have certain conditions such as OHSS, pregnancy, and previous abdominal surgery. Twisting of your ovary may lead to blood flow being cut off to your ovary.
pregnancy with and birth of multiple babies. MENOPUR may increase your chance of having a pregnancy with more than 1 baby. Having a pregnancy and giving birth to more than 1 baby at a time increases the health risk for you and your babies. Your healthcare provider should talk to you about your chances of multiple births before you start using MENOPUR.
birth defects. Babies born after ART may have an increased chance of birth defects. Your age, certain sperm problems, your genetic background, and that of your partner, and a pregnancy with more than 1 baby at a time may increase the chance that your baby may have birth defects.
ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside your womb). MENOPUR may increase your chance of having a pregnancy that is abnormally outside of your womb. Your chance of having a pregnancy outside of your womb is increased if you also have fallopian tube problems.
miscarriage. Your chance of loss of an early pregnancy may be increased if you had difficulty becoming pregnant.
tumors of the ovary. If you have used medicines like MENOPUR more than 1 time to get pregnant, you may have an increased chance of having tumors in your ovaries, including cancer.
