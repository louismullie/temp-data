## Question

A 62-year-old man with a history of NSAID use is admitted to the emergency department with massive hematemesis and hypotension. He is resuscitated with fluids and blood products. Endoscopic therapy is attempted but fails to control the bleeding from a posterior duodenal ulcer. He is taken to the operating room for emergency surgery. Intraoperatively, the surgical team has difficulty localizing the exact bleeding site due to ongoing hemorrhage and poor visualization. The patient is persistently hypotensive despite aggressive resuscitation, and his lactate is rising.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what intraoperative strategies should be considered in this patient, and how should the choice of surgical procedure be determined?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about intraoperative strategies and surgical procedure selection for a 62-year-old man with massive hematemesis from a posterior duodenal ulcer, failed endoscopic therapy, ongoing hemorrhage, and persistent hypotension with rising lactate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and why standard approaches have failed. Then, I should verify the indications for damage control surgery in this context. Next, I will examine intraoperative strategies to localize bleeding and control hemorrhage. After that, I need to choose the definitive procedure based on ulcer location and physiology. Finally, I should confirm resuscitation targets, adjuncts, and the staged plan, and I will double-check any conflicting recommendations about angioembolization in unstable patients before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and the failure points. This is a nonvariceal upper GI bleed from a posterior duodenal ulcer, likely involving the gastroduodenal artery, with failed endoscopic hemostasis and ongoing shock physiology despite resuscitation, which meets criteria for refractory bleeding and hemodynamic instability warranting emergency surgery rather than repeat endoscopy or angioembolization in this unstable state [^36d9065f] [^27e8f923] [^624eed04].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the indication for damage control surgery. The WSES 2020 guideline explicitly recommends considering damage control surgery in patients with hemorrhagic shock and signs of severe physiological derangement to rapidly control bleeding and enable ICU resuscitation, which fits this patient's persistent hypotension and rising lactate despite aggressive resuscitation [^f230a87f] [^388585ae]. I need to ensure I'm aligning with the broader damage control principles: abbreviated laparotomy, control of hemorrhage and contamination, temporary abdominal closure, and staged definitive repair after physiologic optimization, which are well established in trauma and extended to nontrauma emergencies including bleeding peptic ulcer disease [^dd5c6429] [^a67b9549].

> Next, I should review intraoperative strategies to localize bleeding when visualization is poor. Intraoperative endoscopy is suggested to facilitate localization of the bleeding site in refractory cases, and I should confirm that this remains appropriate even in unstable patients if it can be done expeditiously without delaying control. Yes, WSES supports intraoperative endoscopy to guide the surgeon when the source is uncertain, and given the posterior duodenal location, a duodenotomy will likely be required to expose the ulcer base and the bleeding vessel [^bed0cb40] [^9e33ea09]. Wait, let me verify the approach: for a posterior duodenal ulcer, a longitudinal duodenotomy across the pylorus provides direct access to the ulcer crater and the gastroduodenal artery, which is the typical culprit in this setting [^fbe300a6].

> I will now examine the definitive hemostatic procedure. For a large posterior duodenal ulcer with arterial bleeding, simple oversewing is often insufficient due to collateral flow; triple-loop suture ligation of the gastroduodenal artery within the ulcer bed is critical to durable control, and I should confirm that this is the recommended technique. WSES emphasizes triple-loop suturing of the GDA because of the rich collateral supply from the transverse pancreatic arteries, and this should be performed through a duodenotomy with careful closure to avoid stenosis [^fbe300a6]. But wait, what if the duodenal wall is too friable or the ulcer too large? In that scenario, I should consider pyloric exclusion with a gastrojejunostomy and external biliary drainage as a damage-control adjunct to protect the suture line and decompress the duodenum, reserving duodenostomy only as a last resort in extreme circumstances [^6105fce8].

> Let me think about adjuncts and resuscitation targets intraoperatively. I should confirm that we continue damage control resuscitation with permissive hypotension and early blood products to mitigate the lethal triad. Although permissive hypotension evidence is strongest in trauma, the principle of deliberate low blood pressure to facilitate clot formation and limit dilutional coagulopathy is extrapolated to massive GI hemorrhage, with systolic targets around 90–100 mmHg until major bleeding is controlled, while correcting hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy and using a restrictive transfusion threshold of hemoglobin about 7 g/dL unless there is CAD or ongoing ischemia, which aligns with WSES and ACG guidance [^1039279b] [^e8f1aa15]. I should double-check that we also activate massive transfusion protocols and consider tranexamic acid when bleeding is massive, as these are standard adjuncts in major hemorrhage protocols [^bce4e9e2] [^8ef4d41c].

> Hold on, I should verify the staged plan and temporary abdominal closure. After hemostasis and any necessary diversion or decompression, temporary abdominal closure with a negative-pressure device is appropriate if the patient remains unstable, the fascia cannot be closed without tension, or there is concern for ongoing physiologic derangement. This permits ICU resuscitation and planned reoperation for definitive reconstruction once the patient is stabilized, consistent with damage control principles and WSES open abdomen guidance [^de9d68dc] [^dd5c6429]. I need to ensure we document the need for second-look surgery and set expectations for reconstruction, which may include restoring intestinal continuity and addressing acid suppression definitively if indicated once the patient can tolerate it [^de9d68dc].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought angioembolization might still be an option intraoperatively if the surgeon cannot localize the bleeding, but I should correct that. WSES advises against routine angioembolization in unstable patients and reserves it for selected cases with immediate availability and hybrid capabilities; in a persistently hypotensive patient with rising lactate, the priority is operative control, and relying on angioembolization would likely delay definitive hemostasis and worsen outcomes, so surgery must proceed with damage control tactics rather than deferring to IR in this scenario [^74d23c42] [^f230a87f].

> Let me reconsider the procedure choice if the duodenum is extensively damaged or the ulcer involves the ampulla. If the first portion is shattered or the defect is too large for primary closure, antrectomy with Billroth I reconstruction may be necessary, whereas defects near the ampulla may require pyloric exclusion with biliary diversion rather than attempting a high-risk resection in an unstable patient. These decisions should be individualized intraoperatively based on anatomy and physiology, again aligning with WSES recommendations for tailored surgery in complex duodenal ulcers [^6105fce8] [^63438d0e].

> In summary, I should confirm the final algorithm: proceed with damage control laparotomy, employ intraoperative endoscopy if it expedites localization without delay, expose the posterior duodenal ulcer via longitudinal duodenotomy, perform triple-loop suture ligation of the gastroduodenal artery within the ulcer base, consider pyloric exclusion with gastrojejunostomy and external biliary drainage if tissue is friable or the defect is large, leave the abdomen open with temporary closure if unstable, and continue damage control resuscitation with permissive hypotension, early blood products, and correction of coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia, with planned reoperation for definitive reconstruction once the patient is stabilized [^f230a87f] [^bed0cb40] [^fbe300a6] [^de9d68dc] [^1039279b].

---

In this unstable patient with a bleeding posterior duodenal ulcer and failed endoscopy, **damage control surgery is indicated** [^f230a87f] to rapidly control hemorrhage and permit ICU resuscitation [^dd5c6429]. The priority is **open surgery with duodenotomy and triple-loop oversewing of the gastroduodenal artery** [^fbe300a6], as this is the most reliable way to control arterial bleeding from a posterior ulcer [^329761d3]. Intraoperative endoscopy can aid localization if needed [^bed0cb40] [^9e33ea09]. Avoid complex reconstructions; use temporary abdominal closure and plan definitive repair after stabilization [^de9d68dc]. Angioembolization is not appropriate in this unstable patient [^74d23c42].

---

## Indications for damage control surgery

Damage control surgery (DCS) is indicated in patients with **severe physiological derangement** from ongoing hemorrhage and shock [^f230a87f]. The WSES 2020 guidelines recommend DCS for bleeding peptic ulcer patients with hemorrhagic shock and severe physiological derangement to rapidly control bleeding and enable prompt ICU admission [^f230a87f]. This patient's persistent hypotension and rising lactate despite aggressive resuscitation meet these criteria [^notfound].

---

## Intraoperative strategies

### Surgical approach

An **open approach is recommended** [^9178c7bc] for refractory bleeding peptic ulcers, especially with hemodynamic instability, because it provides rapid access and control [^9e33ea09].

---

### Localization of bleeding site

Intraoperative endoscopy can be used to **localize the bleeding site** [^bed0cb40] if the source is unclear, though it is not always necessary in obvious posterior duodenal ulcers [^9e33ea09].

---

### Definitive hemostatic procedure

For posterior duodenal ulcers, the **definitive procedure is duodenotomy with triple-loop oversewing of the gastroduodenal artery (GDA)** [^fbe300a6]. This approach directly addresses the bleeding vessel and is the most effective method for controlling arterial hemorrhage from a posterior ulcer [^329761d3].

---

### Temporary abdominal closure

Temporary abdominal closure (TAC) with a negative-pressure device is recommended [^de9d68dc] when the patient is unstable, allowing rapid transfer to the ICU for resuscitation and correction of coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia [^a67b9549].

---

## Choice of surgical procedure

The choice of procedure **depends on ulcer location**, extent, and bleeding vessel characteristics [^63438d0e]. For posterior duodenal ulcers, duodenotomy with triple-loop oversewing of the GDA is the preferred approach [^fbe300a6]. For large or complex ulcers, pyloric exclusion with gastrojejunostomy may be considered, but this is more complex and should be individualized [^6105fce8]. Avoid definitive reconstructions (e.g. Billroth I/II) in unstable patients; these should be deferred to a second operation after stabilization [^a7478e08].

---

## Role of angiographic embolization

Angiographic embolization is generally not recommended in unstable patients [^74d23c42] because of delays and limited availability. It may be considered only in selected cases with immediate access and appropriate expertise, but surgery remains the preferred option in this scenario [^74d23c42].

---

## Postoperative management

Postoperative care focuses on **continued resuscitation**, correction of coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia, and close monitoring for rebleeding and complications. Definitive reconstruction, if needed, is planned once the patient is hemodynamically stable [^de9d68dc].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intraoperative strategy** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Surgical approach | Open surgery [^9178c7bc] |
| Localization | Intraoperative endoscopy if needed [^bed0cb40] |
| Definitive procedure | Duodenotomy with triple-loop oversewing of GDA [^fbe300a6] |
| Temporary closure | Negative-pressure device [^de9d68dc] |
| Angioembolization | Not recommended in unstable patients [^74d23c42] |
| Postoperative care | Resuscitation, correction of coagulopathy, acidosis, hypothermia, and planned definitive reconstruction [^de9d68dc] |

---

In this unstable patient with a bleeding posterior duodenal ulcer and failed endoscopy, **damage control surgery with open duodenotomy and triple-loop oversewing of the GDA** is the recommended approach [^f230a87f]. This strategy prioritizes rapid hemorrhage control and physiological stabilization, with definitive reconstruction deferred until the patient is stable [^de9d68dc].

### Management of massive peptic ulcer bleeding [^6ee89f42]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Massive bleeding from a peptic ulcer remains a challenge. A multidisciplinary team of skilled endoscopists, intensive care specialists, experienced upper gastrointestinal surgeons, and intervention radiologists all have a role to play. Endoscopy is the first-line treatment. Even with larger ulcers, endoscopic hemostasis can be achieved in the majority of cases. Surgery is clearly indicated in patients in whom arterial bleeding cannot be controlled at endoscopy. Angiographic embolization is an alternate option, particularly in those unfit for surgery. In selected patients judged to belong to the high-risk group — ulcers 2 cm or greater in size located at the lesser curve and posterior bulbar duodenal, shock on presentation, and elderly with comorbid illnesses — a more aggressive postendoscopy management is warranted. The optimal course of action is unclear. Most would be expectant and offer medical therapy in the form of acid suppression. Surgical series suggest that early elective surgery may improve outcome. Angiography allows the bleeding artery to be characterized, and coil embolization of larger arteries may further add to endoscopic hemostasis. The role of early elective surgery or angiographic embolization in selected high-risk patients to forestall recurrent bleeding remains controversial. Prospective studies are needed to compare different management strategies in these high-risk ulcers.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^fbe300a6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

An immediate or delayed biopsy is recommended (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 2C)

A refractory bleeding peptic ulcer is defined as an ulcer still bleeding after repeated endoscopy/angioembolization. Open surgery is recommended when endoscopic treatments have failed and there is evidence of ongoing bleeding, plus or minus hemodynamic instability. The choice of the appropriate surgical procedure for bleeding peptic ulcer should be made on the basis of the location and extension of the ulcer and the characteristics of the bleeding vessel. Surgical approach involves ulcer oversew or resection. Bleeding gastric ulcers should be resected or at least biopsied for the possibility of neoplasms. Conversely, most duodenal ulcers requiring surgery for persistent bleeding are usually large and posterior lesions, and the bleeding is often from the gastro-duodenal artery. A recent prospective cohort study conducted in Denmark compared the outcomes of duodenal and gastric bleeding peptic ulcers and found a significantly higher 90-day mortality and reoperation rate for the duodenal location, confirming the greater complexity of surgical management of this ulcer. Via duodenotomy, the bleeding vessel can be seen on the floor of the ulcer and can be rapidly oversewn. It is critical to perform triple-loop suturing of bleeding of the GDA due to the collateral blood supply to the transverse pancreatic arteries. The surgeon may not know preoperatively where the bleeding originates and intraoperative endoscopic guidance may be helpful. For patients with intractable ulcer bleeding, Schroeder et al. from the analysis of a large database (ACS-NSQIP) have found that the surgical procedure of vagotomy/drainage is associated with significantly lower mortality than simply simple local ulcer oversew. They further suggest that vagotomy/drainage is preferred to local procedures alone for the surgical management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcer disease requiring emergency operation for intractable bleeding ulcers.

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, what is the role of damage control surgery?

We suggest considering damage control surgery for patients with hemorrhagic shock and signs of severe physiological derangement, in order to quickly resolve the bleeding and allow a prompt ICU admission (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidences, 2D).

Indications for damage control surgery in bleeding peptic ulcer are similar to those for perforated peptic ulcer and are reported in the WSES guidelines on Open Abdomen management in non-trauma patients.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^de9d68dc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In patients with perforated peptic ulcer, what is the role of damage control surgery?

In patients with septic shock from a perforated peptic ulcer and signs of severe physiological derangement, we suggest a damage control strategy (Weak recommendation based on very low-quality of evidences, 2D)

In severe peritonitis, some patients may experience disease progression to severe sepsis and septic shock experiencing progressive organ dysfunction, hypotension, myocardial depression, and coagulopathy and a staged approach may be required. If the patient is not in a condition to undergo a definitive repair and/or abdominal wall closure, due to mandatory conditions requiring an open abdomen, the intervention should be abbreviated due to suboptimal local conditions for healing and global susceptibility to spiraling organ failure. Such mandatory conditions include physical inability to close the abdominal fascia without tension, a decision to leave intra-abdominal packing, or a decision to leave blind bowel loops to expedite the procedure. Committing a patient to an open abdomen however has significant risks including the most feared enteroatmospheric fistula which has been reported to be more common in emergency general surgery patients than trauma patients. "Source control" of intra-abdominal contamination remains a discretionary reason to leave the abdomen open, recognizing that "inability to achieve source control" is a frequently quoted but poorly objectified concept in emergency general surgery. Although upper gastrointestinal perforations are often less catastrophic than lower gastrointestinal contaminations, when the patient responded with immunological activation and systemic sepsis, they are suffering from severe complicated intra-abdominal sepsis. If these conditions are met, then we suggest participation and potential enrollment in the COOL Trial Closed or Open after Laparotomy (COOL) study to help provide better guidance for clinicians in the future treating such challenging patients. In general, anastomoses should be avoided in the presence of hypotension or hemodynamic instability, especially if the patient requires vasopressors. After copious abdominal irrigation, a temporary abdominal closure device can be placed if there are mandatory factors dictating an OA or if the patient is randomized to this therapy in the COOL trial. The patient can then be resuscitated appropriately in the ICU. The surgeon can return to the OR for re-exploration, restoration of continuity and closure of the abdomen once the patient is hemodynamically stable. We refer you to the WSES guidelines on Open Abdomen management for further information.

Background

Damage control surgery is a management sequence initiated to reduce the risk of death in severely injured patients presenting with physiological derangement. Damage control principles have emerged as an approach in non-trauma abdominal emergencies in order to reduce mortality compared with primary definitive surgery.

Methods

A PubMed/MEDLINE literature review was conducted of data available over the past decade (up to August 2013) to gain information on current understanding of damage control surgery for abdominal surgical emergencies. Future directions for research are discussed.

Results

Damage control surgery facilitates a strategy for life-saving intervention for critically ill patients by abbreviated laparotomy with subsequent reoperation for delayed definitive repair after physiological resuscitation. The six-phase strategy (including damage control resuscitation in phase 0) is similar to that for severely injured patients, although non-trauma indications include shock from uncontrolled haemorrhage or sepsis. Minimal evidence exists to validate the benefit of damage control surgery in general surgical abdominal emergencies. The collective published experience over the past decade is limited to 16 studies including a total of 455 (range 3–99) patients, of which the majority are retrospective case series. However, the concept has widespread acceptance by emergency surgeons, and appears a logical extension from pathophysiological principles in trauma to haemorrhage and sepsis. The benefits of this strategy depend on careful patient selection. Damage control surgery has been performed for a wide range of indications, but most frequently for uncontrolled bleeding during elective surgery, haemorrhage from complicated gastroduodenal ulcer disease, generalized peritonitis, acute mesenteric ischaemia and other sources of intra-abdominal sepsis.

Conclusion

Damage control surgery is employed in a wide range of abdominal emergencies and is an increasingly recognized life-saving tactic in emergency surgery performed on physiologically deranged patients.

Several scoring systems are available for the evaluation of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The Rockall score can be utilized to identify patients at risk of adverse outcomes where the Glasgow-Blatchford bleeding score identifies patients needing interventions such as blood transfusions or endoscopy.

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, which are the appropriate targets for resuscitation (hemoglobin level, blood pressure/heart rate, lactates level, others)?

We recommend several resuscitation targets, similar to those of damage control resuscitation in the bleeding trauma patient (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 1C).

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, we recommend to maintain an Hb level of at least > 7 g/dl during the resuscitation phase (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidences, 1B).

Early resuscitation of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding is of paramount importance to reduce mortality; this must proceed simultaneously with endoscopic and surgical procedures. A rapid ABC (airway, breathing, and circulation) evaluation should be done immediately. Appropriate targets for resuscitation in bleeding peptic ulcer patients can be considered the same used in bleeding trauma patients (systolic blood pressure of 90–100 mmHg until major bleeding has been stopped; normalization of lactate and base deficit; hemoglobin 7–9 g/dl; correction/prevention of coagulopathy); for this reason, we refer to the abovementioned guideline. Regarding hemoglobin level, a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfusion with an Hb > 7 g/dl) with those of a liberal transfusion strategy (transfusion with an Hb > 9 g/dl) in severe acute gastrointestinal bleeding has been performed. The restrictive strategy, compared with the liberal strategy, has been significantly associated with a better outcome.

High-risk surgical patients have been suggested and recommended as the ideal candidates for angioembolization. However, no specific data exist investigating or defining the definition of "high risk". Interdisciplinary consensus (surgery, gastroenterology, intensive care, anesthesia) is required to guide this decision-making. Low-risk surgical patients are likely to benefit from an operative strategy due to the likely reduced mortality in this group. No specific studies exist to validate this claim.

Furthermore, according to the physiology behind wound repair, it is possible that angioembolization could complicate a subsequent surgical intervention because of the reduction in the blood flow of the operative field, but no specific data exists to validate this claim.

Should embolization be considered for unstable patients with bleeding peptic ulcer?

We suggest against a routinely use of angioembolization unstable patients. Angioembolization in unstable patients could be s considered only in selected cases and in selected facilities (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidences, 2D).

There are no specific data to address the relative safety of angioembolization compared with surgery in hemodynamically unstable patients. Variable definitions of hemodynamic stability between studies further complicate meaningful recommendations in this field. Successful reports of angioembolization in patients with hemorrhagic shock are described. A recent retrospective case series describing super-selective angioembolization in 51 patients with active gastrointestinal hemorrhage (with 57% of these upper gastrointestinal in nature), demonstrated the possibility of this approach in patients with physiological shock (defined in this study as a systolic blood pressure of < 90 mmHg).

The appropriateness of angioembolization in hemodynamically unstable patients depends on a number of factors, including the timely availability and skills of the angioembolization service, the quality of the initial and ongoing resuscitation, the quality of the peri-procedural and post-procedural intensive care, and patient variables. Furthermore, the presence of a hybrid OR or strict proximity of OR and the angioembolization facility is mandatory for the angiographic approach to unstable patients. A coordinated, interdisciplinary approach (surgery, interventional radiology, gastroenterology, intensive care, and anesthesia) is likely to benefit these critically ill patients, although there are no specific data to validate this hypothesis.

When and how do you perform a damage control surgery strategy in patients with severe cIAIs?

Statement 16

There is insufficient evidence to advocate damage control surgery as general strategy in patients with secondary peritonitis (Recommendation 1 C).

In order to value current evidence on damage control surgery for abdominal surgical emergencies a PubMed/MEDLINE literature review was recently published by Weber et al. Minimal evidence exists to validate the benefits of damage control surgery in general surgical abdominal emergencies. The evidence over the past decade is limited to 16 studies including a total of 455 patients, of which the majority are retrospective case series. Damage control surgery has been performed for a wide range of indications, but most frequently for uncontrolled bleeding during elective surgery, hemorrhage from complicated gastroduodenal ulcer disease, generalized peritonitis, acute mesenteric ischaemia, and other sources of intra-abdominal sepsis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of perforated or bleeding peptic ulcers: 2013 WSES position paper [^329761d3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

A recent study suggests transcatheter superselective angioembolization, with reembolization if necessary, is an effective rescue treatment modality for hemodynamically unstable patients with active gastrointestinal hemorrhage and is a reasonable management option. Twenty percent of patients will fail superselective angioembolization and require additional intervention. Ischemic complications are extremely rare.

For patients with intractable ulcer bleeding, Schroeder et al. from the analysis of large database (ACS-NSQIP) have found that the surgical procedure of vagotomy/drainage is associated with significantly lower mortality than just with simple local ulcer oversew. They futher suggest that vagotomy/drainage is preferred to local procedures alone for the surgical management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcer disease requiring emergency operation for intractable bleeding ulcers.

Open surgery is recommended when endoscopic treatments failed and there is evidence of ongoing bleeding +/− hemodynamic instability. The surgeon may not know preoperatively where the bleeding comes from and intraoperative endoscopic guidance may be helpful. A retractor that elevates the sternum might be needed (the so called Goligher sternal-lifting retractor) and sometimes is necessary to excise the xiphisterum. Then, after defusing the spleen, the oesophagus should be taped to enable control of stomach. In case of bleeding gastric ulcer (GUs), anterior gastrotomy can be easily performed. In case of bleeding duodenal ulcer (DUs) it might be needed to perform a duodenotomy and open across D1 and pylorus, longitudinally.

Bleeding GUs should be resected (even just a local resection) or at least biopsied for the possibility of neoplasms. Most of DUs arriving to surgery for persistent bleeding are usually big and posterior lesions and the bleeding is often from gastro-duodenal artery. Via duodenotomy, the bleeding vessel can be seen on the floor of the ulcer and can be rapidly oversewn; then the duodenotomy is closed normally with horizontal sutures to avoid stenosis and without need of routine pyloroplasty.

A Billoth-1 resection with distal gastrectomy might be needed if D1 is fully shattered by a large duodenal ulcer.

Surgical hemostasis or angiographic embolization (where readily available) should be performed only after endoscopic failure.

Open surgery is recommended when endoscopic treatments failed and there is evidence of ongoing bleeding +/− hemodynamic instability.

The proximal gastric remnant should be decompressed with a nasogastric tube placed intraoperatively with verification of its correct position. Anastomoses should be avoided in presence of hypotension or hemodynamic instability, especially if the patient requires vasopressors. After copious abdominal irrigation, a temporary abdominal closure device can be placed. The patient can then be resuscitated appropriately in the ICU. The surgeon can return to the OR for re-exploration, restoration of continuity, possible vagotomy, and closure of the abdomen once the patient is hemodynamically stable.

We suggest resectional surgery in case of perforated peptic ulcer larger than 2 cm (Additional file 4: Video 4)

We suggest resectional surgery in presence of malignant perforated ulcers or high risk of malignancy (e.g. large ulcers, endoscopic features of malignancy, presence of secondary lesions or suspected metastases, etc.) (Additional file 4: Video 4).

We suggest resectional surgery in presence of concomitant significant bleeding or stricture.

We suggest use of techniques such as jejunal serosal patch or Roux en-Y duodenojejunostomy or pyloric exclusion to protect the duodenal suture line, in case of large post-bulbar duodenal defects not amenable to resection (i.e. close to or below the ampulla).

Whenever possible (i.e. stable patient), in case of repair of large duodenal ulcer, we suggest to perform a cholecistectomy for external bile drainage (e.g. via trans-cystic tube).

We suggest duodenostomy (e.g. over Petzer tube) only as an extreme option, in presence of giant duodenal ulcers with severe tissue inflammation and when mobilization of the duodenum is not possible and the patient is in severe septic shock/hemodynamic instability.

### Surgical management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^3bffa655]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The use of surgery in managing upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding has rapidly diminished secondary to advances in our understanding of the pathologies that underlie upper GI bleeding, pharmaceutical treatments for peptic ulcer disease, and endoscopic procedures used to gain hemostasis. A surgeon must work collaboratively with gastroenterologist and interventional radiologist to determine when, and what kind of, surgery is appropriate for the patient with upper GI bleeding.

Challenging ulcer bleeding and salvage treatments

Despite advancements in endoscopic and pharmacological therapies, still a minority of patients (8%–15%) experience refractory peptic ulcer bleeding. Predictors of rebleeding include initial hemodynamic instability, low hemoglobin levels upon presentation, greater blood transfusion requirements, high-risk endoscopic stigmata, large ulcer size, and specific ulcer locations like posterior duodenal or high lesser gastric curvature ulcers. For patients with peptic ulcers who experience recurrent bleeding despite initial endoscopic treatment, a second-look endoscopy has shown long-term bleeding control with reduced complications, no increased mortality risk, and lower costs compared to surgery. Therefore, guidelines recommend a second-look endoscopy in such cases.

Malignancy-related ulcer bleeding is another challenge to manage. Due to local vessel invasion and friable neovascularization of tumors, malignant ulcers can rebleed even after initial hemostasis was achieved. Although surgery and endoscopic resection can remove the tumor, not all patients are appropriate candidates. Standard combination therapy with injection and thermal or mechanical treatment can reach 80%–90% initial hemostasis. However, the overall rebleeding rate of malignant ulcers is 40%, and the rebleeding rate within 30 days is 30%. Until now, there is no strongly recommended therapy for malignant bleeding in treatment guidelines.

If bleeding cannot be controlled through endoscopy, options such as transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) or surgical intervention should be considered. Although TAE has higher rebleeding rates compared with surgery, it is associated with significantly lower complication risks, shorter hospital stays, and no difference in mortality. Hence, TAE is the preferred salvage therapy for patients with failed endoscopic therapy, while surgery is considered when TAE is unavailable locally or after failed TAE attempts.

Surgery

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, which are the indications for surgical treatment and which is the appropriate timing for surgery?

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, we suggest surgical hemostasis (or angiographic embolization if immediately available and with appropriate skills) after failure of repeated endoscopy. In patients with hypotension and/or hemodynamic instability and/or ulcer larger than 2 cm at first endoscopy, we suggest surgical intervention without repeated endoscopy (strong recommendation based on very low-quality evidences, 1D).

A renowned RCT conducted in 1999 compared endoscopic retreatment with surgery for peptic ulcer rebleeding after initial endoscopy. Over a 40-month period, 92 patients with recurrent bleeding were enrolled: 48 patients were randomly assigned to undergo immediate endoscopic retreatment and 44 were assigned to undergo surgery. Of the 48 patients who were assigned to endoscopic retreatment, 35 had long-term control of bleeding. Thirteen underwent salvage surgery, 11 because retreatment failed, and 2 because of perforations resulting from thermocoagulation. Five patients in the endoscopy group died within 30 days, as compared with eight patients in the surgery group (p = 0.37). Seven patients in the endoscopy group had complications, as compared with 16 in the surgery group (p = 0.03). Duration of hospitalization, need for ICU admission, ICU length of stay, and the number of blood transfusions were similar in the two groups. In multivariate analysis, hypotension at randomization (p = 0.01) and an ulcer size of at least 2 cm (p = 0.03) were independent factors predictive of the failure of endoscopic retreatment. According to these data, repeated endoscopy is indicated for stable patients with ulcers smaller than 2 cm in diameter, while for patients with a larger ulcer and heavier bleeding, surgery may be taken into account as a first-line therapy.

### What if endoscopic hemostasis fails? alternative treatment strategies: surgery [^4bd1304f]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Management of bleeding peptic ulcers is increasingly challenging in an aging population. Endoscopic therapy reduces the need for emergency surgery in bleeding peptic ulcers. Initial endoscopic control offers an opportunity for selecting high-risk ulcers for potential early preemptive surgery. However, such an approach has not been supported by evidence in the literature. Endoscopic retreatment can be an option to control ulcer rebleeding and reduce complications. The success of endoscopic retreatment largely depends on the severity of rebleeding and ulcer characteristics. Large chronic ulcers with urgent bleeding are less likely to respond to endoscopic retreatment. Expeditious surgery is advised.

Nonvariceal UGI bleeding is one of the most common emergencies that gastroenterologists encounter, and continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The keys to management are rapid resuscitation and stabilization; appropriate triage based on pre-endoscopic risk factors; early endoscopy to achieve prompt diagnosis and implement hemostatic therapy to high-risk lesions; and aggressive antisecretory therapy (in the case of peptic ulcer bleeding) to reduce the risk of continued or recurrent bleeding.

Early surgical involvement in the management of a patient at high risk for recurrent bleeding, despite endoscopic intervention, is often optimal to assure continuity of care. Close collaboration of the surgical team with gastroenterologic endoscopy teams greatly benefits the patient. A detailed description of the location of the bleeding process is of great help for the surgeon as surgical decision making will be influenced by the distance from the gastroesophageal junction or pylorus, location on the anterior or posterior wall, greater or lesser curvature or incisura, and the size of the process.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) — initial assessment and risk stratification — Hemodynamic status should be assessed immediately upon presentation and resuscitative measures begun as needed (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Randomized trials indicate that transfusions should be given to maintain hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dl, with higher hemoglobin targets potentially needed in patients with other illnesses such as coronary artery disease and in those with intravascular volume depletion. Risk assessment should be performed to stratify patients into higher and lower risk categories, and may assist in management decisions such as timing of endoscopy, time of discharge, and level of care (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). Discharge from the emergency department without inpatient endoscopy may be considered in very low-risk patients, including those meeting Blatchford score 0 criteria — urea nitrogen ≤ 18.2 mg/dl; hemoglobin ≥ 13.0 g/dl for men (12.0 g/dl for women); systolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg; pulse < 100 beats/min; and absence of melena, syncope, cardiac failure, and liver disease — who have < 1% chance of requiring intervention; instruments used include the pre-endoscopic Rockall score (range, 0–7) and the Blatchford score (range, 0–23).

### Strategies to minimize intraoperative blood loss during major surgery [^8ef4d41c]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Reducing operative blood loss improves patient outcomes and reduces healthcare costs. The aim of this article was to review current surgical, anaesthetic and haemostatic intraoperative blood conservation strategies.

Methods

This narrative review was based on a literature search of relevant databases up to 31 July 2019 for publications relevant to reducing blood loss in the surgical patient.

Results

Interventions can begin early in the preoperative phase through identification of patients at high risk of bleeding. Directly acting anticoagulants can be stopped 48h before most surgery in the presence of normal renal function. Aspirin can be continued for most procedures. Intraoperative cell salvage is recommended when anticipated blood loss is greater than 500ml and this can be continued after surgery in certain situations. Tranexamic acid is safe, cheap and effective, and routine administration is recommended when anticipated blood loss is high. However, the optimal dose, timing and route of administration remain unclear. The use of topical agents, tourniquet and drains remains at the discretion of the surgeon. Anaesthetic techniques include correct patient positioning, avoidance of hypothermia and regional anaesthesia. Permissive hypotension may be beneficial in selected patients. Promising haemostatic strategies include use of pharmacological agents such as desmopressin, prothrombin complex concentrate and fibrinogen concentrate, and use of viscoelastic haemostatic assays.

Conclusion

Reducing perioperative blood loss requires a multimodal and multidisciplinary approach. Although high-quality evidence exists in certain areas, the overall evidence base for reducing intraoperative blood loss remains limited.

### How would you manage this patient with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^eebf99af]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is common, morbid, and potentially fatal. Cornerstones of inpatient management include fluid resuscitation; blood transfusion; endoscopy; and initiation of proton-pump inhibitor therapy, which continues in an individualized manner based on risk factors for recurrent bleeding in the outpatient setting. The International Consensus Group released guidelines on the management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding in 2019. These guidelines provide a helpful, evidence-based roadmap for management of gastrointestinal bleeding but leave certain management details to the discretion of the treating physician. Here, 2 gastroenterologists consider the care of a patient with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a peptic ulcer, specifically debating approaches to blood transfusion and endoscopy timing in the hospital, as well as the recommended duration of proton-pump inhibitor therapy after discharge.

### Diagnosis and treatment of perforated or bleeding peptic ulcers: 2013 WSES position paper [^e57d49e8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The incidence of rebleeding in patients with UGIB shows a wide range from 5% to more than 20%, depending on the aetiology of the bleeding and the timing of endoscopic therapy. There is strong evidence that the risk of rebleeding is highest in the initial period of admission, and a 24-h time frame for endoscopic therapy is internationally recommended as the optimal window of opportunity. Naturally, rebleeding must be prevented whenever possible.

PUB is the most common cause of acute UGIB, accounting for 31%-67% of all cases, followed by erosive disease, varices, oesophagitis, malignancies and Mallory-Weiss tears (Table 3).

Table 3
Causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding

In the subgroup of patients with PUB, bleeding from duodenal ulcers is slightly more frequent than from gastric ulcers.

Emergency surgery for PUB has continued to decrease; in the UK, the rate of surgery dropped from 8% to 2% between 1993 and 2006. In the same period in the USA, admissions to hospital for peptic ulcer bleeding fell by 28,2%, the use of endoscopic treatment increased by 58,9%, and the rate of emergency surgery for PUB decreased by 21,9%.

Initial assessment, resuscitation and risk-scores

A primary goal of the initial assessment is to determine whether the patient requires urgent intervention (e.g. endoscopic, surgical, transfusion) or can undergo delayed endoscopy or even be discharged to outpatient management.

Patients presenting with acute UGIB should be assessed promptly and resuscitated if needed. Volume should be replenished initially with crystalloid solutions.

In patients with ongoing blood loss, symptomatic anaemia, or those at increased risk of impaired tissue oxygenation (e.g. patients with chronic heart conditions), blood should be transfused. In haemodynamically stable patients who are not bleeding actively, the threshold of transfusion needs to be defined. International guidelines recommend a policy of transfusion to a haemoglobin concentration of 7 g/dL.

Coagulopathy at presentation is a major adverse prognostic factor. From the UK National Audit, coagulopathy defined by an international normalised ratio (INR) above 1,5 was present in 16,4% of patients and was associated with a 15% mortality rate.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^6105fce8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

While the treatment of a small ulcer is relatively straightforward, the treatment of giant peptic ulcers (diameter > 2 cm) poses different challenges according to the anatomical location. Furthermore, large gastric ulcers should always raise the suspicion of malignancy. The spontaneous perforation of gastric cancer is a rare complication, occurring in 1% of patients with gastric cancer, and it has been reported that about 10–16% of all gastric perforations are caused by gastric carcinoma. Besides this, there are no specific surgical treatment recommendations since the site of perforation and the secondary effects on the surrounding anatomical structures must direct the necessary interventions. The gastric location is usually easier to treat when compared to the duodenal location and gastric resection and reconstruction should be the surgical choice for the treatment of perforated gastric ulcers larger than 2 cm. On the other hand, only the first portion of the duodenum can be resected easily without risk of injuring the bile duct or the pancreatic head. Antrectomy plus or minus D1–D2 resection with diversion is the classic and most commonly described intervention, if the ampullary region is not involved. The proximity of the defect and its relation to the common bile duct and ampulla of Vater must also be thoroughly investigated and intraoperative cholangiography may even be necessary to verify common bile duct anatomy. Several different procedures, such as a jejunal serosal patch, Roux en-Y duodenojejunostomy, pyloric exclusion, and several variations of omental plugs have been described for large duodenal defects when the defect is felt too large to perform a primary repair. In large ulcers, leak rates up to 12% have been reported from attempted closure with an omental patch procedure. These patients also frequently present in septic shock when the amount of peritoneal spillage is large. This factor alone should significantly influence the choice of operative intervention, because a definitive resectional approach for ulcers involving the ampullary area (i.e. Whipple procedure or similar) is usually not recommended in patients with peritonitis, because of the high physiological impact of these procedures and the great risk of postoperative complications. In these cases, a damage control procedure (such as pyloric exclusion with gastric decompression via a nasogastric tube or a gastrostomy and an external biliary diversion via T-tube) will likely be the safest and most appropriate operation for the patient. Duodenostomy (e.g. over Petzer tube) should be used only as a last resort, in the presence of giant ulcers with severe tissue inflammation and when mobilization of the duodenum is not possible and the patient is in severe septic shock with hemodynamic instability.

### Iatrogenic injury of duodenum: malady of a therapeutic misadventure [^8fc49682]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Endoscopic procedures are the front-runner of the management of bleeding duodenal ulcer. Rarely, surgical intervention is sought for acute bleeding, not amenable to endoscopic procedures. Oversewing of the gastroduodenal artery at ulcer crater by transduodenal approach is the most acceptable and recommended method of treatment. We describe a case of an intraoperative duodenal injury that occurred during an attempt to oversew the gastroduodenal artery after a duodenotomy, leading to an unsatisfactory and meagre duodenal stump. This case will highlight the intraoperative turmoil, postoperative complications and management of a series of anticipated but unfortunate events that have rendered us wiser in terms of surgical management of a bleeding duodenal ulcer.

### Permissive hypotension versus conventional resuscitation strategies in adult trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^53718cbc]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Aggressive fluid resuscitation in trauma promotes deleterious effects such as clot disruption, dilutional coagulopathy and hypothermia. Animal studies suggest that permissive hypotension maintains appropriate organ perfusion, reduces bleeding and improves mortality. This review assesses the efficacy and safety of permissive hypotension in adult trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to May 2017 for randomized controlled trials comparing permissive hypotension vs. conventional resuscitation following traumatic injury. We included preoperative and intraoperative resuscitation strategies. The primary outcome was 30-day or in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included blood product utilization, estimated blood loss and in-hospital complications. Pooling was performed with a random-effects model.

Results

We screened 722 abstracts, from which five randomized trials evaluating 1,158 patients were included. Blood pressure targets in the intervention arms varied from systolic BP 50 mm Hg to 70 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg or higher as compared to systolic BP 65 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure of 65 or higher in the control arms. Two studies evaluated only patients with penetrating injury while the remaining three additionally included blunt injuries. Four trials suggested a survival benefit for 30-day or in-hospital mortality with hypotensive resuscitation, although three studies were insufficiently powered to find statistical significance. Studies were of poor to moderate quality due to poor protocol reporting and lack of blinding. The pooled odds ratio was 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.53–0.92), suggesting a survival benefit for permissive hypotension. Those patients received fewer blood products and had lesser estimated blood loss.

Conclusion

Permissive hypotension may offer a survival benefit over conventional resuscitation for patients with hemorrhagic injury. It may additionally reduce blood loss and blood product utilization. However, the majority of studies were underpowered, thus reflecting a need for high quality, adequately powered trials.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults: evaluation and… [^425b58ed]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Risk Factors The most common risk factors for upper GI bleeding include prior upper GI bleeding, anticoagulant use, high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and older age. 1 The overall incidence of peptic ulcer disease is decreasing, likely because of an increase in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori and an increase in the use of proton pump inhibitors; however, the incidence of peptic ulcer disease not related to H. pylori or to NSAID use is increasing. 1, 3 Renal failure, though less common, is a risk factor for upper GI bleeding, particularly in the first year of dialysis 1 because of platelet dysfunction, platelet-vessel wall interaction, and blood coagulation abnormalities. 23 Physicians should inquire about prior upper GI bleeding, history of coagulopathy, and use of antithrombotics, NSAIDs, or SSRIs.

To assess the risk of cirrhosis and variceal bleeding, physicians should inquire about prior liver disease, viral hepatitis, and alcohol use. Physical examination includes assessment of hemodynamic stability, presence of abdominal pain or rebound tenderness, and examination of stool color. Initial Evaluation and Stabilization The initial evaluation includes a complete history, examination, and laboratory evaluation. The goal of the initial evaluation is to determine the severity of the bleeding, to identify the possible source of bleeding, and to guide management decisions, such as hospitalization, transfusion, and diagnostic testing. 3 Patients should maintain "nothing by mouth" orders while being evaluated. 23 Measurement of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels should be repeated based on the severity of the upper GI bleeding, clinical judgment, and hemodynamic stability.

23 A blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio greater than 36 is suggestive of upper GI bleeding when distinguishing it from lower GI bleeding. 23 In patients with significant upper GI bleeding, place two large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters and a bolus of normal saline or lactated Ringer solution to correct hypovolemia and to maintain blood pressure because tachycardia and hypotension may be signs of significant blood loss. 23 Regular monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, and pulse oximetry is necessary during resuscitation and stabilization. Endotracheal intubation may be necessary to protect the airway in patients with significant and ongoing bleeding. 3 Management of patients with life-threatening bleeding warranting intensive monitoring is beyond the scope of this article. There are no RCTs or guidelines to support the use of nasogastric lavage.

A retrospective study of 632 individuals admitted with upper GI bleeding found that nasogastric lavage did not lower mortality, surgery, or transfusion requirements. 23, 25 The use of prokinetic agents before endoscopy is controversial; however, a meta-analysis of eight RCTs that included 598 individuals found that an erythromycin infusion before endoscopy improved visualization, reduced the need for second-look endoscopy, and reduced hospital stay. 3 Clinical prediction guides are necessary for upper GI bleeding risk stratification and to determine therapy. TRANSFUSIONS AND COAGULOPATHY Current guidelines recommend blood transfusion for patients with upper GI bleeding when hemoglobin is less than 8 g per dL, including patients with coronary artery disease, recent cardiac surgery, or hematologic malignancies.

### Peptic ulcer disease [^f1412d54]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer disease usually occurs in the stomach and proximal duodenum. The predominant causes in the United States are infection with Helicobacter pylori and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Symptoms of peptic ulcer disease include epigastric discomfort (specifically, pain relieved by food intake or antacids and pain that causes awakening at night or that occurs between meals), loss of appetite, and weight loss. Older patients and patients with alarm symptoms indicating a complication or malignancy should have prompt endoscopy. Patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should discontinue their use. For younger patients with no alarm symptoms, a test-and-treat strategy based on the results of H. pylori testing is recommended. If H. pylori infection is diagnosed, the infection should be eradicated and antisecretory therapy (preferably with a proton pump inhibitor) given for four weeks. Patients with persistent symptoms should be referred for endoscopy. Surgery is indicated if complications develop or if the ulcer is unresponsive to medications. Bleeding is the most common indication for surgery. Administration of proton pump inhibitors and endoscopic therapy control most bleeds. Perforation and gastric outlet obstruction are rare but serious complications. Peritonitis is a surgical emergency requiring patient resuscitation; laparotomy and peritoneal toilet; omental patch placement; and, in selected patients, surgery for ulcer control.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^3bdacc27]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Non-colonoscopy interventions for acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: A surgical consultation should be requested in patients with high-risk clinical features and ongoing bleeding. In general, surgery for acute LGIB should be considered after other therapeutic options have failed and should take into consideration the extent and success of prior bleeding control measures, severity and source of bleeding, and the level of comorbid disease. It is important to very carefully localize the source of bleeding whenever possible before surgical resection to avoid continued or recurrent bleeding from an unresected culprit lesion (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). Radiographic interventions should be considered in patients with high-risk clinical features and ongoing bleeding who have a negative upper endoscopy and do not respond adequately to hemodynamic resuscitation efforts and are therefore unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation and urgent colonoscopy (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). If a diagnostic test is desired for localization of the bleeding site before angiography, CT angiography should be considered (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

### Current management of peptic ulcer bleeding [^42a3f240]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Peptic ulcer bleeding is a common and potentially fatal condition. It is best managed using a multidisciplinary approach by a team with medical, endoscopic and surgical expertise. The management of peptic ulcer bleeding has been revolutionized in the past two decades with the advent of effective endoscopic hemostasis and potent acid-suppressing agents. A prompt initial clinical and endoscopic assessment should allow patients to be triaged effectively into those who require active therapy, versus those who require monitoring and preventative therapy. A combination of pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy (using a combination of injection and thermal coagulation) offers the best chance of hemostasis for those with active bleeding ulcers. Surgery, being the most effective way to control bleeding, should be considered for treatment failures. The choice between surgery and repeat endoscopic therapy should be based on the pre-existing comorbidities of the patient and the characteristics of the ulcer.

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^6a7a8d20]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Timing of upper endoscopy in overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding — the panel suggests that patients admitted or under observation in hospital with overt UGIB, whether predicted to be at low risk or high risk of further bleeding and death, undergo upper endoscopy within 24 hours of presentation. A large randomized clinical trial comparing urgent endoscopy within 6 hours against 6–24 hours after consultation in 516 patients predicted to be at high risk based on GBS ≥ 12 found that neither further bleeding (28/258 [10.9%] vs 20/258 [7.8%]; difference = 3%, −2% to 8%) nor mortality (23/258 [8.9%] vs 17/258 [6.6%]; difference = 2%, −2% to 7%) was reduced, although endoscopic hemostatic treatment was 11.6% more frequent in the urgent group. Because of randomization lag, the study actually compared endoscopies at means of 10 and 14 hours after presentation, with 55% of the control group undergoing endoscopy within 12 hours, and it excluded patients with hypotensive shock who failed to stabilize after initial resuscitation, a group representing only 5% of the high-risk patients. Given these data, the panel did not include the suggestion from the 2012 ACG Guidelines that endoscopy within 12 hours "may be considered" in patients with high-risk clinical features.

### Damage control surgery in the era of damage control resuscitation [^a67b9549]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Damage control surgery (DCS) is a concept of abbreviated laparotomy, designed to prioritize short-term physiological recovery over anatomical reconstruction in the seriously injured and compromised patient. Over the last 10 yr, a new addition to the damage control paradigm has emerged, referred to as damage control resuscitation (DCR). This focuses on initial hypotensive resuscitation and early use of blood products to prevent the lethal triad of acidosis, coagulopathy, and hypothermia. This review aims to present the evidence behind DCR and its current application, and also to present a strategy of overall damage control to include DCR and DCS in conjunction. The use of DCR and DCS have been associated with improved outcomes for the severely injured and wider adoption of these principles where appropriate may allow this trend of improved survival to continue. In particular, DCR may allow borderline patients, who would previously have required DCS, to undergo early definitive surgery as their physiological derangement is corrected earlier.

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^60988116]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Low- and high-risk clinical features — timing evidence indicates that in low-risk patients, two small RCTs found endoscopy within 2–6 hours identified low-risk endoscopic findings that should allow discharge with outpatient follow-up in at least 40% of patients, but differences in further bleeding or mortality were not identified and one study noted ∼80% of outpatient recommendations were not followed. A large cohort of 5,415 hemodynamically stable patients without significant comorbidities reported that endoscopy within 24 hours had adjusted OR = 0.59, 0.33–1.05 for in-hospital mortality but not 30-day mortality (adjusted OR = 1.02, 0.50–2.09). In high-risk settings, a nationwide Danish cohort found in-hospital mortality was lower with endoscopy 6–24 hours after admission in hemodynamically unstable patients and 12–36 hours after admission in hemodynamically stable patients with significant comorbidities (American Society of Anesthesiologists score 3–5) versus outside these timeframes, raising the possibility that very early endoscopy may cause harm if resuscitation and comorbidity management are not undertaken; conversely, a single-center Korean cohort reported reduced 28-day mortality with endoscopy within 6 hours vs 6–48 hours after presentation.

### Cesena guidelines: WSES consensus statement on laparoscopic-first approach to general surgery emergencies and abdominal trauma [^1595e983]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

These criteria for the definition of the hemodynamic state have been published and variably validated for the abdominal injured trauma patients. As general surgery patients with severe intraperitoneal sepsis or bleeding are just as susceptible to the detrimental effects of acidosis, hypothermia and coagulopathy, these criteria were subsequently adopted for the definition of the patient's hemodynamic state in non-traumatic abdominal emergencies. For this purpose, some authors have proposed other criteria to establish patient's instability: T(°C) < 35, pH < 7.20, Lactate > 2.5 (the lethal triad); systolic blood pressure < 70 mmHg; base deficiency > − 8.0; INR > 1.7; need for the introduction /titration of intraoperative norepinephrine > 10 mcg/min.

Instability is mostly established by parameters (systolic blood pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, temperature — hypothermia), physical examination (vasoconstriction, oliguria, decreased level of consciousness) laboratory evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (pH, lactate/base deficit, coagulopathy). However, there are no universally accepted definitions for the classification of the patient's hemodynamic status and clinical scenarios are often complicated. What may be regarded as acceptable physiological parameters will vary depending on many factors including the age, underlying medication and comorbidities of the patient. Therefore, blood pressure goals should be individualized by the physician according to patient physiology, comorbidities and physiological compensation to shock during the time of resuscitation.

For unstable patients suffering from septic shock due to peritonitis, or hemorrhagic shock due to abdominal bleeding, an open laparotomy as first approach remains mandatory. In a review on Emergency Laparoscopy published in the World Journal of Emergency Surgery in 2006, Warren et al. summarized the indications for emergency laparoscopy based on the contemporary evidence. Laparoscopic surgery was established as the best intervention in acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis and most gynecological emergencies. In penetrating thoraco-abdominal trauma stable patients, where computed tomography (CT) scan has the low sensitivity in detecting diaphragmatic injury, a laparoscopic approach was found to be effective not only for the diagnosis but also as a treatment option. However, its role in the management of other more technically demanding general surgical emergencies, such as perforating peptic ulcers, acute mesenteric ischemia, acute diverticulitis, incarcerated hernias, small bowel obstructions, as well as the majority of abdominal trauma requiring surgery, was considered unclear and the evidence was insufficient to justify the adoption of a laparoscopic-first approach.

### Management of bleeding in vascular surgery [^0bf798bc]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Management of acute coagulopathy and blood loss during major vascular procedures poses a significant haemostatic challenge to anaesthetists. The acute coagulopathy is multifactorial in origin with tissue injury and hypotension as the precipitating factors, followed by dilution, hypothermia, acidemia, hyperfibrinolysis and systemic inflammatory response, all acting as a self-perpetuating spiral of events. The problem is confounded by the high prevalence of antithrombotic agent use in these patients and intraoperative heparin administration. Trials specifically examining bleeding management in vascular surgery are lacking, and much of the literature and guidelines are derived from studies on patients with trauma. In general, it is recommended to adopt permissive hypotension with a restrictive fluid strategy, using a combination of crystalloid and colloid solutions up to one litre during the initial resuscitation, after which blood products should be administered. A restrictive transfusion trigger for red cells remains the mainstay of treatment except for the high-risk patients, where the trigger should be individualized. Transfusion of blood components should be initiated by clinical evidence of coagulopathy such as diffuse microvascular bleeding, and then guided by either laboratory or point-of-care coagulation testing. Prophylactic antifibrinolytic use is recommended for all surgery where excessive bleeding is anticipated. Fibrinogen and prothrombin complex concentrates administration are recommended during massive transfusion, whereas rFVIIa should be reserved until all means have failed. While debates over the ideal resuscitative strategy continue, the approach to vascular haemostasis should be scientific, rational, and structured. As far as possible, therapy should be monitored and goal directed.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^a66769e9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Severe hematochezia — suggested management begins with intravenous fluid (IVF) resuscitation, packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion to threshold > 7g/dL (or higher if shock or cardiovascular ischemia), and exclusion of an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) source if appropriate. With ongoing significant bleeding, CT angiography is listed; under "Extravasation", Prompt transcatheter angiography with embolization if extravasation seen, and under "No Extravasation", Consider urgent colonoscopy (large volume purge prep with 4–6L PEG over 3–4 hours) with intervention for specialized centers with expertise in endoscopic hemostasis. If there is milder lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) or bleeding has subsided, the pathway lists Nonurgent colonoscopy (with split-dose PEG) vs. observation if bleeding subsides and patient has had recent colonoscopy. Risk factors of UGI bleeding include history of peptic ulcer bleeding, portal hypertension, BUN/Cr > 30, aspirin/NSAID use, and positive nasogastric lavage. Predictors of a positive CT angiography include performance of a CTA within 4 hours of hematochezia, recent bowel resection or intervention, transfusion of > 3 units of PRBC, use of antiplatelets or DOACS, tachycardia, or hypotension; for centers without interventional radiology availability, would consider performing a prompt colonoscopy after resuscitation.

### Strategies to prevent blood loss and reduce transfusion in emergency general surgery, WSES-AAST consensus paper [^c305aeb5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Emergency general surgeons often provide care to severely ill patients requiring surgical interventions and intensive support. One of the primary drivers of morbidity and mortality is perioperative bleeding. In general, when addressing life threatening haemorrhage, blood transfusion can become an essential part of overall resuscitation. However, under all circumstances, indications for blood transfusion must be accurately evaluated. When patients decline blood transfusions, regardless of the reason, surgeons should aim to provide optimal care and respect and accommodate each patient's values and target the best outcome possible given the patient's desires and his/her clinical condition. The aim of this position paper was to perform a review of the existing literature and to provide comprehensive recommendations on organizational, surgical, anaesthetic, and haemostatic strategies that can be used to provide optimal peri-operative blood management, reduce, or avoid blood transfusions and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^a2718f49]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — recurrent ulcer bleeding after successful endoscopic hemostatic therapy — We suggest that patients with recurrent bleeding after endoscopic therapy for a bleeding ulcer undergo repeat endoscopy and endoscopic therapy rather than undergo surgery or transcatheter arterial embolization (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence for comparison with surgery; very-low-quality evidence for comparison with transcatheter arterial embolization). In a randomized trial (Endoscopy [N = 48]; Surgery [N = 44]), further bleeding was 11 (22.9) vs 3 (6.8) with absolute difference 16% (2% to 30%); death was 5 (10.4) vs 8 (18.2) with −8% (−22% to 7%); surgery for rebleeding or complication after initial assigned treatment was 13 (27.1) vs 4 (9.1) with 18% (3% to 33%); complications were 7 (14.6) vs 16 (36.4) with −22% (−39% to −4%); and hospital days were median 10 (2–111) vs 11 (4–42). Safety notes include that Two of 48 patients treated with repeat heater probe therapy in the RCT developed perforation, and in that trial failure of repeat endoscopic hemostatic therapy was associated with hypotension at the time of rebleeding and ulcer size > 2 cm.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^7f847bcd]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding management — hemodynamic status should be initially assessed with intravascular volume resuscitation started as needed, and risk stratification based on clinical parameters should be performed to help distinguish patients at high- and low-risk of adverse outcomes. Hematochezia associated with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding source and thus warrants an upper endoscopy. In the majority of patients, colonoscopy should be the initial diagnostic procedure and should be performed within 24 h of patient presentation after adequate colon preparation, and endoscopic hemostasis therapy should be provided to patients with high-risk endoscopic stigmata of bleeding including active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel, or adherent clot. The endoscopic hemostasis modality used (mechanical, thermal, injection, or combination) is most often guided by endoscopist experience, the etiology of bleeding, access to the bleeding site, and endoscopist experience with the various hemostasis modalities, and repeat colonoscopy, with endoscopic hemostasis performed if indicated, should be considered for patients with evidence of recurrent bleeding. Radiographic interventions (tagged red blood cell scintigraphy, computed tomographic angiography, and angiography) should be considered in high-risk patients with ongoing bleeding who do not respond adequately to resuscitation and who are unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation and colonoscopy, and strategies to prevent recurrent bleeding should be considered. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use should be avoided in patients with a history of acute lower GI bleeding, particularly if secondary to diverticulosis or angioectasia, and patients with established cardiovascular disease who require aspirin (secondary prophylaxis) should generally resume aspirin as soon as possible after bleeding ceases and at least within 7 days. Surgery for the prevention of recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding should be individualized, and the source of bleeding should be carefully localized before resection.

### Changing paradigms in surgical resuscitation [^b4fdac45]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing emergency surgery typically require resuscitation, either because they are hemorrhaging or because they are experiencing significant internal fluid shifts. Intravascular hypovolemia is common at the time of anesthesia induction and can lead to hemodynamic collapse if not promptly treated. Central pressure monitoring is associated with technical complications and does not improve outcomes in this population. Newer modalities are in use, but they lack validation. Fluid resuscitation is different in bleeding and septic patients. In the former group, it is advisable to maintain a deliberately low blood pressure to facilitate clot formation and stabilization. If massive transfusion is anticipated, blood products should be administered from the outset to prevent the coagulopathy of trauma. Early use of plasma in a ratio approaching 1:1 with red blood cells (RBCs) has been associated with improved outcomes. In septic patients, early fluid loading is recommended. The concept of "goal-directed resuscitation" is based on continuing resuscitation until venous oxygen saturation is normalized. In either bleeding or septic patients, however, the most important goal remains surgical control of the source of pathology, and nothing should be allowed to delay transfer to the operating room. We review the current literature and recommendations for the resuscitation of patients coming for emergency surgery procedures.

### Cesena guidelines: WSES consensus statement on laparoscopic-first approach to general surgery emergencies and abdominal trauma [^ee54909a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Traditional surgical management of simple PPUs involved laparotomy with primary suture closure or omental patch. The first laparoscopic treatment of a perforated peptic ulcer with an omental patch and fibrin glue was described in 1990 by Mouret et al. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis comparing postoperative outcomes of laparoscopic versus open omental patch repair of PPU included a total of 29 studies with 5311 patients and four RCTs with 238 patients. Most of the ulcers were in the duodenum (57.0%) followed by the stomach (30.7%). Mean ulcer size ranged from 5 to 16.2 mm in laparoscopic repair and 4.7 to 15.8 mm in open repair. Laparoscopic repair was associated with lower 30-day mortality, overall morbidity, surgical site infection, and LOS.

There is increasing adoption of the laparoscopic approach with decreasing conversion rates, as shown by Coe et al. in a recent analysis on a total of 5253 patients who underwent PPU repair from December 2013 to December 2017, using data from the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit. Across the 4-year study period, laparoscopic repair increased from 20 to 26% and the conversion rate decreased from 40 to 31%. A recent retrospective study compared the outcomes of patients who received different surgical approaches for PPU. In the open approach group, in-hospital mortality and need for post-operative ICU were significantly higher, and the postoperative stay was longer. Previous abdominal surgery, ulcer size, and a posterior ulcer location, were predictive factors for conversion to an open approach.

A tailored approach is suggested by the 2020 WSES guidelines. The surgeon must consider the ulcer location and the size (considering open repair for ulcers larger than 2 cm). For large gastric ulcers that raise the suspicion of malignancy, resection with operative frozen pathologic examination is suggested. In cases of large duodenal ulcers, the surgeon has also to consider the need for resections or repair plus/minus pyloric exclusion/external bile drainage.

Shelat et.al proposed some selection criteria for surgical training in laparoscopic PPU repair (Boey score of 0 or 1; ulcer size less than 10 mm; located in pyloro-duodenal area; no suspicion of malignancy; no previous abdominal surgery; ASA < 3) as being effective to reduce aspects of the learning curve and to enhance patient safety.

Gastric and small bowel emergencies are often seen in the emergency department and require rapid assessment and intervention as patients can deteriorate quickly. Some of the more frequently seen gastric emergencies include gastric volvulus and peptic ulcer disease, which can present with ischemia, strangulation, perforation, or severe bleeding. Swift diagnosis is crucial to ensuring the proper management whether that is endoscopic or with surgical exploration. Perforated peptic ulcers that are not contained will require surgical intervention, whereas bleeding ulcers can often be controlled with endoscopic interventions.

Massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a life-threatening condition that can result from numerous causes and requires skilled resuscitation to decrease patient morbidity and mortality. Successful resuscitation begins with placement of large-bore intravenous or intraosseous access; early blood product administration; and early consultation with a gastroenterologist, interventional radiologist, and/or surgeon. Activate a massive transfusion protocol when initial red blood cell transfusion does not restore effective perfusion or the patient's shock index is greater than 1.0. Promptly reverse coagulopathies secondary to oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet use. Use thromboelastography or rotational thromboelastometry to guide further transfusions. Secure a definitive airway and minimize aspiration.

Non-operative management — endoscopic treatment

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, which are the indications for non-operative management?

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, we recommend non-operative management as the first line of management after endoscopy (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 1C).

Non-operative management of bleeding peptic ulcer incorporates principles of ABCDE:
Airway control
Breathing — ventilation and oxygenation
Circulation — fluid resuscitation and control of bleeding
Drugs — pharmacotherapy with PPIs, prokinetics, etc.
Endoscopy (diagnostic and therapeutic) or embolization (therapeutic)

A meta-analysis from Barkun et al. that included forty-one randomized trials showed that all endoscopic therapies decreased rebleeding versus pharmacotherapy alone. Endoscopy is indicated to establish diagnosis and institute therapy for bleeding peptic ulcer. In acutely bleeding ulcers, endoscopy is a part of resuscitation.

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, which are the indications for endoscopic treatment?

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, we recommend endoscopic treatment to achieve hemostasis and reduce re-bleeding, the need for surgery, and mortality (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 1C).

We suggest stratifying patients based on the Blatchford score and adopting a risk-stratified management (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidences, 2D):
In the very low-risk group, we suggest outpatient endoscopy (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 2C)
In the low-risk group, we recommend early inpatient endoscopy (≤ 24 h of admission) (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 1C).
In the high-risk group, we recommend urgent inpatient endoscopy (≤ 12 h of admission) (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 1C).

### The acute upper gastrointestinal bleed [^074f7aec]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), defined as intraluminal hemorrhage proximal to the ligament of Treitz, can range from mild and asymptomatic to massive life-threatening hemorrhage. For the purposes of this article, the authors define an acute UGIB to be one that results in new acute symptoms and is, therefore, potentially life-threatening. UGIB requires a systematic approach to evaluation and treatment, similar to the management of a trauma patient. Surgeon involvement in UGIBs remains integral despite the rare need for operative management. Endoscopy is the primary tool for diagnosis and treatment.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^82649444]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In light of the above, we cannot suggest the routine application of the omental patch because of the longer operative time, the need for advanced laparoscopic skills and the similar results after simple closure, but it could be considered a viable option in selected cases.

In patients with perforated peptic ulcer and large perforation (≥ 2 cm), which surgical procedure should be adopted?

We suggest a tailored approach based upon the location of the ulcer for the treatment of perforated peptic ulcer larger than 2 cm. In case of large gastric ulcers that raise the suspicion of malignancy, we suggest resection with contextual operative frozen pathologic examination whenever possible. In case of large duodenal ulcers, we suggest considering the need of resections or repair plus/minus pyloric exclusion/external bile drainage. We recommend duodenostomy only in extreme circumstances (weak recommendations based on very low-quality evidences, 2D).

Since the 1960s, interventional radiology has played a role in the management of gastrointestinal bleeding. What began primarily as a diagnostic modality has evolved into much more of a therapeutic tool. And although the frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding has diminished thanks to management by pharmacologic and endoscopic methods, the need for additional invasive interventions still exists. Transcatheter angiography and intervention is a fundamental step in the algorithm for the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^1444633e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The management of bleeding ARV can be very challenging and essentially includes prompt resuscitation and correction of coagulopathy, immediate workup to localize the site/source of bleeding and then the application of a suitable treatment modality or immediate transfer to a tertiary referral center. Management options may vary with a combination of local/endoscopic, medical, radiological, and surgical methods available. In mild cases, intravenous fluid replacement, blood transfusion, correction of coagulopathy, and optimal medication for portal hypertension are usually effective.

Initial resuscitation and hemodynamic stabilization are critical and patients' conditions should be optimized before endoscopic intervention. The management of comorbid conditions, including the appropriate management of anti-platelet agents and anticoagulants, requires a multidisciplinary and individualized approach.

The intravascular volume repletion is done with crystalloids and packed red blood cells. The targets of resuscitation are the restoration of hemodynamic status but avoiding over-expansion, which may exacerbate portal pressure, impair clot formation, and increase the risk of further bleeding. In fact, a certain degree of hypovolemia and hypotension promotes activation of endogenous vasoactive systems, leading to splanchnic vasoconstriction and, therefore, reducing portal blood flow and pressure. A recent randomized controlled trial showed that a restrictive packed red blood cell transfusion strategy improves survival in Child–Pugh A and B patients. The results of this study showed that patients with cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding should be transfused when hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dl, aiming at a target level of 7–9 g/dl. Other risks related to blood product utilization are immunologic (transfusion-related lung injury and development of HLA antibodies) and can impact subsequent transplantation or impair the ability to receive further transfusions. A recent guideline from the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee suggests the following transfusion thresholds for management of active bleeding in advanced liver disease: hematocrit > 25%, platelet count > 50,000, and fibrinogen > 120 mg/dl. Exceptions to this restrictive strategy are massive bleeding, which should prompt the activation of a dedicated transfusional protocol, cardiovascular comorbidities, and any other condition that precludes adequate physiological response to acute anemia. It is important to keep in mind that an acute hypotension may decrease hepatic perfusion, which in the setting of underlying chronic liver disease can exacerbate liver injury. A helpful maneuver to slow down the bleeding rate could be the endorectal placement of a compression tube (i.e. Sengstaken-Blakemore Tube or a Linton-Nachlas balloon compression tube) held under moderate traction: this device should be left in place until the patient is sufficiently stabilized or until the patient is transferred to a center with available expertise. The placement of balloon tamponade can also give additional time to correctly study the patients with CT scans or other imaging techniques, thus enabling to tailor the management strategy to the anatomy of the bleeding vessel. Eventually, rebleeding is almost universal if another modality of treatment is not instituted.

### Challenges in the management of acute peptic ulcer bleeding [^60f0b68f]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common medical emergency worldwide, a major cause of which are bleeding peptic ulcers. Endoscopic treatment and acid suppression with proton-pump inhibitors are cornerstones in the management of the disease, and both treatments have been shown to reduce mortality. The role of emergency surgery continues to diminish. In specialised centres, radiological intervention is increasingly used in patients with severe and recurrent bleeding who do not respond to endoscopic treatment. Despite these advances, mortality from the disorder has remained at around 10%. The disease often occurs in elderly patients with frequent comorbidities who use antiplatelet agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and anticoagulants. The management of such patients, especially those at high cardiothrombotic risk who are on anticoagulants, is a challenge for clinicians. We summarise the published scientific literature about the management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers, identify directions for future clinical research, and suggest how mortality can be reduced.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^71f959ac]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnoses of nosocomial, procedure-related perforations are made by evaluating clinical findings, particularly radiographic imaging with contrast examinations (preferably CT). The presence of retroperitoneal air upon CT analysis does not linearly correlate with the severity of the condition or the need for surgery.

If there is any suspicion of perforation, the surgeon must promptly diagnose the patient and immediately initiate systemic support, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and intravenous resuscitation. Following clinical and radiographic examination, the mechanism, site, and extent of injury should be taken into account when selecting a conservative or surgical approach.

Despite extensive retroperitoneal air observed in CT analysis, successful non-operative management of sphincterotomy-related retroperitoneal perforations is possible, provided that the patient remains stable. In contrast, if a patient develops abdominal pain, becomes febrile, or appears critically ill, surgical exploration should be considered for repair or drainage, especially in the case of elderly or chronically ill patients who are less able to withstand physiological stress.

Early surgical intervention often facilitates ensuing primary repair strategies, similar in principle to closure of duodenal perforations secondary to duodenal ulcers. Delayed repair following failed non-operative treatment can be devastating and may require duodenal diversion and drainage without repair of the actual perforation.

Several novel methods of managing ERCP-induced perforation have been reported in recent literature. Some patients have been managed successfully with an endoclipping device; however, this procedure is somewhat precarious given that adequate closure requires inclusion of the submucosal layer of the bowel wall, which clips cannot reliably ensure. Patients must be carefully selected for this procedure; the clipping method is only appropriate for patients who meet the criteria for conservative management (such as the absence of peritoneal signs) and who present with small, well-defined perforations detected without delay. The majority of pancreaticobiliary and duodenal perforations (70%) secondary to periampullary endoscopic interventions can be treated non-operatively by means of nasogastric drainage, antibiotic coverage and nutritional support.

### Evidence-based guidelines for bleeding in trauma patients: where do we go from here? [^3c4d26a8]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

The development of evidence-based guidelines has gained popularity as a strategy to reduce variation in practice and to orient clinical care around documentable best practices. Based on available data, the new European guidelines for the management of bleeding in the trauma patient do deliver a number of sound recommendations. However, some issues remain controversial and, like many guidelines, the actual translation of these evidence-based recommendations into routine clinical practice protocols continues to leave opportunity for variation. Nevertheless, this consensus guideline provides an excellent starting point. As evidence continues to accumulate, future iterations should provide greater specificity and move us closer to the definitive best practice.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^bd0f72be]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding — non-colonoscopy interventions: A surgical consultation should be requested in patients with high-risk clinical features and ongoing bleeding, and surgery for acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding should be considered after other therapeutic options have failed with careful localization of the source whenever possible (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). Radiographic interventions should be considered in patients with high-risk clinical features and ongoing bleeding who have a negative upper endoscopy and do not respond adequately to hemodynamic resuscitation and are unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation and urgent colonoscopy (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). If a diagnostic test is desired for localization of the bleeding site before angiography, computed tomographic angiography should be considered (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

### Technique of antroduodenectomy without ulcer excision as a safe alternative treatment for bleeding chronic duodenal ulcers [^dd6bee2d]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of a bleeding chronic posterior duodenal ulcer, with bleeding recurrence or persistence despite endoscopic therapy, requires surgical treatment and constitutes a challenge for the surgeon; furthermore such chronic ulcers are often wide and sclerotic, so the surgeon needs to avoid the risk of recurrent bleeding if conservative surgery is applied. If radical surgery must be performed, the greater risk involves duodenal leakage, hepatic hilar injury, or pancreatic injury. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and complications arising from a surgical procedure, described by Dubois in 1971 (Gastrectomy and gastroduodenal anastomosis for post-bulbar ulcers and peptic ulcers of the second part of the duodenum. J Chir 101:177–186). This operation involves antroduonectomy with gastroduodenal anastomosis. It is similar to a Billroth I gastrectomy but without dissection of the ulcer.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively studied the medical data of patients who underwent this procedure for the treatment of bleeding chronic posterior duodenal ulcers during the past 20 years.

Results

There were 28 such patients admitted to our institution for emergency surgery, who went on to be treated by the Dubois procedure. Ulcerous disease was efficiently treated without rebleeding or duodenal leakage. The mortality rate was 17%; most deaths resulted from medical failure in older patients suffering from massive bleeding. The rate of medical complications reached 21%. Surgical complications developed in 14% of patients.

Conclusions

The Dubois antroduodenectomy is a safe and effective surgical procedure for the treatment of bleeding chronic duodenal ulcers. The number of fatal outcomes among patients with this condition remains high, particularly in older and vulnerable patients experiencing massive bleeding.

Angiography, embolization

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, which are the indications for angiography?

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, we suggest considering angiography for diagnostic purposes as a second-line investigation after a negative endoscopy (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 2C).

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of provocation angiography.

Angiography may assist both the diagnosis and the treatment of hemorrhage associated with peptic ulcer disease. However, endoscopy remains the first-line investigation of choice for an undifferentiated upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Similarly, endoscopy is the first-line diagnostic modality for patients with suspected upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage from ulcer disease.

Angiography for diagnostic purposes is a second-line investigation and angiography before endoscopy results in unacceptable rates of negative investigations and is not warranted given the invasive nature of an angiogram. Angiography is useful for the confirmation and localization of the point of hemorrhage and allows treatment by embolization. On occasion, provocation angiography with the use of anticoagulants may be indicated. An inter-specialty consensus should guide this investigation on a case by case basis. Only case reports, case series, and expert opinion are available to guide this decision-making.

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, which are the indications for angioembolization?

In hemodinamically stable bleeding peptic ulcer patients, where endoscopic hemostasis fails twice or is not possible/feasible, we suggest angiography with angioembolization where technical skills and equipment are available (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidences, 2D)

Endoscopy is the established first-line therapy for the management of hemorrhage associated with peptic ulcer disease. It is appropriate (high-level evidence), to also conduct a second endoscopic examination with therapeutic intent, in cases of recurrent hemorrhage. However, where this also fails, surgery has been traditionally indicated. These operations are reported to be associated with mortality rates as high as 40%. Because of this high postoperative mortality, other strategies have been sought and angioembolization has become increasingly described during the past two decades.

### Management of patients with rebleeding [^63c0c166]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer bleeding is a common emergency. Management of ulcer bleeding requires prompt risk stratification, initiation of pharmacotherapy, and timely evaluation for endoscopy. Although endoscopy can achieve primary hemostasis in more than 90% of peptic ulcer bleeding, rebleeding may occur in up to 15% of patients after therapeutic endoscopy and is associated with heightened mortality. Early identification of high-risk patients for rebleeding is important. Depending on bleeding severity and center availability, patients with rebleeding may be managed by second endoscopy, transarterial angiographic embolization, or surgery. This article reviews the current management of peptic ulcers with an emphasis on rebleeding.
