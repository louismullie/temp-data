## Question

Management of intracranial hemorrhage

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of intracranial hemorrhage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the hemorrhage subtype because management diverges for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage versus aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Then, I should verify the universal prehospital and emergency priorities. Next, I will examine acute medical management, including blood pressure control, coagulopathy reversal, and intracranial pressure strategies. After that, I need to consider surgical indications and minimally invasive options. I will then review systems of care, neuromonitoring, and complications. Finally, I should address secondary prevention, special populations, and knowledge gaps, and close with a concise, actionable algorithm that aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities, because conflating spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage leads to errors in management. Spontaneous ICH is nontraumatic bleeding into brain parenchyma, often due to hypertension or cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and is the focus of the 2022 AHA/ASA ICH guideline, whereas aneurysmal SAH is bleeding into the subarachnoid space from a ruptured aneurysm and is governed by the 2023 AHA/ASA aSAH guideline, which I should keep distinct in my recommendations [^e327e917] [^dade2bfa].

> I need to ensure the universal prehospital and emergency steps are addressed immediately. Activate EMS early, provide early notification to the receiving hospital, and stabilize airway, breathing, and circulation en route. Avoid hypotension and hyperglycemia, and treat seizures promptly, as these steps reduce time to diagnosis and mitigate secondary brain injury and are consistently recommended across guidelines and reviews [^8c4e0ff8] [^b1532de5] [^9f8f6225].

> Next, I should review imaging and initial assessment. Noncontrast head CT is the diagnostic gold standard to confirm ICH, quantify hematoma volume, assess for intraventricular extension, and identify early signs of hematoma expansion. I should double-check that CT angiography is considered when secondary causes are suspected or when the patient is young without hypertension, to look for vascular malformations or aneurysms, aligning with AHA/ASA guidance on etiologic imaging in selected cases [^e327e917] [^abbb2b3f].

> Now, acute blood pressure management. For spontaneous ICH with mild to moderate severity and SBP 150–220 mmHg, I should confirm that rapid lowering to a target SBP of 130–140 mmHg is safe and may improve functional outcomes, with the caveat to avoid dropping SBP below 130 mmHg because that may be harmful. Initiate within 2 hours and titrate smoothly to minimize variability, and extend this approach to the subacute phase with a long-term target of ≤ 130/80 mmHg for secondary prevention, which is supported by AHA/ASA and reinforced by the 2025 ACC/AHA/AANP hypertension guideline for secondary prevention after ICH [^4080427e] [^60d5d97c] [^7dfba04f] [^9674486e] [^57b98f0d].

> Hold on, I should verify coagulopathy reversal specifics because timing and agent choice matter. For warfarin-associated ICH, rapid reversal with 4-factor PCC plus IV vitamin K is preferred. For DOAC-associated ICH, use idarucizumab for dabigatran and andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors when available, and if not, consider 4-factor PCC off-label. For antiplatelet-associated ICH, platelet transfusion has not shown benefit and is not routinely recommended, and desmopressin has insufficient evidence, so I should avoid reflexively transfusing platelets outside trials or select scenarios [^e327e917] [^e4274a1d] [^e325b419].

> I will now examine intracranial pressure and mass effect management. Elevate the head of bed to 30 degrees, maintain a neutral neck position, and consider osmotic therapy with mannitol or hypertonic saline for suspected elevated ICP. I should confirm that corticosteroids are not indicated for ICP control in ICH. For hydrocephalus from IVH, external ventricular drainage is indicated, and in select severe cases, intraventricular thrombolysis may be considered in specialized centers, though evidence is mixed and should be individualized [^49368561] [^a0e7d99f] [^e4274a1d].

> Let me consider surgical indications and timing. For cerebellar hemorrhage, evacuation is generally recommended if the hematoma exceeds about 3 cm or if there is neurological deterioration, brainstem compression, or hydrocephalus. For supratentorial ICH, craniotomy has not shown consistent benefit in randomized trials, but minimally invasive surgery is an area of active investigation and may be reasonable in selected patients, particularly for deep basal ganglia hemorrhages, though I should emphasize that current evidence does not support routine MIS for all and patient selection is key [^e327e917] [^e4274a1d] [^a30e01ce].

> Next, I should review systems of care and neuromonitoring. Admission to a specialized stroke unit with multidisciplinary teams reduces mortality and improves outcomes, and patients with IVH, infratentorial ICH, or larger supratentorial hematomas should be transferred early to centers with neurosurgical capabilities. ICP monitoring is reasonable in patients with GCS ≤ 8 or signs of herniation, but I need to acknowledge that high-quality evidence for routine invasive ICP monitoring in ICH is limited and extrapolated from TBI, so decisions should be individualized and trial enrollment considered when available [^f047da49] [^e6864e9d] [^64f3e9fb] [^49368561] [^ef82b9b9].

> I should confirm complication prevention strategies. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression is recommended, and pharmacologic prophylaxis can be considered once hemorrhage stability is established, balancing bleeding risk. Fever control and glycemic management are part of standard neurocritical care, and dysphagia screening before oral intake reduces pneumonia risk. Regarding seizures, treat clinical seizures promptly, but do not use prophylactic antiseizure medications routinely, as they do not improve functional outcomes [^e4274a1d] [^a0e7d99f] [^3190dad5] [^77361184].

> Now, secondary prevention. Aggressive blood pressure control is the cornerstone to reduce recurrence, targeting ≤ 130/80 mmHg long term, and the choice of antihypertensive class should be individualized with thiazide-type diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs as reasonable options. For patients with atrial fibrillation, decisions about resuming anticoagulation should weigh ischemic risk against recurrent ICH risk, and if anticoagulation is resumed, timing remains uncertain and should be individualized, ideally in shared decision-making with the patient or surrogate [^9674486e] [^57b98f0d] [^884a7e51].

> But wait, what about special populations and prognostication. I should avoid early therapeutic nihilism. Full active treatment for at least 24–48 hours is advised because early prognostication is unreliable, and prognostic scales should not be used alone to limit life-sustaining therapy. In elderly patients, frailty and pre-morbid function should guide intensity of care, and in patients with suspected cerebral amyloid angiopathy, I need to consider the heightened recurrence risk and tailor antithrombotic decisions accordingly [^c42e5a7d] [^e3ad67d1] [^f0217774].

> I should double-check knowledge gaps and future directions so I do not overstate certainty. Evidence remains limited for routine invasive ICP monitoring, optimal timing and selection for minimally invasive surgery, and the exact timing of anticoagulation resumption after ICH. Ongoing and future trials, including bundled care approaches and hemostatic therapies, are essential, and standardized outcome measures for hemostasis trials will improve comparability and accelerate translation [^ef82b9b9] [^e4274a1d] [^22745007].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical algorithm while keeping it reference-aligned. In the first hour, stabilize ABCs, obtain noncontrast CT, start IV antihypertensive for SBP ≥ 150 mmHg targeting 130–140 mmHg, and reverse coagulopathy. In hours 2–24, admit to a stroke unit, monitor neurologic status closely, manage ICP with head elevation and osmotherapy as needed, and evaluate for surgical intervention if cerebellar hemorrhage is large or if there is hydrocephalus or clinical deterioration. Beyond 24 hours, continue BP control, prevent complications, begin rehabilitation, and initiate secondary prevention planning, with early goals-of-care discussions using shared decision-making rather than premature withdrawal of care [^e327e917] [^4080427e] [^f047da49] [^e3ad67d1].

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a **neurologic emergency** requiring rapid diagnosis and coordinated care to limit hematoma expansion, control intracranial pressure, and prevent secondary brain injury [^9f8f6225]. Immediate **noncontrast CT** confirms the diagnosis and guides management, while early blood pressure lowering to 130–140 mmHg systolic is safe and may improve outcomes in eligible patients [^4080427e] [^60d5d97c]. Rapid reversal of anticoagulation is essential, and patients should be managed in a stroke unit with neurosurgical support when indicated [^e327e917] [^f047da49]. Surgery is reserved for select cases, such as cerebellar hemorrhage > 3 cm, progressive neurologic decline, or refractory intracranial hypertension, and minimally invasive approaches are under study but not yet standard [^e327e917] [^e4274a1d]. Early prognostication is unreliable; avoid withdrawing care in the first 24–48 hours unless clearly futile [^c42e5a7d].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnosis

- **Clinical presentation**: Sudden headache, focal deficits, altered consciousness, seizures, or signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: Noncontrast CT is the gold standard to confirm ICH, quantify volume, assess ventricular extension, and identify early expansion markers (e.g. blend sign, spot sign) [^abbb2b3f].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, coagulation profile, renal function, and type and crossmatch for potential transfusion [^notfound].

---

## Acute medical management

### Blood pressure control

- **Target**: Systolic BP 130–140 mmHg for mild-to-moderate ICH (SBP 150–220 mmHg) [^4080427e].

- **Timing**: Initiate within 2 hours and achieve target within 1 hour to reduce hematoma expansion [^7dfba04f].

- **Caution**: Avoid SBP < 130 mmHg, which may cause harm [^4080427e].

---

### Coagulopathy reversal

| **Anticoagulant** | **Reversal strategy** |
|-|-|
| Warfarin | - 4-factor PCC + vitamin K <br/> - FFP if PCC unavailable [^notfound] |
| Heparin | Protamine sulfate |
| DOACs | - Idarucizumab for dabigatran <br/> - Andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors <br/> - 4-factor PCC if andexanet unavailable [^notfound] |
| Antiplatelet agents | - Platelet transfusion only if neurosurgery planned <br/> - Desmopressin may be considered in select cases [^notfound] |

---

### Intracranial pressure management

- **Elevation**: Head of bed 30° [^a0e7d99f].

- **Osmotherapy**: Mannitol or hypertonic saline for suspected elevated ICP [^20a5ff9b].

- **Monitoring**: Consider ICP monitoring in GCS ≤ 8 or refractory elevated ICP [^49368561].

- **Hydrocephalus**: External ventricular drain (EVD) for ventricular enlargement with neurologic decline [^49368561].

---

### Seizure management

Treat clinical seizures with antiseizure medications; **avoid routine prophylaxis** because it does not improve outcomes [^3190dad5] [^77361184].

---

## Surgical management

- **Indications**: Cerebellar hemorrhage > 3 cm, progressive neurologic decline, or refractory elevated ICP [^2565b597].

- **Approaches**: Craniotomy, stereotactic aspiration, or minimally invasive surgery (MIS) are options; MIS is promising but not yet standard [^e4274a1d].

- **Timing**: Early surgery may reduce hematoma expansion and secondary injury, but patient selection is critical [^a30e01ce].

---

## Systems of care and secondary prevention

Stroke unit care with multidisciplinary teams improves outcomes and reduces mortality [^f047da49]. Regional systems enabling rapid transfer to centers with neurocritical care and neurosurgery are recommended [^abbb2b3f]. Secondary prevention focuses on **aggressive blood pressure control** (≤ 130/80 mmHg), lifestyle modification, and judicious antithrombotic decisions after shared decision-making [^9674486e] [^884a7e51].

---

## Prognostication and ethical considerations

Early prognostication is unreliable; **avoid early withdrawal of care** in the first 24–48 hours unless clearly futile [^c42e5a7d]. Use shared decision-making with surrogates, and avoid using DNR status to limit other interventions [^e3ad67d1].

---

## Emerging therapies and research directions

Minimally invasive surgery and endoscopic evacuation are under active investigation and may expand indications [^a30e01ce]. Hemostatic agents such as recombinant factor VIIa have not shown consistent benefit and are not routinely used [^827c2b6c]. Digital health and AI may enable faster triage, imaging analysis, and decision support [^a30e01ce].

---

Intracranial hemorrhage management centers on **rapid diagnosis**, early blood pressure control, coagulopathy reversal, and coordinated neurocritical care, with surgery reserved for select cases. Early, aggressive care in stroke units improves outcomes, and ongoing research into minimally invasive surgery and hemostatic therapies may further advance care.

### Acute intracerebral haemorrhage: diagnosis and management [^51be0c0d]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) accounts for half of the disability-adjusted life years lost due to stroke worldwide. Care pathways for acute stroke result in the rapid identification of ICH, but its acute management can prove challenging because no individual treatment has been shown definitively to improve its outcome. Nonetheless, acute stroke unit care improves outcome after ICH, patients benefit from interventions to prevent complications, acute blood pressure lowering appears safe and might have a modest benefit, and implementing a bundle of high-quality acute care is associated with a greater chance of survival. In this article, we address the important questions that neurologists face in the diagnosis and acute management of ICH, and focus on the supporting evidence and practical delivery for the main acute interventions.

### 2023 guideline for the management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^dade2bfa]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

The "2023 Guideline for the Management of Patients With Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage" replaces the 2012 "Guidelines for the Management of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage". The 2023 guideline is intended to provide patient-centric recommendations for clinicians to prevent, diagnose, and manage patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Methods

A comprehensive search for literature published since the 2012 guideline, derived from research principally involving human subjects, published in English, and indexed in MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline, was conducted between March 2022 and June 2022. In addition, the guideline writing group reviewed documents on related subject matter previously published by the American Heart Association. Newer studies published between July 2022 and November 2022 that affected recommendation content, Class of Recommendation, or Level of Evidence were included if appropriate. Structure: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a significant global public health threat and a severely morbid and often deadly condition. The 2023 aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage guideline provides recommendations based on current evidence for the treatment of these patients. The recommendations present an evidence-based approach to preventing, diagnosing, and managing patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, with the intent to improve quality of care and align with patients' and their families' and caregivers' interests. Many recommendations from the previous aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage guidelines have been updated with new evidence, and new recommendations have been created when supported by published data.

ACUTE MANAGEMENT

How do I approach the management of ICH?

ICH is a neurological emergency. The presence of expanding haematoma and vasogenic oedema inside the fixed volume of the cranial vault can lead to a precipitous increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) and fatal brain herniation syndromes. The principle of 'time is brain' also firmly applies to ICH; haematoma expansion occurs very earlyand independently predicts a poor outcome. The rapid delivery of a care bundle incorporating anticoagulation reversal, intensive blood pressure management and neurosurgery/critical care if required has been associated with a substantial improvement in 30-day case-fatality rates.

The overarching goals of acute management are to stabilise the patient to ensure they survive the initial insult, and to prevent secondary brain injury (figure 4). Patients with ICH may require immediate intensive care unit admission. Otherwise, all patients should be admitted to an acute stroke unit as soon as possible; the benefit is at least as great for patients with ICH as it is for those with ischaemic stroke. The general principles of acute care are the same as those for acute ischaemic stroke, as outlined in the first article in this series. Secondary prevention measures, cerebral small vessel disease and decisions regarding restarting antithrombotic therapy will be addressed in subsequent articles.

Figure 4
Schema of the time course and mechanisms of secondary brain injury in intracerebral haemorrhage, including intraventricular haemorrhage.

Management of the complications of ICH is a key focus of acute care. Raised ICP can result from the mass effect of the bleed or peri-haematomal oedema or from hydrocephalus. Although there is a lack of evidence to guide its management in ICH, measures used for raised ICP in other settings may help. These include raising the head of the bed to 30° (although without supportive evidence in acute stroke), mild sedation, analgesia and mannitol (or hypertonic saline, depending on cardiac and renal comorbidities). Intensive ICP monitoring is recommended in those with a GCS < 9, evidence of herniation or hydrocephalus. Corticosteroids are possibly associated with more harm than benefit when used for lowering ICP in ICH, so should not be used. Early-onset seizures are not uncommon, occurring in one in seven patients, with most occurring at or near the onset. Clinical seizures should be managed with antiseizure medications, but prophylactic treatment should not be offered routinely. Cortical involvement, age younger than 65 years, volume greater than 10 mL and early seizures within 7 days of ICH identify patients at higher risk of subsequent late seizure development.

### Medical management of intracerebral haemorrhage [^27109cfc]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

The global burden of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is enormous. Developing evidence-based management strategies for ICH has been hampered by its diverse aetiology, high case fatality and variable cooperative organisation of medical and surgical care. Progress is being made through the conduct of collaborative multicentre studies with the large sample sizes necessary to evaluate therapies with realistically modest treatment effects. This narrative review describes the major consequences of ICH and provides evidence-based recommendations to support decision-making in medical management.

### Management of acute intracranial and intraventricular hemorrhage [^0cdb52b2]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Acute intracranial hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage are devastating disorders. The goal of this review is to familiarize clinicians with recent information pertaining to the acute care of intracranial hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage.

Data Sources

PubMed search and review of the relevant medical literature.

Summary

The management of intracranial hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage is complex. Effective treatment should include strategies designed to reduce hematoma expansion and limit the medical consequences of intracranial hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage. At present, there are a number of new approaches to treatment that may reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes. Clinicians should recognize that patients with large hematomas may make a substantial recovery.

Conclusions

Patients with intracranial hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage should be cared for in an intensive care unit. New therapies designed to stabilize hematoma growth and reduce hematoma burden may improve outcomes.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^884a7e51]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Knowledge gaps and future research — antithrombotic therapy after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): In addition to the uncertainty of risk and benefit of anticoagulation in patients with AF and ICH, there is limited evidence for individual selection of optimal timing of anticoagulation resumption in patients for whom anticoagulation will be restarted, and ongoing trials and future studies with stratification based on ICH location, mechanism, and risk factors for recurrence may lead to more informative decisions. Most analyses evaluating the role of appropriate antithrombotic therapy in patients with ICH have focused on recurrent events, and future studies that incorporate outcomes such as disability or quality of life in addition to clinical events may provide information that is more patient-centric.

### Emerging approaches in the management of intracranial hemorrhage: ARISE II consensus recommendations [^a30e01ce]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in the fundamental understanding of the pathophysiology of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), many issues related to ICH management remain understudied with discrepancies in management. Given the high disease severity and prevalence, consensus recommendations are urgently needed to guide further research and management strategies. Thus, a group of clinical experts, industry leaders, and government representatives was assembled to examine emerging approaches in ICH management and their future impact on patient care. The timing of intervention within 24 hours and the role of minimally invasive evacuation, particularly for basal ganglia hemorrhage locations, were identified as key research focuses to guide future trial design. Mobile stroke units and artificial intelligence (AI) are promising technologies that streamline preoperative and triaging workflows and improve time to intervention. Efforts to further develop surgical technologies will be crucial to improve ICH visualization and evacuation. Further research, industry collaboration, and investment are needed to advance treatment frontiers and catalyze ICH research.

### Chinese stroke association guidelines for clinical management of cerebrovascular disorders: executive summary and 2019 update of clinical management of intracerebral haemorrhage [^6f8a008f]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) refers to the haemorrhage within the brain parenchyma, characterised with rapid onset, neurological deterioration and poor outcome. Cerebral haemorrhage accounts for 23.4% of patients who had stroke in China, of which 46% died or had severe disability within 1 year. According to the China's Health and family planning statistical yearbook 2017, the direct hospitalisation cost of cerebral haemorrhage patients in 2016 was 1.45 billion dollars, which caused heavy health, economic and social burden. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) has presented three versions of the guidelines for the management of spontaneous cerebral haemorrhage, and the latest version of the guidelines collected clinical evidence up to 2013. In the past 5 years, the clinical management of cerebral haemorrhage has made new progress. Early active and reasonable treatment may improve the clinical outcome of patients. The Chinese Stroke Association reviewed the research for the past 5 years across the world, making summary and recommendations. This guideline was drafted by relevant experts, applying to the management of patients with ICH (figure 1).

Figure 1
Flowchart of the management of patients with ICH. BP, blood pressure; ICH, intracerebral haemorrhage; IVH, intraventricular haemorrhage.

Recommendations follow the Chinese Stroke Association's methods of classifying the level of certainty of the treatment effect and the class of evidence, which are consistent with the system adopted by the latest AHA/ASA guidelines (as follows).

Classification of Recommendations Class I: there are confirmed evidence or unanimously agreement that the procedure or treatment given is effective. Class II: there are controversial evidence or disagreement regarding the effectiveness of procedure or treatment. IIa: some evidence or opinions support its effectiveness. IIb: there are no good evidence for its effectiveness. Class III: procedure or treatment is ineffective or harmful in some cases.
Level of Evidence Level of Evidence A: evidence comes from multiple randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or meta-analysis. Level of Evidence B: evidence comes from single RCT or non-randomised trial. Level of Evidence C: evidence only comes from experts' opinions, case studies and so on.

### Cerebrovascular disease… [^012abc1f]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Explore the latest in cerebrovascular disease, including recent guidelines and advances in management of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. This randomized clinical trial assesses the benefits of a cardiorespiratory exercise intervention on hippocampal volume and cognition when delivered to patients at 2 months after ischemic stroke. This secondary analysis of the Multi-Arm Optimization of Stroke Thrombolysis randomized clinical trial investigates if the addition of direct thrombin inhibitors or glycoprotein platelet inhibitors to intravenous thrombolysis in patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke improves reperfusion rates and/or clinical outcomes. A 34-year-old patient with a family history of stroke had right-sided headache, left upper extremity hemiparesis, and left hand numbness; magnetic resonance angiography showed bilateral narrowing of the terminal portion of the intracranial carotid arteries, more severe on the right.

What is the diagnosis and what would you do next. This Viewpoint reviews lessons learned from recent studies of thrombectomy for medium and distal vessel occlusion, and provides guidance for the path forward. This individual participant data meta-analysis determines the frequency and subtypes of intracranial hemorrhage in patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis plus endovascular treatment vs EVT alone and determines the association between various ICH subtypes and patient functional outcomes. This intervention study evaluates in utero embolization in fetuses with vein of Galen malformation. This randomized clinical trial examines the safety and efficacy of intravenous alteplase administered 4. 5 to 24 hours after stroke onset in patients with salvageable brain tissue. This cohort study assesses whether benefits of stroke center certification are equally experienced by Black and White patients with stroke.

This comparative effectiveness research study compares the risk of cardiovascular events after initiation of treatment with individual sulfonylureas or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors. This cohort study of female patients with cervical artery dissection examines whether future pregnancies are associated with increased risk of recurrent CeAD, stroke, or death. This phase 1 and 2 randomized clinical trial investigated both the safety threshold and efficacy of 3 different doses of tenecteplase when given by catheter to patients with large vessel occlusion stroke after successful endovascular thrombectomy. This randomized clinical trial examines the efficacy and safety of intra-arterial tenecteplase in patients with successful endovascular therapy.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^abbb2b3f]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

AHA/ASA intracerebral hemorrhage guideline — This guideline recommends development of regional systems that provide initial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) care and the capacity, when appropriate, for rapid transfer to facilities with neurocritical care and neurosurgical capabilities. Hematoma expansion is associated with worse ICH outcome, and there is now a range of neuroimaging markers that, along with clinical markers such as time since stroke onset and use of antithrombotic agents, help to predict the risk of hematoma expansion, including signs detectable by noncontrast computed tomography, the most widely used neuroimaging modality for ICH. ICHs, like other forms of stroke, occur as the consequence of a defined set of vascular pathologies, and this guideline emphasizes the importance of, and approaches to, identifying markers of both microvascular and macrovascular hemorrhage pathogeneses. When implementing acute blood pressure lowering after mild to moderate ICH, treatment regimens that limit blood pressure variability and achieve smooth, sustained blood pressure control appear to reduce hematoma expansion and yield better functional outcome.

Limiting life-sustaining treatments — The decision of when and how to limit life-sustaining treatments after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains complex and highly dependent on individual preference; the decision to assign do not attempt resuscitation status is entirely distinct from the decision to limit other medical and surgical interventions and should not be used to do so, and decisions to implement an intervention should be shared between the physician and patient or surrogate and should reflect the patient's wishes as best as can be discerned; baseline severity scales can be useful to provide an overall measure of hemorrhage severity but should not be used as the sole basis for limiting life-sustaining treatments.

### Acute intracerebral haemorrhage: diagnosis and management [^555c4db8]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

ICH has the worst outcomes of all stroke subtypes, but increased research interest in recent years has led to significant advances in its diagnosis and management. The focus of existing treatment is the prevention of haematoma expansion, and progress in supportive care, blood pressure control and anticoagulation reversal has been rewarded with improved outcome. The role of neurosurgery is still unclear but the field is rapidly evolving, with minimally invasive techniques showing promise in selected groups, even in the context of neutral trials so far.

Key points

Intracerebral haemorrhage is a medical emergency; its rapid diagnosis, investigation and treatment should prevent further brain injury and improve outcome.
Although 30-day case fatality is ~40%, full supportive care should be considered for at least the first 24–48 hours, as prognostication can be difficult.
Hyper-acute interventions such as anticoagulation reversal, blood pressure lowering and neurosurgery may improve recovery, but many uncertainties remain.
Clinical trials based on pathophysiological knowledge and embedded in routine clinical practice are the main hope for its better management.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) inpatient setting and neuromonitoring — Depending on the severity of hemorrhage, the appropriate inpatient setting may be an intensive care unit (ICU) with full critical care and intensive monitoring or a dedicated stroke unit, and patients with ICH can benefit from neuromonitoring by staff trained in neurological assessment. The highest-risk period for neurological decline is within the first 12 hours after the hemorrhage, with deterioration events becoming uncommon after 48 hours, and the ability to affect the patient's clinical course often rests on the ability to detect changes in the neurological examination accurately and consistently. Rehabilitation teams and specially trained nurses working together with physicians familiar with patients with ICH have been shown to improve outcomes and reduce mortality compared with a general medical ward.

### Intracerebral haemorrhage: current approaches to acute management [^9f8f6225]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage is a life-threatening illness of global importance, with a poor prognosis and few proven treatments. As a heterogeneous disease, certain clinical and imaging features help identify the cause, prognosis, and how to manage the disease. Survival and recovery from intracerebral haemorrhage are related to the site, mass effect, and intracranial pressure from the underlying haematoma, and by subsequent cerebral oedema from perihaematomal neurotoxicity or inflammation and complications from prolonged neurological dysfunction. A moderate level of evidence supports there being beneficial effects of active management goals with avoidance of early palliative care orders, well-coordinated specialist stroke unit care, targeted neurointensive and surgical interventions, early control of elevated blood pressure, and rapid reversal of abnormal coagulation.

### Update on management of intracerebral hemorrhage [^7288e538]. Neurosurgical Focus (2003). Low credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a lingering cause of significant mortality and morbidity rates in contemporary society. Despite its established burden, considerably less investigative attention has been devoted to the study of ICH than other forms of stroke. Only a limited number of clinical studies have been performed to examine the surgical (both craniotomy and minimally invasive) and medical management of patients with ICH. No consistently efficacious strategies have been identified through such investigations. Limitations in study design and execution have universally impaired the interpretation and impact of available data. Management of ICH unfortunately remains heterogeneous across institutions, and it continues to suffer from the lack of proven medical and surgical effectiveness. Urgently needed are further prospective randomized controlled trials in which investigators consider the shortcomings of previous endeavors in the management of ICH. In the present article the authors review the current management practices of ICH, discuss the controlled trials, and highlight recent trials and future avenues of further study.

### Intracerebral haemorrhage [^b0241a90]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Intracerebral haemorrhage is an important public health problem leading to high rates of death and disability in adults. Although the number of hospital admissions for intracerebral haemorrhage has increased worldwide in the past 10 years, mortality has not fallen. Results of clinical trials and observational studies suggest that coordinated primary and specialty care is associated with lower mortality than is typical community practice. Development of treatment goals for critical care, and new sequences of care and specialty practice can improve outcome after intracerebral haemorrhage. Specific treatment approaches include early diagnosis and haemostasis, aggressive management of blood pressure, open surgical and minimally invasive surgical techniques to remove clot, techniques to remove intraventricular blood, and management of intracranial pressure. These approaches improve clinical management of patients with intracerebral haemorrhage and promise to reduce mortality and increase functional survival.

Conclusion

Spontaneous ICH is a neurological emergency associated with high mortality and morbidity. Key management issues include prompt etiologic diagnosis, reversal of anticoagulation, consideration of surgical management, and control of blood pressure. The clinical scenario and local practice will influence choice of therapeutic environment. As of March 2016, there were 581 ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials evaluating therapeutic opportunities in ICH. Early prognostication should not be attempted except when clear signs of nonconfounded irreversible brain damage are present, such as an absence of brain stem reflexes.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — synopsis of BP targets and implementation: As a primary recommendation, lowering systolic BP (SBP) to a target range of 130 to 140 mm Hg is safe and may be reasonable in improving functional outcome in patients presenting with acute ICH of mild to moderate severity and SBP between 150 and 220 mm Hg. Initiating treatment as soon as possible and careful titration of BP-lowering therapy to ensure continuous smooth and sustained control of BP are recommended. Acute lowering of SBP to < 130 mm Hg in patients presenting with ICH and elevated BP is potentially harmful and should be avoided.

### Management of intracerebral hemorrhage: JACC focus seminar [^f0217774]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for a disproportionate amount of stroke-related morbidity and mortality. Although chronic hypertension and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are the underlying cerebral vasculopathies accounting for the majority of ICH, there are a broad range of potential causes, and effective management requires accurate identification and treatment of the underlying mechanism of hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging and vascular imaging techniques play a critical role in identifying disease mechanisms. Modern treatment of ICH focuses on rapid stabilization, often requiring urgent treatment of mass effect, aggressive blood pressure reduction and correction of contributing coagulopathies to achieve hemostasis. We discuss management of patients with ICH who continue to require long-term anticoagulation, the interaction of ICH with neurodegenerative diseases, and our approach to prognostication after ICH. We close this review with a discussion of novel medical and surgical approaches to ICH treatment that are being tested in clinical trials.

Should I pursue intensive treatment?

The focus for the great majority of patients should be on the full provision of high-quality active treatment and supportive care, at least in the first 24–48 hours. Decisions about instituting a ceiling of care should depend on an assessment of prognosis, but this is difficult to determine acutely. There are multiple dedicated ICH prognostic grading scales, the most widely used being the ICH score, which has acceptable discrimination for functional outcome measured by the modified Rankin score at up to 12 months (figure 1). Such scales should not be used, however, as the sole means to gauge prognosis or guide the withdrawal of supportive treatment.

Like other conditions with high rates of poor outcomes and a perceived lack of effective treatments, ICH is vulnerable to therapeutic nihilism. Early ceilings of care and a focus on comfort measures are more likely to be pursued acutely in ICH than in ischaemic stroke, independent of neurological deterioration and co-morbidities, and are associated with poorer outcome. While timely do-not-resuscitate orders are important considerations in stroke management, these should not influence other aspects of care. In practice, however, do-not-resuscitate orders in ICH often herald less active supportive care, so clinicians should be cautious when considering early do-not-resuscitate orders.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) and European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS) guideline on stroke due to spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage [^e4274a1d]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) affects ~3.4 million people worldwide each year, causing ~2.8 million deaths. Many randomised controlled trials and high-quality observational studies have added to the evidence base for the management of people with ICH since the last European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines for the management of spontaneous ICH were published in 2014, so we updated the ESO guideline. This guideline update was guided by the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) standard operating procedures for guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, in collaboration with the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS). We identified 37 Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) questions and prioritised clinical outcomes. We conducted systematic literature searches, tailored to each PICO, seeking randomised controlled trials (RCT) - or observational studies when RCTs were not appropriate, or not available - that investigated interventions to improve clinical outcomes. A group of co-authors allocated to each PICO screened titles, abstracts, and full texts and extracted data from included studies. A methodologist conducted study-level meta-analyses and created summaries of findings tables. The same group of co-authors graded the quality of evidence, and drafted recommendations that were reviewed, revised and approved by the entire group. When there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation, each group of co-authors drafted an expert consensus statement, which was reviewed, revised and voted on by the entire group. The systematic literature search revealed 115,647 articles. We included 208 studies. We found strong evidence for treatment of people with ICH on organised stroke units, and secondary prevention of stroke with blood pressure lowering. We found weak evidence for scores for predicting macrovascular causes underlying ICH; acute blood pressure lowering; open surgery via craniotomy for supratentorial ICH; minimally invasive surgery for supratentorial ICH; decompressive surgery for deep supratentorial ICH; evacuation of cerebellar ICH > 15mL; external ventricular drainage with intraventricular thrombolysis for intraventricular extension; minimally invasive surgical evacuation of intraventricular blood; intermittent pneumatic compression to prevent proximal deep vein thrombosis; antiplatelet therapy for a licensed indication for secondary prevention; and applying a care bundle. We found strong evidence against anti-inflammatory drug use outside of clinical trials. We found weak evidence against routine use of rFVIIa, platelet transfusions for antiplatelet-associated ICH, general policies that limit treatment within 24h of ICH onset, temperature and glucose management as single measures (outside of care bundles), prophylactic anti-seizures medicines, and prophylactic use of temperature-lowering measures, prokinetic anti-emetics, and/or antibiotics. New evidence about the management of ICH has emerged since 2014, enabling this update of the ESO guideline to provide new recommendations and consensus statements. Although we made strong recommendations for and against a few interventions, we were only able to make weak recommendations for and against many others, or produce consensus statements where the evidence was insufficient to guide clinical decisions. Although progress has been made, many interventions still require definitive, high-quality evidence, underpinning the need for embedding clinical trials in routine clinical practice for ICH.

### Acute care bundles should be used for patients with intracerebral haemorrhage: an expert consensus statement [^5ae1ee4c]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose:

Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is the most devastating form of stroke and a major cause of disability. Clinical trials of individual therapies have failed to definitively establish a specific beneficial treatment. However, clinical trials of introducing care bundles, with multiple therapies provided in parallel, appear to clearly reduce morbidity and mortality. Currently, not enough patients receive these interventions in the acute phase.

Methods:

We convened an expert group to discuss best practices in ICH and to develop recommendations for bundled care that can be delivered in all settings that treat acute ICH, with a focus on European healthcare systems.

Findings:

In this consensus paper, we argue for widespread implementation of formalised care bundles in ICH, including specific metrics for time to treatment and criteria for the consideration of neurosurgical therapy.

Discussion:

There is an extraordinary opportunity to improve clinical care and clinical outcomes in this devastating disease. Substantial evidence already exists for a range of therapies that can and should be implemented now.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association 2023 aSAH guideline — scope and coverage — addresses the diagnosis and treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) in adults and is intended to update and replace the AHA/ASA 2012 aSAH guideline. This 2023 guideline is limited explicitly to aSAH and does not address other types of SAH such as those caused by trauma, vascular malformation, or hemorrhage-prone neoplasm. It does not overlap with AHA/ASA guidelines or scientific statements on the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), arteriovenous malformations, and unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The document aims to cover the full course of aSAH from initial diagnosis, systems of care, and acute interventions to further inpatient care of post-aSAH complications, and it introduces new sections on nursing care and recovery. Risk factors for recurrent aSAH are addressed, whereas risk factors for aneurysm development and rupture and management of unruptured aneurysms are excluded because they are covered in a separate guideline. Emphases include shared decision-making, health equity, and systems of care, and some aspects of inpatient aSAH medical care and post-aSAH rehabilitation and recovery are likely to be similar between patients with aSAH and those with other types of stroke.

### The acute management of intracerebral hemorrhage: a clinical review [^827c2b6c]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease with high rates of mortality and morbidity. The major risk factors for ICH include chronic arterial hypertension and oral anticoagulation. After the initial hemorrhage, hematoma expansion and perihematoma edema result in secondary brain damage and worsened outcome. A rapid onset of focal neurological deficit with clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure is strongly suggestive of a diagnosis of ICH, although cranial imaging is required to differentiate it from ischemic stroke. ICH is a medical emergency and initial management should focus on urgent stabilization of cardiorespiratory variables and treatment of intracranial complications. More than 90% of patients present with acute hypertension, and there is some evidence that acute arterial blood pressure reduction is safe and associated with slowed hematoma growth and reduced risk of early neurological deterioration. However, early optimism that outcome might be improved by the early administration of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has not been substantiated by a large phase III study. ICH is the most feared complication of warfarin anticoagulation, and the need to arrest intracranial bleeding outweighs all other considerations. Treatment options for warfarin reversal include vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, and rFVIIa. There is no evidence to guide the specific management of antiplatelet therapy-related ICH. With the exceptions of placement of a ventricular drain in patients with hydrocephalus and evacuation of a large posterior fossa hematoma, the timing and nature of other neurosurgical interventions is also controversial. There is substantial evidence that management of patients with ICH in a specialist neurointensive care unit, where treatment is directed toward monitoring and managing cardiorespiratory variables and intracranial pressure, is associated with improved outcomes. Attention must be given to fluid and glycemic management, minimizing the risk of ventilator-acquired pneumonia, fever control, provision of enteral nutrition, and thromboembolic prophylaxis. There is an increasing awareness that aggressive management in the acute phase can translate into improved outcomes after ICH.

### Management of anticoagulant-related intracranial hemorrhage: an evidence-based review [^40a43111]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Management

There are several uncertainties in the management of AICH. These uncertainties include the lack of evidence and limited guidelines for using biological products and pharmacologic agents, and accurate, quick, and meaningful laboratory testing to evaluate the hemostatic system. Moreover, individual variation in response to therapy and the difficulty in assessing ongoing bleeding make it even more challenging to manage this clinical problem. One should also note that the mere correction of a laboratory parameter (that is, an ex vivo test) might not correlate with reversal of coagulopathy in vivo as often demonstrated by the expansion of AICH even after such correction. Given the emergent nature of AICH and their unpredictability, randomized clinical trials or even large cohort studies in this population are unlikely and recommendations regarding treatment strategies will continue to be based on case series and anecdotal experience.

### Acute care bundles should be used for patients with intracerebral haemorrhage: an expert consensus statement [^94390304]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is the most devastating form of stroke and a major cause of disability. Clinical trials of individual therapies have failed to definitively establish a specific beneficial treatment. However, clinical trials of introducing care bundles, with multiple therapies provided in parallel, appear to clearly reduce morbidity and mortality. Currently, not enough patients receive these interventions in the acute phase.

Methods

We convened an expert group to discuss best practices in ICH and to develop recommendations for bundled care that can be delivered in all settings that treat acute ICH, with a focus on European healthcare systems.

Findings

In this consensus paper, we argue for widespread implementation of formalised care bundles in ICH, including specific metrics for time to treatment and criteria for the consideration of neurosurgical therapy.

Discussion

There is an extraordinary opportunity to improve clinical care and clinical outcomes in this devastating disease. Substantial evidence already exists for a range of therapies that can and should be implemented now.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage can be a devastating disease, with an in-hospital mortality rate of up to 20%. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association 2023 Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Guidelines provide a comprehensive update to the 2012 Guidelines based on a systematic review of the intervening evidence. The guidelines are broad in scope, covering prehospital care, aneurysm treatment modality, medical complications, detection and treatment of delayed cerebral ischemia, and recovery. Here, we comment on salient aspects of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage care, compare these guidelines with the 2023 Neurocritical Care aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage guidelines, and review relevant updates.

Atraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage represents a small proportion of strokes, but is a true medical emergency that results in significant morbidity and mortality. Making the diagnosis can be challenging and misdiagnosis can result in devastating consequences. There are several time-dependent diagnostic and management considerations for emergency physicians and other frontline providers. This article reviews the most up-to-date literature on the diagnostic workup of subarachnoid hemorrhage, avoiding misdiagnosis, and initial emergency department management recommendations.

### Acute intracerebral haemorrhage: diagnosis and management [^c93b3ade]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

The management of ICH has not paralleled the dramatic advances in acute ischaemic stroke therapeutics driven by many large randomised controlled trials. Clinical trials in ICH face unique challenges; a less common and more severe on average condition with poorly understood pathophysiology results in a sizeable proportion of patients being ineligible. Aspiring to recruit every ICH survivor to at least one trial is the only way to resolve uncertainties and improve outcome. Fortunately, we have much about which to be optimistic. There are currently over 60 active recruiting (or soon-to-be recruiting) ICH trials, many focused on the possible interventions of haemostatic agents and surgical techniques, where much uncertainty persists.

### Diagnosis and management of subarachnoid haemorrhage [^4ed0108c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

While advancements in medical technology and treatment protocols have significantly improved outcomes, SAH remains a challenging condition with profound implications for patient care. The highly individualised nature of SAH, due to factors such as aneurysm location patient comorbidities, and pathophysiology underscores the importance of personalised treatment strategies. The incidence of multi-system complications further exemplifies the need for an interdisciplinary approach, which is critical for optimising patient outcomes.

As we continue to face these multifaceted challenges, there is a pressing need for ongoing research to refine existing treatment protocols and to develop new, innovative approaches to manage SAH. Future studies should aim to address the gaps in our understanding of SAH pathophysiology and to evaluate strategies that could mitigate the systemic inequities that currently limit the accessibility of optimal care.

The collaboration between neuroscientists, clinicians, and health policy experts will be crucial in this endeavour. The development of novel therapeutics and improved management techniques, backed by robust data collection and analysis, holds the promise of enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected by SAH.

### The critical care management of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage: a contemporary review [^2b208858]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is defined as nontraumatic bleeding into the brain parenchyma, which can extend into the ventricles and into the subarachnoid space. ICH is the second most common subtype of stroke, accounting for 10–50% of all cases, depending on the population, race, and region studied. According to the "Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors" report, there were 5.3 million cases and over 3.0 million deaths secondary to ICH worldwide in 2010. The case-fatality rate ranges from 35% at 7 days to 59% at 1 year. Half of fatal cases occur in the first 48 hours after presentation. Survivors are often left with severe disability, with less than 40% of patients regaining functional independence. The epidemiology of ICH may change in the future with better control of risk factors such as hypertension, but the use of newer anticoagulation therapies may influence the acute management and possibly prognosis of the disease.

ICH has been traditionally described as the subtype of stroke with the poorest prognosis. However, recent observational reports suggested that self-fulfilling prognostic pessimism may lead to withdrawal of life support in patients who otherwise may have had an acceptable clinical outcome if managed aggressively. Part of the pessimism surrounding the prognostication of hemorrhagic stroke is hypothesized to be a tendency not to consider factors such as age, previous comorbidities, etiology of the bleeding, and socioeconomic factors, which are known to affect outcome.

Knowledge gaps and future research — serial imaging after ICH: Routine serial CT after the initial scan, regardless of neurological status, to evaluate for ICH expansion, development of hydrocephalus, or brain swelling is not uncommon in clinical practice. Although the usefulness of this practice has been studied extensively in patients with ICH attributable to traumatic brain injury, there is a paucity of studies in patients with nontraumatic, spontaneous ICH. Future research should evaluate the cost/benefit implications of serial imaging after ICH and clarify the patient characteristics and conditions under which serial imaging should be considered.

### Pharmacist's guide to common intracranial bleeding terms and treatments [^e31eed1d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pharmacists care for patients with intracranial bleeding such as those with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or subdural hematoma (SDH), although these bleeding events are often generically termed "head bleed". This over-simplified term refers to a heterogeneous group of life-threatening intracranial hemorrhages, each with a distinctive etiology and treatment paradigm.

Data Sources

Common intracranial hemorrhage types were reviewed to identify the scope of this narrative review.

Study Selection and Data Abstraction

Relevant studies and guidelines pertinent to the selected topic were considered.

Data Synthesis

Various hemorrhage types such as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and SDH fall into the colloquialism of "head bleed". However, these and other hemorrhage types are radiographically distinct and often require different management strategies. Surgical management is helpful in some of these situations (SDH, SAH) and limited in scope for others (ICH). Pharmacotherapy for reversal of coagulopathy and treatment of elevated intracranial pressure may be considered similar across the spectrum of intracranial bleeding pathologies, while other factors such as seizure prophylaxis and blood pressure control depend on the bleeding type.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Differences in the need for surgical intervention, neurologic monitoring, cerebral perfusion changes, risk of seizure, optimal blood pressure, and other clinical characteristics make each type of intracranial bleeding unique.

Conclusions

Pharmacists should be aware of the differences in surgical and pharmacotherapy strategies among these intracranial hemorrhages to optimize care for this neurocritical care population.

### Complications of intracerebral haemorrhage [^9fb32549]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is the most devastating type of stroke and is a leading cause of disability and mortality. By contrast with advances in ischaemic stroke treatment, few evidence-based targeted treatments exist for ICH. Management of ICH is largely supportive, with strategies aimed at the limitation of further brain injury and the prevention of associated complications, which add further detrimental effects to an already lethal disease and jeopardise clinical outcomes. Complications of ICH include haematoma expansion, perihaematomal oedema with increased intracranial pressure, intraventricular extension of haemorrhage with hydrocephalus, seizures, venous thrombotic events, hyperglycaemia, increased blood pressure, fever, and infections. In view of the restricted number of therapeutic options for patients with ICH, improved surveillance is needed for the prevention of these complications, or, when this is not possible, early detection and optimum management, which could be effective in the reduction of adverse effects early in the course of stroke and in the improvement of prognosis. Further studies are needed to enhance the evidence-based recommendations for the management of this important clinical problem.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^49368561]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage intracranial pressure (ICP) management — Ventricular drainage should be performed in patients with ICH/IVH with hydrocephalus contributing to decreased level of consciousness. In patients with ICH with a GCS score ≤ 8, ICP monitoring and treatment might be considered to reduce mortality and improve outcomes. Hyperosmolar therapy may be considered for transiently reducing ICP, and corticosteroids should not be administered for the treatment of elevated ICP in the setting of ICH. ICP is typically measured by insertion of ICP monitors into the brain parenchyma or an EVD into the ventricles, though the indications for use of ICP monitoring are less clear.

### Management of raised intracranial pressure in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: time for a consensus? [^8e1c374c]. Neurosurgical Focus (2017). Low credibility.

Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a well-recognized phenomenon in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) that has been demonstrated to lead to poor outcomes. Despite significant advances in clinical research into aSAH, there are no consensus guidelines devoted specifically to the management of elevated ICP in the setting of aSAH. To treat high ICP in aSAH, most centers extrapolate their treatment algorithms from studies and published guidelines for traumatic brain injury. Herein, the authors review the current management strategies for treating raised ICP within the aSAH population, emphasize key differences from the traumatic brain injury population, and highlight potential directions for future research in this controversial topic.

### Clinical review: critical care management of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage [^2565b597]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage is by far the most destructive form of stroke. The clinical presentation is characterized by a rapidly deteriorating neurological exam coupled with signs and symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure. The diagnosis is easily established by the use of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Ventilatory support, blood pressure control, reversal of any preexisting coagulopathy, intracranial pressure monitoring, osmotherapy, fever control, seizure prophylaxis, treatment of hyerglycemia, and nutritional supplementation are the cornerstones of supportive care in the intensive care unit. Dexamethasone and other glucocorticoids should be avoided. Ventricular drainage should be performed urgently in all stuporous or comatose patients with intraventricular blood and acute hydrocephalus. Emergent surgical evacuation or hemicraniectomy should be considered for patients with large (> 3 cm) cerebellar hemorrhages, and in those with large lobar hemorrhages, significant mass effect, and a deteriorating neurological exam. Apart from management in a specialized stroke or neurological intensive care unit, no specific medical therapies have been shown to consistently improve outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Recommended primary outcomes for clinical trials evaluating hemostatic agents in patients with intracranial hemorrhage: a consensus statement [^22745007]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

In patients with acute spontaneous or traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, early hemostasis is thought to be critical to minimize ongoing bleeding. However, research evaluating hemostatic therapies has been hampered by a lack of standardized clinical trial outcome measures.

Objective

To identify appropriate primary outcomes for phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of therapies aimed at reducing acute intracranial bleeding.

Evidence Review

A comprehensive review of all previous clinical trials of hemostatic therapy for intracranial bleeding was performed, and studies measuring the frequency, risk factors, and association of intracranial bleeding with outcome of hemorrhage growth were included.

Findings

A hierarchy of 3 outcome measures is recommended, with the first choice being a global patient-centered clinical outcome scale measured 30 to 180 days after the event; the second, a combined clinical and radiographic end point associating hemorrhage expansion with a poor patient-centered outcome at 24 hours or later; and the third, a radiographic measure of hemorrhage expansion at 24 hours alone. Additional recommendations stress the importance of separating various subtypes of bleeding when possible, early treatment within a standardized treatment window, and the routine use of computerized planimetry comparing continuous measures of absolute and relative hemorrhage growth as either a primary or secondary end point.

Conclusions and Relevance

Standardization of outcome measures in studies of intracranial bleeding and hemostatic therapy will support comparative effectiveness research and meta-analysis, with the goal of accelerating the translation of research into clinical practice. The 3 outcome measures proposed in this consensus statement could help this process.

### The critical care management of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage: a contemporary review [^105f15fd]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), defined as nontraumatic bleeding into the brain parenchyma, is the second most common subtype of stroke, with 5.3 million cases and over 3 million deaths reported worldwide in 2010. Case fatality is extremely high (reaching approximately 60% at 1 year post event). Only 20% of patients who survive are independent within 6 months. Factors such as chronic hypertension, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and anticoagulation are commonly associated with ICH. Chronic arterial hypertension represents the major risk factor for bleeding. The incidence of hypertension-related ICH is decreasing in some regions due to improvements in the treatment of chronic hypertension. Anticoagulant-related ICH (vitamin K antagonists and the newer oral anticoagulant drugs) represents an increasing cause of ICH, currently accounting for more than 15% of all cases. Although questions regarding the optimal medical and surgical management of ICH still remain, recent clinical trials examining hemostatic therapy, blood pressure control, and hematoma evacuation have advanced our understanding of ICH management. Timely and aggressive management in the acute phase may mitigate secondary brain injury. The initial management should include: initial medical stabilization; rapid, accurate neuroimaging to establish the diagnosis and elucidate an etiology; standardized neurologic assessment to determine baseline severity; prevention of hematoma expansion (blood pressure management and reversal of coagulopathy); consideration of early surgical intervention; and prevention of secondary brain injury. This review aims to provide a clinical approach for the practicing clinician.

AHA/ASA 2022 intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — acute blood pressure (BP) lowering recommendations: In patients with spontaneous ICH of mild to moderate severity and systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 150 and 220 mm Hg, acute lowering of SBP to a target of 140 mm Hg with the goal of maintaining in the range of 130 to 150 mm Hg is safe and may be reasonable for improving functional outcomes. In patients with spontaneous ICH presenting with large or severe ICH or those requiring surgical decompression, the safety and efficacy of intensive BP lowering are not well established. In patients with spontaneous ICH of mild to moderate severity presenting with SBP > 150 mm Hg, acute lowering of SBP to < 130 mm Hg is potentially harmful.

### Guidelines for the neurocritical care management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^41d50869]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The neurointensive care management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is one of the most critical components contributing to short-term and long-term patient outcomes. Previous recommendations for the medical management of aSAH comprehensively summarized the evidence based on consensus conference held in 2011. In this report, we provide updated recommendations based on appraisal of the literature using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology.

Methods

The Population/Intervention/Comparator/Outcome (PICO) questions relevant to the medical management of aSAH were prioritized by consensus from the panel members. The panel used a custom-designed survey instrument to prioritize clinically relevant outcomes specific to each PICO question. To be included, the study design qualifying criteria were as follows: prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective or retrospective observational studies, case-control studies, case series with a sample larger than 20 patients, meta-analyses, restricted to human study participants. Panel members first screened titles and abstracts, and subsequently full text review of selected reports. Data were abstracted in duplicate from reports meeting inclusion criteria. Panelists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Risk of Bias tool for assessment of RCTs and the "Risk of Bias In Nonrandomized Studies - of Interventions" tool for assessment of observational studies. The summary of the evidence for each PICO was presented to the full panel, and then the panel voted on the recommendations.

Results

The initial search retrieved 15,107 unique publications, and 74 were included for data abstraction. Several RCTs were conducted to test pharmacological interventions, and we found that the quality of evidence for nonpharmacological questions was consistently poor. Five PICO questions were supported by strong recommendations, one PICO question was supported by conditional recommendations, and six PICO questions did not have sufficient evidence to provide a recommendation.

Conclusions

These guidelines provide recommendations for or against interventions proven to be effective, ineffective, or harmful in the medical management of patients with aSAH based on a rigorous review of the available literature. They also serve to highlight gaps in knowledge that should guide future research priorities. Despite improvements in the outcomes of patients with aSAH over time, many important clinical questions remain unanswered.

### Neurocritical care for intracranial haemorrhage: a systematic review of recent studies [^cae7a706]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is associated with significant early mortality (up to 50% at 30 days) and long-term morbidity (with permanent neurological deficits in 75–80% of patients) and represents a serious health issue worldwide. The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in clinical research on ICH diagnosis and treatment that has led to revision of the guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ICH from the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association in 2013. This systematic review reports recent clinical evidence (original studies published between September 2013 and July 2015) related to neurocritical care and intensive care unit management of patients with ICH. All but one publication included in this review report original studies related to managment of patients with intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage. These include insights on risk stratification and neurocritical care or intensive care unit treatment, management of haemodynamic variables and mechanical ventilation (goal-directed fluid therapy, advanced haemodynamic monitoring, and avoidance of hyperoxia and hyperventilation), and pharmacological neuroprotection.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage — shared decision-making with surrogates: many patients are unable to participate in goals-of-care discussions, and a shared decision-making model, in which clinicians ensure surrogates' understanding, listen to responses, and incorporate this information into decisions, is encouraged in critical care. One study found surrogate satisfaction was associated with greater use of a shared decision-making model, and despite limited level of evidence, shared decision-making can reasonably be considered good clinical practice.

### Advances in the management of intracerebral hemorrhage [^fb6acef0]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a major public-health problem worldwide. No proven treatments are available for this condition, which is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Only 20% of individuals who survive ICH are independent at 6 months. Hypertension, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and anticoagulation are known to be associated with such hemorrhages. No effective preventive therapies exist specifically for CAA-related ICH. The incidence of hypertension-related ICH might be decreasing in some populations with improvements in the treatment of hypertension; however, the incidence of anticoagulant-related ICH is increasing, as the use of anticoagulants rises. Many questions remain unanswered regarding the clinical management of ICH, although in the past 10 years completed medical and surgical clinical trials-examining hemostatic therapy, blood pressure control and/or hematoma evacuation-have refined our understanding of the goals of such management. Ongoing clinical trials, which have built on the lessons of past studies, hold promise for the development of effective, scientifically proven treatments for ICH. In this Review, we discuss clinical trials for ICH that have been completed in the past 10 years, the contributions of these studies to the clinical management of ICH, and the ongoing trials that might further improve clinical care.

Hypertension and ICH — rationale for aggressive BP control: Hypertension has a strong causal association with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and uncontrolled hypertension accounts for 73.6% of the global population-attributable risk for ICH; it is therefore critical to measure and identify uncontrolled hypertension after ICH and aggressively manage blood pressure (BP) to prevent recurrence.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for intracerebral hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to management of BP, AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AHA/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate treatment with a thiazide-type diuretic, ACEi, or ARB in patients with hypertension who have experienced an ICH to lower BP and reduce the risk of recurrent ICH.

Section 4: management of complications of ICH

Management of intracranial hypertension

Recommendations

4.1.1.1 Patients with Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8 points can be considered for intracranial pressure monitoring (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C).

4.1.1.2 Osmotic drugs and hyperventilation may be considered in patients with intracranial hypertension (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C).

4.1.1.3 It is reasonable to control intracranial pressure below 20 mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressure at the range of 50–70 mm Hg (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C).

4.1.2 The position of the head should be appropriately elevated (head of bed elevation to at least 30°) (Class I, Level of Evidence C).

4.1.3 Intravenous infusion of mannitol is recommended to reduce intracranial pressure, with individualised dosage and course of treatment. Cardiac and renal function and electrolyte levels should be closely monitored (Class I, Level of Evidence C).

4.1.4 Usage of furosemide, glycerol fructose and/or albumin may be combined when necessary (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B).

Hydrocephalus

Recommendation

External ventricular drainage is reasonable, especially when the patient's level of consciousness decreased (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B).

Secondary epilepsy

Recommendations

4.3.1 Patients with seizures should be given antiepileptic drugs (AED) (Class I, Level of Evidence A).

4.3.2 The use of AED for seizure prevention is not recommended (Class III, Level of Evidence B).

4.3.3 Patients with reduced consciousness and imaging findings of cerebral haemorrhage, continuous EEG monitoring is reasonable to determine whether they have epilepsy (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C).

Cardiac complications

Recommendation

ECG and cardiac enzyme measurement is reasonable after cerebral haemorrhage to screen for cardiac complications (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C).

Pulmonary infection and prevention

Recommendation

Swallowing test is recommended before oral feeding to decrease the risk of pneumonia (Class I, Level of Evidence B).

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for intracerebral hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to management of BP, AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AHA/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM 2025 guidelines recommend to consider titrating BP carefully in adult patients with acute spontaneous ICH requiring acute BP lowering to ensure smooth, nonlabile, and sustained control, avoiding peaks and large variability in SBP, to improve functional outcomes.
