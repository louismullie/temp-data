## Question

elevated lactate, from what

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes, pathophysiology, and management implications of elevated lactate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the causes of hyperlactatemia mechanistically. Then, I should verify the key clinical contexts where lactate meaningfully changes management, especially sepsis, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock. Next, I will examine medication-related causes, particularly metformin and NRTIs, and the thresholds and actions that warrant urgent intervention. After that, I should review organ-specific contributors such as liver failure and mesenteric ischemia. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and highlight pitfalls, including when lactate can be normal despite hypoperfusion and when non-shock causes predominate.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic framework. Elevated lactate arises from three broad mechanisms: increased production due to tissue hypoxia or hypermetabolic states, decreased clearance from hepatic or renal dysfunction, and altered cellular metabolism from drugs or toxins. I should double-check that this triad aligns with contemporary reviews and shock literature, which consistently describe type A hypoperfusion-driven, type B non-hypoxic, and clearance-impaired etiologies, with the liver responsible for roughly 70–75% of lactate clearance and kidneys for the remainder [^117QzUyt] [^1114zMju].

> Now, I will examine shock states, starting with sepsis and septic shock. Wait, let me verify the diagnostic thresholds: Sepsis-3 defines septic shock as sepsis with vasopressor requirement to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg and serum lactate > 2 mmol/L in the absence of hypovolemia, and emergency care pathways commonly use > 2 mmol/L as abnormal and > 4 mmol/L as high risk. Lactate is nonspecific but correlates with mortality and is recommended to be measured and trended to guide resuscitation, with repeat testing at about 2-hour intervals and a target of at least a 10% relative decline indicating improvement [^115A1XRf] [^114jA46a] [^115asmtM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about lactate being diagnostic for sepsis. I need to ensure we emphasize that lactate is neither sensitive nor specific for sepsis and must be interpreted in clinical context, which is why guidelines recommend lactate-guided resuscitation as an adjunct rather than a standalone diagnostic test, and why capillary refill time can be used as an additional perfusion marker in septic shock [^117DAB7u] [^11276ay2].

> Next, I should review cardiogenic shock. Let me consider the staging and prognostic use of lactate: the SCAI SHOCK classification uses lactate thresholds to anchor severity, with lactate > 2 mmol/L consistent with at least Stage C shock, and multiple consensus statements endorse lactate as a universal marker for diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis. Importantly, lactate can be normal in chronic heart failure with low cardiac index, so I need to check for dissociation between hemodynamics and lactate and integrate serial lactate with other markers like bicarbonate and end-organ function [^113QRdKX] [^115TePB4] [^115sSN7i].

> I will now examine medication-induced hyperlactatemia, with metformin as the prime example. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is rare but severe, typically presenting with lactate > 5 mmol/L, anion gap acidosis, and metformin levels > 5 mcg/mL; risk escalates with renal impairment, hepatic disease, hypoxia, sepsis, dehydration, older age, contrast exposure, surgery, and interacting drugs like topiramate, and management hinges on immediate drug cessation and prompt hemodialysis to clear metformin and correct acidosis; I should confirm that contemporary kidney guidelines still support metformin down to eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m² with individualized risk assessment, which they do [^116q9XRK] [^113dtbBd] [^112k3nLi].

> But wait, what if the patient is on NRTIs or other mitochondrial toxins? I need to check for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor–associated lactic acidosis, which is linked to mitochondrial toxicity; stavudine carries a prominent warning, and pediatric guidance highlights risk with propylene glycol diluents and certain combinations; presentation can be insidious with fatigue, GI symptoms, dyspnea, and neurologic findings, and management includes stopping the offending agent and supportive care with attention to thiamine and riboflavin status [^1165wKfC] [^115x5fkm] [^114dDjkk].

> Let me consider hepatic failure next. In acute liver failure, lactate elevation reflects both increased production and decreased clearance and is a poor prognostic marker. I should confirm that guidelines advise recognizing this and using lactate trends alongside clinical and laboratory markers to guide escalation, including consideration of renal replacement therapy to correct acidosis and metabolic derangements [^111dAKuu].

> I should double-check mesenteric ischemia, where lactate is notoriously unreliable early. The ESTES guideline advises not to use serum lactate to diagnose acute mesenteric ischemia because a normal value does not exclude the diagnosis; thus, a normal lactate cannot reassure against ischemia, and clinical suspicion must drive imaging and surgical consultation [^114bSyaU].

> Next, I should review oncologic and hypermetabolic states. Aggressive lymphomas can elevate serum lactate via tumor hypermetabolism even without infection; distinguishing sepsis-related from lymphoma-related hyperlactatemia is challenging, but concurrent LDH elevation supports a lymphoma source, and delays in recognizing tumor lysis or hypermetabolic lactate elevation can worsen outcomes; I need to ensure I correlate with LDH, clinical context, and infection workup before attributing lactate solely to sepsis [^114x3msM] [^112ZQAdV].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic approach. First, I should confirm the measurement validity and repeat lactate if the clinical picture is discordant, using venous sampling and trending at 2-hour intervals when elevated. Then, I should classify the likely mechanism by integrating hemodynamics, perfusion markers, organ function, and medications. Next, I should target the underlying cause with sepsis bundles, shock support, drug withdrawal, or disease-specific therapy. Finally, I should monitor lactate clearance as a dynamic marker of response while remembering that persistent elevation may indicate incomplete resuscitation or ongoing production or impaired clearance [^114jA46a] [^115asmtM] [^1114zMju].

> Hold on, I should verify key thresholds and actions to avoid missteps. In septic shock, lactate > 2 mmol/L contributes to the definition and should trigger aggressive resuscitation and trending. In metformin toxicity, lactate > 5 mmol/L with acidosis warrants immediate drug cessation and hemodialysis. In cardiogenic shock, lactate > 2 mmol/L aligns with SCAI Stage C and should prompt escalation and consideration of mechanical support. Conversely, a normal lactate does not exclude shock or ischemia, so I must not anchor on a single value [^115A1XRf] [^116q9XRK] [^115TePB4] [^114bSyaU].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address special populations and edge cases. In pediatrics, lactate trends can guide resuscitation but should be integrated with clinical assessment. In cirrhosis, lactate may be elevated due to impaired clearance and lower MAP targets are reasonable. In DKA, lactated Ringer's has been studied and may be acceptable in some protocols, but I should confirm local guidance and the primacy of treating the underlying metabolic derangement. And in LVAD patients, hemolysis can elevate LDH and confound lactate interpretation, so I should check for pump thrombosis when alarms and hemolysis markers rise [^115nsZBf] [^112G6DE3] [^111oFw6u] [^112pXgBS].

Elevated lactate reflects **increased anaerobic metabolism** from tissue hypoperfusion or hypoxia (type A) [^115A1XRf] or **impaired clearance** from hepatic dysfunction or mitochondrial toxicity (type B) [^117QzUyt]. Common causes include sepsis [^115A1XRf], shock, hypoxemia, ischemia, liver failure [^111dAKuu], and medications such as metformin [^116q9XRK] and NRTIs [^1165wKfC]. Lactate is a **nonspecific marker** of severity and risk [^113QRdKX]; interpret trends and the clinical context to guide management [^114jA46a].

---

## Pathophysiology of lactate elevation

Lactate is produced when pyruvate is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase under anaerobic conditions; under aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the Krebs cycle. Elevated lactate arises from **increased production** (anaerobic glycolysis) or **decreased clearance** (hepatic dysfunction, mitochondrial toxicity) [^1114zMju].

---

## Classification of lactic acidosis

Lactic acidosis is classified as **type A** (inadequate oxygen delivery or utilization) or **type B** (normal oxygen delivery, due to metabolic or clearance defects) [^1114zMju]:

| **Type** | **Mechanism** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| A | Inadequate oxygen delivery or utilization | - Sepsis <br/> - Shock <br/> - Hypoxemia <br/> - Severe anemia <br/> - CO poisoning [^115A1XRf] [^117QzUyt] |
| B | Normal oxygen delivery, impaired clearance or mitochondrial dysfunction | - Hepatic failure <br/> - Mitochondrial toxicity (NRTIs, metformin) <br/> - Malignancy <br/> - Thiamine deficiency [^111dAKuu] [^1165wKfC] [^116q9XRK] |

---

## Common clinical causes of elevated lactate

### Type A lactic acidosis (inadequate oxygen delivery or utilization)

- **Sepsis and septic shock**: Increased anaerobic metabolism from hypoperfusion and mitochondrial dysfunction [^notfound].
- **Shock states**: Hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and obstructive shock reduce oxygen delivery [^notfound].
- **Hypoxemia**: Respiratory failure, CO poisoning, and severe anemia increase anaerobic metabolism [^1114zMju].
- **Ischemia**: Mesenteric, limb, or cardiac ischemia causes local anaerobic glycolysis [^1114zMju].

---

### Type B lactic acidosis (normal oxygen delivery, impaired clearance or mitochondrial dysfunction)

- **Hepatic dysfunction**: Reduced lactate clearance from cirrhosis or acute liver failure [^111dAKuu].
- **Mitochondrial toxicity**: NRTIs, metformin, and propofol impair oxidative phosphorylation [^notfound].
- **Malignancy**: High glycolytic tumors (e.g. lymphoma, leukemia) increase lactate production [^114x3msM].
- **Thiamine deficiency**: Impairs pyruvate dehydrogenase, increasing lactate [^117QzUyt].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated lactate

Elevated lactate is a **nonspecific marker** of illness severity and mortality risk across settings, including sepsis, shock, trauma, and critical illness [^113QRdKX] [^114jA46a]. Serial lactate trends are more informative than single values and help assess response to therapy and prognosis [^112VuYTq].

---

## Diagnostic approach to elevated lactate

When lactate is elevated, use a structured approach:

- **Confirm measurement**: Ensure proper sampling and processing; repeat if questionable [^114jA46a].
- **Clinical context**: Assess for sepsis, shock, hypoxemia, ischemia, hepatic dysfunction, and medications [^117QzUyt].
- **Additional tests**: ABG, electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, glucose, and medication review [^115x5fkm].
- **Imaging**: Consider for ischemia, infection, or malignancy as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the **underlying cause**:

- **Type A**: Restore perfusion and oxygen delivery (fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, source control) [^notfound].
- **Type B**: Stop offending drugs, treat hepatic dysfunction, correct metabolic defects, and provide supportive care [^116q9XRK] [^111dAKuu].
- **Monitoring**: Track lactate trends to guide therapy and assess response [^112VuYTq].

---

Elevated lactate reflects increased production or impaired clearance; **identify the cause and treat it directly**, using lactate trends to monitor response and risk.

### Sepsis and septic shock [^115A1XRf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on sepsis and septic shock:

- Definition: According to the Sepsis-3 definition, sepsis is characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction (defined as an increase of ≥ 2 points from baseline in the SOFA score) caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome is no longer included in the definition of sepsis. Septic shock is defined as sepsis with profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, requiring vasopressor therapy to maintain a mean arterial pressure of ≥ 65 mmHg and serum lactate level > 2 mmol/L (> 18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia.
- Pathophysiology: The most common infectious pathogens responsible for the development of sepsis are S. aureus (20.5%), Pseudomonas species (19.9%), fungi (19%), E. coli (16.0%), Klebsiella species (12.7%), and Acinetobacter (9%).
- Epidemiology: In hospitalized adult patients, the incidence of sepsis is estimated at 6.0%.
- Disease course: In patients with sepsis, continued activation of immune cells in response to an infection result in a dysregulated inflammatory response. The coagulation system is closely tied to the inflammatory response, with cross talk between the two systems. These pathophysiological changes cause the clinical manifestations of organ dysfunction, which may progress to multiple organ failure, and death.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The overall mortality associated with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock is 10–20%, 20–50%, and 40–80%, respectively.

Lactate in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) — diagnostic accuracy data indicate that an elevated CSF lactate concentration of more than 3.5 to 4.2 mmol/L occurs more frequently in bacterial than in aseptic meningitis, and two large metaanalyses reported sensitivity of 93% and 97% and specificity of 96% and 94%, respectively. In healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis after neurosurgery, using a cutoff of 4 mmol/L was both sensitive (88%) and highly specific (98%), with positive predictive value 96% and negative predictive value 94%. In a prospective post-neurosurgical study, increased CSF lactate (≥ 4 mmol/L) had sensitivity 97%, specificity 78%, and a 97% negative predictive value. However, for CSF shunt–associated infection, if a cutoff of 4 mmol/L had been used, almost half of the infections would have been missed, and CSF lactate concentrations were normal in 20% of patients diagnosed with a shunt infection.

Bicarbonate therapy — recommendations in adults with septic shock: For hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidemia, we suggest against using sodium bicarbonate therapy to improve hemodynamics or to reduce vasopressor requirements (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence), and the narrative specifies this applies to pH ≥ 7.15. For severe metabolic acidemia (pH ≤ 7.2) with acute kidney injury (AKI) defined by AKI Network (AKIN) score 2 or 3, we suggest using sodium bicarbonate therapy (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Haloperidol lactate (haloperidol) [^111X7S46]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

Hyperpyrexia and heat stroke, not associated with the above symptom complex, have also been reported with haloperidol.

Neurological Adverse Reactions in Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies

Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies are reported to have an increased sensitivity to antipsychotic medication. Manifestations of this increased sensitivity with haloperidol treatment include severe extrapyramidal symptoms, confusion, sedation, and falls. In addition, haloperidol may impair the antiparkinson effects of levodopa and other dopamine agonists. Haloperidol is contraindicated in patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hypersensitivity Reactions

There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions with haloperidol. These include anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, dermatitis exfoliative, hypersensitivity vasculitis, rash, urticaria, face edema, laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Haloperidol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to this drug (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

### Neuroblastoma, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113gqzSf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Neuroblastoma — additional workup recommends that all patients undergo an H&P, with special attention given to the abdominal exam to evaluate for masses and organomegaly, as well as a thorough neurologic exam, and any family history of neuroblastoma or other childhood cancers should be noted. Essential laboratory tests include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel, and urine catecholamine levels — homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) — which are elevated in the majority of patients; analysis of urine HVA and VMA levels is required for diagnosis only if bone marrow is the only diagnostic tissue obtained. In selected cases, clinicians may consider obtaining the prothrombin (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) if the liver is involved or there is a concern for bleeding; pregnancy tests should be done for all patients of childbearing potential, and a referral to fertility specialists should be made for patients with high-risk disease to discuss possible options and timing for fertility preservation. Analysis of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin levels can be considered in select cases, and high levels of LDH and ferritin in patients with neuroblastoma have been associated with worse prognosis.

### 0.9% saline versus Ringer's lactate as initial fluid in children with diabetic ketoacidosis: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111oFw6u]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

The study Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA was published by Ashish Agarwal and colleagues in 2025 in the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetic ketoacidosis and Diabetes mellitus type 1. In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the trial question was: what is the effect of Ringer's lactate in children with T1DM mellitus who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis? In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the population was: 67 patients (44 female, 23 male). The inclusion criteria were children aged 9 months to 12 years with T1DM who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis. The key exclusion criteria were symptomatic cerebral edema; pre-existing/established CKD; underlying liver disorders; inborn errors of metabolism and serum potassium > 5.5 mEq/L at admission. In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the interventions were: n = 33 Ringer's lactate (Ringer's lactate as initial fluid for resuscitation and replacement) n = 34 saline (0.9% saline as initial fluid for resuscitation and replacement). In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in time to resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis (12.9 hours vs. 16.8 hours; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.8). In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in rise in chloride level at 8 hours (4.4 mmol/L vs. 10.8 mmol/L; MD -6.4, 95% CI -10.7 to -2.1) Significant increase in rise in bicarbonate level at 12 hours (14.7 mmol/L vs. 12.9 mmol/L; MD 1.8, 95% CI 0.3 to 3.3) No significant difference in hypokalemia (45.5% vs. 61.8%; RR 0.74, 95% CI -0.34 to 1.82). In the Lactated Ringer's vs. Saline in DKA study, the conclusion was: in children aged 9 months to 12 years with T1DM who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis, Ringer's lactate was superior to saline with respect to time to resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Metformin hydrochloride (Glumetza) [^111a5BUv]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the full prescribing information [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Drug Interactions (7)].

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue GLUMETZA and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### SCAI door to lactate clearance (SCAI DLC) cardiogenic shock initiative: definition, hypothesis, and call to action [^1114zMju]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2025). High credibility.

Pathophysiology of lactate in cardiogenic shock (CS) — production, clearance, and classification: Lactic acid is produced at low levels by multiple tissues and increases with hypoxemia or tissue hypoperfusion; under hypoxia, glycolysis generates pyruvate that is reduced by L‑lactate dehydrogenase to lactate, and adrenergic stress can accelerate glycolysis. Lactate clearance (LC) occurs primarily through the liver — accounting for approximately 70% to 75% — with the remaining 25% to 30% cleared by the kidneys and urinary excretion playing only a minor role in clearance (< 10%). The historic classification of lactic acidosis divides the condition into 2 categories: type A (inadequate tissue perfusion or oxygenation resulting in excess lactate production) and type B (adequate perfusion with increased production, reduced clearance, or both).

### Dapagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Xigduo) [^111xpXvs]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

There have been post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by non‑specific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of XIGDUO XR.

In XIGDUO XR-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.

### Metformin hydrochloride (Fortamet) [^114k4a96]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Lactic Acidosis:

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic
complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with
FORTAMET (metformin hydrochloride) Extended-Release
Tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic
acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic
conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant
tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated
blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/ L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte
disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate
ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin
plasma levels > 5 μg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients
receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000
patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years).
Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant
renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal
hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/ surgical
problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart
failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or
acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia,
are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases
with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic
acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of
renal function in patients taking FORTAMET (metformin
hydrochloride) Extended-Release Tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose
of FORTAMET. In particular, treatment of the elderly
should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. FORTAMET treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of
age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function
is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic
acidosis. In addition, FORTAMET should be promptly
withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia,
dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly
limit the ability to clear lactate, FORTAMET should
generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic
disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either
acute or chronic, when taking FORTAMET, since alcohol
potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In
addition, FORTAMET should be temporarily discontinued
prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure
(see also PRECAUTIONS).

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^112G6DE3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) hemodynamics and monitoring specify that in patients without cirrhosis, septic shock is identified by the need for vasopressor support to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ≥ 65 mm Hg and serum lactate level ≥ 2 mmol/L (> 18 mg/dl) in the absence of hypovolemia; in patients with cirrhosis, a MAP goal of ≥ 60 mm Hg, rather than 65 mm Hg, is recommended while specific targets for ventricular filling pressure, volume, lactate, or central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) cannot be recommended; placement of an arterial line and central venous access in circulatory shock is highly recommended, echocardiography is the preferred modality for monitoring fluid status, central venous pressure monitoring may be inaccurate because of ascites, monitoring of abdominal pressures using a bladder catheter is not recommended routinely, careful large-volume paracentesis is recommended in patients with tense ascites, and serum lactate may be elevated due to impaired hepatic clearance or tissue hypoxia and in hemodynamically unstable patients elevation in serum lactate suggests tissue hypoxia.

Resuscitation targets — lactate and capillary refill time: For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest guiding resuscitation to decrease serum lactate in patients with elevated lactate level, over not using serum lactate (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), noting that during acute resuscitation serum lactate should be interpreted in clinical context and other causes of elevation. For adults with septic shock, we suggest using capillary refill time to guide resuscitation as an adjunct to other measures of perfusion (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### SCAI door to lactate clearance (SCAI DLC) cardiogenic shock initiative: definition, hypothesis, and call to action [^112VuYTq]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2025). High credibility.

Lactate elevation and clearance — marker of shock trajectory in cardiogenic shock are associated with outcomes across studies. In AMI-CS, a secondary registry analysis in 217 patients reported baseline lactate and lactate at 6, 12, and 24 hours as strong predictors of 30-day mortality, and a 30% relative reduction in lactate at 24 hours after intensive care unit admission predicted improved survival. In IABP-SHOCK II, lactate wash-in was the strongest predictor of mortality with an optimal cut-off value of 3.1 mmol/L. In DOREMI, complete clearance of lactate, percentage lactate clearance, and percentage lactate clearance per hour were independent predictors of survival, with complete lactate clearance emerging as the strongest predictor. As cadence context from sepsis literature, authors recommended measuring lactate every 2 hours in patients with septic shock.

### EACTS / STS / AATS guidelines on temporary mechanical circulatory support in adult cardiac surgery [^1126L8Si]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Lactate and pH — monitoring and prognostication in CS: Lactate is produced in many tissues in response to tissue ischaemia and serves as a non-specific marker of poor perfusion; elevated lactate levels correlate with increased mortality in patients with CS not receiving tMCS and there is universal support for the use of lactate as a diagnostic and prognostic marker, including evaluation for monitoring response to tMCS. Rising lactate levels are associated with higher mortality, suggesting that early initiation of tMCS is warranted to reduce risk; two retrospective studies demonstrated that lactate > 15 mmol/L was associated with 100% mortality, yet due to variability in published data no definitive lactate threshold for futility can be established, and metabolic markers (eg, lactate and pH) and end-organ markers (eg, creatinine and liver enzymes) should be interpreted together with clinical factors such as age.

### Sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride (Zituvimet XR) [^113s2xcK]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of ZITUVIMET XR. In ZITUVIMET XR-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.

### Glyburide and metformin [^113RoWJr]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Less frequently, symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), such as lightheadedness, dizziness, shakiness, or hunger may occur. The risk of hypoglycemic symptoms increases when meals are skipped, too much alcohol is consumed, or heavy exercise occurs without enough food. Following the advice of your doctor can help you to avoid these symptoms.

9. Are there any serious side effects that glyburide and metformin can cause?

People who have a condition known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and who take glyburide and metformin may develop hemolytic anemia (fast breakdown of red blood cells). G6PD deficiency usually runs in families. Tell your doctor if you or any members of your family have been diagnosed with G6PD deficiency before you start taking glyburide and metformin.

Glyburide and metformin rarely cause serious side effects. The most serious side effect that glyburide and metformin can cause is called lactic acidosis.

10. What is lactic acidosis and can it happen to me?

Lactic acidosis is caused by a buildup of lactic acid in the blood. Lactic acidosis associated with metformin is rare and has occurred mostly in people whose kidneys were not working normally. Lactic acidosis has been reported in about one in 33,000 patients taking metformin over the course of a year. Although rare, if lactic acidosis does occur, it can be fatal in up to half the cases.

### Dapagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Xigduo) [^111qx3ZA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Age 65 or Greater: The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Radiological Studies with Contrast: Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop XIGDUO XR at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart XIGDUO XR if renal function is stable.

Surgery and Other Procedures: Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. XIGDUO XR should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.

Hypoxic States: Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue XIGDUO XR.

Excessive Alcohol Intake: Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving XIGDUO XR.

Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of XIGDUO XR in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (5.1)
Peritonitis: Initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy (5.1)
Monitor for lactic acidosis in patients at risk (5.2)
Monitor for electrolyte, fluid, and nutrition imbalances (5.4)

5.1 Peritonitis and Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis

Peritonitis has been associated with DIANEAL peritoneal dialysis solution use. Following use, inspect the drained fluid for the presence of fibrin or cloudiness, which may indicate the presence of peritonitis. Improper clamping or priming sequence may result in infusion of air into the peritoneal cavity, which may result in abdominal pain and/or peritonitis. If peritonitis occurs, treat with appropriate therapy.

Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis (EPS), sometimes fatal, is a complication of peritoneal dialysis therapy and has been reported in patients using DIANEAL solutions.

5.2 Lactic Acidosis

Monitor patients with conditions known to increase the risk of lactic acidosis [e.g., severe hypotension or sepsis that can be associated with acute renal failure, hepatic failure, inborn errors of metabolism, and treatment with drugs such as nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)] before the start of treatment and during treatment with lactate-based peritoneal dialysis solutions. Use of DIANEAL solutions in patients with severe lactic acidosis is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3 Overinfusion

Overinfusion of peritoneal dialysis solution volume into the peritoneal cavity may be characterized by abdominal distention, feeling of fullness and/or shortness of breath. Drain the peritoneal dialysis solution from the peritoneal cavity to treat overinfusion.

5.4 Electrolyte, Fluid, and Nutrition Imbalances

Peritoneal dialysis may affect a patient's protein, water-soluble vitamin, potassium, bicarbonate, calcium, and magnesium levels and volume status. Monitor hematology, electrolytes, blood chemistry and fluid status periodically and take appropriate clinical action.

Potassium is omitted from DIANEAL solutions because dialysis may be performed to correct hyperkalemia. In situations where there is a normal serum potassium level or hypokalemia, addition of potassium chloride (up to a concentration of 4 mEq/L) to the solution may be necessary to prevent severe hypokalemia. Monitor fluid status to avoid hyper- or hypovolemia and potentially severe consequences including congestive heart failure, volume depletion and hypovolemic shock.

5.5 Hyperglycemia

DIANEAL solutions contain dextrose and may increase the risk for hyperglycemia in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. Patients may require initiation or modification of antidiabetic therapy during treatment with DIANEAL solutions. Monitor blood glucose.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation / Heart Failure Society of America guideline on acute mechanical circulatory support [^115sSN7i]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Cardiogenic shock — biomarkers and organ dysfunction for diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis are summarized: Elevated arterial lactate levels are nonspecifically indicative of tissue hypoxia and are associated with mortality in CS. A peripheral oxygen demand–delivery mismatch will result in low central venous oxygen measurements, and serial measurements of arterial lactate and mixed venous oxygen saturation levels may be helpful to temporally monitor responses to therapeutic interventions. In acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac troponin is noted to be elevated and has a rise-and-fall pattern consistent with acute ischemic injury, whereas N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was not associated with short-term mortality in multivariable analysis in CS. Acute kidney injury with a rise in serum creatinine and a potential reduction in urinary output is associated with poor outcomes, and acute ischemic or congestive liver injury with marked transaminase, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase elevations and increased prothrombin time is linked to higher risk, with these patients having a 2.5-fold higher 30-day mortality than patients without acute liver injury. A paradigm change has expanded the pathophysiology in CS to include activation of a systemic inflammatory response, and classical inflammatory markers such as neutrophils have been associated with mortality in these patients.

### Glyburide and metformin [^112JrXzC]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Lactic Acidosis

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with glyburide and metformin; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Glyburide and metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, glyburide and metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, glyburide and metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking glyburide and metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).

Lactic Acidosis

Lactic acidosis is a serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride and it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia.

Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride treatment should not be initiated in any patient unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin, because alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.10, 5.11, 5.12, 5.13)]. Use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis may frequently cause dose-dependent metabolic acidosis and may exacerbate the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

### Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride [^1132N51y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- Surgery and other procedures — Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.

- Hypoxic states — Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets.

- Excessive Alcohol intake — Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients, therefore, should be warned against excessive alcohol intake, acute or chronic, while receiving Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets.

- Hepatic impairment — Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

Hypoglycemia

Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets are capable of producing hypoglycemia; therefore, proper patient selection, dosing, and instructions are important to avoid potential hypoglycemic episodes. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents or ethanol. Renal insufficiency may cause elevated drug levels of both glipizide and metformin hydrochloride. Hepatic insufficiency may increase drug levels of glipizide and may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of hypoglycemic reactions. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly and people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.

Before using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: severe breathing problems (such as obstructive lung disease, severe asthma), metabolic acidosis (such as diabetic ketoacidosis), blood problems (such as anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency), kidney disease, liver disease. Before having surgery or any X-ray/scanning procedure using injectable iodinated contrast material, tell your doctor that you are taking this medication. You will need to temporarily stop this medication before the time of your surgery/procedure. Consult your doctor for further instructions. Before having surgery, tell your doctor or dentist about all the products you use (including prescription drugs, nonprescription drugs, and herbal products). You may experience blurred vision, dizziness, or drowsiness due to extremely low or high blood sugar levels. Do not drive, use machinery, or do any activity that requires alertness or clear vision until you are sure you can perform such activities safely. Limit alcohol while using this medication because it can increase your risk of lactic acidosis and developing low blood sugar. High fever, "water pills" (diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide), too much sweating, diarrhea, or vomiting may cause loss of too much body water (dehydration) and increase your risk of lactic acidosis. Stop taking this medication and tell your doctor right away if you have prolonged diarrhea or vomiting. Be sure to drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration unless your doctor directs you otherwise. It may be harder to control your blood sugar when your body is stressed (such as due to fever, infection, injury, or surgery). Consult your doctor because increased stress may require a change in your treatment plan, medications, or blood sugar testing. Older adults may be a greater risk for side effects such as low blood sugar or lactic acidosis. During pregnancy, this medication should be used only when clearly needed. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor. Your doctor may direct you to use insulin instead of this product during your pregnancy. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully. Metformin can cause changes in the menstrual cycle (promote ovulation) and increase the risk of becoming pregnant. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about the use of reliable birth control while using this medication. Metformin passes into breast milk in small amounts. Consult your doctor before breast-feeding.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin‑associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.
If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of RIOMET. In RIOMET treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.
Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue RIOMET and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.
For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:
Before initiating RIOMET, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
RIOMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4)].
Initiation of RIOMET is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking RIOMET. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.
In patients taking RIOMET whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.
Renal impairment — The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.
The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:
Before initiating RIOMET, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
RIOMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4)].
Initiation of RIOMET is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking RIOMET. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.
In patients taking RIOMET whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.
Drug interactions — The concomitant use of RIOMET with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].
Age 65 or greater — The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.
Radiologic studies with contrast — Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop RIOMET at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart RIOMET if renal function is stable.
Surgery and other procedures — Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. RIOMET should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.
Hypoxic states — Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue RIOMET.
Excessive alcohol intake — Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving RIOMET.
Hepatic impairment — Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of RIOMET in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

High-Flow/High-Power (or High-Watt) alarms — The differential diagnosis for high-power alarms includes impeller thrombosis, systemic arterial vasodilatation (sepsis syndrome versus a medication effect), or significant continuous aortic regurgitation (AR). Pump dysfunction can be caused by malfunction of a mechanical component, but it is more commonly caused by partial thrombosis of the impeller in continuous-flow (CF) LVADs, and any condition that impedes the impeller rotation results in increased LVAD power consumption. In partial impeller thrombosis with high power consumption, the displayed high flow is a calculated and results in a false estimate of high flow, with actual flow typically equivalent to baseline flow or actually decreased. Clinical features associated with pump thrombosis include hemolysis characterized by hemoglobinuria along with elevated lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, and serum free hemoglobin levels, and on echocardiography primary pump dysfunction secondary to thrombosis may manifest as signs of reduced LV unloading compared with the previous surveillance exam.

Off-label pharmacotherapy — metformin is associated with modest weight loss that has been well documented when used to treat patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), pre-diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and it has also been shown to cause weight loss in patients without DM with antipsychotic-induced weight gain. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), reductions have persisted for 10 years or more and the most important influence on both weight loss and maintenance is adherence to metformin therapy; additional data are needed for the use of metformin for weight loss in patients without the aforementioned conditions. Metformin is generally safe, though the risk of lactic acidosis (boxed warning) must be considered.

Hepatic Impairment

Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of KAZANO in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

5.2 Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis has been reported in the postmarketing setting and in randomized clinical trials. In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, acute pancreatitis was reported in 6 (0.2%) patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 2 (< 0.1%) patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), acute pancreatitis was reported in 10 (0.4%) patients treated with alogliptin and in 7 (0.3%) patients treated with placebo.

It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for pancreatitis while using KAZANO.

After initiation of KAZANO, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, alogliptin should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated.

Blood lactate — use of trends to guide resuscitation: We suggest using trends in blood lactate levels, in addition to clinical assessment, to guide resuscitation of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In children with an elevated blood lactate, repeat testing that reveals a persistent elevation in blood lactate may indicate incomplete hemodynamic resuscitation and should prompt efforts to further promote hemodynamic stability. Pediatric evidence includes one observational study of lactate-guided resuscitation that included 77 children with sepsis in the ED, in which lactate normalization was associated with a decreased risk of persistent organ dysfunction (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29–0.73 and adjusted RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29–0.78); indirect adult evidence includes six RCTs with a total of 1,007 patients evaluating lactate-guided resuscitation of patients with septic shock.

BOXED WARNING

WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin­-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin­-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), (2.7), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride (Kombiglyze) [^111Wyvyn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of KOMBIGLYZE XR.

In KOMBIGLYZE XR-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^1115wEis]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Recognizing sepsis and septic shock in the first minutes to hours of care — sepsis is a confirmed or suspected infection with new or worsening organ dysfunction and dysregulated host response to infection and is not defined by a single datum or finding. Septic shock exists in a subset of sepsis patients with circulatory dysfunction and confers higher mortality; it has a spectrum from hypotension alone to hypotension requiring vasopressor support with an elevated blood lactate level after initial sepsis resuscitation, and septic shock is a severe form of sepsis with cardiovascular dysfunction, usually manifested as hypotension. All patients with impaired cardiovascular function from sepsis are best managed with early detection and prompt treatment. Because sepsis detection can be difficult and the differential diagnosis is often broad, any guideline or care pathway or bundle must accommodate this and guidance is most applicable when the diagnosis of sepsis is established; accurate diagnosis may require advanced or repeated testing and observation to distinguish it from other causes of acute illness. Sepsis is a clinical diagnosis based on a dysregulated response to an infection, and a specific pathogen does not need to be identified for a patient to have sepsis.

### Elevated serum lactate in lymphoma: not always infection… [^114x3msM]. ASCO (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract e19039 Background: In patients with lymphoma, lactate dehydrogenase is an important prognostic marker. Serum lactate can also be elevated due to hypermetabolism from aggressive lymphoma. We have observed critically ill lymphoma patients with elevated serum lactate who had a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of their underlying lymphoma because the cause of the elevated lactate was presumed to be infection. This clinical observation led us to perform a study to evaluate the relationship between serum lactate and LDH levels in lymphoma patients. Methods: We used the Mayo Clinic Lymphoma Database to search for patients with lymphoma and elevated lactate during a recent two year time period, January 2014 through December 2015. Fifty patients met these initial criteria and underwent medical chart review.

The patients were divided into two groups – those with documented infection and those without infection where the elevated lactate was due to lymphoma hypermetabolism. The Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the SepsisLA and LymLA groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate survival. Results: The mean age of the 66 patients was 65 ± 14. 8 years and 60% were male. At the time of presentation, the mean lactate and LDH values were 4. 5 ±
2. 81mmol/L and 835. 1 ±
1741. 4 U/L, respectively. 64% of patients had elevated LDH values. After review, 32 patients were in the SepsisLA group; 18 were in the LymLA group. DLBCL was the most common disease type in both the SepsisLA and LymLA.

Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the level of lactate elevation is not helpful indiscriminating SepsisLA vs LymLA; however an elevated LDH with elevated lactate is more likely LymLA. Lymphoma pts with LymLA had an inferior survival compared to SepsisLA. We are unable to define the true incidence and prognostic value of elevated serum lactate in lymphoma; this will require a prospective study with fresh samples.

• 

For treatment-experienced pregnant women during the second or third trimester, when REYATAZ is coadministered with either an H 2-receptor antagonist or tenofovir, REYATAZ 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily is recommended. There are insufficient data to recommend a REYATAZ dose for use with both an H 2-receptor antagonist and tenofovir in treatment-experienced pregnant women.

• 

No dosage adjustment is required for postpartum patients. However, patients should be closely monitored for adverse events because atazanavir exposures could be higher during the first 2 months after delivery [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.5) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

Maternal Adverse Reactions

Cases of lactic acidosis syndrome, sometimes fatal, and symptomatic hyperlactatemia have occurred in pregnant women using REYATAZ in combination with nucleoside analogues, which are associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis syndrome.

Hyperbilirubinemia occurs frequently in patients who take REYATAZ [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)], including pregnant women [see DATA].

Advise pregnant women of the potential risks of lactic acidosis syndrome and hyperbilirubinemia.

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

All infants, including neonates exposed to REYATAZ in utero, should be monitored for the development of severe hyperbilirubinemia during the first few days of life [see DATA].

Lactate — initial ED testing, thresholds, and repeat strategy are specified as follows: We support initially measuring blood lactate levels in the ED (venous or arterial) and repeating lactate measurement after initial resuscitation only if elevated above 4 mmol/L or if there is suspicion of clinical deterioration, and we endorse the use of venous lactate specimens. Convenient thresholds used to note abnormal elevation are more than 2.0 mmol/L and more than 4.0 mmol/L; the most convincing data of benefit from repeat measurements studied those with an initial lactate level of at least 4 mmol/L, with a common practice of measuring lactate in 2-hour intervals and using a 10% relative decline between measurements to indicate improvement. Blood lactate level is not a specific diagnostic test for sepsis, and elevations correlate with a higher risk of short-term mortality.

We recommend temporary discontinuation of potentially nephrotoxic and renally excreted drugs in people with a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2 (GFR categories G3a-G5) who have serious intercurrent illness that increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers (including ACE-Is, ARBs, aldosterone inhibitors, direct renin inhibitors), diuretics, NSAIDs, metformin, lithium, and digoxin (1C). We recommend that adults with CKD seek medical or pharmacist advice before using over-the-counter medicines or nutritional protein supplements (1B), and we recommend not using herbal remedies in people with CKD (1D). For metformin, we recommend that it be continued in people with GFR ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73 m^2 (GFR categories G1-G3a); its use should be reviewed in those with GFR 30–44 ml/min/1.73 m^2 (GFR category G3b); and it should be discontinued in people with GFR < 30 ml/min/ 1.73 m^2 (GFR categories G4-G5) (1C). We recommend that all people taking potentially nephrotoxic agents such as lithium, aminoglycosides, and calcineurin inhibitors should have their GFR, electrolytes and drug levels regularly monitored (1A). The US Food and Drug Administration black-box warning for metformin states it is contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL in men and ≥ 1.4 mg/dL in women, and it is now recognized that the risk for lactic acidosis in patients on metformin is extremely low.

WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin­ associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin­ associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), (2.7), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Warnings Section

Lactic Acidosis:

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).

### Lactic acidosis… [^112ojxts]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

ALTHOUGH endogenous lactic acid has been recognized as a source of metabolic acidosis for many years in a variety of situations, 1–5 it was not until the publication by Huckabee of his clinical observations of the significance of lactic acid acidosis 6, 7 that great interest was stimulated in this condition. The demonstration that severe metabolic acidosis, frequently of fatal outcome, was a significant clinical problem has led to the increasing recognition of this situation in clinical practice. 5, 8–17. The definition of lactic acidosis remains arbitrary. Since the production of lactate is always accompanied by an equivalent appearance of hydrogen ion, significant elevation in blood lactate must be interpreted as lactic acidosis regardless of resultant arterial pH or bicarbonate levels.

Qualifying factors include the degree of compensation for the metabolic acidosis, represented by arterial pH, eventual outcome, the presence or absence of clinical symptoms of metabolic acidosis. TRANQUADA RE, GRANT WJ, PETERSON CR. Lactic Acidosis. Arch Intern Med. 1966; 117: 192–202.

Metformin

Lactic acidosis is a serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with JENTADUETO and is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels of > 5 µg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin is approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, (with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal impairment, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia due to unstable or acute failure, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in any patient unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids. Use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis may cause dose-dependent metabolic acidosis and may exacerbate the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Antiretroviral therapy–associated lactic acidosis — agents, onset, presentation, and adult risk factors are summarized as follows: Associated antiretrovirals include NRTIs with ZDV, and lactic acidosis is less likely with 3TC, FTC, ABC, TAF, and TDF, and 3TC, FTC, ABC, TAF, and TDF are less likely to induce clinically significant mitochondrial dysfunction than ZDV. Onset is generally after years of exposure, with a few cases reported shortly after initiation in people with underlying liver disease. Presentation ranges from clinically asymptomatic to insidious combinations of generalized fatigue, weakness, myalgias, and vague abdominal pain, weight loss, unexplained nausea, or vomiting. Adult risk factors include female sex, high BMI, chronic HCV infection, African American race, coadministration of TDF with metformin, overdose of propylene glycol, CD4 count < 350 cells/mm3, acquired riboflavin or thiamine deficiency, possible pregnancy, and overdose in setting of renal insufficiency including a case of ARV-associated new-onset renal insufficiency (TDF/FTC plus DRV/c).

to metformin accumulation during treatment with GLUCOVANCE (Glyburide and
Metformin HCl) Tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of
cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic
conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant
tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated
blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances
with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When
metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma
levels > 5 µg/mL are generally found.

The
reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride
is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately
0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure
to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis.

### Use of admission serum lactate and sodium levels to predict mortality in necrotizing soft-tissue infections… [^111SwLft]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

On exploratory classification and regression tree analysis, admission serum lactate and sodium levels were predictors of mortality, with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 28%, positive predictive value of 23%, and negative predictive value of 100%. A serum lactate level greater than or equal to 54. 1 mg/dL alone was associated with a 32% mortality, whereas a serum sodium level greater than or equal to 135 mEq/L combined with a lactate level less than
54. 1 mg/dL was associated with a mortality of 0%. On CART analysis, 2 admission variables, serum lactate and sodium levels, were predictors of mortality. Patients with a lactate level greater than or equal to 54. 1 mg/dL had a mortality of 32%. Patients with a serum lactate level less than 54. 1 mg/dL combined with a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L had a mortality of 19%. Necrotizing soft-tissue infections remain a highly lethal disease.

The present study of 124 patients with NSTI found a mortality of 17%. On CART analysis, 2 admission laboratory variables, an elevated serum lactate level and decreased serum sodium level, were included in a decision tree to predict an increased risk of death. Sepsis leads to increased muscle glucose uptake, increased lactate production and decreased utilization, an increase in the calculated ratio of muscle membrane permeabilities to Na+ and K+, and an increased intracellular Na+ concentration. 13–17 These effects may be mediated by complement activation. 18 In addition, sepsis has been linked to. I presume the statistical analysis ruled out a correlation between hypotension, tachycardia, and an elevated serum lactate level. In fact, in this study, on univariate analysis, both blood pressure and base deficit were correlated with the mortality rate.

Not surprisingly, I found that patients with upper-extremity NSTI who presented with shock have a higher mortality rate, which I published in a paper decades ago in the Journal of Hand Surgery. I have observed more recently that patients with leukocytosis in excess of 25 000/μL have a poor prognosis.

### Stavudine [^1165wKfC]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including stavudine and other antiretrovirals. Although relative rates of lactic acidosis have not been assessed in prospective well-controlled trials, longitudinal cohort and retrospective studies suggest that this infrequent event may be more often associated with antiretroviral combinations containing stavudine. Female gender, obesity, and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals who received the combination of stavudine and didanosine with other antiretroviral agents. Coadministration of stavudine and didanosine is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]

Particular caution should be exercised when administering stavudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases of lactic acidosis have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Generalized fatigue, digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss); respiratory symptoms (tachypnea and dyspnea); or neurologic symptoms, including motor weakness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] might be indicative of the development of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis syndrome.

Treatment with stavudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered for patients with confirmed lactic acidosis.

Antiretroviral therapy–associated lactic acidosis — clinical features, risk factors, monitoring, and management are outlined as follows: Dyspnea and peripheral neuropathy are listed manifestations, and patients may present with acute multiorgan failure (e.g., fulminant hepatic failure, pancreatic failure, respiratory failure). Risk factors include Preterm Infants or Any Neonates Who Have Not Attained a Postmenstrual Age of 42 Weeks and a Postnatal Age of ≥ 14 Days and exposure to propylene glycol used as a diluent in LPV/r oral solution. For Patients With Clinical Signs or Symptoms Consistent With Lactic Acidosis, obtain blood lactate level and additional diagnostic evaluations should include serum bicarbonate, anion gap, and/or arterial blood gas; amylase and lipase; serum albumin; and hepatic transaminases; blood for lactate determination should be collected and processed within 4 hours of collection. Management includes Anecdotal (Unproven) Supportive Therapies — administer bicarbonate infusions, THAM (tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane), high doses of thiamine and riboflavin, and oral antioxidants (e.g. L-carnitine, co-enzyme Q10, vitamin C). Following resolution of abnormalities, resume therapy either with an NRTI-sparing regimen or a revised NRTI-containing regimen, and institute a revised NRTI-containing regimen with caution using NRTIs that are less likely to induce mitochondrial dysfunction (i.e. ABC, TAF, TDF, FTC, or 3TC); lactate should be monitored monthly for ≥ 3 months. Management can be initiated before receiving the results of the confirmatory test.

### Haloperidol lactate [^11588q7i]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

Hyperpyrexia and heat stroke, not associated with the above symptom complex, have also been reported with haloperidol.

Neurological Adverse Reactions in Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies

Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies are reported to have an increased sensitivity to antipsychotic medication. Manifestations of this increased sensitivity with haloperidol treatment include severe extrapyramidal symptoms, confusion, sedation, and falls. In addition, haloperidol may impair the antiparkinson effects of levodopa and other dopamine agonists. Haloperidol is contraindicated in patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hypersensitivity Reactions

There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions with haloperidol. These include anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, dermatitis exfoliative, hypersensitivity vasculitis, rash, urticaria, face edema, laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Haloperidol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to this drug (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

You have unusual (not normal) muscle pain.
You have stomach pains, nausea or vomiting.
You have trouble breathing.
You feel dizzy or lightheaded.
You have a slow or irregular heartbeat.

ACTOPLUS MET can have other serious side effects. See " What are the possible side effects of ACTOPLUS MET? "
