a'. Tinnitus
b. Hypothermia
c. Respiratory alkalosis
d. Metabolic acidosis
e. Hyperventilation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which effect does not occur in salicylate intoxication, with options including tinnitus, hypothermia, respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, and hyperventilation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic acid–base pattern in salicylate poisoning. Then, I should verify the expected neurologic and auditory manifestations. Next, I will check the thermoregulatory response. Finally, I will cross-check each option against authoritative sources to identify the outlier that does not fit the expected clinical picture.

> Let me first confirm the hallmark acid–base pattern. Salicylates directly stimulate the medullary respiratory center, producing hyperventilation and a primary respiratory alkalosis; concurrently, salicylates uncouple oxidative phosphorylation and interfere with the Krebs cycle, generating a mixed high anion gap metabolic acidosis, so the classic pattern is respiratory alkalosis with a superimposed metabolic acidosis, not hypothermia or isolated metabolic acidosis alone [^114fZ6fj] [^115BRuDJ].

> Wait, let me verify the auditory symptom. Tinnitus is a classic early manifestation of salicylate toxicity and can occur even at therapeutic levels; it is commonly described in both acute and chronic salicylism and is frequently used as a clinical clue in overdose presentations, so option a (tinnitus) is expected in salicylate intoxication [^114fZ6fj] [^113Uvffm] [^116EGLku].

> I need to check the thermoregulatory effect next. Salicylate overdose typically causes hyperthermia due to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and increased metabolic heat production; hypothermia is not a recognized feature of salicylate toxicity, so option b (hypothermia) stands out as inconsistent with the expected pathophysiology [^113Uvffm] [^114fZ6fj].

> Hold on, I should confirm the respiratory alkalosis and hyperventilation. Hyperventilation with resultant respiratory alkalosis is a defining early feature of salicylate poisoning driven by central stimulation of ventilation; this is consistently described in clinical reviews and case-based discussions, so options c (respiratory alkalosis) and e (hyperventilation) are expected findings [^114fZ6fj] [^113Uvffm] [^116EGLku].

> Let me consider the metabolic acidosis. A high anion gap metabolic acidosis from lactate accumulation and salicylate metabolites is characteristic and typically coexists with the respiratory alkalosis in moderate to severe cases, so option d (metabolic acidosis) is also expected in salicylate intoxication [^114fZ6fj] [^115BRuDJ].

> Putting this together, the effect that does not occur in salicylate intoxication is hypothermia. Instead, salicylate toxicity produces hyperthermia, along with tinnitus, hyperventilation, respiratory alkalosis, and metabolic acidosis, so the correct answer is b. Hypothermia [^113Uvffm] [^114fZ6fj].

---

The effect that does not occur in salicylate intoxication is **hypothermia**. Salicylate poisoning causes **hyperthermia** from uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation and increased metabolic rate [^113Uvffm], not hypothermia. The classic triad is **respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, and tinnitus** [^114fZ6fj]; hyperventilation is expected early [^116EGLku], and hypothermia is not a feature [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of salicylate intoxication

Salicylates stimulate the medullary respiratory center, causing **hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis** [^114fZ6fj]. They also uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, increasing metabolic rate and heat production, and cause a **metabolic acidosis** from lactate and ketoacid accumulation [^114fZ6fj]. These effects drive the classic clinical picture.

---

## Clinical manifestations of salicylate intoxication

Salicylate intoxication presents with a characteristic constellation of signs and symptoms, including:

- **Respiratory alkalosis**: Early hyperventilation with decreased PaCO2 and increased pH [^114fZ6fj].
- **Metabolic acidosis**: Later compensation with decreased bicarbonate and base excess [^113Uvffm].
- **Tinnitus**: Common early symptom, often with hearing loss [^116EGLku].
- **Hyperventilation**: Tachypnea and increased respiratory effort [^114fZ6fj].
- **Hyperthermia**: Increased body temperature from uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation [^113Uvffm].

---

## Thermoregulatory effects of salicylate intoxication

Salicylates increase metabolic rate and heat production, typically causing **hyperthermia** [^113Uvffm]. Hypothermia is not a recognized feature of salicylate poisoning; instead, elevated temperature is expected in both acute and chronic toxicity [^113Uvffm].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Occurrence in salicylate intoxication** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|
| a. Tinnitus | Yes | Common early symptom of salicylate toxicity [^116EGLku] |
| b. Hypothermia | No | Salicylates cause hyperthermia, not hypothermia [^113Uvffm] |
| c. Respiratory alkalosis | Yes | Early hyperventilation causes respiratory alkalosis [^114fZ6fj] |
| d. Metabolic acidosis | Yes | Later metabolic acidosis from lactate and ketoacids [^114fZ6fj] |
| e. Hyperventilation | Yes | Stimulation of respiratory center causes hyperventilation [^114fZ6fj] |

## Conclusion

The effect that does not occur in salicylate intoxication is **hypothermia**. Salicylate poisoning causes hyperthermia from increased metabolic rate and heat production, whereas hypothermia is not a recognized feature [^notfound].

### Vestibular paroxysmia: clinical characteristics and long-term course [^115UaUfb]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

In our study, the most frequent type of vertigo in dVP was spinning (60%) compared to pVP with 42%, which was the only significantly different clinical parameter between the two subgroups. Thus, the high occurrence of rotational vertigo of around 70% in the above-mentioned studies was confirmed for dVP, but not for pVP. This might be due to relatively weak inclusion criteria for pVP, requiring only 5 short attacks of vertigo-like sensations, thereby risking including non-vestibular attacks, e.g. due to circulatory dysregulations. This result appears to be logical, since in VP the peripheral vestibular system is involved, typically reflected by rotatory vertigo.

Most probably due to the fact that specific triggers and accompanying symptoms are not mandatory in the current diagnostic criteria, spontaneous occurrence was two to three times more frequent and accompanying symptoms, especially cochlear ones, less frequent in our cohort. Overall, about 70% of patients reported no accompanying symptoms at all and if they were present, they occurred equally often in dVP and pVP, so they did not help to differentiate between the two entities.

Hyperventilation-induced nystagmus is suggested to reflect hyperexcitability of the compressed nerve, but is also found in other peripheral vestibular diseases, e.g. vestibular schwannoma and unilateral vestibulopathia, as well as in vestibular migraine, cerebellar diseases, and even in healthy adults (up to 12%). In our patient cohort, hyperventilation-induced nystagmus was found in about 40% of dVP as well as pVP patients, which is less frequent compared to earlier descriptions of up to 70%.

All available studies that investigated SVV deviation showed increased rates of pathological tilting in smaller cohorts (22% to 40%). This is approximately in line with the rate of 18% slight SVV deviations in our study only in dVP, whereas it was low in pVP (8%). The persisting mild tone imbalance might explain ongoing unspecific impairment in the attack-free interval, e.g. unsteadiness of gait or drowsiness. In contrast to hyperventilation-induced nystagmus, SVV deviation as a sign of an acute vestibular tone imbalance is not at all evident in healthy persons, and thus can serve as a more reliable indicator. In contrast, mild peripheral dysfunction (calorics, vHIT) can also be explained by preceding diseases, and does not imperatively reflect acute pathology.

### Ventilatory responses to inhaled carbon dioxide, hypoxia, and exercise in idiopathic hyperventilation [^113NVUdU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Idiopathic hyperventilation (IH) is a poorly understood condition of sustained hypocapnia and controversial etiology. Although behavioral/emotional factors may contribute, it is uncertain whether chemosensitivity is altered, hyperventilation is maintained during exercise, and the associated breathlessness reflects the hyperventilation. In 39 patients with IH and 23 control subjects, we described ventilatory responses to isocapnic-hypoxia, hyperoxic-hypercapnia, and exercise; breath-hold tolerance; breathlessness; and psychologic status. Patients demonstrated hyperventilation at rest, with hypocapnia (28 ± 3.8 mm Hg), a normal (slightly alkaline) arterial pH and [H(+)]a, and a significant base excess (-4.5 ± 2.7 mEq/L), consistent with compensated respiratory alkalosis. Hyperventilation was sustained during exercise, despite hyperoxic-hypercapnic ventilatory responsiveness being normal and isocapnic-hypoxic ventilatory responsiveness being low relative to control (but exceeding control [2.4 ± 1.0 vs. 1.6 ± 0.5 L/min/%, p < 0.05] with acute restoration to normocapnia). Hyperventilation was maintained during exercise, at the resting CO(2) "setpoint". Relative to control, the breath-hold tolerance was attenuated, and dyspnea during exercise was significantly greater and not simply ascribable to the high ventilation. These observations suggest that patients with IH have a sustained hyperventilatory and dyspneic drive that, although not attributable to central chemosensitivity, may possibly have peripheral chemoreflex contributions. The nature and etiology of this chronic hyperventilatory drive remain unclear.

Data Analysis

Physiological data were averaged every 5 min during the submaximal exercise and used for time-dependent data analysis. The same variables during exercise were obtained as values averaged at given T es levels (37.0°C, 37.4°C, 37.8°C, and 38.2°C) and were utilized for T es -dependent analysis. For resting data, we used the averaged data from the last 5 min of the 10-min baseline and post-ingestion period, respectively. The data for MCA V mean (MCA V mean %baseline) and MCA CVCi (MCA CVCi %baseline) were calculated as relative values compared with baseline levels, which were assigned a value of 100%. Cutaneous vascular conductance was normalized to the maximum conductance, with values expressed as a percentage of the maximum (%max). The values during the high-intensity exercise were assessed by averaging data every 30 s. Furthermore, the value during the final 30 s in one trial, in which participants exercised for a shorter duration, was assessed and compared with the value at the corresponding time point in the other trial (i.e. Iso-time: 122 ± 70 s). The 30-s highest or lowest value achieved during the high-intensity exercise was defined as peak or nadir value, respectively. Due to technical issues, the measurement of respiratory variables, skin blood flow on the forearm, and sweat rate on the forearm was unsuccessful in one, two, and one participants, respectively. Two participants did not perform high-intensity exercise because they exceeded T es 39.0°C, a criterion for exercise cessation due to ethical considerations, at the end of moderate-intensity exercise.

We plotted E as a function of T es and conducted simple linear regression analyses using GraphPad Prism (v. 9.5.1; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). The slope of the regression lines relating E to T es assessed by a least-squares fit crossed was considered to define to sensitivity of hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation. For the analyses, 30-s averaged data were used. In addition, to exclude the fast component of E kinetics, only respiratory data collected after the first 5 min of the exercise were analyzed.

The change (Δ) from the Ice to the Con trial was assessed for E, PETCO 2, MCA V mean %baseline, and gastrointestinal complaints measured at the end of moderate-intensity exercise, and duration of high-intensity exercise. Δ values were used for outlier analyses (see the Statistical Analysis section).

### The pathophysiology of' happy' hypoxemia in COVID-19 [^114Vzd6f]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The normal response to hypercapnia (caused by increased V D, hypoventilation or increased VCO 2) is an increase in respiratory drive and minute volume ventilation. Hypoxemia itself rather plays a limited role in the sensation of breathlessness experienced by patients with cardiopulmonary disease on the opposite of hypercapnia that creates per se dyspnea. In healthy subjects, the respiratory drive shifts minimally in mild hypoxemia (PaO 2 60–65 mmHg), such as resulting from stays at high altitude or experimental hypoxic chambers. Many patients with dyspnea are not hypoxemic, while those who are, usually experience only a slight improvement in symptoms after hypoxemia is corrected with supplemental oxygen therapy. When arterial P a O 2 drops below 40 mmHg, dyspnea often occurs. Of note, the normal response to hypoxemia is a rise in minute ventilation, primarily by increasing tidal volume and respiratory rate. Increased respiratory rate (tachypnea) and tidal volume (hyperpnea) - and not dyspnea - are therefore the most important clinical signs of impending hypoxemic respiratory failure. Furthermore, PaCO 2 serves as one of the fundamental regulators of cerebral blood flow. Hyperventilation causes decreased PaCO2 which subsequently leads to arterial vasoconstriction thus lowering cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure. In contrary, increase in PaCO 2 leads to increased intracranial pressure ultimately leading to deteriorating level of consciousness, altered brainstem reflexes, and altered postural and motor responses. At the bedside, a profound understanding of the pathophysiological determinants of respiratory drive and hypoxemia may promote a more complete comprehension of a COVID-19 of a patient's clinical presentation and timely management.

### Practical guide to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in adults [^111mSAj1]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Panel 8: Respiratory exchange rate (RER) and breathing reserve (BR). RER describes the ratio of CO 2 output to O 2 uptake (/) as a function of time and reflects patient effort (RER at least ≥ 1). RER depends on the rate of lactate increase during progressive exercise. BR indicates the actual percentage of the maximum ventilatory capacity (MVV-V̇E). Validity depends on adequate spirometry.

Analysis (target values and response kinetics): RER values at rest: normal, high or low? RER > 1 at rest (indicative of hyperventilation). RER ≥ 1 achieved in early exercise (work rate already above lactate threshold) or in late exercise? An abrupt, persistent RER increase during early exercise suggests exercise-induced R-L shunt. RER < 1 during exercise (e.g. poor effort, severe lung disease [cannot be adequately increased], myopathy, PAD, hyperventilation prior to testing)? Delayed decrease in RER in early recovery (indicates delayed CO 2 elimination, e.g. severe COPD) or rapid RER decrease in early recovery (indicates delayed recovery ofvs.due to a high O 2 deficit during exercise)? BR normal or low? A low BR indicates reduced ventilatory capacity due to impaired lung mechanics and increased ventilatory demands during exercise.

### Dysfunctional breathing diagnosed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing in' long COVID' patients with persistent dyspnoea [^116LKp4g]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Long-lasting dyspnoea associated with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection is part of the so-called 'long COVID' syndrome and may persist for months after acute infection. Estimates of 'long COVID' prevalence vary from 2.3% to 40%, depending on the definition and examination time after acute infection. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is the most detailed diagnostic procedure to disentangle the mechanisms of dyspnoea by simultaneously evaluating cardiovascular adaptation, ventilation and gas exchange through exercise. Some data on CPET after SARS-CoV-2 infection have been published. Respiratory limitation (RL) and deconditioning seem to be the main patterns limiting exercise. Based on questionnaires, some authors suspect that hyperventilation syndrome might contribute to dyspnoea in 'long COVID'. In a case series of patients evaluated with CPET for persistent post-COVID-19 dyspnoea, hyperventilation with an elevated V'E/V'CO 2 ratio was described. Hyperventilation was further suspected in a larger cohort of patients evaluated with CPET.

Hyperventilation syndrome is one specific type of dysfunctional breathing (DB), characterised in CPET by low PaCO 2 set point resulting in ventilatory inefficiency characterised by high minute ventilation/CO 2 output (V'E/V'CO 2) with usually a normal dead volume/tidal volume (VD/Vt) ratio. However, other types of DB with normal PaCO 2 and V'E/V'CO 2 have been described, in particular, erratic ventilation with wide and irregular variations of Vt and breathing frequency (BF) over the progression of effort during CPET.DB manifesting these characteristics can be distinguished by analysis of ventilation patterns on CPET and may significantly contribute to dyspnoea in people living with 'long COVID' patients. In the present study, we aimed to determine the occurrence of DB in patients with 'long COVID'-associated dyspnoea, describe the specific ventilation pattern, and identify clinical predictors of DB. Our hypothesis was that a large proportion of individuals had a DB pattern especially in the ambulatory setting when dyspnoea could not be explained by obvious structural findings.

Panel 4: The relationships of minute ventilation vs. O 2 uptake and vs. CO 2 output (ventilatory equivalents) as a function of time. The ventilatory equivalents EqO 2 ≈and EqCO 2 ≈indicate how many litres must be ventilated to take up 1 L of O 2 or exhale 1 L of CO 2 (gas exchange efficiency). The same information is found in panel 6 in a linear presentation. The lower the equivalent values, the more effective the gas exchange or work of breathing, and vice versa. Excessvs.andoccurs due to augmented ventilatory drive (nonspecific hyperventilation), metabolic acidosis (compensatory hyperventilation) and/or V/Q mismatch (true ventilatory inefficiency).

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^114ZCGQ8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) — diagnosis and severity criteria are based on objective lung function changes rather than symptoms; the diagnosis of EIB is established by changes in lung function provoked by exercise, not on the basis of symptoms, using serial lung function measurements after exercise or hyperpnea challenge with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) preferred for better repeatability and discrimination. The airway response is expressed as percent fall in FEV1 from baseline, calculated using the lowest FEV1 recorded within 30 minutes after exercise, and the criterion for diagnosis is a percent fall in FEV1 of ≥ 10%. Severity can be graded as mild, moderate, or severe when the percent fall in FEV1 is ≥ 10% but < 25%, ≥ 25% but < 50%, and ≥ 50%, respectively. Surrogates for exercise testing that may be easier to implement include eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea or hyperventilation and hyperosmolar aerosols, including 4.5% saline, as well as dry powder mannitol.

### Effect of ventilatory drive on carbon dioxide sensitivity below eupnea during sleep [^115GFVuG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We determined the effects of changing ventilatory stimuli on the hypocapnia-induced apneic and hypopneic thresholds in sleeping dogs. End-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PET(CO2)) was gradually reduced during non-rapid eye movement sleep by increasing tidal volume with pressure support mechanical ventilation, causing a reduction in diaphragm electromyogram amplitude until apnea/periodic breathing occurred. We used the reduction in PET(CO2) below spontaneous breathing required to produce apnea (DeltaPET(CO2)) as an index of the susceptibility to apnea. DeltaPET(CO2) was -5 mm Hg in control animals and changed in proportion to background ventilatory drive, increasing with metabolic acidosis (-6.7 mm Hg) and nonhypoxic peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation (almitrine; -5.9 mm Hg) and decreasing with metabolic alkalosis (-3.7 mm Hg). Hypoxia was the exception; DeltaPET(CO2) narrowed (-4.1 mm Hg) despite the accompanying hyperventilation. Thus, hyperventilation and hypocapnia, per se, widened the DeltaPET(CO2) thereby protecting against apnea and hypopnea, whereas reduced ventilatory drive and hypoventilation narrowed the DeltaPET(CO2) and increased the susceptibility to apnea. Hypoxia sensitized the ventilatory responsiveness to CO2 below eupnea and narrowed the DeltaPET(CO2); this effect of hypoxia was not attributable to an imbalance between peripheral and central chemoreceptor stimulation, per se. We conclude that the DeltaPET(CO2) and the ventilatory sensitivity to CO2 between eupnea and the apneic threshold are changeable in the face of variations in the magnitude, direction, and/or type of ventilatory stimulus, thereby altering the susceptibility for apnea, hypopnea, and periodic breathing in sleep.

### 2022 ESC / ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^115Ey2Tz]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gas — pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and analysis of arterial blood gas (ABG) or arterialized capillary blood are necessary to distinguish between pulmonary hypertension groups, assess comorbidities and the need for supplementary oxygen, and determine disease severity, and the initial work-up of suspected pulmonary hypertension should comprise forced spirometry, body plethysmography, lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and ABG; in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), PFTs are usually normal or may show mild restrictive, obstructive, or combined abnormalities, DLCO may be normal although it is usually mildly reduced, and a severely reduced DLCO (< 45% of the predicted value) with otherwise normal PFTs can occur in PAH associated with systemic sclerosis, PVOD, in PH group 3 conditions (emphysema, interstitial lung disease, or combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema), and in some PAH phenotypes, with a low DLCO associated with a poor prognosis in several forms of PH; patients with PAH usually have normal or slightly reduced partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), severe reduction of PaO2 might raise suspicion for patent foramen ovale, hepatic disease, other right-to-left shunt abnormalities (e.g. septal defect), or low-DLCO-associated conditions, and partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is typically lower than normal due to alveolar hyperventilation.

### Cerebrospinal fluid and arterial acid-base equilibrium of spontaneously breathing patients with aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^113QyNGy]. Neurocritical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we used the physicochemical approach to acid–base to describe the acid–base characteristics of both arterial blood and CSF of spontaneously breathing patients with SAH and compared these results with those of a control population, i.e. healthy, spontaneously breathing patients undergoing elective surgery under spinal anesthesia. The main finding of our study was that patients with SAH had lower CSF SID, mainly due to an increased concentration of lactate. Arterial SID did not differ between the two populations. Therefore, when blood SID was subtracted from CSF SID (ΔSID), significantly different values were observed in patients with SAH and controls (Fig. 1). This finding clearly points toward a primary metabolic acid–base disorder caused by intracranial bleeding and compartmentalized in the cerebral/CSF environment. Despite the acidifying effect of a reduced CSF SID, CSF pH was similar in the two populations, as CSF PCO 2 was significantly reduced in patients with SAH. The respiratory compensation of this local metabolic acidosis led to blood HA in 40% of the SAH population.

Isolated CSF acidosis has been induced in several animal models by directly injecting acids into the ventricular system. In these studies, local CSF acidification triggered the respiratory chemoreceptors and caused an increase in minute ventilation to restore CSF pH through a reduction in CSF PCO 2. Given the anatomical and functional separation between blood and CSF, the acids injected locally did not reach the bloodstream, which was therefore unaffected by the acid–base disorder. Consequently, the compensatory hyperventilation corrected CSF pH and led to a systemic HA of the blood.

Although the presence of HA frequently characterizes patients with cerebrovascular conditions, only a few reports investigated the underlying mechanisms. We hypothesized that a local CSF metabolic acidosis, i.e. a reduction in CSF SID, could partially explain the finding. We therefore studied the blood/CSF electrolytes and acid–base of healthy patients undergoing spinal anesthesia and considered these data, for the present study, as baseline values, i.e. normal reference values before the SAH.

### Nortriptyline hydrochloride (Pamelor) [^111dEvh3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular – A maximal limb-lead QRS duration of ≥ 0.10 seconds may be the best indication of the severity of the overdose. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate should be used to maintain the serum pH in the range of 7.45 to 7.55. If the pH response is inadequate, hyperventilation may also be used. Concomitant use of hyperventilation and sodium bicarbonate should be done with extreme caution, with frequent pH monitoring. A pH > 7.60 or a pCO2 < 20 mmHg is undesirable. Dysrhythmias unresponsive to sodium bicarbonate therapy/hyperventilation may respond to lidocaine, bretylium or phenytoin. Type 1A and 1C antiarrhythmics are generally contraindicated (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide). In rare instances, hemoperfusion may be beneficial in acute refractory cardiovascular instability in patients with acute toxicity. However, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusions, and forced diuresis generally have been reported as ineffective in tricyclic antidepressant poisoning.

CNS – In patients with CNS depression, early intubation is advised because of the potential for abrupt deterioration. Seizures should be controlled with benzodiazepines, or if these are ineffective, other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin). Physostigmine is not recommended except to treat life-threatening symptoms that have been unresponsive to other therapies, and then only in consultation with a poison control center.

Psychiatric Follow-up – Since overdosage is often deliberate, patients may attempt suicide by other means during the recovery phase. Psychiatric referral may be appropriate.

Pediatric Management – The principles of management of child and adult overdosages are similar. It is strongly recommended that the physician contact the local poison control center for specific pediatric treatment.

### Induction of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures without placebo [^116pUXQr]. Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) can only be made with EEG-video monitoring. The authors describe a provocative technique without placebo. Patients with a clinical suspicion for PNES underwent an activation procedure using suggestion, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation. Of 19 inductions performed, 16 (84%) were successful in inducing the habitual episode. The authors' technique had a sensitivity comparable to those using placebo (e.g., saline injection), but does not have disadvantages.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2024 update [^113HNV3E]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Cold water immersion survival — there are 4 phases of cold water immersion (airways above water) that can contribute to aspiration and drowning: the cold shock response causes gasping and hyperventilation lasting 30–90 s; cold incapacitation may be evident after only a few minutes of submersion and progress to incapacitation after 10 or more min; hypothermia can take 30 or more minutes to occur in an adult who is not wearing specific thermal protective garments (a victim can only survive this long if flotation is available); and drowning may occur due to rescue collapse just before, during, or shortly after rescue. Immediate attention must always be given to self-rescue and extricating oneself from a hazardous environment, and likelihood of survival is increased by having appropriate gear (e.g., a PFD or lifejacket) and training and by dressing for water temperature, not just air temperature, in the event of immersion. After immersion, the most important decisions are assessment of the presence of any potential immediate threats to life and whether to swim to safety or await rescue.

### Carotid body dysregulation contributes to long COVID symptoms [^111KhYn4]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The symptoms of long COVID, which include fatigue, breathlessness, dysregulated breathing, and exercise intolerance, have unknown mechanisms. These symptoms are also observed in heart failure and are partially driven by increased sensitivity of the carotid chemoreflex. As the carotid body has an abundance of ACE2 (the cell entry mechanism for SARS-CoV-2), we investigated whether carotid chemoreflex sensitivity was elevated in participants with long COVID.

Methods

Non-hositalised participants with long-COVID (n = 14) and controls (n = 14) completed hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR; the measure of carotid chemoreflex sensitivity) and cardiopulmonary exercise tests. Parametric and normally distributed data were compared using Student's unpaired t-tests or ANOVA. Nonparametric equivalents were used where relevant. Peason's correlation coefficient was used to examine relationships between variables.

Results

During cardiopulmonary exercise testing the V E /VCO 2 slope (a measure of breathing efficiency) was higher in the long COVID group (37.8 ± 4.4) compared to controls (27.7 ± 4.8, P = 0.0003), indicating excessive hyperventilation. The HVR was increased in long COVID participants (-0.44 ± 0.23l/min/ SpO 2%, R 2 = 0.77 ± 0.20) compared to controls (-0.17 ± 0.13l/min/SpO 2%, R 2 = 0.54 ± 0.38, P = 0.0007). The HVR correlated with the V E /VCO 2 slope (r = -0.53, P = 0.0036), suggesting that excessive hyperventilation may be related to carotid body hypersensitivity.

Conclusions

The carotid chemoreflex is sensitised in long COVID and may explain dysregulated breathing and exercise intolerance in these participants. Tempering carotid body excitability may be a viable treatment option for long COVID patients.

Forty-two cases of salicylate intoxication in infants and children observed over a 10-year-period are reviewed. The majority of the 13 cases of poisoning due to accidental ingestion occurred in the 2- to 4-year age range whereas the 29 intoxications resulting from therapeutic administration of salicylates occurred chiefly in infants. Accumulative therapy intoxication is more likely to occur in infants rather than older children not only because of an unawareness of the dangers and of the proper dose of acetylsalicylic acid, but also because of the decreased renal excretion of salicylates due to renal immaturity, and pre-renal azotemia due to dehydration resulting from the disease for which the drug is given. The marked variability in time response of an individual to salicylates is emphasized.

Even in poisoning resulting from accidental ingestion, where the effects of an underlying disease do not have to be considered, the plasma concentration of salicylate, clinical response, degree of toxicity at a given concentration of salicylate, and time required for renal excretion varied greatly for children of time same age and size who ingested comparable amounts of salicylate. Severe intoxication at how concentrations of salicylate in the plasma was observed. Hyperventilation and vomiting are the most common clinical manifestations of salicylism but a hemorrhagic diathesis due to hypoprothrombinemia, hyperpyrexia, delirium or coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory failure may be observed. The unique effect of salicylates on acid-base balance with an initial respiratory alkalosis progressing to a metabolic acidosis is discussed. A treatment program based on physiologic principles is outlined.

The important role of drug ingestion, especially acetylsalicylic acid, as a cause of death is re-emphasized and a plea is made for better education and attention to the potential dangers of salicylates. Skip Nav Destination Article navigation Comments.

### CO ₂, infections, and critical illnesses [^115869KY]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Why are there no guidelines or standards for therapeutic CO 2 management anywhere in medicine?

Why are Intensive Care Unit patients routinely managed with elective endotracheal intubation, paralysis, toxic propofol sedation, assiduous avoidance of helpful narcotics, mechanical hyperventilation that depletes CO 2 body reserves, causes cellular oxygen starvation, and invites bacterial invasion?

Why aren't critically ill patients managed instead with narcotics, hypercarbia, CO 2 supplementation, and hyperbaric chamber therapy that synergize the effectiveness of antibiotics?

Why aren't tanks of carbogen standard equipment wherever they might be needed, and why don't Red Cross training programs embrace its use?

### Postural hyperventilation as a cause of postural tachycardia syndrome: increased systemic vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output when upright in all postural tachycardia syndrome variants [^1165ygFS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Regional blood volume responses to tilt

Figure 3 shows regional blood volume data, obtained by impedance plethysmography, averaged over each POTS group and control subjects. The percentage change of central blood volume was reduced for all patients with POTS while upright (P < 0.001). There was an initial upswing in splanchnic blood volume in POTS‐hyperventilation and a less easily discerned reciprocal change in CBV. Splanchnic blood volume exceeded control in all POTS (P < 0.01), whereas an increase in pelvic volume in POTS did not reach significance. Calf volume was significantly larger than control for POTS–normal CO and POTS‐hyperventilation, but not for POTS‐↓CO (P < 0.001). After administration of supplemental CO 2, CBV, splanchnic, pelvic, and calf blood volumes were similar in subjects with POTS‐hyperventilation and control subjects.

### Causes, consequences, and treatments of sleep and circadian disruption in the ICU: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^1176q5AZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Sleep promotion intervention components in the intensive care unit outline actionable strategies and special considerations across care processes. Recommended environmental and zeitgeber actions include "Providers should mitigate light from screens in the room (e.g., televisions, mobile computers)", together with feeding and sedation guidance: "Time-restricted feeding should be structured to deliver food during the day and provide a fast during the night" and "Providers should minimize daytime sedation to optimize daytime mobility and wakefulness". For pain and anxiety management, the table advises "Follow PADIS guideline to optimize nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic analgesic strategies" (PADIS, pain, agitation and sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption) and to "Balance pain and anxiety with the need to minimize analgesics and anxiolytics known to disrupt sleep (e.g., narcotics and benzodiazepines)". Personalization includes, "If patient not able to convey sleep preferences, consider asking surrogate". Environmental controls emphasize, "Investigate sources of noise, which can be diverse and highly unique to each unit or room; talking and equipment alarms are common sources of noise, but many other sound sources exist" and "Discourage nighttime visitors outside of special circumstances (e.g., end of life)". Care delivery timing encourages clustering, with "Involve stakeholders for all changed work flows", noting "Restaffing may be needed to increase tasks during nonesleep times", that a "Dedicated sleep period may not be feasible on the basis of patient acuity, but care can be reduced to urgent tasks", and to "Reassure patients that while they are being allowed to rest, remote monitoring (e.g., telemetry) is ongoing". For ventilation, the statement cautions that "It is unclear if the mode of mechanical ventilation vs. the achievement of physiologic principles (e.g., synchrony, respiratory muscle rest, avoidance of hyperventilation, relief of dyspnea) is most important in preventing ventilator-related sleep disruption". Medication practices include "Multidisciplinary review of medications daily with critical care pharmacist; reduce dose or discontinue when possible", and medication timing guidance to "Leverage electronic medical record defaults to preferentially schedule medication administration in the daytime" and "Strategize continuous infusion bag volumes, concentrations, and start times such that bag and tubing changes do not occur during protected sleep periods".

### Comparative analysis between available challenge tests in the hyperventilation syndrome [^116sJVBj]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The hyperventilation syndrome (HVS) is characterized by somatic/ psychological symptoms due to sustained hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis without any organic disease.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare ventilatory parameters and symptoms reproducibility during the hyperventilation provocation test (HVPT) and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) as diagnostic tools in patients with HVS, and to identify the most frequent etiologies of the HVS by a systematic assessment.

Methods

After exclusion of organic causes, 59 patients with HVS according to Nijmegen's questionnaire (NQ) score ≥ 23 with associated hypocapnia (PaCO 2 /PET CO2 < 35 mm Hg) were studied.

Results

The most frequent comorbidities of HVS were anxiety and asthma (respectively 95% and 73% of patients). All patients described ≥ 3 symptoms of NQ during the HVPT vs 14% of patients during the CPET (p < 0.01). For similar maximal ventilation (61 L/min during HVPT vs 60 L/min during CPET), the median level of PET CO2 decreased from 30 mmHg at baseline to 15 mmHg during hyperventilation and increased from 31 mmHg at baseline to 34 mmHg at peak exercise (all p < 0.01). No significant difference for the ventilatory parameters was found between patients with HVS (n = 16) and patients with HVS + asthma (n = 43).

Conclusions

In term of symptoms reproducibility, HVPT is a better diagnostic tool than CPET for HVS. An important proportion of patients with HVS has an atypical asthma previously misdiagnosed. The exercise-induced hyperventilation did not induce abnormal reduction in PET CO2, suggesting that the exercise could be a therapeutic tool in HVS.

### Effects of acute hypoventilation and hyperventilation on exhaled carbon monoxide measurement in healthy volunteers [^1127sfb1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Results

eCO analysis showed a good level of reproducibility. The mean difference between duplicate measurements was 0.11 (0.20) ppm. Environmental CO concentration was 0.8 ppm in lab A and 1.7 ppm in lab B.

eCO values are reported in table 3. In comparison with normoventilation, eCO values were lower during hyperventilation and higher during hypoventilation (p < 0.01 in both cases); difference was more pronounced between normo- and hyperventilation (mean value: 1.2 ppm) than between normo- and hypoventilation (mean value: 0.4 ppm). No significant difference was observed between measurements performed in lab A and B (K-W test), while measured eCO levels were significantly lower when gas sampling was performed after a deep inspiration than after a normal inspiration (p < 0.01).

### Hyperventilation and electroconvulsive therapy: a literature review [^113xe9Pz]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperventilation has been proposed as an augmentation strategy in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in accordance with its proconvulsant effect.

Objective

This study reviews the existing literature on the application of hyperventilation in ECT, its efficacy, and tolerance.

Methods

A systematic search was performed in PubMed and EMBASE databases. Search terms ('electroconvulsive therapy' and 'hyperventilation', 'ventilation', 'hyperoxygenation', 'hyperoxia', 'hypocapnia') were used to retrieve works from 1966 to June 2016. Works that described hyperventilation manoeuvres in ECT settings and their clinical repercussion were included in the review.

Results

A total of 17 observational and experimental studies were selected. An important heterogeneity in study designs, samples and ECT conditions, was detected. Findings support a positive influence of hyperventilation on seizure duration, which is the main study variable across different works. Effects of hyperventilation on seizure threshold and quality parameters have been less thoroughly studied. Systematic recording of clinical outcomes and adverse effects of hyperventilation is uncommon.

Conclusions

The literature suggests that hyperventilation may be an effective and safe technique to enhance ECT, but many aspects remain to be studied. Further investigations, especially controlled clinical trials, are necessary and should result in a specific and reliable hyperventilation protocol for ECT settings.

### Causes of breathing inefficiency during exercise in heart failure [^112h94BD]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with heart failure (HF) develop abnormal pulmonary gas exchange; specifically, they have abnormal ventilation relative to metabolic demand (ventilatory efficiency/minute ventilation in relation to carbon dioxide production [V(E)/VCO₂]) during exercise. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the factors that underlie the abnormal breathing efficiency in this population.

Methods and Results

Fourteen controls and 33 moderate-severe HF patients, ages 52 ± 12 and 54 ± 8 years, respectively, performed submaximal exercise (∼65% of maximum) on a cycle ergometer. Gas exchange and blood gas measurements were made at rest and during exercise. Submaximal exercise data were used to quantify the influence of hyperventilation (PaCO₂) and dead space ventilation (V(D)) on V(E)/VCO₂. The V(E)/VCO₂ relationship was lower in controls (30 ± 4) than HF (45 ± 9, P < .01). This was the result of hyperventilation (lower PaCO₂) and higher V(D)/V(T) that contributed 40% and 47%, respectively, to the increased V(E)/VCO₂ (P < .01). The elevated V(D)/V(T) in the HF patients was the result of a tachypneic breathing pattern (lower V(T), 1086 ± 366 versus 2003 ± 504 mL, P < .01) in the presence of a normal V(D) (11.5 ± 4.0 versus 11.9 ± 5.7 L/min, P = 0.095).

Conclusions

The abnormal ventilation in relation to metabolic demand in HF patients during exercise was due primarily to alterations in breathing pattern (reduced V(T)) and excessive hyperventilation.

### Decreased COsaturation during circular breathwork supports emergence of altered States of consciousness [^113z1Zzk]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

End-tidal CO 2 saturation during breathwork

To first establish if circular breathwork caused CO 2 saturation to drop as previously described for voluntary hyperventilation, we repeatedly measured etCO 2 throughout the session (see Methods). As expected, etCO 2 in active breathers dropped significantly throughout the session compared to passive breathers, with an average of 36.7 ± 1.5 versus 20.1 ± 0.8 mmHg (mean ± SEM; see Fig. 1A; for individual etCO 2 traces, see Supplementary Fig. S1). This effect occurred irrespective of Holotropic or Conscious-Connected breathing techniques (Two-way ANOVA; df = 60; Effect of active versus passive breathing: F = 111.4; p < 0.001; Cohen's D: 3.03; Effect of breathing technique: F = 0.0; p = 0.91; Cohen's D: 0.14; Interaction: F = 0.0; p = 0.91; see Supplementary Table S3 for details). Effects were even more pronounced for the minimum etCO 2 per participant across time points 2–4, which dropped to 16.6 ± 0.8 mmHg in the active-breathing group but remained at 34.3 ± 1.5 mmHg in the passive-breathing group (mean ± SEM; Fig. 1B; Two-way ANOVA; df = 60; Active versus passive breathing: F = 119.0; p < 0.001; Cohen's D: 3.11; Breathing technique: F = 0.1; p = 0.81; Cohen's D: 0.06; Interaction: F = 0.2; p = 0.64; see Supplementary Table S3 for details). The time course of etCO 2 confirmed that in active-breathing sessions, etCO 2 levels dropped throughout the first half of the session, typically reaching their minimum at measurement time points 2–3, and then gradually rising again towards the end of the session (Fig. 1C). These dynamics were highly similar between Holotropic and Conscious-Connected breathwork sessions (Correlation of average CO 2 trajectories for active-breath groups in Holotropic and Conscious-Connected breathwork: n = 6 observation time points per breathwork style; r = 0.92; conf.int(r) low = 0.41; conf.int(r) high = 0.99; p = 0.01). These results indicate that participants adhered to the breathing instructions they were assigned to, with the active-breath group, but not the passive-breath group, reaching decreases in etCO 2 that would be expected during deliberate hyperventilation.

### Airway cells after swimming outdoors or in the sea in nonasthmatic athletes [^112Yx323]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Marathon runners and elite swimmers showed increased inflammatory cells in the airways at baseline. Although airway neutrophils increase further after a marathon race, the airway response to swimming is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of swimming on airway cells. To avoid the concomitant effects of chronic exposure to chlorine, the study was conducted in seven nonasthmatic swimmers [mean age (SD): 23.3 ± 7.7 yr, training: 32 ± 15 km.wk-1] habitually training in an outdoor pool (OP), i.e., a low-chlorine environment.

Methods

Spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide (NO), induced sputum, and peripheral blood samples were obtained at baseline, after a 5-km trial in OP, and after a 5-km race in the sea (S), i.e., hypertonic airway exposure.

Results

Airway neutrophil differential counts at baseline were higher in swimmers than in sedentary controls (N = 10), but cell counts, neutrophil elastase, and eosinophil cationic protein were unaffected by 5-km swimming. After swimming, L-selectin expression on airway cells decreased, suggesting exercise-induced cell mobilization into the airways and/or direct effects of hyperventilation on airway cells. After S, airway eosinophil differential counts increased slightly. Exhaled NO concentration was 19 ± 6 ppb at baseline, 8 ± 4 ppb after OP, and 21 ± 7 ppb after S (P < 0.005 for OP vs baseline and S).

Conclusions

In swimmers not chronically exposed to high chlorine concentrations, data obtained at baseline suggest a direct relationship between airway neutrophilia and endurance training. The low L-selectin expression by airway cells postexercise suggests hyperventilation-induced cell recruitment or modulation of cell function. Hypertonic exposure of airways during exercise may slightly increase airway eosinophils and exhaled NO. Overall, 5-km swimming exerted smaller effects on airway cells than running a marathon.

### Carotid body dysregulation contributes to long COVID symptoms [^114PoAsW]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The hypoxic ventilatory response was correlated with the V E /VCO 2 slope, so that a person with high chemoreflex sensitivity had a higher V E /VCO 2 slope (or vice versa). This suggests that elevated carotid chemoreflex sensitivity may partially explain reduced breathing efficiency and hyperventilation during exercise in participants with long COVID. In fact, breathing efficiency was poor in some of the participants in this study; 64% of the long COVID group had a V E /VCO 2 slope > 34 (versus only 7% (one person) in the control group), which is a powerful prognostic indicator of future outcomes for people with heart failure. It is possible that in long COVID the carotid chemoreflex has a similar function as that described in heart failure, partially explaining the dysregulated breathing and feelings of breathlessness in patients with ongoing symptoms after their initial mild infection. Elevated V E /VCO 2 slopes are also caused by increased dead space ventilation due to 1) inadequate aeration of the alveoli and 2) poor perfusion of the aerated lung spaces, affecting gas exchange. However, in this study there was no evidence of mechanical lung or small airway issues (due to a similar prevalence of normal breathing reserve in the two groups and similar resting spirometry between the groups). No obvious evidence of gas exchange issues were observed either, because the P ET CO 2 during exercise (to AT) increased by a similar magnitude in the participants with long COVID versus the controls.

Finally, the resting P ET CO 2 was < 30 mmHg in 4 participants with long COVID. Low P ET CO 2 causes similar symptoms as those often experienced by patients with long COVID including feelings of brain fog (due to poor cerebral perfusion) and paraesthesia. The level of P ET CO 2 however did not reach apnoeic threshold levelsin any patients because there were no apnoeas at rest and no evidence of periodic breathing patterns. Low resting P ET CO 2 and hyperventilation is a hallmark of hyperventilatory syndrome which has been cited as a cause of ongoing in symptoms in some cohorts of patients with long COVID. It is possible that problems with breathing at rest and during exercise, leading to lower P ET CO 2 levels and manifesting as hyperventilation syndrome could be partially driven by the carotid chemoreflex in patients with long COVID.

### Urine anion gap can differentiate respiratory alkalosis from metabolic acidosis in the absence of blood gas results [^116E1xMj]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low plasma bicarbonate concentration due to chronic respiratory alkalosis may be misdiagnosed as metabolic acidosis and mistreated with administration of alkali therapy, particularly when arterial blood gas is not available.

Methods

We measured urine anion gap [urine (Na + +K +)-(Cl -)], as a surrogate of renal ammonium excretion in 15 patients presenting with hyperventilation and low serum bicarbonate concentration to distinguish chronic respiratory alkalosis (CRA) from metabolic acidosis (MA) when blood gas was unavailable.

Results

Hyperventilation and low serum bicarbonate concentrations were associated with urine pH above 5.5 and positive urine anion gap in all, suggesting CRA. The diagnosis was later confirmed by obtaining capillary blood gas, which showed a decrease in PCO 2 and high normal pH values.

Conclusion

The use of urine anion gap can help to differentiate between chronic respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, especially when arterial blood gas is not obtained.

### Metabolic acidosis as an underlying mechanism of respiratory distress in children with severe acute asthma [^114BptRE]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

1) To alert the clinician that increasing rate and depth of breathing during treatment of acute asthma may be a manifestation of metabolic acidosis with hyperventilation rather than worsening airway obstruction; and 2) to describe the frequency of metabolic acidosis with hyperventilation in children with severe acute asthma admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit.

Design

Retrospective medical record review.

Setting

University-affiliated children's hospital.

Patients

All patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with a diagnosis of asthma between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2005.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Fifty-three patients with asthma (median age 7.8 yrs, range 0.7–17.9 yrs; 35 [66%] male; 46 [87%] black and 7 [13%] white) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit during the study period. Fifteen (28%) patients developed metabolic acidosis with hyperventilation (pH < 7.35, Pco2 < 35 torr [4.6 kPa], and base excess ≤ -7 mmol/L) during their hospital course. Of these, lactic acid was assessed in four patients and was elevated in each; all had hyperglycemia (blood glucose > 120 mg/dL [6.7 mmol/L]). Patients who developed metabolic acidosis with hyperventilation received asthma therapy similar to that received by patients who did not develop the disorder. Metabolic acidosis resolved contemporaneously with tapering of beta2-adrenergic agonists and administration of supportive care. All patients survived.

Conclusions

Metabolic acidosis with hyperventilation manifesting as respiratory distress can occur in children with severe acute asthma. A pathophysiologic rationale exists for the contribution of beta2-adrenergic agents to the development of this acid-base disorder. Failure to recognize metabolic acidosis as the underlying mechanism of respiratory distress may lead to inappropriate intensification of bronchodilator therapy. Supportive care and tapering of beta2-adrenergic agents are recommended to resolve this condition.

### The clinical utility of eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation testing for the diagnosis of exercise-induced bronchospasm [^115j4aWJ]. The Journal of Asthma (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) is the acute, transient airway narrowing associated with exercise. Eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH) has been used to diagnose EIB in elite athletes and in research settings. The clinical utility of EVH in a general pulmonary practice has not previously been reported. Thus we sought to determine the utility and applicability of EVH testing in the clinical setting.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 178 EVH tests performed at the Ohio State University Medical Center.

Results

A total of 178 EVH studies were performed. Fifty patients (28%) were EIB-positive. A threshold of 60% of the predicted maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) per minute was used as a criterion for an adequate EVH test. A majority of patients, 127 (71%), had adequate EVH tests. Females were less likely to achieve 60% MVV than males (80% vs. 55%; p = 0.002). Of the 51 patients with inadequate tests, 17 (33%) were EIB-positive; 16 of these 17 were female. Overall, EVH testing was diagnostic in 144 of 178 (81%) of patients tested.

Conclusions

We present the first description of the clinical use of EVH testing for the diagnosis of EIB in a large pulmonary practice. EVH was diagnostic in a large majority of patients. EVH is an excellent and feasible modality to diagnose EIB in patients seen in a general pulmonary practice. Our data highlight the need for further studies regarding the appropriate minimum threshold minute ventilation for an EVH test and to explain potential mechanisms for seemingly different stimulus thresholds for bronchospasm in males versus females.

### A case of hyperventilation leading to apnea and desaturation in PACU [^111AQu5Q]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory complications are not uncommon in the immediate post-operative period. We frequently come across problems like airway obstruction, desaturation, hypoventilation, ineffective ventilation due to inadequate reversal of neuromuscular blocking agents, etc. But hyperventilation as a sole presentation following smooth early recovery from general anesthesia is not a frequent encounter. We recently faced such a case where the patient, after an uneventful general anesthesia and early recovery, developed severe hyperventilation leading to apnea and desaturation. We ruled out and managed possible organic causes and even considered psychological cause for such symptom. Here we present this case as well as discuss the possible causes and an approach to such cases if it occurs in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).

### Effects of acute hypoventilation and hyperventilation on exhaled carbon monoxide measurement in healthy volunteers [^115oDCRt]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

High levels of exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) are a marker of airway or lung inflammation. We investigated whether hypo- or hyperventilation can affect measured values.

Methods

Ten healthy volunteers were trained to achieve sustained end-tidal CO2 (etCO(2)) concentrations of 30 (hyperventilation), 40 (normoventilation), and 50 mmHg (hypoventilation). As soon as target etCO(2) values were achieved for 120 sec, exhaled breath was analyzed for eCO with a photoacoustic spectrometer. At etCO(2) values of 30 and 40 mmHg exhaled breath was sampled both after a deep inspiration and after a normal one. All measurements were performed in two different environmental conditions: A) ambient CO concentration = 0.8 ppm and B) ambient CO concentration = 1.7 ppm.

Results

During normoventilation, eCO mean (standard deviation) was 11.5 (0.8) ppm; it decreased to 10.3 (0.8) ppm during hyperventilation (p < 0.01) and increased to 11.9 (0.8) ppm during hypoventilation (p < 0.01). eCO changes were less pronounced than the correspondent etCO(2) changes (hyperventilation: 10% Vs 25% decrease; hypoventilation 3% Vs 25% increase). Taking a deep inspiration before breath sampling was associated with lower eCO values (p < 0.01), while environmental CO levels did not affect eCO measurement.

Conclusions

eCO measurements should not be performed during marked acute hyperventilation, like that induced in this study, but the influence of less pronounced hyperventilation or of hypoventilation is probably negligible in clinical practice.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^113XiPyq]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### A man with dizziness and altered mental status | NEJM resident 360… [^114fZ6fj]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published January 18, 2023 Anion-gap metabolic acidosis, in combination with hyperventilation with respiratory alkalosis and altered mental status, is suggestive of salicylate toxicity. Read the NEJM Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital here. A: Salicylates activate the respiratory center of the medulla, causing hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis. Tachypnea and increased respiratory effort can be clues for early diagnosis of salicylate toxicity. Salicylates cause metabolic acidosis through interference with both cellular metabolism in the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as through accumulation of unbound salicylate molecules. Tinnitus is a side effect that can occur even with the use of therapeutic doses of salicylates, but it can also be a clue to salicylate toxicity. Q: What accounts for the neurologic findings associated with salicylate toxicity.

A: Unbound salicylate molecules easily cross the blood–brain barrier, which leads to altered mental status, neuroglycopenia, and cerebral edema. Neurologic manifestations are more prominent with chronic toxicity than with acute toxicity and include agitation, confusion, hallucinations, slurred speech, seizures, and coma. Failure to recognize chronic salicylate toxicity in patients with neurologic manifestations can lead to unnecessary neurologic investigations, which delay the implementation of appropriate therapy and ultimately contribute to the higher morbidity and mortality associated with the chronic form than with the acute form. A: Treatment with activated charcoal can be effective, particularly when it is administered within 2 hours after ingestion, but it should be given only to alert and cooperative patients. Dosing outside this window and repeat dosing may be justified in patients who are at risk for prolonged retention of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract.

Urinary alkalization is a key element in the management of both acute and chronic salicylate toxicity. Physiochemical characteristics such as the small molecular size, the low volume of distribution, and the lack of tissue binding make salicylate an ideal substance for dialysis. Hemodialysis should be considered in patients with altered mental status, kidney insufficiency, acute respiratory insufficiency that has led to the administration of supplemental oxygen, and failure of standard therapy. A salicylate level of more than 90 mg per deciliter is an indication for dialysis, regardless of signs and symptoms.

### The influence of venous admixture on alveolar dead space and carbon dioxide exchange in acute respiratory distress syndrome: computer modelling [^116U7dZv]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Respiratory acidosis, simulated by higher PaCO 2 at zero base excess, led to lower VdA S /VtA (Figure 4). Metabolic acidosis had the opposite effect. For the conditions shown in Figure 4 and at a Qs/Qt of 0.4, the fraction of carbon dioxide exchange caused by the Haldane effect varied between 0.2 and 0.3. Low CvCO 2, as occurs in metabolic acidosis or hyperventilation, was associated with low Haldane effect. At a Qs/Qt of 0.5, the VdA S /VtA correlated with the logarithm of CvCO 2 (VdA S /VtA = -0.10 × ln [CvCO 2] + 0.55; R = 0.997).

Respiratory acidosis I and II refer to arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2) values of 9.1 kPa and 15.8 kPa, respectively, yielding arterial pH (pHa) values of 7.25 and 7.09, respectively. Metabolic acidosis I and II refer to base excess (BE) values of -9.0 mmol/l and -17 mmol/l, yielding pHa values of 7.25 and 7.10, respectively.

In critically sick patients, physiological aberrations are often combined. A patient in traumatic shock may have high Qs/Qt, and low haemoglobin and Qt. Tissue hypoxia may lead to metabolic acidosis. Figure 5 shows how VdA S /VtA would increase as a consequence of these successive or parallel phenomena. Particularly high values of VdA S /VtA were observed in compensated metabolic acidosis, characterized by hyperventilation to reduce PaCO 2 so as to partially normalize pH.

### Carotid body dysregulation contributes to long COVID symptoms [^1123sarG]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We also found evidence of elevated resting V T /Ti, an index of inspiratory flow, in the long COVID group versus the control group. The V T /Ti is used as surrogate of primary neural drive for inspirationand thus could indicate a higher 'inspiratory drive' at rest in the long COVID participants which may contribute to their feelings of dyspnoea. High inspiratory flow can also indicate changes in airway mechanics, however, this is unlikely in the long COVID group, since resting lung function (spirometry) was similar between groups. During exercise, hyperventilation or poor breathing efficiency was also evidenced by elevated V E /VCO 2 slopes and an elevated V E /VCO 2 ratio at anaerobic threshold and peak exercise. Since the carotid chemoreflex plays an important part in the control of breathing both at rest and exercise (including inspiratory drive); it is possible that it is contributing to hyperventilation in long COVID. However, we did not directly measure PaCO 2, thus the assumption that the lower P ET CO 2 and the higher V E for a given level of VCO 2 during exercise indicates hyperventilation (and not increased dead space ventilation for example) should be taken with caution.

### Effects of three spontaneous ventilation modes on respiratory drive and muscle effort in COVID-19 pneumonia patients [^111gB2t6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

An increase in respiratory drive has been described for COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe respiratory failure. The strong efforts of these patients are noteworthy and compatible with the development of potential patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) due to uncontrolled transpulmonary and transvascular pressures, such as deterioration and relapses of respiratory failure. To induce hyperventilation in experimental settings, Mascheroni et al. infused salicylate into the brainstem of spontaneously breathing sheep. The increase in minute ventilation produced lung injury, which was prevented by sedation and paralysis on controlled mechanical ventilation. In addition, two patterns of Ers have been described in such patients: high and low Ers. Based on the P-SILI hypothesis and Ers, different authors have advocated for radical changes in respiratory management. However, the respiratory mechanics just before switching to spontaneous breathing or at the time of estimation of the respiratory drive, as well as the relationship between both, have not been sufficiently studied. P-SILI in COVID-19 has been evaluated in a computational model, which demonstrated that inspiratory effort is comparable with that associated with ventilator-induced injury.

Identifying strategies that can mitigate progression of lung injury is of interest for these patients. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the impact of different spontaneous ventilation modes on the respiratory response regarding respiratory drive, muscle effort, and WOBp in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients via direct acquisition of monitored respiratory signals from ventilators: Paw, V´ and V. The goal was to evaluate possible reduction in muscle effort, as well as its relationship with the Ers of the respiratory system (Ers). This study focused on inspiratory muscle activity by calculating muscle pressure (Pmus); we thus avoided more invasive manoeuvres with a risk of contamination and contagion, such as oesophageal catheters. Some of the results of this study have been previously reported in abstract form.

### Mobilizing carbon dioxide stores. An experimental study [^1177MUDh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Understanding the physiology of CO 2 stores mobilization is a prerequisite for intermittent extracorporeal CO 2 removal (ECCO 2 R) in patients with chronic hypercapnia. Objectives: To describe the dynamics of CO 2 stores. Methods: Fifteen pigs (61.7 ± 4.3 kg) were randomized to 48 hours of hyperventilation (group "Hyper", n = 4); 48 hours of hypoventilation (group "Hypo", n = 4); 24 hours of hypoventilation plus 24 hours of normoventilation (group "Hypo-Baseline", n = 4); or 24 hours of hypoventilation plus 24 hours of hypoventilation plus ECCO 2 R (group "Hypo-ECCO 2 R", n = 3). Forty-eight hours after randomization, the current [Formula: see text]e was reduced by 50% in every pig. Measurements and Main Results: We evaluated [Formula: see text]co 2, [Formula: see text]o 2, and metabolic [Formula: see text]co 2 ([Formula: see text]o 2 times the metabolic respiratory quotient). Changes in the CO 2 stores were calculated as [Formula: see text]co 2 -metabolic V̇co 2. After 48 hours, the CO 2 stores decreased by 0.77 ± 0.17 l kg -1 in group Hyper and increased by 0.32 ± 0.27 l kg -1 in group Hypo (P = 0.030). In group Hypo-Baseline, they increased by 0.08 ± 0.19 l kg -1, whereas in group Hypo-ECCO 2 R, they decreased by 0.32 ± 0.24 l kg -1 (P = 0.197). In the second 24-hour period, in groups Hypo-Baseline and Hypo-ECCO 2 R, the CO2 stores decreased by 0.15 ± 0.09 l kg -1 and 0.51 ± 0.06 l kg -1, respectively (P = 0.002). At the end of the experiment, the 50% reduction of [Formula: see text]e caused a Pa CO2 rise of 9.3 ± 1.1, 32.0 ± 5.0, 16.9 ± 1.2, and 11.7 ± 2.0 mm Hg h -1 in groups Hyper, Hypo, Hypo-Baseline, and Hypo-ECCO 2 R, respectively (P < 0.001). The Pa CO2 rise was inversely related to the previous CO 2 stores mobilization (P < 0.001). Conclusions: CO 2 from body stores can be mobilized over 48 hours without reaching a steady state. This provides a physiological rationale for intermittent ECCO 2 R in patients with chronic hypercapnia.

### Dysfunctional breathing diagnosed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing in' long COVID' patients with persistent dyspnoea [^112qNPPJ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

We identified DB mostly without hyperventilation as an explanation of persisting dyspnoea after SARS-Cov-2 infection. Indeed, hyperventilation type of DB with inappropriately elevated V'E/V'CO 2 ratio in the absence of VD/VT elevation was observed in only one patient. In this context, the V'E/V'CO 2 slope is suggestive of a low PaCO 2 setpoint during exercise, which represent alveolar hyperventilation. All other patients presented DB with a chaotic ventilatory pattern. Some of these patients described a sensation of air hunger and presented sighing at rest, which were associated with deep sighing during exercise, as objectively evidenced by CPET. As explained above no other physiological limitations suggesting an underlying organic disease were present.

A classification of five types of DB has been proposed: (1) hyperventilation syndrome; (2) periodic deep sighing; (3) thoracic dominant breathing; (4) forced abdominal expiration and (5) thoraco-abdominal asynchrony. These patterns have been described at rest and cannot be transposed to our data, which also concern ventilation during exercise. Regardless of this, dyspnoeic 'long COVID' patients with DB exhibited a chaotic ventilatory pattern at rest (during the rest phase of CPET) and during exercise close to the periodic deep sighing category. Moreover, patients frequently reported periodic deep sighing together with yawning.

Regarding medical management for acute liver failure, more specifically with respect to management of hepatic encephalopathy, EASL 2017 guidelines recommend to administer mannitol or hypertonic saline for surges of ICP with consideration for short-term hyperventilation (monitor reverse jugular venous saturation to prevent excessive hyperventilation and risk of cerebral hypoxia).

### Acute and chronic effects of aspirin toxicity and their treatment… [^113Uvffm]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Salicylate poisoning remains a major clinical hazard, usually resulting from accidental ingestions in preschool children, suicidal overdoses in adults and teenagers, and therapeutically acquired intoxication in all ages. Alkalemia or acidemia, alkaluria or aciduria, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, and water and electrolyte imbalances may occur; nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, hyperpnea, hyperpyrexia, disorientation, coma, and/or convulsions are common. With chronic, therapeutically induced salicylism, these symptoms may be mistaken for symptoms resulting from the illness for which the salicylates were administered. For acute ingestions, the magnitude of the poisoning is clearly dose related. Blood level determinations are good prognostic indicators for acute ingestions but are of limited value in chronic, therapeutically induced salicylism. Fluid and electrolyte management is the mainstay of therapy.

### Mitigating hyperventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation [^111ALCMk]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Although multiple airway management and ventilation strategies have been proposed during cardiac arrest, the ideal strategy is unknown. Current strategies call for advanced airways, such as endotracheal intubation and supraglottic airways. These may facilitate hyperventilation which is known to adversely affect cardiopulmonary physiology. We provide a summary of conceptual models linking hyperventilation to patient outcomes and identify methods for mitigating hyperventilation during cardiac arrest.

### Ice slurry mitigates hyperventilation and cerebral hypoperfusion, and may enhance endurance performance in the heat [^113vBC9d]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Ventilatory and cardiovascular responses

We observed that pre-exercise ice slurry ingestion decreased T es and rectal and gastrointestinal temperatures before exercise compared with the Con trial, and these temperatures remained lower throughout the moderate-intensity exercise (Figs. 2 A–C). Correspondingly, as per our hypothesis, the reductions in E associated with ice slurry ingestion were observed throughout the moderate-intensity exercise (Fig. 2 E). Similarly, using a pre- or inter-exercise cold water immersion, we previously reported that subsequent E during exercise in the heat decreased in parallel with reductions in core temperature. Based on the combined findings of our present and previous studies, cooling strategies that accompanies reductions in core temperature, whether applied externally or internally, may help alleviate respiratory strain during exercise in the heat.

Regarding the potential influence of gastrointestinal temperature on the reduced E, the sensitivity of hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation was slightly lower (−1.6 L·min −1 ·°C −1) in the Ice than the Con trial, with a moderate effect size (r = 0.42), although the difference was not statistically significant, contrary to our hypothesis (Fig. 3 B). The reduced sensitivity associated with ice slurry ingestion only partially (~34%) accounts for the observed reductions in E. In line with this, E was similar between the two trials at comparable T es levels (Fig. 3 D) despite a maximum difference in gastrointestinal temperature of ~1.2°C (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, the reduction in gastrointestinal temperature associated with ice slurry ingestion is not a major factor underlying the reduced E. A greater reduction in gastrointestinal temperature may be necessary to affect the ventilatory response, or temperature sensors in the gastrointestinal organs may have minimal influence on ventilatory response in humans. Taken together, our results suggest that during submaximal exercise in the heat, pre-exercise ice slurry ingestion mitigates exercise ventilation primarily by lowering core temperature rather than reducing the sensitivity of hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation through reductions in gastrointestinal temperature.

### International consensus recommendations for anesthetic and intensive care management of lung transplantation. An EACTAIC, SCA, ISHLT, ESOT, ESTS, and AST approved document [^1121QSVf]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Lung transplantation — ventilatory strategies and escalation state that ventilation of patients with restrictive lung disease generally require higher airway pressures, increased PEEP, and relatively higher I:E ratios; cystic fibrosis patients should be hyperventilated often with high airway pressures and larger tidal volumes to maintain adequate gas exchange and, considering adaptation to chronic hypercapnia, focus primarily on arterial pH rather than arterial carbon dioxide tension; all efforts should be directed toward success of 1 lung ventilation including optimization of all components of ventilation and managing shunt circulation, with long-acting inhaled pulmonary vasodilators targeted to the ventilated lung; if optimization of 1 lung ventilation does not achieve sufficient gas exchange and severe respiratory acidosis and/or hypoxia and low SvO2 persist, early mechanical extracorporeal life support should be initiated as suggested by the Mechanical Support Task Force.

### Value of arterial blood gas analysis in patients with acute dyspnea: an observational study [^113fQocq]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnostic accuracy of arterial blood gas parameters

Values of ABGA parameters at presentation varied widely in all underlying disorders (Figure 1). Acidosis (pH < 7.35) was found in 88 patients (17%) at presentation. Of those, 9 (10%) had metabolic acidosis, 66 (75%) respiratory acidosis, and 13 (15%) mixed-type acidosis. In 142 patients (27%) alkalosis (pH > 7.45) was present at presentation. Six patients (3.4%) showed metabolic, 108 (60%) respiratory, and 65 (36%) mixed-type alkalosis. Hypoxemia (PaO 2 < 10.8 kPa) was found in 377 patients (71%).

Figure 1
Values of arterial blood gas parameters at presentation. Boxplots (median, interquartile range) of pH (upper left), partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2; upper right), partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2; lower left), and partial pressure of bicarbonate (HCO 3; lower right) at presentation in patients with acute heart failue (AHF), excerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma (ECOPD/asthma), community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), pulmonary embolism (PE), hyperventilation from anxiety (HV), and other disorders.

Evaluating the value of AGBA parameters at presentation as a diagnostic test, we found that neither the presence of respiratory or metabolic acidosis or alkalosis nor individual or combined absolute values of ABGA parameters were able to reliably identify specific disorders responsible for dyspnea or to distinguish patients with pulmonary disorders from other causes of dyspnea (Table 1). Only in patients with hyperventilation from anxiety disorders, pH (odds ratio (OR) 4.50, 95% CI 2.27 to 8.92) and hypoxemia (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.65) provided useful diagnostic information. We found a combined area under the curve of 0.86 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.88) with an optimal cut-off for pH of 7.45. Using this cut-off, pH yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 72% and 75%, respectively. When subgroups of patients with NYHA III/IV (n = 471, 89%), or with oxygen saturation below 90% (n = 117, 23%) were analyzed separately, the diagnostic accuracy did not increase.

### Metabolic alkalosis: a new red flag in status epilepticus [^114EkykH]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study reveals that approximately 50% of SE patients present with an acid–base disorder within the first 24 h of SE according to the Henderson–Hasselbalch approach.

About 35% of patients experienced respiratory and/or metabolic acidosis, likely directly related to respiratory disfunction and/or lactate production. The antiepileptic effect of acidosis is well established: neuronal excitability and seizure activity are strongly suppressed by a decrease in brain and blood pH, with some anticonvulsants, such as acetazolamide, acting reducing extracellular brain pH. However, the prognostic role of acidosis in critically ill patients remains debated. Some studies associate acidosis to higher mortality, while others find no relationship with outcome, or even a correlation to better prognosis. In our study, we did not find a clear association between acidosis and outcomes, but a larger sample size may be needed to detect small differences.

In the first 24 h of SE, 15% of patients showed alkalosis, split evenly between metabolic and respiratory causes. The pathogenesis of alkalosis in SE is less clear, and likely influenced by the overall pathophysiological context. Alkalosis, especially metabolic alkalosis, has been recognized as a common acid–base disturbance in critically ill patients, increasing with invasive therapies like mechanical ventilation, gastric aspiration, and intravenous infusions. In our cohort, we assessed pH only in the very first stage of SE and only a small percentage of patients experienced alkalosis, with no relationship to intensive care unit (ICU) admission or invasive therapies, suggesting their non-primary role in this context.

An increase in pH is associated with the generation of spontaneous interictal spikes in animal models, potentially contributing to the interictal–ictal transition. In this context, hyperventilation-induced alkalosis has long been used to induce seizure activity/electroencephalogram abnormalities as an activation test.

### Leptin deficiency promotes central sleep apnea in patients with heart failure [^115ZUM7a]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Leptin-deficient animals hyperventilate. Leptin expression by adipocytes is attenuated by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Increased circulating natriuretic peptides (NPs) are associated with an increased risk of central sleep apnea (CSA). This study tested whether serum leptin concentration is inversely correlated to NP concentration and decreased in patients with heart failure (HF) and CSA.

Methods

Subjects with HF (N = 29) were studied by measuring leptin, NPs, CO2 chemosensitivity (Δminute ventilation [V.e]/Δpartial pressure of end-tidal CO2 [Petco2]), and ventilatory efficiency (V.e/CO2 output [V.co2]) and were classified as CSA or no sleep-disordered breathing by polysomnography. CSA was defined as a central apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 15. The Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and logistic regression were used for analysis, and data were summarized as mean ± SD; P < .05 was considered significant.

Results

Subjects with CSA had higher ANP and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations (P < .05), ΔV.e/ΔPetco2 (2.39 ± 1.03 L/min/mm Hg vs 1.54 ± 0.35 L/min/mm Hg, P = 0.01), and V.e/V.co2 (43 ± 9 vs 34 ± 7, P < .01) and lower leptin concentrations (8 ± 10.7 ng/mL vs 17.1 ± 8.8 ng/mL, P < .01). Logistic regression analysis (adjusted for age, sex, and BMI) demonstrated leptin (OR = 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01–0.71; p = 0.04) and BNP (OR = 4.45; 95% CI, 1.1–17.9; p = 0.05) to be independently associated with CSA.

Conclusions

In patients with HF and CSA, leptin concentration is low and is inversely related to NP concentration. Counterregulatory interactions of leptin and NP may be important in ventilatory control in HF.

### Exercise hyperventilation and pulmonary gas exchange in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: effects of balloon pulmonary angioplasty [^115orkNj]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Excessive ventilation (V̇E) and abnormal gas exchange during exercise are features of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). In selected CTEPH patients, balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) improves symptoms and exercise capacity. How BPA affects exercise hyperventilation and gas exchange is poorly understood.

Methods

In this longitudinal observational study, symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise tests and carbon monoxide lung diffusion (DLCO) were performed before and after BPA (interval, mean (SD): 3.1 (2.4) months) in 36 CTEPH patients without significant cardiac and/or pulmonary comorbidities.

Results

Peak work rate improved by 20% after BPA whilst V̇E at peak did not change despite improved ventilatory efficiency (lower V̇E with respect to CO 2 output [V̇CO 2]). At the highest identical work rate pre- and post-BPA (75 (30) watts), V̇E and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (P(Ai-a)O 2) decreased by 17% and 19% after BPA, respectively. The physiological dead space fraction of tidal volume (VD/VT), calculated from measurements of arterial and mixed expired CO 2, decreased by 20%. In the meantime, DLCO did not change. The best correlates of P(Ai-a)O 2 measured at peak exercise were physiological VD/VT before BPA and DLCO after BPA.

Conclusions

Ventilatory efficiency, physiological VD/VT, and pulmonary gas exchange improved after BPA. The fact that DLCO did not change suggests that the pulmonary capillary blood volume and probably the true alveolar dead space were unaffected by BPA. The correlation between DLCO measured before BPA and P(Ai-a)O 2 measured after BPA suggests that DLCO may provide an easily accessible marker to predict the response to BPA in terms of pulmonary gas exchange.

### Practical guide to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in adults [^116ehkcz]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Ventilation/perfusion mismatching

The ratio of ventilation (V) to perfusion (Q) is decisive for the quality of the gas exchange in the lungs. Pronounced ventilation/perfusion mismatch (V/Q) occurs in pulmonary disease, pulmonary vascular disorders and heart failure. Therefore, gas exchange measurements are central to the understanding of the pathophysiology of exercise limitation.

Due to gravity, at rest there is a small gradient in ventilation and a much more pronounced gradient in perfusion from the apex to the bottom of the lung in the upright position (e.g. V/Q drops from the apex [high V/Q] to the bottom) and renders gas exchange ineffective. During exercise, these V/Q heterogeneities diminish, because the upper lung segments are now well ventilated and perfused through deep inhalation, vascular dilation and recruitment of previously closed capillaries. The result is an enlarged gas exchange area. In principle, two kinds of ventilation/perfusion disturbances reflecting true ventilatory inefficiency can be distinguished, and these often overlap:
low V/Q regions (incomplete ventilation disorder; shunt effect). The ventilation to perfusion ratio decreases in subventilated but normally perfused alveoli (relative hypoventilation). Examples include chronic obstructive lung diseases (COPD) and restrictive lung diseases (pulmonary fibrosis). As a net effect, hypoxaemia occurs as a result of venous admixture, which cannot be compensated for by hyperventilation, resulting in an increase of P(A-a) O 2. Elevated PaCO 2 is usually prevented by hyperventilation in other lung areas. The different effects on PaO 2 and PaCO 2 are attributable to the different dissociation curves of O 2 (sigmoidal form of the O 2 dissociation curve) and CO 2 (linear form of the CO 2 dissociation curve). Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is one mechanism to redistribute perfusion to better oxygenated regions and thus limit the extent of hypoxaemia.
high V/Q regions (incomplete distribution disorder; increased dead-space ventilation [VD/VT↑]). In normally ventilated but poorly perfused alveoli (relative hyperventilation), the V/Q ratio increases (dead-space effect). Examples include pulmonary emphysema (compression effects due to hyperinflation, reduced capillary bed), chronic heart failure, primary or secondary pulmonary vascular disease, and restrictive lung disease (e.g. interstitial lung disease [ILD] with reduced capillary bed). Overall, high V/Q mismatch usually has only a minor effect on arterial blood gases (more on CO 2 than on O 2 due to impaired release of CO 2 to the alveoli), resulting in increased P(a-ET)CO 2, because other lung areas are overventilated in a compensatory manner.

### Indirect airway challenges [^111Y73z1]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Indirect challenges act by causing the release of endogenous mediators that cause the airway smooth muscle to contract. This is in contrast to the direct challenges where agonists such as methacholine or histamine cause airflow limitation predominantly via a direct effect on airway smooth muscle. Direct airway challenges have been used widely and are well standardised. They are highly sensitive, but not specific to asthma and can be used to exclude current asthma in a clinic population. Indirect bronchial stimuli, in particular exercise, hyperventilation, hypertonic aerosols, as well as adenosine, may reflect more directly the ongoing airway inflammation and are therefore more specific to identify active asthma. They are increasingly used to evaluate the prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and to assess specific problems in patients with known asthma, e.g. exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, evaluation before scuba diving. Direct bronchial responsiveness is only slowly and to a modest extent, influenced by repeated administration of inhaled steroids. Indirect challenges may reflect more closely acute changes in airway inflammation and a change in responsiveness to an indirect stimulus may be a clinically relevant marker to assess the clinical course of asthma. Moreover, some of the indirect challenges, e.g. hypertonic saline and mannitol, can be combined with the assessment of inflammatory cells by induction of sputum.

Respiratory responses and CBFv

Respiratory data for all subjects are shown in Figure 1. Oxygen saturation was always > 96%. After tilt, increased TV accounted for much of the V E increase (P < 0.001) in POTS‐hyperventilation because there was a relatively small nonsignificant increase in respiratory rate. ETCO 2 decreased inversely to the V E increase for patients with POTS‐hyperventilation (P < 0.0001), and CBFv decreased in parallel (P < 0.0001), as expected. There were no differences in the parameters shown comparing the other POTS groups with controls. Maximum ventilation in subjects with POTS was achieved 2 to 4 minutes after head‐up tilt and was maintained throughout tilt. Administration of supplemental CO 2, shown as CO 2, to achieve approximate eucapnia normalized CBFv and significantly decreased V E and TV (P < 0.025), returning them to near‐control levels.

### Is hyperventilation an effective" activating" procedure in routine clinical EEG studies in children? [^114SdEbM]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Electroencephalography (EEG) records of consecutive 275 children (ages 3–18 years; average 11 years; 34.5% females), with generalized epilepsy, consistent with epileptiform discharges in baseline EEG, who underwent 5 minutes of voluntary hyperventilation during standard EEG recordings were reviewed in this study to determine the actual value of the voluntary hyperventilation in routine clinical EEG in provoking epileptiform EEG abnormalities. Of the 275 EEG records, only in 11.6% hyperventilation revealed increased interictal epileptiform discharges as evidenced by increase in frequency during hyperventilation when compared with the baseline EEG and in 0.7% ictal epileptiform discharges without clinical seizure. None of the 275 children elicited clinical seizure during hyperventilation. The value of voluntary hyperventilation as an "activating" procedure in routine clinical EEG studies even in children with generalized epilepsy was questioned in this study.

Blood gas analysis

The performance of arterial blood gas (ABG) or capillary blood gas (CBG) during the rest phase and immediately postexercise adds additional benefit when investigating the cause of unexplained exertional breathlessness. Hyperventilation and gas exchange abnormalities can present with similar response patterns, that is, raised ventilatory slope, raised ventilatory equivalents and reduced end-tidal carbon dioxide levels. However, to accurately distinguish between these response patterns, it is essential to understand whether there is a wide alveolar to arterial oxygen partial pressure difference (P (A-a) O 2) and/or a wide end-tidal to arterial difference in carbon dioxide (P (a-ET) CO 2) and hence the need for blood gas sampling. Oxygen saturation levels recorded by pulse oximetry are not accurate enough in all subjects to allow accurate distinction. If one or both of these are wider than the expected normal, then this is highly suggestive of a gas exchange and/or dead space problem.

Additionally, clinically relevant information on arterial carbon dioxide tension, pH, bicarbonate and blood lactate levels can be obtained from arterialised blood gas sampling at rest and immediately postexercise. The ratio of physiological dead space ventilation (V D) to tidal ventilation (V T) can be calculated by the metabolic system using the measurement of arterial carbon dioxide tension. V D /V T provides further assessment of the efficiency of gas exchange. Although most metabolic systems will provide a calculated V D /V T without measurement of arterial carbon dioxide tension, this is based on end tidal gas tensions and should be considered inaccurate.

It is important that the blood is collected while the patient is connected to the mask/mouthpiece and breath samples are being recorded. The metabolic system must be notified at the point at which the sample is collected so the breath values can be directly compared with the blood sample values. This ensures an accurate comparison between arterial gas values and gases being inspired/expired. For details on the performance of ABGs/CBGs, please see the ARTP Statement on Lung Function 2020.

### Salicylate toxicity | NEJM resident 360… [^116EGLku]. resident360.nejm.org (2020). Medium credibility.

Q: What are some of the clinical manifestations of acute salicylate toxicity. A: In acute intoxication, within 1 or 2 hours after a single salicylate ingestion, at which point plasma levels often exceed 40 or 50 mg per deciliter, clinical manifestations of salicylate intoxication include tinnitus, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and hyperpnea. Plasma levels between 50 mg per deciliter and 70 mg per deciliter indicate severe intoxication and can be associated with fever, sweating, listlessness, and incoordination. At levels exceeding 75 mg per deciliter, patients are at risk for hallucinations, seizures, cerebral edema, coma, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and cardiovascular collapse.

A: Coingestion of ethanol or opioids and the effects of high doses of salicylate itself slow gastric emptying and delay the peak concentration of the drug. Slow absorption of enteric-coated formulations and multiple acetylsalicylic acid ingestions that are separated in time may result in a disconnect between clinical manifestations and plasma levels. Frequent monitoring is required, and an undetectable or low salicylate level should not lull the clinician into complacency about the need to initiate treatment if the assessment suggests a possibility of salicylism. The plasma level of salicylate required to elicit symptoms tends to be lower in chronic than in acute salicylate poisoning, sometimes falling into the upper end of the therapeutic range, because of the large amount of drug previously distributed to and located within tissues, including the central nervous system.

In cases of acute salicylate toxicity, rising plasma levels are roughly correlated with the development of expected clinical manifestations, but such correlations are notoriously absent with chronic toxicity. Overreliance on drug levels can lead to underestimation of the severity of poisoning and delay implementation of appropriate therapy, potentially contributing to worse outcomes.

### Hyperventilation during routine electroencephalography: are three minutes really necessary? [^1171iq1e]. Pediatric Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Hyperventilation induces absence seizures in children with absence epilepsy, and routine electroencephalography studies include three minutes of hyperventilation. We studied the duration of hyperventilation required to provoke a first absence seizure to determine whether three minutes of the procedure are indeed necessary.

Methods

Electroencephalography records of children who experienced absence seizures during hyperventilation were reviewed. The time from hyperventilation onset to a first and further seizure(s) was measured, and the occurrence of absences during the posthyperventilation phase was also noted.

Results

Sixty-two studies were evaluated. Mean time from hyperventilation onset to a first absence was 52 seconds (median 32 seconds). The vast majority (85.5%) had an absence within 90 seconds. Most (68%) children sustained a single event. All eight children with posthyperventilation seizures had experienced at least one event during hyperventilation.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that current guidelines for routine pediatric electroencephalography recording requiring three minutes of hyperventilation may not be clinically necessary. We found that the vast majority of children referred for suspected absence seizures experience a seizure less than 90 seconds after hyperventilation onset, and even more so by 120 seconds. Hence, a larger prospective study is warranted to establish more accurate hyperventilation duration parameters. We also suggest that once an absence seizure has been recorded at any time during hyperventilation, this procedure could be stopped, thus reducing the amount of discomfort for the child.

### Effect of nitrous oxide on cerebrovascular reactivity to carbon dioxide in children during sevoflurane anaesthesia [^111fQzt5]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Sevoflurane and nitrous oxide have intrinsic cerebral vasodilatory activity. To determine the effects of nitrous oxide on cerebrovascular reactivity to carbon dioxide (CCO(2)R) during sevoflurane anaesthesia in children, middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (V(mca)) was measured over a range of end-tidal carbon dioxide concentrations (E'(CO(2))), using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography.

Methods

Ten children aged 1.5–6 yr were anaesthetized with sevoflurane and received a caudal block. Patients were allocated randomly to receive either air-nitrous oxide or nitrous oxide-air. Further randomization determined the sequence of E'(CO(2)) (25, 35, 45, and 55 mm Hg) and sevoflurane (1.0 then 1.5 MAC or 1.5 then 1.0 MAC) concentrations. Once steady state had been reached, three measurements of V(mca), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) were recorded.

Results

Cerebrovascular carbon dioxide reactivity was reduced in the 25–35 mm Hg E'(CO(2)) range on the addition of nitrous oxide to 1.5 MAC, but not 1.0 MAC sevoflurane. A plateau in CCO(2)R of 0.4–0.6% per mm Hg was seen in all groups between E'(CO(2)) values of 45 and 55 mm Hg. Mean HR and MAP remained constant throughout the study period.

Conclusions

Cerebrovascular carbon dioxide reactivity is reduced at and above an E'(CO(2)) of 45 mm Hg during 1.0 and 1.5 MAC sevoflurane anaesthesia. The addition of nitrous oxide to 1.5 MAC sevoflurane diminishes CCO(2)R in the hypocapnic range. This should be taken into consideration when hyperventilation techniques for reduction of brain bulk are being contemplated in children with raised intracranial pressure.

### Oxycodone and aspirin (Endodan) [^115zT6mF]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Serious overdose with ENDODAN (Oxycodone and Aspirin Tablets,
USP) is characterized by signs and symptoms of opioid and salicylate overdose.
Oxycodone overdosage can be manifested by respiratory depression (a decrease in
respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanosis),
extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity,
cold and clammy skin, pupillary constriction (pupils may be dilated in the
setting of hypoxia), and sometimes bradycardia and hypotension. In severe
overdosage, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest and death may occur.
Early signs of acute aspirin (salicylate) overdose including tinnitus occur at
plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. Plasma concentrations of aspirin
above 300 mcg/mL are toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels
above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with
certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. For real or suspected overdose, a
Poison Control Center should be contacted immediately.

In acute salicylate overdose, severe acid-base and electrolyte disturbances
may occur and are complicated by hyperthermia and dehydration, and coma.
Respiratory alkalosis occurs early while hyperventilation is present, but is
quickly followed by metabolic acidosis. Serious symptoms such as depression,
coma, and respiratory failure progress rapidly.

### Severe portal and systemic acidosis during CO-laparoscopy compared to helium or gasless laparoscopy and laparotomy in a rodent model: an experimental study [^116qtPzW]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

So far, no measurements of the portal pH in humans are published, most probably due to technical difficulties and related safety and ethical aspects. Yoshida et al. measured portal acidosis but did not investigate the effect of hyperventilation in a porcine model. Furthermore, Hanly et al. reported a persistent local acidosis of the peritoneum during CO 2 -LS despite simultaneous respiratory correction of systemic acidosis. These results may indicate the importance of potential hepatic acidosis under CO 2 -LS that may occur also in humans. The circumstance of CO 2 -LS leading to portal acidosis that cannot be corrected by hyperventilation could play a role in hepatic immunological and metabolic reactions. For example, a potential impairment of the liver function, as it was indicated by Yoshida et al. in a porcine model, could be taken into consideration when performing abdominal tumour surgery, as there might be an impact on tumour cell growth and spreading of hepatic neoplasia given a constant acidic flushing of the liver during LS. However, it is unknown if these alterations also occur in humans.

The effect of acidosis within hepatic tissue caused by peritoneal CO 2 -absorption and acidic portal flushing on hepatic metabolism are still unknown in detail, but might aggravate the course of pre-existing hepatopathy. However, the effect of hepatic tumour cell growth as a consequence of exposure to CO 2 -LS was already investigated previously and discussed in several studies. We tried to address this question in WAG rats developing colorectal cancer metastases in the liver subjected to CO 2 -LS. Using the same rat breed and equal experimental setup, an increased tumour growth and suppressed anti-tumoural cellular defence were found after direct subcapsular hepatic inoculation of colorectal tumour cells under CO 2 -LS compared to LT. Considering the identical operative setup of the present and preceding tumour-study, their comparison might rise the suggestion of a certain correlation between CO 2 -LS with its associated portal acidosis and an enhanced hepatic colorectal tumour growth, that might be triggered by the potential mechanism of immunosuppression. However, further evidence for direct causality first needs to be demonstrated yet by a joint study.

### Effect of hyperventilation on rate corrected QT interval of children [^114RGqnu]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperventilation is known to cause ST segment changes and QT variability in adults, but this has not been systematically studied in children.

Aim

To investigate the effect of hyperventilation on rate corrected QT interval (QTc) in children.

Methods and Results

25 children (male = 10) with a median age of 14 (range 8.3–17.6) years were asked to hyperventilate for 1 min before exercise testing using the modified Bruce protocol. Mean QTc at rest, after hyperventilation, at peak exercise and at 1 min of recovery was 425(± 31), 460(± 30), 446(± 38) and 420(± 32) ms, respectively. Mean increase (95% CI) in QTc after hyperventilation was 35(19 to 51) ms (p < 0.001), while there was minimal difference between QT interval at rest and after hyperventilation (mean QT 352(± 41) vs 357(± 44) ms). In six children, there were abnormalities in T wave morphology following hyperventilation. The QTc increment following hyperventilation was more pronounced in children with resting QTc < 440 ms (n = 14, mean increment (95% CI): 55 (33 to 78) ms) compared to children with QTc ≥ 440 ms (n = 11, mean increment (95% CI): 9 (-4 to 22) ms) (p = 0.001). QTc prolongation following hyperventilation was seen in children with both low and intermediate probability of long QT syndrome (LQTS). Peak exercise and early recovery did not cause a statistically significant change in QTc in either of these groups.

Conclusions

Hyperventilation produces repolarisation abnormalities, including prolongation of QTc and T wave abnormalities in children with low probability of LQTS. The likely mechanism is delayed adaptation of QT interval with increased heart rate. Thus, a hyperventilation episode can be misdiagnosed as LQTS, especially in an emergency department.

### The long-term effect of elexacaftor / tezacaftor / ivacaftor on cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescent patients with cystic fibrosis: a pilot observational study [^111XEsNL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We hypothesize that patients with CF will improve their physical activity by several adaption mechanisms, e.g. higher myocardial contractility and cardiac output (HR, higher AT which correlate with decreasing values of RQ and V E /VO 2), more effective gas exchange (increased VO 2 peak and VCO 2), lower work of breathing (improved V E due to increased V T, RR and decreased V D /V T), and lower hyperventilation following elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor use. Also, the aim of this study is to define other CPET parameters suitable for evaluating the cardiorespiratory demands in cystic fibrosis.

### Pediatric neuroanesthesia. hydrocephalus [^112j3DEx]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Hydrocephalus, one of the most common adult and pediatric neurosurgical disorders, is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricular system as a result of obstruction to the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Causes of hydrocephalus include congenital obstruction, hemorrhage, infection, cysts and tumors, and associated neural tube deformities (i.e., myelomeningocele, Arnold-Chiari malformation). Treatment of hydrocephalus involves surgical implantation of shunt systems to drain the cerebrospinal fluid. Anesthetic considerations involve attention to the possibility of increased intracranial pressure and prevention of aspiration through rapid-sequence intravenous induction and modest hyperventilation until the ventricles have been decompressed.

### Carvedilol reduces exercise-induced hyperventilation: a benefit in normoxia and a problem with hypoxia [^113KgJPd]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate whether carvedilol influences exercise hyperventilation and the ventilatory response to hypoxia in heart failure (HF).

Methods and Results

Fifteen HF patients participated to this double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, cross-over study. Patients were evaluated by quality of life questionnaire, echocardiography, pulmonary function and cardiopulmonary exercise tests (ramp and constant workload) both in normoxia (FiO2 = 21%) and hypoxia (FiO2 = 16%, equivalent to a simulated altitude of 2000 m). Carvedilol improved clinical condition and reduced left ventricle size, but had no effect on lung mechanics. In normoxia during exercise, ventilation was lower, V(CO2) unchanged and PaCO2 (constant workload) or PetCO2 (ramp) higher with carvedilol, exercise capacity was unchanged (peak workload 92 ± 22 and 90 ± 22W for placebo and carvedilol, respectively). Abnormal V(E)/V(CO2) slope was reduced by carvedilol. Hypoxia increased ventilation but less with carvedilol; exercise capacity decreased to 87 ± 21W (placebo) and to 80 ± 11 W (carvedilol, p < 0.01). With hypoxia, carvedilol decreased V(E)/V(CO2) slope. At constant workload exercise with hypoxia, PaO2 decreased to 69 ± 6 mm Hg (placebo) and to 64 ± 5 (carvedilol, p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Carvedilol reduced hyperventilation possibly by reducing peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity as suggested by PaCO2 increase with normoxia and PaO2 decrease with hypoxia without V(CO2) and V(D)/V(T) changes. Lessening hyperventilation is beneficial when breathing normally, but detrimental when hyperventilation is needed for exercise at high altitude.

### Diagnostic tests and subtypes of dysfunctional breathing in children with unexplained exertional dyspnea [^115Yzdv8]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Inappropriate hyperventilation during exercise may be a specific subtype of dysfunctional breathing (DB).

Objective

To assess whether Nijmegen questionnaire and hyperventilation provocation test (HVPT) are able to differentiate inappropriate hyperventilation from other DB subtypes in children with unexplained exertional dyspnea, and normal spirometry and echocardiography.

Methods

The results were compared between a subgroup of 25 children with inappropriate hyperventilation (increased V'E/V'CO 2 slope during a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET)) and an age and sex matched subgroup of 25 children with DB without hyperventilation (median age, 13.5 years; 36 girls). Anxiety was evaluated using State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children questionnaire.

Results

All children were normocapnic (at rest and peak exercise) and the children with hyperventilation had lower tidal volume/vital capacity on peak exercise (shallow breathing). The Nijmegen score correlated positively with dyspnea during the CPET and the HVPT (p = 0.001 and 0.010, respectively) and with anxiety score (p = 0.022). The proportion of children with a positive Nijmegen score (≥ 19) did not differ between hyperventilation (13/25) and no hyperventilation (14/25) groups (p = 0.777). Fractional end-tidal CO 2 (FETCO 2) at 5-min recovery of the HVPT was < 90% baseline in all children (25/25) of both subgroups. Likewise, there was no significant difference between the two subgroups for other indices of HVPT (FETCO 2 at 3-min recovery and symptoms during the test).

Conclusion

The validity of the Nijmegen questionnaire and the HVPT to discriminate specific subtypes of dysfunctional breathing, as well as the relevance of the inappropriate hyperventilation subtype itself may both be questioned.

### Effects of acute hypoventilation and hyperventilation on exhaled carbon monoxide measurement in healthy volunteers [^114ZdSNn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

In general ventilation patterns can influence quantification of volatile analytes in exhaled breath and should be controlled to ensure representative analyses. In this study we evaluated whether acute hypo- or hyperventilation can significantly influence eCO measurements. This hypothesis was only partially confirmed because hyperventilation decreased eCO, but to a much lesser extent than etCO 2; in practice, eCO decreased by 10% while etCO 2 decreased by 25%. Hypoventilation had an even lesser effect, causing a small and clinically negligible eCO increase (3%) while etCO 2 increased by 25%. We also found that eCO measurements were not affected by environmental CO, but decreased slightly if a deep inspiration is taken before breath sampling.

Changes of ventilatory pattern are common in patients affected by respiratory diseases, particularly during mechanical ventilation; in addition, the procedure of breath sampling itself may induce patients to hyperventilate. Acute hypo- and hyperventilation cause proportional changes of the levels of many analytes, such as CO 2, isoprene, and ethane, in exhaled breath. By contrast our results point out that hypo- and hyperventilation have small impact on eCO measurements; this is in agreement with the observation reported by other Authors that ventilatory changes affects eCO and etCO 2 differently.

### Use of breathing retraining exercises and SSRIs in patients with hyperventilation syndrome [^111zPVv6]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Hyperventilation syndrome (HVS) is a condition that is seen in almost 10% of the general adult population. It presents with difficulty breathing, often in conjunction with anxiety, dizziness and light-headedness. We report a case involving a woman in her 30s, who presented to the emergency room with a primary complaint of shortness of breath and had a prolonged expiratory phase on examination. During a follow-up office visit, she had a generalised anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7) score of 11, consistent with moderate anxiety. The diagnosis of HVS was made, and the patient began breathing retraining exercises and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine. At her subsequent visit 1month later, the patient reported significant improvement in both her shortness of breath and anxiety. Her GAD-7 score had decreased to 4, consistent with minimal anxiety. We believe that early recognition, behavioural interventions and SSRIs improved the patient's outcome.

### Eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation is superior to methacholine challenge testing for detecting airway hyperreactivity in nonathletes [^114JkACC]. The Journal of Asthma (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Response to eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH) has not been compared with methacholine challenge testing (MCCT) in nonathletes being evaluated for dyspnea on exertion.

Objective

To determine the airway response to EVH and MCCT in a population of nonathletes who exercise regularly but have symptoms with exertion.

Methods

We reviewed records for all patients with exercise symptoms who underwent both EVH and MCCT. Presenting symptoms, comorbid diseases, and results of bronchoprovocation (BP) testing were recorded. This study was approved by the institutional review board at our hospital.

Results

A total of 131 patients (mean age 32.3 ± 11.6, body mass index (BMI) 27.1 ± 4.7 kg/m(2), 59.5% male) had an EVH, MCCT, and clinical evaluation performed. Overall, 37 (28.2%) patients had positive BP testing and met criteria for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). There were 32 (24.4%) patients with a positive EVH, compared with only 11 patients with a positive MCCT (8.4%). There were 26 patients (19.8%) who had a positive EVH but a negative MCCT, and correlation between the two tests was poor to moderate (r = 0.11–0.57). A complaint of chest pain and younger age were independent predictors for a positive EVH, whereas a history of tobacco use and a decreased FEV(1)/FVC (forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity) predicted a positive MCCT. A previous diagnosis of asthma was an independent predictor for a response to either test. Discussion. In a population of nonathletes who exercise regularly and have symptoms with exertion, EIB is common. Correlation between EVH and MCCT in this population is poor, and although the tests are somewhat complementary, a large percentage of patients had a negative MCCT but a positive EVH.

Conclusions

EIB is common in nonathletes with exercise-induced symptoms, and EVH is the preferred test for this population.

Clinical Implications

EIB is common in nonathletes who exercise regularly. In this population, MCCT will miss most patients with EIB, and MCCT and EVH show only poor-to-moderate correlation.

Capsule Summary

EVH has not been compared with MCCT in nonathletes without a diagnosis of asthma. Our study shows that the two tests are complementary in this population, but EVH is positive more often.

"Positive pressure ventilation impairs cardiac filling and output especially in the failing RV".

### Cerebral glucose and oxygen metabolism in patients with fulminant hepatic failure [^1119TPvx]. Liver Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Hyperammonemia and hyperventilation are consistent findings in patients with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), which may interfere with cerebral glucose and oxygen metabolism. The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether cerebral oxidative metabolism is preserved early in the course of FHF and whether hyperventilation has an influence on this. We included 16 patients with FHF, 5 patients with cirrhosis of the liver, and 8 healthy subjects. Concomitant blood sampling from an arterial catheter and a catheter in the jugular bulb and measurement of cerebral blood flow by the xenon 133 wash-out technique allowed calculation of cerebral uptake of glucose (CMRgluc) and oxygen (CMRO2). Both CMRgluc and CMRO2 were reduced in patients with FHF compared with those with cirrhosis and healthy subjects, i.e., 11.8 ± 2.7 v 18.3 ± 5.5 and 28.5 ± 6.6 micromol/100 g/min (P < .05) and 86 ± 18 v 164 ± 42 and 174 ± 27 micromol/100 g/min (P < .05). Arteriovenous difference in oxygen and oxygen-glucose index were normal in patients with FHF. Institution of mechanical hyperventilation did not affect glucose and oxygen uptake and hyperventilation did not affect lactate-pyruvate ratio or lactate-oxygen index. In conclusion, we found that cerebral glucose and oxygen consumption are proportionally decreased in patients with FHF investigated before clinical signs of cerebral edema. Our data suggest that cerebral oxidative metabolism is retained at this stage of the disease without being compromised by hyperventilation.

### Identification of a novel perifornical-hypothalamic-area-projecting serotonergic system that inhibits innate panic and conditioned fear responses [^111DTGEb]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Panic is an innate adaptive response to an imminent threat that includes an integrated pattern of behaviors (e.g. fighting or fleeing) accompanied by cardiovascular, respiratory, and endocrine perturbations. One of the pivotal brain areas underlying such responses is the hypothalamic area surrounding the fornix, where electrical stimulation in cats produced panic-associated defense reactions (e.g. piloerection, hissing, and arching of back) as demonstrated in the seminal work of Hess and Brugger. Subsequent studies in rodents determined that pharmacological stimulation or disinhibition of similar anatomical regions, including the perifornical hypothalamus and perifornical part of the lateral hypothalamus (henceforth defined as perifornical hypothalamic area, PFA) elicit behavioral (running/escape) and physiological (blood pressure, tachycardia, thermal changes, and hyperventilation) components of the "fight or flight" response. Similarly, stimulation of the PFA during neurosurgeries in humans produced tachycardia, increased blood pressure, thermal sensations, hyperventilation, and self-reports of fear of dying or panic attack (PA).

### Dysfunctional breathing diagnosed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing in' long COVID' patients with persistent dyspnoea [^1126iSs5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

DB can be defined as a neural breathing disorder originating from the central nervous system, where an abnormal breathing drive results in respiratory discomfort in the absence or in excess of the magnitude of underlying cardiorespiratory disease.

The lack of gold standard to diagnose DB is an acknowledged problem. The Nijmegen questionnaire was initially validated for hyperventilation syndrome and its use is extrapolated in other type of breathing without evidence. Most of our patients were complaining of deep sighs with erratic type of breathing and lacked the typical symptoms associated with hyperventilation and it appeared unlikely that the Nijmegen was an appropriate instrument for the diagnosis of DB in these patients.

CPET is the most exhaustive method for the investigation of dyspnoea as it can determine exercise capacity, as well as the dominant causes of exercise limitation, including DB. In DB, an abnormally high BF for the work rate and an erratic pattern of both VT and BF in response to an increasing work rate can be recognised using the ventilation panels (panel 9 of Wasserman or ventilation slopes) from most CPET software. We also used a specific graph to study ventilation, which plots VT and BF over V'E but without any filter applied which may mask the erratic pattern of ventilation. This allows for a qualitative impression of the dispersion of VT and BF over the test (see online supplemental material). Despite sharing similar symptoms with the DB hyperventilation syndrome (such as dyspnoea, sighing, yawning), DB with a chaotic ventilatory pattern observed at CPET can be distinguished from hyperventilation syndrome. Indeed V'E/V'CO 2 and PaCO 2 are mostly normal in DB with a chaotic ventilatory pattern, while they are expected to be abnormal in the hyperventilation syndrome. The association between the specific chaotic ventilatory pattern of DB and the absence of a cardiac or respiratory cause for exercise termination is highly suggestive of the diagnosis.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^115kv5Ld]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea — physiological mechanisms and example causes are organized into increased respiratory drive (e.g., interstitial lung disease, pleural effusion, pulmonary vascular disease, congestive heart failure) and chemoreceptor stimulation with conditions leading to acute hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and/or acidemia; additional categories include increased dead space and/or acute hypercapnia, impaired ventilatory pump (e.g., muscle weakness, airflow obstruction), metabolic acidosis, renal disease, decreased oxygen carrying capacity (e.g., anemia), decreased release of oxygen to tissues (e.g., hemoglobinopathy), decreased cardiac output, pregnancy, and behavioral factors (hyperventilation syndrome, anxiety disorders, panic attacks). Impaired ventilatory mechanics are listed separately and include airflow obstruction (asthma, COPD, laryngospasm, aspiration of foreign body, bronchitis), muscle weakness (myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barre, spinal cord injury, myopathy, post-poliomyelitis syndrome), and decreased compliance of the chest wall (severe kyphoscoliosis, obesity, pleural effusion). Notes indicate that in most cardiopulmonary disease states a combination of increased respiratory drive and impaired mechanics will be present, and that heart failure includes both systolic and diastolic dysfunction with differing symptom patterns and potential contributions from metaboreceptors.

11.3. Respiratory management after cardiac surgery — supportive measures emphasize that respiratory management plays a critical role in the management of PH and avoidance of PHCs, maintaining adequate lung volumes and gas exchange while avoiding acidosis during the postoperative period is crucial for successful outcomes, high doses of fentanyl attenuate the stress response in neonates and continuous fentanyl infusion with the use of muscle relaxants is recommended during the early postoperative period, supplemental doses of fentanyl immediately before endotracheal suctioning are often used to attenuate the risk for PHCs, brief hyperventilation or sodium bicarbonate infusions are useful for the immediate management of PHC, but prolonged alkalosis may have adverse effects and sodium bicarbonate can also decrease cardiac output and cerebral blood flow and increase central venous pressure and SVR.

### Effects of acute hypoventilation and hyperventilation on exhaled carbon monoxide measurement in healthy volunteers [^114dtpoE]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

While eCO values are scarcely affected by hypoventilation that occurs during measurement, hyperventilation should be avoided because it significantly decreases eCO values. Nonetheless light hyperventilation occurring during measurements may be acceptable because eCO changes are much less pronounced than ventilation changes (reflected by etCO 2).

### A hyperventilation theory of job stress and musculoskeletal disorders [^117W8B7Q]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

There is evidence of a link between job stress and upper extremity work-related musculoskeletal disorders. However, the biobehavioral mechanisms by which psychosocial stress factors contribute to the development of musculoskeletal disorders are uncertain.

Methods

Based on established principles of breathing and job stress and the relevant empirical literatures, a hyperventilation theory of job stress and work-related musculoskeletal disorders was developed.

Results

Hyperventilation (overbreathing) refers to a drop in arterial CO2 caused by ventilation that exceeds metabolic demands for O2. Excessive loss of CO2 (increase in rate of flow of CO2 from cells to longs) that results from hyperventilation produces a rise in blood pH (i.e., respiratory alkalosis). This disruption in the acid-base equilibrium triggers a chain of systemic physiological reactions that have adverse implications for musculoskeletal health, including increased muscle tension, muscle spasm, amplified response to catecholamines, and muscle ischemia and hypoxia. Hyperventilation is often characterized by a shift from a diaphragmatic to a thoracic breathing pattern, which imposes biomechanical stress on the neck/shoulder region due to the ancillary recruitment of sternocelidomastoid, scalene, and trapezius muscles in support of thoraci breathing.

Conclusions

A hyperventilation theory provides an innovative framework for understanding how job stress contributes to pathophysiological processes that increase the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. With respect to the control of these disorders, a hyperventilation theory has important implications for establishing effective work organization interventions and individual stress-management methods. In this regard, breathing is a biobehavioral metric for assessing whether psychosocial aspects of work organization are in balance with a worker's needs and resources. A hyperventilation theory also provides a unique rationale for coping with job stress and musculoskeletal discomfort through breathing training, light physical exercise, and rest breaks.

### Nortriptyline hydrochloride [^115f9Joh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular

A maximal limb-lead QRS duration of ≥ 0.10 seconds may be the best indication of the severity of the overdose. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate should be used to maintain the serum pH in the range of 7.45 to 7.55. If the pH response is inadequate, hyperventilation may also be used. Concomitant use of hyperventilation and sodium bicarbonate should be done with extreme caution, with frequent pH monitoring. A pH > 7.60 or a pC02 < 20 mmHg is undesirable. Dysrhythmias unresponsive to sodium bicarbonate therapy/hyperventilation may respond to lidocaine, bretylium or phenytoin. Type 1A and 1C antiarrhythmics are generally contraindicated (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide).

In rare instances, hemoperfusion may be beneficial in acute refractory cardiovascular instability in patients with acute toxicity. However, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusions, and forced diuresis generally have been reported as ineffective in tricyclic antidepressant poisoning.

CNS

In patients with CNS depression, early intubation is advised because of the potential for abrupt deterioration. Seizures should be controlled with benzodiazepines, or if these are ineffective, other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin). Physostigmine is not recommended except to treat life-threatening symptoms that have been unresponsive to other therapies, and then only in consultation with a poison control center.

Psychiatric Follow-up

Since overdosage is often deliberate, patients may attempt suicide by other means during the recovery phase. Psychiatric referral may be appropriate.

Pediatric Management

The principles of management of child and adult overdosages are similar. It is strongly recommended that the physician contact the local poison control center for specific pediatric treatment.

### A case of hyperventilation leading to apnea and desaturation in PACU [^114gCLcy]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Here we report a case of severe hyperventilation leading to apnea and desaturation in the recovery room. The exact reason for the hyperventilation was not identified despite ruling out its possible causes and treating the probable organic causes such as pain, full bladder, inadequate reversal of neuromuscular blockade, hypoxia, hypoglycemia or metabolic acidosis. However, we felt that conversion disorder was the most likely cause for this hyperventilation.

Hyperventilation in the postoperative period might be due to an effect on the respiratory center of the brain or due to a metabolic cause like metabolic acidosis. One such case reported the effect of normal saline used as irrigation solution during neurosurgery which altered the brain pH leading to hyperventilation. In our case there was no reason for such metabolic derangement. Although normal saline was used for irrigation of the mastoid cavity, there was no exposure to the central nervous system. Moreover, capnography was monitored throughout the intraoperative period and ETCO 2 was maintained in the normal range. The patient was ASA PS I, not on any medication; therefore, other systemic or pharmacological causes of metabolic derangement was less likely. The ABG analysis also ruled out the possibility of metabolic acidosis as a primary acid-base disorder. Also, hyperventilation was present only when the effect of sedation started to wear off and it reverted to normal breathing once the patient was sedated; thus neurological cause of hyperventilation was unlikely.

Emergence agitation can occur in the PACU. It is more common in children with nearly 30% of them presenting with restlessness, agitation and disorientation. It usually occurs within 10 min of recovery and resolves quickly, followed by an uneventful course. Emergence agitation is a possibility in this case as she is a teenager and the onset was approximately 15 min following recovery from anesthesia. She was anxious preoperatively, and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane, both of which are known risk factors for emergence agitation. However, our patient presented predominantly with severe hyperventilation as the primary symptom, which has not been reported as a symptom of emergence reaction in the literature. The hyperventilation was severe enough to cause severe respiratory alkalosis, apnea and desaturation, which is a rare feature in emergence agitation.

### Determinants of exercise capacity in cystic fibrosis patients with mild-to-moderate lung disease [^111EDXH7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Multivariate analysis showed that FEV 1 was the most significant predictor of VO 2 peak in patients with severe lung disease. This result is consistent with data from earlier studies and demonstrates the predominant role of ventilatory disorders in exercise limitation in severe CF patients. Additional functional parameters, such as distension, obstruction, and CO diffusion also correlated with VO 2 peak, but were not independent predictors. The low BR exhibited by our population is another characteristic of the exercise response in severe CF patients. Tantisira et al. showed that the BR index (V E /maximal voluntary ventilation calculated at ventilatory threshold) was the most powerful predictor of mortality in CF patients awaiting lung transplantation. This has also been observed in COPD but is not common to all obstructive lung diseases. For example, McNicholl et al. reported that only 18% of severe asthma patients had ventilatory limitation due to obstructive lung function.

In contrast, the VO 2 peak was not fully explained by FEV 1 in patients with mild-to-moderate lung disease, and some patients exhibited impaired aerobic capacity despite having normal resting lung function (Figure 1). Indeed, multivariate analysis showed that two CPET parameters were the major independent determinants of VO 2 peak in group 2: hyperventilation due to abnormal ventilatory control, resulting in high ventilatory equivalents (as demonstrated by V E /VO 2 and V E /VCO 2 peaks), and BR depletion. Exercise ventilation is regulated by numerous mechanisms, most of which remain incompletely understood. Hyperventilation during exercise reflects a nonspecific response to one or more dysfunctional links in the respiratory chain, but the main cause is not known. In some diseases, such as heart failure, hyperventilation is recognized as a more relevant prognostic factor than VO 2 peak. The hyperventilatory response may be due to several factors, including inefficient gas exchange as reflected by P(A-a)O 2 and the V D /V T ratio. Although hyperventilation is difficult to relate to other abnormalities, the strong correlation of hyperventilation with oxygen pulse and peak lactatemia suggests that central (cardiovascular) and peripheral (muscle) determinants play a role.

### Hyperventilation and cerebrospinal fluid acidosis caused by topiramate [^1141TUJW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of hyperventilation caused by topiramate therapy and propose a pathophysiologic mechanism for this disorder.

Case Summary

A 52-year-old woman with refractory seizure disorder was admitted to the burn care unit with burns over 10% of her body. Her seizure medications, unchanged and well tolerated for several months, included carbamazepine 1200 mg, lamotrigine 500 mg, phenobarbital 80 mg, and topiramate 150 mg per day. During hospitalization, despite a relatively normal arterial pH, the woman developed persistent hyperventilation, with respiratory rates up to 50 breaths/min. Alkalinization did not reduce the hyperventilation. Thoracic contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan ruled out pulmonary embolism and persistent pneumonia. Salicylate and biguanide screening were negative; results of repeated thyroid and liver function tests were normal. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging excluded a cerebral pathology. After cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed acidosis (pH 7.14), topiramate was withdrawn and the patient's general condition rapidly improved. Forty-eight hours later, the CSF pH had increased to 7.26. The woman was discharged from the burn care unit on the 42nd hospital day.

Discussion

Hyperchloremic normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, which can lead to hyperventilation, has been reported as an adverse effect of topiramate treatment. However, our patient had respiratory alkalosis. Concurrent etiologies of peripheral hyperventilation were excluded, leaving central neurogenic hyperventilation as the remaining etiology. Such central neurogenic hyperventilation associated with topiramate has previously been reported in intensive care. Our case report demonstrates CSF acidosis. Withdrawing topiramate reduced both CSF acidosis and hyperventilation. The mechanism of topiramate-induced CSF acidosis remains unclear. According to the Naranjo probability scale, the relationship of hyperventilation to administration of topiramate in our patient was probable.

Conclusions

Normal doses of topiramate may provoke central neurogenic hyperventilation, as a result of CSF acidosis. The acid-base status of critically ill patients receiving topiramate should be monitored carefully.

### Arterial-to-end-tidal carbon dioxide tension difference in children with congenital heart disease [^112dC7V6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study estimated the arterial-to-end-tidal carbon dioxide tension difference (deltaPaCO2-PE'CO2) in children with congenital heart disease; evaluated whether hyperventilation can reduce this difference; and analyzed the relationship between the difference and the oxygen saturation (SaO2) and hemoglobin level.

Design

Prospective clinical study.

Setting

Tertiary health care center.

Participants

One hundred patients scheduled for correction of their underlying cardiac defect with either right-to-left or left-to-right intracardiac shunts were divided into 4 groups (n = 25 each): (1) N1, cyanotic with severe pulmonary artery hypertension; (2) N2, cyanotic with normal or decreased pulmonary artery pressure (PAP); (3) N3, acyanotic with normal or mild increases in PAP and severe increases in pulmonary blood flow (PBF); and (4) N4, acyanotic with normal PAP and normal or mild increase in PBF.

Interventions

All the patients received the same anesthetic regimen. The initial settings for tidal volume, respiratory rate, and inspiratory-to-expiratory (I:E) ratio were 10 mL/kg, 15 to 30 breath/min, and inspired time 40% of the total respiratory period with a 10% end-inspiratory pause. After the measurement of oxygen saturation, PO2, Hb, and deltaPaCO2-PE'CO2, all the children were hyperventilated (tidal volume: 14–15 mL/kg, respiratory rate: 5–6 breaths/min more than the initial rate, I:E ratio: same) to observe its effects on the deltaPaCO2-PE'CO2.

Measurements and Results

The deltaPaCO2-PE'CO2, when predicted from the oxygen saturation, hemoglobin concentration, and PaO2, was found to be greater than the observed value in the first 3 groups (p < 0.001); whereas in group N4 these 2 values were comparable. It was also found that the gradient was higher when there was a decrease in SaO2 and an increase in the hemoglobin level. After hyperventilation, in groups N1 and N3, deltaPaCO2-PE'CO2 was decreased when compared with their baseline values; this reduction was not as much as predicted (p = 0.363 and 0.236, respectively). However, in groups N2 and N4 posthyperventilation, the deltaPaCO2-PE'27 CO2 was decreased significantly below their baseline measurements. These decreases were as much predicted.

Conclusion

The deltaPaCO2-end-tidal carbon dioxide (PE'CO2) can be increased both in cyanotic and acyanotic children. Increased PAP is as important as increased PBF or right-to-left shunting in producing disorders in carbon dioxide homeostasis. Hyperventilation is of little use in reducing deltaPaCO2-PE'CO2 in children with high PAPs and pulmonary hyperperfusion.

### How I manage intracranial hypertension [^115FS2uJ]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

When and how to escalate to upper tier therapies

I generally reserve to patients with refractory intracranial hypertension ICP-lowering strategies associated with significant side effects and potential complications as hyperventilation, metabolic suppression and decompressive craniectomy.

Hyperventilation produces a reduction of HICP by inducing cerebral vasoconstriction and reducing cerebral blood volume. The effect is short lasting and cease when the interstitial pH, alkalotic during the immediate hyperventilation phase, returns to normality. However, because of the theoretical risk of hypoperfusion, I aim to achieve mild hyperventilation, i.e. a PaCO 2 ~ 30–32 mmHg, only in patients in whom ICP remains abnormally elevated despite first- and second-line treatments, considering adding for safety a brain oxygenation monitor. I use more aggressive hyperventilation only in life-threatening cases with the risk of cerebral herniation and death.

Barbiturates have been historically used for decreasing brain metabolism and consequently cerebral blood flow/volume and therefore HICP at the cost of serious side effects including hypotension and infections. I avoid long-term administration, and I generally administer thiopentone (10 mg/kg bolus, checking its efficacy, followed by 3–8 mg/kg/h infusion) as temporary "bridge" to decompressive craniectomy (DC) in refractory cases. I prefer, as third tier therapy, DC that has a long-lasting effect on the control of refractory HICP. DC performed without severe refractory HICP increases the rate of unfavourable neurologic outcome and should be avoided. On the other hand, DC in patients with severe refractory HICP reduces mortality (22 more survivors for every 100 patients treated). At 12 months, 13/22 survivors (59%) had favourable outcomes while 9/22 (41%) were in a vegetative state or in lower severe disability. For these reasons, DC needs to wisely ponder in the context of refractory HICP and it should be undertaken timely in subjects with a potentially acceptable prognosis (i.e. before irreversible damages occurred), considering individual patient's preferences and family's quality of life expectations.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^112JeQe8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Panic disorder and air hunger descriptors — unexplained dyspnea is one of the hallmarks of panic disorder, and clustering of suffocating, smothering, and air hunger has been observed in patients with panic disorder in response to breath-holding and carbon dioxide (CO2) rebreathing or challenge; similar clustering has been reported in idiopathic hyperventilation without cardiopulmonary or neuromuscular disease. This suggests that, in susceptible individuals, air hunger may occur even in the absence of reduced ventilatory capacity, with possible roles for excessive ventilatory drive, impaired perception of achieved ventilation, increased sensitivity to CO2 (potentially with a genetic component), or excessive responses to cerebral acidosis or hypoxia due to hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia. Whatever term is used, it represents a perception that the drive to breathe is not being matched by adequate pulmonary ventilation.

### Oxycodone and aspirin [^116xFh2U]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation

Acute overdose with oxycodone and aspirin tablets can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.

Early signs of acute aspirin (salicylate) overdose including tinnitus occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. For real or suspected overdose, a Poison Control Center should be contacted immediately.

In acute salicylate overdose, severe acid-base and electrolyte disturbances may occur and are complicated by hyperthermia and dehydration, and coma. Respiratory alkalosis occurs early while hyperventilation is present, but is quickly followed by metabolic acidosis. Serious symptoms such as depression, coma, and respiratory failure progress rapidly.

Salicylism (chronic salicylate toxicity) may be noted by symptoms such as dizziness, tinnitus, difficulty hearing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mental confusion. More severe salicylism may result in respiratory alkalosis.

### Haploinsufficiency of TCF4 causes syndromal mental retardation with intermittent hyperventilation (pitt-hopkins syndrome) [^114eaz1v]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

Pitt-Hopkins syndrome is a rarely reported syndrome of so-far-unknown etiology characterized by mental retardation, wide mouth, and intermittent hyperventilation. By molecular karyotyping with GeneChip Human Mapping 100K SNP arrays, we detected a 1.2-Mb deletion on 18q21.2 in one patient. Sequencing of the TCF4 transcription factor gene, which is contained in the deletion region, in 30 patients with significant phenotypic overlap revealed heterozygous stop, splice, and missense mutations in five further patients with severe mental retardation and remarkable facial resemblance. Thus, we establish the Pitt-Hopkins syndrome as a distinct but probably heterogeneous entity caused by autosomal dominant de novo mutations in TCF4. Because of its phenotypic overlap, Pitt-Hopkins syndrome evolves as an important differential diagnosis to Angelman and Rett syndromes. Both null and missense mutations impaired the interaction of TCF4 with ASCL1 from the PHOX-RET pathway in transactivating an E box-containing reporter construct; therefore, hyperventilation and Hirschsprung disease in patients with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome might be explained by altered development of noradrenergic derivatives.

### Ice slurry mitigates hyperventilation and cerebral hypoperfusion, and may enhance endurance performance in the heat [^1142PGHf]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). Medium credibility.

Pre-exercise ingestion of ice slurry, a sherbet-like beverage, is known as a precooling strategy. This cooling effect contributes to an increase in heat storage capacity and a reduction in perceptual stress (e.g. perceived exertion and thermal sensation/comfort), which have the potential to improve endurance exercise performance in the heat. However, this ergogenic effect is not always detected, possibly due to gastrointestinal issues. Nevertheless, how ice slurry ingestion modulates physiological strain experienced during exercise in the heat remain understood. This information is necessary to determine whether pre-exercise ice slurry ingestion is indeed effective for improving exercise performance during heat stress.

During prolonged moderate-intensity exercise in the heat, elevations in core temperature (hyperthermia) lead to increases in minute ventilation (E). Specifically, when E is expressed as a function of esophageal temperature (an index of core temperature), E increases linearly with rising core temperature. The slope of this relationship appears to reflect the sensitivity of hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation. This hyperventilation increases the work of breathing (energy demand), possibly compromising exercise efficiency. Although the mechanisms underlying hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation in humans remain unclear, carotid bodies might be involved, although results are inconclusive. Animal studies suggested that elevated temperature in the central nerves (medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, and spinal cord), carotid bodies, and muscle afferents may increase ventilation. Moreover, an animal study demonstrated that intra-abdominal warming increases ventilation, suggesting that abdominal temperature may also play a role in the control of breathing. In this context, decreases in gastrointestinal temperature achieved by pre-exercise ice slurry ingestion may reduce the sensitivity of hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation during prolonged exercise in the heat in humans, although this possibility has not yet been demonstrated. In addition, reductions in core temperature mediated by ice slurry ingestion may correspondingly reduce E during exercise in the heat, independently of the influence of gastrointestinal temperature on the sensitivity of hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation. However, whether pre-exercise ice slurry ingestion attenuates ventilation during prolonged moderate-intensity exercise in the heat remains unclear.

### Effects of acute hypoventilation and hyperventilation on exhaled carbon monoxide measurement in healthy volunteers [^113sNp4C]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The statistical analysis was carried out with the software "Statistica for Windows" (StatSoft Inc, USA) and STATA Intercooled v. 9.2 software for MacIntosh (Stata Co.; College Station Lakewag, TX, USA). Values are reported as means (standard deviations). Major deviations from normal distribution were ruled out by graphic inspection and by Shapiro-Wilks's test. The Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) equality-of-populations rank test (adjusted with Bonferroni at level of significance p ≤ 0.05) was employed to assess real difference of variation between lab A vs lab B.

Statistical analysis on eCO values was performed with ANOVA for repeated measures; planned comparisons were tested with linear contrasts. Factors taken into account were setting (lab A Vs B) and etCO 2 (30 Vs 40 Vs 50 mmHg); planned comparisons were hypoventilation Vs normoventilation, hyperventilation Vs normoventilation, normal inspirations Vs deep inspiration. ANOVA for repeated measures was also applied to SpO2 values. The factor taken into account was etCO 2; planned comparisons were hypoventilation Vs normoventilation and hyperventilation Vs normoventilation. Finally, pre-test and test etCO 2 values were compared with paired t-test.

### CO ₂, infections, and critical illnesses [^113Ez57e]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

I am writing this "Letter to the Editor" in response to your recently published article entitled "Time sequence of bacterial and fungal pathogens causing infections in trauma patients".

Title: Bacterial infections could be largely abolished by applying known science.

Consider the following:

The normal partial pressure of oxygen in human tissues kills almost all bacteria. Almost all "antibiotic-resistant" bacteria are opportunistic "facultative anaerobes" that can tolerate oxygen levels in poorly perfused and oxygenated tissues such as the prostate or in surgically disrupted or diseased tissues.
Hemoglobin that carries 99% of the oxygen in blood is 100% saturated in blood leaving the lungs, so breathing 100% oxygen is useless.
Breathing pure oxygen is a fire hazard and is toxic to lung tissue.
CO 2 supplementation of inhaled gas mixtures with carbon dioxide beneficially stimulates respiratory drive, reduces microvascular flow resistance, increases cardiac output, speeds oxygen transport to tissues, releases oxygen from hemoglobin into tissues, elevates the partial pressure of oxygen in tissues, counteracts the respiratory depression caused by narcotics, speeds the metabolism and clearance of narcotics, and cures bacterial infestations even without the help of antibiotics.
Breathing carbogen in hyperbaric chambers further enhances tissue oxygenation and should synergize with opioids and antibiotics to quickly cure life-threatening infections.
Narcotics prevent nervous nociception that exaggerates microvascular flow resistance and complement carbon dioxide like love complements marriage. This has been understood for nearly 100 years.
In the 1930s, carbogen, a mixture of 5% carbon dioxide and 95% oxygen in a pressurized canister, was extensively used for treatment of heart attacks, strokes, bacterial infections, carbon monoxide poisoning, asthma, atelectasis, pneumonia, smoke inhalation, drowning, and newborn babies with breathing problems. It saved countless lives and nearly revolutionized medicine.
Mechanical hyperventilation confers no benefits and is inherently harmful because it depletes CO 2 body reserves, undermines respiratory drive, exaggerates microvascular flow resistance, inhibits the release of oxygen from blood into tissues, and causes cellular oxygen starvation.
Carbon dioxide was abandoned as a treatment after the "Leake/Waters" hoax vilified CO 2 as "toxic waste, like urine" to wreck the reputation of the nurse anesthetists who dominated anesthesia service after World War I.
These therapeutic principles apply equally to critical illnesses including ARDS, MOFS, SARS, SIRS, COVID, eclampsia, the surgical stress syndrome, cardiac bypass syndrome, and anesthetic management.
Transcutaneous O 2 /CO 2 monitoring is superior to pulse oximetry because it directly measures the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide in tissues, whereas pulse oximetry uses an algorithm that assesses the reflectance of three different wavelengths of light to assess arterial blood oxygenation. It is readily "fooled" by mechanical hyperventilation with 100% oxygen that super-saturates blood plasma with meaningless tiny quantities of oxygen and causes "readouts" of 100 even while cells are starving for oxygen.

### Respiratory alkalosis [^115XQaNN]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Respiratory alkalosis is an extremely common and complicated problem affecting virtually every organ system in the body. This article reviews the various facets of this interesting problem. Respiratory alkalosis produces multiple metabolic abnormalities, from changes in potassium, phosphate, and calcium, to the development of a mild lactic acidosis. Renal handling of the above ions is also affected. The etiologies may be related to pulmonary or extrapulmonary disorders. Hyperventilation syndrome is a common etiology of respiratory alkalosis in the emergency department setting and is a diagnosis by exclusion. There are many cardiac effects of respiratory alkalosis, such as tachycardia, ventricular and atrial arrhythmias, and ischemic and nonischemic chest pain. In the lungs, vasodilation occurs, and in the gastrointestinal system there are changes in perfusion, motility, and electrolyte handling. Therapeutically, respiratory alkalosis is used for treatment of elevated intracranial pressure. Correction of a respiratory alkalosis is best performed by correcting the underlying etiology.
