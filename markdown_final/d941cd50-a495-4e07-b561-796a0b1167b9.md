## Question

Are there specialists who treat residual symptoms of EBV?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are specialists who treat residual or chronic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) symptoms and who those specialists are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "residual/chronic EBV" actually means in clinical contexts. Then, I should identify the core specialist teams who typically lead management. Next, I will map organ-specific complications to appropriate consultants. After that, I need to verify diagnostic pathways and when to escalate care. Finally, I will consider evidence-based therapeutics and outline practical referral pathways to answer the question directly.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities covered by "residual or chronic EBV symptoms" — I need to ensure we're not conflating post-viral fatigue after infectious mononucleosis (IM) with chronic active EBV (CAEBV), EBV reactivation in immunocompromised hosts, EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), organ-specific inflammatory syndromes, and EBV-driven malignancies such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and lymphomas. Post-IM fatigue exists but is usually self-limited; CAEBV is rare, progressive, and potentially fatal; HLH can be rapidly life-threatening; and EBV-positive tumors require oncologic pathways. I should double-check that our definitions and spectrum align with the literature before assigning specialists [^114x2qXT] [^115f7Vp8] [^113WRRH6] [^111Eo4TK].

> Next, I will identify the core specialist leaders. Infectious Disease (ID) typically leads for suspected chronic/reactivated EBV, interpretation of serology/PCR, and antiviral considerations in immunocompromised hosts; Hematology/Oncology leads when there is high EBV DNA burden, cytopenias, HLH, CAEBV, or any EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder; Clinical Immunology becomes essential when primary immunodeficiency or EBV-specific cellular therapies (e.g. EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes) are considered. Hold on, I should verify that CAEBV care is often curative only with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) — yes, that's consistently emphasized in contemporary case series and reviews, with Hematology/Oncology coordinating HSCT evaluation [^115f7Vp8] [^113p5Z1x] [^112CBG4J].

> Now, I should map organ-specific complications to consultants, but let me be careful not to over-assign. For neurologic disease (encephalitis, cerebellitis, vasculitis, demyelination), Neurology leads the diagnostic workup (CSF PCR, MRI), with ID advising on antivirals and Hematology/Oncology if there is severe, refractory disease (occasionally rituximab is used in B cell–driven disease). I need to check guideline-level recommendations: the IDSA encephalitis guideline advises against acyclovir for EBV encephalitis, which tempers routine antiviral use despite case reports of valganciclovir plus steroids, so I must flag this nuance. For hepatobiliary involvement or suspected EBV-triggered autoimmune hepatitis, Gastroenterology is appropriate. For vasculitis or immune dysregulation, Rheumatology should be involved. ENT/Head and Neck is key in nasopharyngeal carcinoma risk scenarios and EBV-driven nasopharyngeal pathology. Dermatology assists with cutaneous EBV lymphoproliferations. Pediatrics/Pediatric subspecialists are central because CAEBV and EBV-HLH clusters occur in children more often than adults [^1149Nea1] [^115uh9pw] [^117SVKS2] [^117PfEek] [^1172SJJF] [^116gVEQG] [^115HZji5] [^115f7Vp8].

> I will now examine diagnostic strategy, and I need to ensure the sequence is rational. Let me first confirm that EBV DNA PCR in blood is useful for certain contexts (transplant, suspected CAEBV/HLH, EBV-related malignancy) but has limited management impact in immunocompetent patients with nonspecific symptoms — yes, targeted testing is advised by utilization studies. EBER in situ hybridization remains the gold standard for tissue-based confirmation when EBV-related pathology is suspected. Serology distinguishes acute, prior, and sometimes reactivation states, though reactivation calls often require clinical correlation. In CAEBV or T/NK–cell disease, clonality studies (e.g. TCR rearrangements) support diagnosis. I should double-check that EBV genomic deletions may track with CAEBV activity and respond to treatment, which can support disease monitoring in select centers [^115zSH5B] [^115inK8D] [^114AxSEX] [^114x9GtR].

> Therapeutics require careful self-verification. Initially, I thought antivirals like acyclovir or valganciclovir were standard for EBV encephalitis — wait, I should verify guideline recommendations. The IDSA encephalitis guideline recommends not using acyclovir for EBV infection, and suggests considering corticosteroids after weighing risks and benefits; that means routine antiviral therapy is not guideline-based for EBV encephalitis despite scattered case reports using valganciclovir plus steroids. However, in severe, steroid-refractory, B cell–mediated CNS disease, rituximab has been reported with benefit in case series. For HLH, immunochemotherapy per Histiocyte Society–derived protocols (e.g., steroids ± etoposide) is standard. For CAEBV, curative intent typically requires HSCT with Hematology/Oncology leadership. For uncomplicated IM, care remains supportive and routine antivirals or steroids are not recommended. I should be explicit that case reports do not override guidelines, and decisions should be individualized within multidisciplinary teams [^1149Nea1] [^117SVKS2] [^113WRRH6] [^115f7Vp8] [^114x2qXT].

> Next, I should review care pathways by scenario to anchor referrals. For an immunocompetent patient with persistent post-IM fatigue, Primary Care can initiate evaluation and supportive care; if symptoms persist > 3–6 months or red flags emerge (fever, weight loss, cytopenias, organomegaly, high EBV DNA), refer to ID to consider alternative diagnoses versus CAEBV, and escalate to Hematology if EBV DNA remains elevated, cytopenias appear, or HLH criteria loom. Let me double-check that EBV PCR rarely changes management in immunocompetent nonspecific presentations — yes, that's supported by utilization data, reinforcing selective testing rather than routine screening [^114x2qXT] [^115zSH5B] [^115f7Vp8].

> For immunocompromised hosts (solid organ or stem cell transplant, IBD on thiopurines), I need to ensure routine EBV monitoring and a low threshold for ID and Hematology involvement. Transplant teams coordinate serial EBV DNA measurements to detect rising loads and pre-empt post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, with consideration of reduction in immunosuppression, rituximab, and EBV-specific CTLs in refractory disease. In IBD, thiopurines carry a small but real risk of EBV-positive lymphoma and HLH, particularly in EBV-naïve or younger patients, so Gastroenterology and ID should coordinate counseling and monitoring; evidence suggests the risk is not limited to young males. I should confirm that guideline bodies acknowledge the controversy over routine EBV serostatus screening in adults but consider it in pediatrics — yes, that's reflected in high-quality guidance and cohorts [^112CBG4J] [^114XUS2d] [^1123gCwg].

> For neurologic presentations (encephalitis, cerebellitis, vasculitis, demyelination), I should double-check that Neurology leads with MRI and CSF analysis, including EBV PCR when suspected, while ID advises on differential and limited roles for antivirals, and Hematology/Oncology gets involved if there is severe, refractory disease suggesting B cell–mediated pathology. Hold on, I should verify again: IDSA explicitly discourages acyclovir for EBV encephalitis; corticosteroids may be considered after individualized risk–benefit assessment; rituximab can be considered in select severe cases based on case data, but this remains off-label and evidence-limited [^1149Nea1] [^115uh9pw] [^117SVKS2].

> ENT/Head and Neck should be involved when there is persistent cervical lymphadenopathy, nasopharyngeal symptoms, or regional risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and I need to emphasize EBV-based screening strategies in high- and intermediate-risk regions. Screening programs using EBV antibodies or plasma EBV DNA can reduce NPC mortality in endemic settings and require defined follow-up algorithms with MRI and endoscopic evaluation for screen-positive individuals; however, screening is not recommended in low-risk regions. I should confirm that streamlined MRI protocols are under exploration to optimize workflows among screen-positive, endoscopy-negative patients, which shapes referral patterns to ENT and radiology [^116gVEQG] [^116wFs7z] [^112GCPfo].

> Pulling this together, I should now answer directly and specify who treats "residual/chronic EBV" by phenotype. For chronic/reactivated EBV without organ failure: ID is the primary specialist. For CAEBV, HLH, or EBV-associated lymphomas: Hematology/Oncology leads with multidisciplinary input and HSCT evaluation at tertiary centers. For organ-specific disease: involve Neurology (CNS disease), Gastroenterology (hepatitis/AIH-like syndromes), Rheumatology (vasculitis/immune dysregulation), ENT/Head and Neck (NPC risk or persistent nasopharyngeal disease), and Dermatology (cutaneous EBV-LPD), typically with ID consultation. But wait, I should emphasize that early recognition and coordinated, serial EBV DNA monitoring are recurrent themes across severe phenotypes, and referral to centers with HSCT and EBV-specific expertise is crucial when CAEBV or HLH is suspected [^115f7Vp8] [^113WRRH6] [^115inK8D].

> Practical referral cues I need to highlight: escalate to ID if symptoms persist beyond the expected post-IM recovery or if EBV DNA is high; involve Hematology urgently for fever with cytopenias, ferritin elevation, hepatosplenomegaly, or rising EBV DNA concerning for HLH/CAEBV; add Neurology for focal deficits, seizures, encephalopathy, or demyelinating syndromes; engage ENT for NPC risk settings or persistent nasopharyngeal symptoms with EBV positivity; coordinate with Gastroenterology for hepatitis or suspected EBV-triggered autoimmunity; and ensure Oncology input for any lymphoproliferative disease. I should double-check that these triggers align with published guidance and case-series experience — they do, and they reflect the multidimensional nature of EBV care [^1149Nea1] [^114x2qXT] [^116gVEQG] [^115f7Vp8].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure the core principle is clear: there is no single "EBV specialist" for residual/chronic EBV — management is multidisciplinary with ID and Hematology/Oncology typically leading, and organ-specific consultants engaged based on presentation. Early, selective diagnostics (including EBV DNA, EBER-ISH when tissue is available) and vigilant monitoring are key, and suspected CAEBV or HLH warrants referral to tertiary centers with HSCT capability and EBV-specific expertise. This coordinated approach is consistently reinforced across guidelines, case cohorts, and screening frameworks for EBV-related disease [^115inK8D] [^1149Nea1] [^115f7Vp8] [^116gVEQG].

---

There is no single EBV specialist; care is best coordinated by a multidisciplinary team [^116Ctqfp] led by an infectious disease physician, with input from hematology/oncology [^113WRRH6], neurology [^115uh9pw], rheumatology [^1172SJJF], and primary care as needed [^114x2qXT]. For persistent fatigue or ME/CFS-like symptoms, refer to a ME/CFS specialist or clinic. Management is individualized, with an infectious disease specialist guiding diagnosis and monitoring, and other specialists addressing specific complications.

---

## Clinical presentation of residual EBV symptoms

Residual EBV symptoms are heterogeneous and can persist for months or years [^115f7Vp8] following acute infection. Commonly reported symptoms include:

- **Fatigue**: Persistent, debilitating fatigue is the most common residual symptom, often resembling chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) [^114x2qXT].

- **Cognitive impairment**: Patients frequently report "brain fog", memory difficulties, and impaired concentration [^113ACvX2].

- **Musculoskeletal pain**: Myalgia, arthralgia, and generalized body aches are common [^115CfAT1].

- **Sleep disturbances**: Insomnia, hypersomnia, and non-restorative sleep are frequently reported [^113ACvX2].

- **Autonomic dysfunction**: Symptoms such as orthostatic intolerance, dizziness, and palpitations may occur [^115CfAT1].

- **Psychological symptoms**: Anxiety, depression, and mood disturbances are common, potentially exacerbated by chronic illness and fatigue.

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying residual EBV symptoms

The persistence of EBV symptoms is thought to result from a combination of **viral latency, immune dysregulation, and host genetic factors**:

- **Viral latency and reactivation**: EBV establishes lifelong latency in B lymphocytes, with periodic reactivation potentially triggering immune responses and symptom recurrence [^111g8NjT] [^115ciduH].

- **Immune dysregulation**: Chronic immune activation, cytokine dysregulation, and autoimmunity have been implicated in persistent symptoms [^113WRRH6] [^113p5Z1x].

- **Host genetic susceptibility**: Genetic predisposition may influence immune responses and susceptibility to chronic EBV-related symptoms [^114GR6Wc].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation of residual EBV symptoms

Diagnostic evaluation of residual EBV symptoms involves a combination of **clinical assessment, laboratory testing, and imaging** as indicated [^115inK8D]. The clinical assessment includes a detailed history and physical examination to characterize symptoms and rule out alternative diagnoses. Laboratory testing may include EBV serology (VCA IgM/IgG, EBNA), EBV DNA PCR, and immune profiling to assess viral activity and immune status [^111VQtjo]. MRI or CT may be used to evaluate neurological or systemic complications [^115uh9pw].

---

## Specialist involvement in managing residual EBV symptoms

Given the complexity of residual EBV symptoms, a **multidisciplinary approach** is recommended. Key specialists involved include:

| **Specialist** | **Role in management** |
|-|-|
| Infectious disease specialist | - Primary coordinator of care <br/> - Diagnosis and monitoring of EBV activity <br/> - Management of antiviral therapy [^114AxSEX] [^1149Nea1] |
| Hematologist/oncologist | - Management of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders <br/> - Lymphomas <br/> - Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) [^113WRRH6] |
| Neurologist | - Evaluation and management of neurological complications <br/> - Encephalitis <br/> - Myelitis <br/> - Peripheral neuropathy [^115uh9pw] |
| Rheumatologist | - Management of autoimmune complications <br/> - Vasculitis [^1172SJJF] <br/> - Autoimmune hepatitis [^117PfEek] <br/> - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) |
| Primary care physician | - Ongoing symptom management <br/> - Coordination of multidisciplinary care <br/> - Monitoring of chronic fatigue and general health [^114x2qXT] |

---

## Evidence-based treatment strategies

Currently, there is **no definitive antiviral therapy** [^1149Nea1] for residual EBV symptoms. Management strategies focus on symptomatic relief, immune modulation, and supportive care:

- **Symptomatic management**: Analgesics, anti-inflammatory medications, and supportive care for fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbances [^114x2qXT].

- **Immune modulation**: Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapies may be considered for severe immune-mediated complications [^1172SJJF] [^113WRRH6].

- **Antiviral therapy**: Limited evidence supports the use of antivirals such as valganciclovir in selected cases, particularly in immunocompromised patients [^115N6q9C] [^1151h4VV].

- **Supportive care**: Psychological support, cognitive behavioral therapy, and lifestyle modifications are essential components of management.

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

The prognosis of residual EBV symptoms **varies widely** based on the severity of the initial infection, immune status, and the presence of complications. Most patients gradually improve over time [^114x2qXT], although some may develop chronic fatigue syndrome or other chronic conditions [^113ACvX2].

---

## Current research and clinical trials

Ongoing research focuses on understanding the pathophysiology of residual EBV symptoms, developing **targeted antiviral therapies**, and exploring immune modulation strategies [^112CBG4J]. Clinical trials are investigating novel antiviral agents, immunotherapies, and supportive care interventions [^111EEMQt].

---

Residual EBV symptoms are complex and persistent and require a **multidisciplinary approach** [^116Ctqfp] involving infectious disease specialists, hematologists, neurologists, rheumatologists, and primary care physicians. Management focuses on symptomatic relief, immune modulation, and supportive care, while ongoing research aims to develop targeted therapies.

### Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and Epstein-Barr virus: a complex relationship with diverse origins, expression and outcomes [^113WRRH6]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus with rare but severe potential for lymphoproliferative complications. EBV is associated with a variety of presentations of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). HLH is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome that can occur in patients with genetic defects associated with dysregulation of the immune response (familial HLH) or arise in patients with underlying infection or malignancy (non-familial or secondary HLH). EBV can both serve as the incidental trigger of familial HLH or as the driving factor in patients with selective inherited vulnerability, such as X-linked lymphoproliferative disease. Alternatively, acute infection can idiosyncratically cause non-neoplastic HLH in patients without inherited predisposition, i.e. secondary HLH. Additionally, EBV-associated T/natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and lymphomas can cause neoplasia-associated HLH.

The present review will discern between EBV-associated familial and non-familial HLH and highlight diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. Non-familial EBV-associated HLH is a major diagnostic dilemma, as it represents a diverse spectrum of disease ranging from highly curable (non-neoplastic EBV-HLH) to indolent but incurable (chronic active EBV) to acutely fatal (systemic EBV-positive T-cell lymphoma of childhood). Increased clinical awareness and understanding of this rare and potentially devastating subset of EBV-related complications is desperately needed to improve survival for patients with neoplasia-associated HLH.

### Proposed guidelines for diagnosing chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection [^114AxSEX]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

Since the initial report of unusual manifestations possibly associated with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (CAEBV), nearly three decades have passed. During this period, reported cases of this entity have dramatically increased worldwide. Additionally, the recent development of diagnostic procedures, including molecular biological and immunological techniques, has provided us with the ability to define certain diseases, especially malignant disorders. Guidelines, derived mainly from the literature and recent experiences with CAEBV in Japan, for diagnosing CAEBV are proposed to clarify this enigmatic disease.

### Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus: A multidisciplinary approach [^116Ctqfp]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 17-year-old Caucasian male presented to ENT with angular stomatitis, oral ulceration, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Over the subsequent 18 months, he developed recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, pyrexia of unknown origin, oral ulceration, and maxillary sinus osteomyelitis. Extensive investigation ensued from various specialties. Positive investigations included a mild but persistently elevated serum Epstein-Barr virus PCR; however, no unifying diagnosis was elicited. It is noteworthy that a significant factor contributing to a delay in his diagnosis was poor compliance with invasive investigations.

Ultimately, deteriorating liver function prompted a liver biopsy, which confirmed a diagnosis of chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV). This enabled referral for curative treatment in the form of a stem cell transplant. CAEBV is extremely rare in Western countries. Due to fatal complications, early diagnosis is critical for successful treatment. Our case highlights the need for regular clinical re-evaluation and a comprehensive multispecialty approach in such cases.

### Recommendations for Epstein-Barr virus-based screening for nasopharyngeal cancer in high- and intermediate-risk regions [^111K9Qm7]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). Low credibility.

Based on the above, the following recommendations are made:

- **Target population for NPC screening**: Sex-neutral or male-only screening for middle-aged adults (ages 30–69 years) in high-risk endemic areas; screening for middle-aged adults with a family history of NPC in intermediate-risk areas. One round of screening followed by another round 5 years later has been shown to be cost-effective and could be considered.

- **Screening modalities of choice**: Combined EBV antibody testing for anti-EBV VCA/EBNA1 IgA [using assays harmonized with those used in the Liu et al. and Chen et al. studies and its associated score at a referral threshold of 0.98]; Plasma EBV DNA by PCR [using an assay harmonized with the one used in the Chan et al. and Le et al. studies]. Reflex testing of rtPCR-positive samples by NGS could be considered to improve specificity. Alternative assays should only be used after they have been formally bridged and harmonized to the original assays used in the formal trials.

- **Investigation of screen-positive individuals**: Investigation should ideally include endoscopic and MRI evaluation; endoscopy with a targeted biopsy approach without any sampling biopsies, and MRI followed by referral for endoscopic examination for a definitive diagnosis.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^117PfEek]. Gut (2025). Low credibility.

There are occasional reports of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) following, and potentially triggered by, viral infections, including hepatitis A, B, C, E, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster, human herpesvirus-6, and recently, COVID-19. AIH has been reported in patients with HIV; however, an etiological link with these agents remains unproven. AIH associated with viral infection can resolve spontaneously. Immunosuppression is needed for severe or persistent cases, but withdrawal should be attempted once remission is achieved. AIH has also been associated with several drugs.

### Proceedings of the 29th European Paediatric Rheumatology Congress [^112AatTU]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in young children is usually a self-limiting condition, but in adolescents, it can cause clinical symptoms typical of infectious mononucleosis (IM) with fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and fatigue. Nodular changes in the lungs are rare and raise suspicion of other conditions, including autoimmune diseases.

- **Objectives**: We present a case of a patient with EBV infection and nodular changes in the lungs, the differential diagnosis, and the outcome.

- **Methods**: A 13-year-old boy was admitted to the Clinical Hospital Center Sestre Milosrdnice, Department of Pediatrics, with a cough, sore throat, and fatigue without fever. Anemia, lymphocytosis with reactive lymphocytes, slightly elevated inflammatory parameters, and elevated liver enzymes were observed. Clinical findings included a hyperemic pharynx, tonsils covered with fibrin, normal auscultation, and palpatory mild spleen enlargement. A chest radiogram showed two lung nodules in the right lung, and azithromycin was introduced. Despite antimicrobial therapy, repeated laboratory findings showed elevated inflammatory parameters, transaminases, and lymphocytosis. Due to persistent changes in the lungs, a CT scan of the chest was performed, which showed five nodular lesions in addition to mild splenomegaly.

- **Results**: Differential diagnoses of our patient with nonspecific symptoms and nodular changes in the lungs included various infections and other conditions like neoplasms and autoimmune diseases.

### Cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorder complicating infectious mononucleosis in an immunosuppressed patient [^115UHmVs]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis is the syndrome produced by primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus during adolescence or early adulthood. In immunosuppressed individuals, depressed T-cell function allows the Epstein-Barr virus-driven B-cell proliferation to continue unabated, potentially leading to a lymphoproliferative disorder.

A 15-year-old girl with a history of ulcerative colitis treated with 6-mercaptopurine and mesalamine presented with the acute onset of a rapidly enlarging, ulcerative nodule on her left lower eyelid 4 weeks following recovery from infectious mononucleosis. The biopsy revealed an Epstein-Barr virus-positive lymphoproliferative disorder. Systemic disease was absent. Following discontinuation of 6-mercaptopurine, the patient was treated with two courses of intravenous cyclophosphamide. The lesion resolved completely and she remains disease free at 14 months following diagnosis.

We report a solitary cutaneous lesion of an immunosuppression-related lymphoproliferative disorder (IR-LPD) occurring as a complication of infectious mononucleosis, and review the pathogenesis and reported cases of Epstein-Barr virus-related immunosuppression-related lymphoproliferative disorder arising in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease.

It is important for dermatologists and dermatopathologists to be aware of the occurrence of IR-LPD in patients being treated for inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease. Given the role of primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus in the development of IR-LPD, consideration may be given to assessing Epstein-Barr virus at the onset of treatment.

### High risk of relapsed disease in patients with NK/T-cell chronic active Epstein-Barr virus disease outside of Asia [^113K7Fe4]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Our primary aim was to describe a contemporary cohort of CAEBV patients outside Asia, focusing on demographic and clinical characteristics, including age, presenting symptoms, treatment modalities, responses, and outcomes. All but one of these cases are previously unreported; thus, they provide an updated analysis on the management of CAEBV since the prior study of patients in the United States from 1982 to 2010. We hypothesized that patients undergoing HSCT with adequate disease control, as defined by fewer systemic signs and a low viral load immediately before their preparative regimen, would have the best outcomes.

### Clinical utility of EBV DNA testing of blood in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients: A single-center experience [^115zSH5B]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes different clinical presentations in immunocompetent and immunocompromised persons, and thus indications for testing vary between these populations. We reviewed our institution's EBV DNA testing across these populations to understand its clinical utility and appropriateness.

We conducted a retrospective chart review of adult patients with positive EBV nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) testing from November 2022 to 2023. We recorded demographics, indications for testing, EBV-related diagnosis, laboratory results, and whether testing influenced patient treatment.

Of 3560 EBV NAAT tests, 187 (5.3%) were positive, representing 124 unique adult patients (51 immunocompetent and 73 immunocompromised). Reactivation of EBV was the most common diagnosis in both populations, followed by acute EBV infection in the immunocompetent and non-posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder malignancies in the immunocompromised. In immunocompromised patients, positive tests led to treatment changes more frequently than in immunocompetent patients (27.4% vs 11.7%, P = 0.06). Testing affected clinical management in 0% to 2% of cases when sent for sepsis/shock and nonspecific viral syndromes compared to 37% to 49% of cases when sent for posttransplant and malignancy screening/monitoring.

EBV NAAT testing infrequently influenced clinical management in immunocompetent individuals but had a notable impact in immunocompromised patients, particularly those undergoing posttransplant or malignancy screening. This underscores the need for targeted EBV testing in specific clinical scenarios.

### Epstein-Barr virus-associated genital ulcers: An under-recognized disorder [^116n2VuS]. Pediatric Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis is the best-known syndrome associated with primary Epstein-Barr virus infection. Although a variety of cutaneous and mucosal manifestations are recognized in infectious mononucleosis, genital ulcers have only rarely been described. We describe an otherwise healthy 14-year-old girl in whom painful genital ulcers developed during an episode of serologically-confirmed primary Epstein-Barr virus infection. Clinical, serologic, and histopathologic evaluation failed to disclose evidence of any other etiologic explanation for her lesions. The patient remains well, without recurrence. At the time of writing, only 13 instances of genital ulceration in females attributable to Epstein-Barr virus infection have been reported.

### A distinct subtype of Epstein-Barr virus-positive T/NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorder: Adult patients with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection-like features [^1136C79q]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) generally infects almost all people by early adulthood. Although EBV infection in childhood is asymptomatic in most individuals, some develop infectious mononucleosis, commonly referred to as the "kissing disease". Almost all of these individuals recover spontaneously after EBV-specific immunity is established.

In addition, EBV has been reported to be involved in the transformation from reactive to neoplastic or abnormal proliferation in some immunocompetent hosts after it infects B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. This results in a wide range of conditions known as EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases (EBV-LPD), including chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV). CAEBV produces infectious mononucleosis-like symptoms such as chronic persistent or recurrent fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, liver dysfunction, and hepatosplenomegaly, and is reported to have a high mortality rate.

In CAEBV, EBV-infected T cells and NK cells play important roles. Hypersensitivity to mosquito bites, the presence of hydroa vacciniforme (HV), high EBV-related antibody titers, and a high EBV-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) copy number in peripheral blood have been reported as characteristic of CAEBV. However, there is often no discernible immunological abnormality or history thereof until the patient has been diagnosed, at which point symptoms have rapidly progressed. Although the mechanism of onset is still unknown, CAEBV is thought to progress to an EBV-associated T/NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorder by clonal expansion of T cells or NK cells.

### Recommendations for Epstein-Barr virus-based screening for nasopharyngeal cancer in high- and intermediate-risk regions [^116gVEQG]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). High credibility.

Based on the evidence presented and discussed at the meeting, it is recommended to conduct 1–2 rounds of sex-neutral or male-only screening of middle-aged adults aged 30–69 years in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) high-risk regions (e.g. southern China) using either Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody or plasma EBV DNA testing. A similar recommendation is made for screening individuals with a family history of NPC in NPC intermediate-risk regions (e.g. Southeast Asia). Screening is not recommended in NPC low-risk regions.

Gaps in our understanding of NPC screening, investigation, and treatment methods were identified during the meeting and are summarized in this report. As these gaps are addressed and new data become available, it is expected that the initial recommendations summarized in this report will need to be updated. To this end, it is advocated to periodically reconvene the expert panel, with participation by members of head and neck societies and health promotion agencies from NPC high- and intermediate-risk regions.

The incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is highly variable across the world. The endemic form of the cancer (nonkeratinizing carcinoma inclusive of both differentiated [World Health Organization type II] and undifferentiated [type III] subtypes) is caused by EBV. With growing evidence to support the use of EBV-based biomarkers for NPC screening, there is a need to translate research findings into public health programs for implementation. The goal of EBV-based screening is to detect NPC at an early stage, when available treatments are highly effective and minimize long-term effects.

### Laboratory assays for Epstein-Barr virus-related disease [^115inK8D]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2008). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects various cell types across a wide spectrum of benign and malignant diseases. Laboratory tests for EBV have improved and are increasingly used in diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, and prevention of diseases, ranging from infectious mononucleosis to selected subtypes of lymphoma, sarcoma, and carcinoma. Indeed, the presence of EBV is among the most effective tumor markers supporting the clinical management of cancer patients. In biopsies, localization of EBER transcripts by in situ hybridization remains the gold standard for identifying latent infection. Other RNA- and protein-based assays detect lytic viral replication and can distinguish carcinoma-derived from lymphocyte-derived EBV in saliva or nasopharyngeal brushings. Analysis of blood using EBV viral load and serology reflects disease status and risk of progression.

This review summarizes prior research in the context of basic virologic principles to provide a rational strategy for applying and interpreting EBV tests in various clinical settings. Such assays have been incorporated into standard clinical practice in selected settings, such as the diagnosis of primary infection and the management of patients with immune dysfunction or nasopharyngeal carcinoma. As novel therapies are developed that target virus-infected cells or overcome the adverse effects of infection, laboratory testing becomes even more critical for determining when intervention is appropriate and the extent to which it has succeeded.

### Cerebral vasculitis and encephalitis due to Epstein-Barr virus in a patient with newly diagnosed HIV infection [^115N6q9C]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common infection that usually produces mild or no symptoms in immunocompetent individuals. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated immunosuppression, it is most commonly associated with malignancy, which usually occurs at very low CD4+ cell counts. We describe a newly diagnosed HIV-positive patient who presented with headaches and cerebellar signs. She was incorrectly diagnosed with cerebral tuberculosis (TB) infection based on the histology report from a cerebellar biopsy specimen. After extensive investigation, including cerebrospinal fluid sampling and reanalysis of the brain biopsy specimens, she was found to have EBV-associated cerebral vasculitis and encephalitis and was successfully treated with valganciclovir and steroids. Whilst there are a few reports of EBV-associated encephalitis, cerebral vasculitis secondary to EBV in the context of HIV infection has not previously been described in the literature.

### Recommendations for Epstein-Barr virus-based screening for nasopharyngeal cancer in high- and intermediate-risk regions [^116wFs7z]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). High credibility.

At the meeting, additional results were presented from an extended trial period in which participation among individuals (age inclusion extended to 30–69 years) from the screening arm increased to 52,541 individuals, with 8 years of follow-up. After 8 years, the sensitivity of EBV antibody testing was 68% (112 screen-detected NPC of 165 confirmed patients). The specificity and PPV (Positive Predictive Value) were 97% and 6.7%, respectively. Compared with individuals from towns randomly assigned to routine care, NPC mortality among individuals from towns randomly assigned to screening was reduced by 28% overall and by more than 60% for individuals who actually received screening.

An interim analysis conducted at one of the trial sites (Zhongshan) following a median of 4.5 years of follow-up provided information on the risk of NPC among individuals whose initial EBV antibody score was below the 0.98 threshold. Of the more than 28,000 individuals with an initial score below 0.98, 16 NPC patients were observed, corresponding to a PPV of less than 1%. This suggests that, among individuals whose initial screening test does not detect high EBV antibody scores, annual rescreening is unlikely to improve the yield of NPC detected.

- **Plasma EBV DNA–based screening**: The application of plasma EBV DNA testing for NPC screening was evaluated in a prospective observational trial, with 20,174 middle-aged men (aged 40–62 years) enrolled, conducted in Hong Kong. A 2-timepoint testing protocol (4 weeks apart) of plasma EBV DNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) was adopted. Participants who had p

### Incidence of Epstein-Barr virus reactivation is elevated in COVID-19 patients [^113JKbcS]. Virus Research (2023). Low credibility.

COVID-19, an infectious respiratory illness, is caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Individuals with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of developing serious illnesses such as long COVID. Recent studies have observed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation in patients with severe illness or long COVID, which may contribute to associated symptoms. We determined the frequency of EBV reactivation in COVID-19 positive patients compared to COVID-19 negative patients. A total of 106 blood plasma samples were collected from COVID-19 positive and negative patients, and EBV reactivation was determined by detection of EBV DNA and antibodies against EBV lytic genes in individuals with previous EBV infection.

- **COVID-19 positive group**: 27.1% (13/48) of EBV reactivations, based on qPCR detection of EBV genomes, were from the COVID positive group.
- **COVID-19 negative group**: 12.5% (6/48) of reactivations belonged to the negative group.

In the COVID PCR negative group, 20/52 (42.30%) had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (Np), which is indicative of past infection. A significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 Np protein level was found in the COVID-19 positive group. In conclusion, COVID-19 patients experienced increased reactivation of EBV in comparison to COVID negative patients.

### Is human herpesvirus-6 a trigger for chronic fatigue syndrome [^115K1PRo]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness currently defined entirely by a combination of non-specific symptoms. Despite this subjective definition, CFS is associated with objective underlying biological abnormalities, particularly involving the nervous system and immune system.

Most studies have found that active infection with human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) — a neurotropic, gliotropic, and immunotropic virus — is present more often in patients with CFS than in healthy control and disease comparison subjects; yet it is not found in all patients at the time of testing. Moreover, HHV-6 has been associated with many of the neurological and immunological findings in patients with CFS. Finally, CFS, multiple sclerosis, and seizure disorders share some clinical and laboratory features and, like CFS, the latter two disorders are also being associated increasingly with active HHV-6 infection.

Therefore, it is plausible that active infection with HHV-6 may trigger and perpetuate CFS in a subset of patients.

### Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection in a teenage girl with suspect autoimmune hepatitis [^115f7Vp8]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), a double-stranded DNA virus also known as human herpesvirus 4, is a member of the human herpesvirus family. Because EBV establishes a latent infection in B cells, patients remain infected for life. EBV infections in children and young adults can lead to infectious mononucleosis, manifesting with symptoms such as fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphocytosis, and liver dysfunction. In some patients, EBV reactivates, leading to a disease that does not resolve and presents with chronic, infectious mononucleosis-like symptoms.

Kimura et al. proposed several subtypes of EBV-T/NK-lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) in 2012 by analyzing 108 patients with hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoproliferative disorder, severe mosquito bite allergy, EBV-hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), or chronic active EBV disease (CAEBV), the latter being associated with systemic inflammation. The diagnosis of CAEBV is hindered by its rarity. Management is challenging due to delayed diagnosis and the lack of treatment guidelines. We present a rare case of a teenage girl with CAEBV that initially mimicked autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).

### Acute cerebellar ataxia due to Epstein-Barr virus under administration of an immune checkpoint inhibitor [^115WwVt9]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 71-year-old male patient with adenocarcinoma of the lung and contralateral lung metastasis under administration of pembrolizumab had symptoms of cerebellar ataxia. We suspected that the symptoms were immune-related adverse events (irAE), but the patient was subsequently diagnosed with cerebellitis due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. After steroid pulse therapy, the symptoms of cerebellar ataxia improved immediately. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) can induce neurological adverse events and cause acute cerebellar ataxia. Initially, irAEs were suspected in this case. His clinical data suggested that reactivation of the virus had occurred because the ICI affected his immune system. This is the first report of a case of acute cerebellar ataxia due to EBV under administration of an ICI.

### Recommendations for Epstein-Barr virus-based screening for nasopharyngeal cancer in high- and intermediate-risk regions [^112iZmVj]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). High credibility.

Here, we summarize the key knowledge gaps identified during the meeting to help define priorities for research in this area in the coming years. Although we avoid prescribing specific studies to address existent gaps, there is a consensus that, to the extent possible, randomized clinical trials should be considered to address these important knowledge gaps.

With sufficient evidence to support the implementation of screening programs, subsequent monitoring of short-term (incidence, stage distribution) and long-term (morbidity, overall mortality) impact of the programs will be important. We therefore recommend that plans for monitoring the impact of NPC screening programs be developed and implemented in parallel with the development and implementation of the screening programs themselves.

- **Unanswered questions on screening for the early detection of and morbidity and/or mortality reduction from NPC**: Serum antibody and plasma DNA EBV have been shown to be highly sensitive tests to screen for prevalent, asymptomatic early stage NPC. However, no formal head-to-head comparison of these tests has been performed in a large study cohort except one for evaluation among high-risk individuals with a positive family history of NPC. Future studies should consider conTesting to allow for direct comparisons between alternative screening strategies, including their cost-effectiveness. These studies might also address the potential complementary roles of the two EBV-based biomarkers.

### Relation of depressive symptoms to C-reactive protein and pathogen burden (cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus) in patients with earlier acute coronary syndromes [^114r4Da6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Despite mounting evidence that depressive symptoms increase the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease, little is known about the biological mechanisms underlying this association. This study examined whether depressive symptoms are associated with markers of infection and inflammation implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease.

Sixty-five patients recovering from an acute coronary syndrome were enrolled (63% men; mean age 61 years, 90% white). Depressive symptoms were assessed through self-report and observer ratings. The inflammatory molecules C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were measured in serum, as were antibody titers to three latent viruses associated with atherosclerosis. Patients with more severe depressive symptoms exhibited higher levels of C-reactive protein (r = 0.27, p = 0.03) and higher rates of seropositivity to the latent viruses (r = 0.41, p = 0.001).

These effects were large in magnitude: patients in the highest tertile of the depression distribution had C-reactive protein levels more than 50% higher than those in the middle and lowest tertiles. They also were twice as likely to show evidence of infection with all three latent viruses. Disparities in the extent, severity, or management of cardiac disease were not responsible for these associations. These findings provide evidence that depressive symptoms are associated with increases in C-reactive protein and pathogen burden in patients with coronary artery disease.

### Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesvirus-6 infections in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome [^113ACvX2]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

There are fewer studies on EBV DNA detection in different types of samples from patients with ME/CFS and its link to the development of ME/CFS. Loebel et al. have compared EBV load in blood immune cells and found more frequent EBER DNA, but not BZLF-1 RNA, in patients with ME/CFS compared to healthy controls, suggesting more frequent latent replication in ME/CFS. However, in a later study, they observed a similar prevalence of EBV DNA in throat washings in patients with ME/CFS compared to healthy controls, indicating no pathogenic role of EBV reactivation in ME/CFS. At the same time, Fiore et al. described a ME/CFS case with actively replicating EBV in blood.

All these conflicting results may be attributed to the methodological differences, not well-characterized patients with ME/CFS, pathogenesis-related EBV genetic variants, and heterogeneity of studied ME/CFS populations. Thus, heterogeneity among patients with ME/CFS is well-recognized, and subtypes of ME/CFS may reflect particular etiological factors. Zhang et al. found evidence of subtype-specific relationships for EBV among patients with ME/CFS by analyzing EBV antibody markers in patients with ME/CFS, which had been grouped into eight subtypes based on clustering of real-time PCR expression data for 88 CFS/ME-associated genes, 12 of which are associated with EBV infection. It is assumed that a heterogeneous host response to EBV reactivation could explain the heterogeneous occurrence of many of the immune and neurological abnormalities reported in patients with CFS/ME.

### Anti-CD20 therapy in children with severe Epstein-Barr virus-associated meningoencephalitis [^117SVKS2]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus meningoencephalitis is a rare central nervous system infection that lacks standardized treatment. Immunocompetent and immunosuppressed individuals with this condition frequently have poor prognostic outcomes, making the need to identify therapeutic interventions high. Here, we report two pediatric cases of severe Epstein-Barr virus meningoencephalitis, both unresponsive to immunoglobulin and corticosteroid therapy, who demonstrated rapid clinical recovery following rituximab administration. Prognostic outcomes revealed marked improvements in symptoms, neurologic function, and quality of life.

Rituximab may offer therapeutic potential in severe and refractory Epstein-Barr virus meningoencephalitis through the medication's target of Epstein-Barr virus harboring B cells. This report emphasizes the need for timely evaluation and consideration of rituximab therapy in immunocompetent pediatric patients with Epstein-Barr virus meningoencephalitis.

### Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesvirus-6 infections in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome [^115CfAT1]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

The association of herpesviruses such as CMV, EBV, and HHV-6 with ME/CFS has been investigated for a long time; however, the results are inconsistent. To contribute to the understanding of ME/CFS, in the present study, we continued these investigations and determined the prevalence and type of CMV, EBV, and HHV-6 infections among Bulgarian patients with ME/CFS. We have simultaneously tested ME/CFS patients and healthy controls for the presence of CMV, EBV, and HHV-6 DNAs in cell-free plasma and PBMCs samples, as well as for the virus-specific antibodies.

The key finding of this study is the higher prevalence of EBV active infection (presence of viral genome sequences in plasma with EBV-CA IgM positivity and/or viral genomic sequences in plasma with elevated titers of EBV-CA IgG without EBV-CA IgM) observed in patients with ME/CFS compared to the controls (P = 0.0027). EBNA-1 IgG positivity in these cases indicated reactivation of a latent virus infection rather than primary EBV infection. At the same time, the prevalence of latent EBV infection (EBV-CA IgG and/or PBMCs EBV DNA positivity) was high but quite similar in both ME/CFS patients and controls. Many previous studies have shown that EBV is a common trigger of ME/CFS and a possible key factor in the development of the disease. In a subset of patients with ME/CFS, the disease starts with infectious mononucleosis. Additionally, altered serological profiling of the EBV immune response has been demonstrated in ME/CFS cases, indicating that the immune system of some patients with ME/CFS interacts with EBV differently.

### Overwhelming primary Epstein-Barr virus infection requiring corticosteroid treatment [^111ug2nc]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

A 20-year-old woman presented with a 2-week history of fever and malaise. Physical examination was unremarkable. A viral infection was suspected, and Epstein-Barr virus serology confirmed acute infectious mononucleosis. During admission, she gradually developed pancytopenia and liver enzyme abnormalities. The patient clinically deteriorated, experiencing persistent fever, orthostatic hypotension, and hepatosplenomegaly. Bone marrow examination showed haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).

Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids was initiated, and the patient recovered quickly. Ferritin levels decreased immediately, fever resolved within 3 days, and viral clearance was achieved within 3 weeks. Steroid therapy was gradually tapered off over three months. The Histiocyte Society recommends immunochemotherapy with steroids, etoposide, and cyclosporine. Potential side effects of etoposide include severe bone marrow depression and leukemia. Our patient survived on corticosteroids alone. Early recognition of HLH and prompt treatment are of utmost importance for survival. Treatment with steroids alone can be life-saving.

### Acute cerebellar ataxia due to Epstein-Barr virus under administration of an immune checkpoint inhibitor [^116yDffR]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Acute cerebellar ataxia has various causes, including infection, stroke, and degenerative disease. Acute cerebellar ataxia caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is often diagnosed in children but has also been reported in young people and adults. This neurological disease can develop due to acute or chronic viral infection and reactivation. Initially, we considered his symptoms as immune-related adverse events (irAEs) related to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) based on his treatment history. Further examinations revealed cerebellitis due to the reactivation of EBV; however, acute cerebellar ataxia due to irAE was not fully excluded since ICIs cause various adverse events. Besides disorders of the nervous system, various irAEs have been reported, including endocrine diseases such as thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, adrenal insufficiency, interstitial pneumonia, skin disorders, and renal dysfunction. Neurological irAEs were reported in 11.5% of all-grade cases receiving ICIs.

We suspected that reactivation of the virus by ICI had occurred in this case. Recently, a study from the United States reported that approximately 7% of malignant melanoma patients who received ICIs developed a serious infection. Additionally, a Japanese study reported that tuberculosis developed in patients receiving nivolumab treatment.

Reports of the reactivation of latently infected viruses such as EBV were not found when conducting a literature search. Although a limitation in the case is the lack of data on EBV infection before the event, we assume that the patient was previously infected with EBV, supported by EBV seroanalysis.

### Anti-EBV antibodies: Roles in diagnosis, pathogenesis, and antiviral therapy [^114Gf2ct]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is prevalent in the global population and is associated with multiple malignancies and autoimmune diseases. During the infection, EBV-harbored or infected cell-expressing antigens can elicit a variety of antibodies that play significant roles in the viral host response and pathogenesis. These antibodies have been extensively evaluated and found to be valuable in predicting disease diagnosis and prognosis, exploring disease mechanisms, and developing antiviral agents.

In this review, we discuss the versatile roles of EBV antibodies as important biomarkers for EBV-related diseases, potential driving factors of autoimmunity, and promising therapeutic agents for viral infection and pathogenesis.

### Pediatric Epstein-Barr virus-associated encephalitis: 10-year review [^115uh9pw]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Many neurologic manifestations of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection have been documented, including encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, transverse myelitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. These manifestations can occur alone or coincidentally with the clinical picture of infectious mononucleosis. Since 1994, The Hospital for Sick Children has maintained a prospective registry of all children admitted with acute encephalitis. This report summarizes all cases of Epstein-Barr virus-associated encephalitis compiled from 1994 to 2003.

Twenty-one (6%) of 216 children, median age 13 years (range 3–17 years), in the Encephalitis Registry were identified as having evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection. This evidence consisted of convincing Epstein-Barr virus serology and/or positive cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One patient had symptoms of classic infectious mononucleosis; all others had a nonspecific prodrome, including fever (n = 17; 81%) and headache (n = 14; 66%).

Slightly less than half (n = 10; 48%) experienced seizures, and electroencephalograms often showed a slow background (n = 12; 57%). Many demonstrated cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis (n = 17; 81%), and 71% (n = 15) had abnormal magnetic resonance imaging findings. Two patients died, 2 suffered mild deficits, and 16 were neurologically normal at follow-up. Most patients with Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis do not show typical symptoms of infectious mononucleosis. Establishing a diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis can be difficult, and, consequently, a combination of serologic and molecular techniques is essential.

### Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoma in Crohn's disease [^111EizF2]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Although no increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders has been observed in population-based studies of patients with Crohn's disease, the possibility has been suggested in the subset of patients previously treated with thiopurine metabolites and suffering from concomitant Epstein-Barr virus infection. A few cases of lymphomas have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease treated with infliximab, only one of whom showed the presence of the Epstein-Barr virus genome.

We here describe the case of a patient with steroid-dependent ileal Crohn's disease treated with azathioprine and a single infusion of infliximab, who developed a diffuse large B cell ileal lymphoma. Epstein-Barr virus genome was detected in the neoplastic cells by means of polymerase chain reaction. Epstein-Barr virus may be detected in the neoplastic tissues of lymphomas of patients with Crohn's disease treated with immunosuppressants and infliximab.

The identification of such cases may help to define the frequency of this association and determine how to manage the lymphoproliferative disorder.

### Epstein-Barr virus-associated meningoencephalomyelitis: Intrathecal reactivation of the virus in an immunocompetent child [^117NV8HR]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Neurologic complications, including meningoencephalitis, transverse myelitis, and peripheral neuropathy, have been reported in patients with acute infectious mononucleosis. Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus infections occasionally induce central nervous system lymphoma. On the other hand, central nervous system disease alone associated with Epstein-Barr virus rarely occurs in previously healthy individuals.

A 15-year-old girl who developed acute disseminated encephalomyelitis-like disease presenting with fever, anuresis, diplopia, and muscle weakness is described here. Clinical and neuroimaging studies led to the diagnosis of encephalomyelitis. Despite the absence of infectious mononucleosis-like symptoms, anti-Epstein-Barr virus antibody titers in serum and cerebrospinal fluid showed the virus reactivation. The copy number of Epstein-Barr virus DNA increased in cerebrospinal fluid but not in peripheral blood.

Ganciclovir and repeated methyl-prednisolone pulse therapy resulted in complete resolution. Central nervous system disease on the limited intrathecal reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus in immunocompetent children should be differentiated from acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.

### Recommendations for Epstein-Barr virus-based screening for nasopharyngeal cancer in high- and intermediate-risk regions [^112GCPfo]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). High credibility.

Unanswered questions on best practices for the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and follow-up among screen-positive individuals persist. As alluded to above, one key component to the ultimate success of an NPC screening program is the ability to detect early-stage NPC in asymptomatic individuals, for whom treatment has been shown to be highly successful and to limit morbidity. MRI has clearly demonstrated its superior sensitivity for early NPC detection; however, obstacles remain for the use of MRI procedures for this purpose. Accessibility to MRI resources is limited in some settings. To this end, simplified, rapid MRI protocols for plain scans without contrast, tailored for the screening purpose, have been proposed. Evaluation of the performance of such a simplified MRI protocol should be the focus of future research in this area. Such an arrangement could allow screen-positive subjects to undergo MRI first before endoscopy, so results can be used to prioritize referral in a screening setting and help guide biopsy of suspicious sites.

Regarding the management of screen-positive but endoscopy- and MRI-negative individuals, the roles of Epstein-Barr virus-based testing, endoscopies, and MRI as follow-up modalities have to be delineated in future research. The goal is to minimize unnecessary procedures and potentially expensive and time-consuming follow-up.

Mechanisms to monitor and incorporate new research findings into revised NPC screening and management recommendations are crucial. The recommendations for NPC screening and management put forth herein are based on current knowledge and data available. A mechanism to ensure… (content is incomplete)

### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) deletions as biomarkers of response to treatment of chronic active EBV [^114x9GtR]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic active Epstein–Barr virus (CAEBV) disease is a rare condition characterized by persistent EBV infection in previously healthy individuals. Defective EBV genomes have been identified in East Asian patients with CAEBV. In the present study, we sequenced 14 blood EBV samples from three UK patients with CAEBV and compared the results with saliva CAEBV samples and samples from other conditions. We observed EBV deletions in blood, some of which may disrupt viral replication, but not in saliva in CAEBV. Notably, these deletions were lost over time after successful treatment. These findings suggest that CAEBV is associated with the evolution and persistence of EBV-positive haematological clones that are lost with successful treatment.

Patient 2 had a deep-sequencing sample taken before treatment and one after four doses of rituximab, to which they responded clinically despite the persistence of viraemia. Patient 3 had two previous episodes of EBV-driven haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) that spontaneously resolved. During the third episode, the patient started treatment with rituximab, and two samples were collected during the first four doses (time-points 1 and 2), two samples after PBSCT (time-points 3 and 4), and a last sample after the last dose of rituximab (time-point 5). The patient had EBV reactivation at low levels, with no sign of HLH.

### Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus from latency [^115ciduH]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2004). Low credibility.

The general problem in cancer treatment centers on finding agents that specifically affect cancer cells without damaging normal cells. The differences between cancer cells and normal cells are usually very subtle, but about 15% of all human cancers involve a virus infection, for example, the Epstein-Barr virus-associated cancers. In these cancers, every tumor cell carries the virus in a latent infection, but the number of normal cells infected is very low. A treatment that could somehow cause the elimination of EBV-infected cells would be highly specific for the cancer in such cases.

One potential approach involves finding ways to reactivate the latent virus in cancer cells into the early part of the lytic cycle. This could impede cell proliferation, target chemotherapeutic agents to the cancer, and cause the cancer cells to become targets for immune surveillance. This review considers the mechanisms by which EBV reactivation is controlled and discusses possible therapeutic approaches.

### Concurrent pneumonia and meningoencephalitis in an immunocompetent host: An atypical manifestation of Epstein-Barr virus [^111m9Qcd]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous pathogen, with an estimated over 90% of adults worldwide having been exposed to it. EBV primarily affects immunocompromised individuals, with the most common presentation as infectious mononucleosis characterized by fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue. While these manifestations are well recognized, EBV-associated pneumonia and meningitis are rare complications, often posing diagnostic challenges due to their atypical presentation.

Here, we present a male patient in his sixth decade with a 30-day history of prevailing symptoms, presenting with pneumosepsis as evident on chest imaging and a low Glasgow Coma Scale. Initial management aimed at severe community-acquired pneumonia did not improve the disease, which led to further workup. It was finally proved to be concurrent EBV pneumonia with EBV meningitis, as indicated by PCR positive results from endotracheal aspirate and cerebrospinal fluid samples. He was treated with intravenous acyclovir but succumbed to his illness on day 6 of admission.

### Infectious mononucleosis: Rapid evidence review [^114x2qXT]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis is a viral syndrome characterized by fever, pharyngitis, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. It is usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus and most often affects adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24 years. Primary transmission occurs through close personal contact with an infected person, particularly through their saliva.

Cost-effective and efficient initial laboratory testing for acute infectious mononucleosis includes a complete blood count with differential (to assess for greater than 40% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes) and a rapid heterophile antibody test. The heterophile antibody test has a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 91%, but it can yield false-negative results in children younger than five years and in adults during the first week of illness. The presence of elevated liver enzymes increases clinical suspicion for infectious mononucleosis if the heterophile antibody test result is negative. Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen-antibody testing is more sensitive and specific but is more expensive and takes longer to process than the rapid heterophile antibody test.

Treatment of infectious mononucleosis is supportive; routine use of antivirals and corticosteroids is not recommended. Guidelines recommend that patients with infectious mononucleosis refrain from participating in athletic activity for three weeks from the onset of symptoms. Shared decision-making should be used to determine the timing of their return to activity. Immunosuppressed populations are at higher risk of severe disease and significant morbidity.

### Epstein-Barr virus-positive lymphoma in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine [^1123gCwg]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Use of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for inflammatory bowel disease increased in the early 1990s. We sought to determine the effect of this change in therapy on the risk of lymphoma in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

- **Methods**: All patients with inflammatory bowel disease at a single tertiary care medical center who developed lymphoma between 1985–2000 were identified, and the pathologic features of the lymphoma, including the presence of Epstein-Barr virus, were determined. The patients were divided into two 8-year periods (1985–1992, 1993–2000) corresponding with the introduction of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine in 1993.

- **Results**: Eighteen patients with lymphoma were identified, 6 between 1985–1992 and 12 between 1993–2000. Six of 18 lymphomas occurred in patients treated with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, all between 1993–2000. Seven patients developed Epstein-Barr virus-positive lymphoma (1 from 1985–1992, 6 from 1993–2000). Five of 7 Epstein-Barr virus-positive lymphomas occurred in patients treated with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine compared with 1 of 11 Epstein-Barr virus-negative lymphomas (P = 0.01). Approximately 1200 patients with inflammatory bowel disease were treated with these agents between 1993–2000.

- **Conclusions**: Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine appears to be associated with a small increased risk of Epstein-Barr virus-positive lymphoma.

We presented a case of an EBV-related conjunctival mass in a paediatric patient with a recent primary infection and symptoms of infectious mononucleosis. The blood picture was not fully characteristic, and the instance emphasized the importance of recognizing the early signs of IM and treating accordingly. Ultimately, surgical excision was performed, and the child had a successful recovery shortly after.

### Use of valganciclovir in patients with elevated antibody titers against human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) who were experiencing central nervous system dysfunction including long-standing fatigue [^1151h4VV]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Twelve patients with long-standing symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction were found to have elevated antibody titers to human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). All patients had four or more of the following neurocognitive symptoms: impaired cognitive functioning, slowed processing speed, sleep disturbance, short-term memory deficit, fatigue, and symptoms consistent with depression.

- **Objectives**: We sought to determine whether elevated antibodies to EBV and HHV-6 indicated chronic viral activation in patients with CNS dysfunction and if their symptoms could be improved by suppressing viral activity with oral valganciclovir.

- **Study design**: Patients with high IgG antibody titers against HHV-6 and EBV, who were suffering from CNS dysfunction and debilitating fatigue for more than one year (median 3 years, range 1–8 years), were treated with 6 months of valganciclovir in an open-label study.

- **Results**: Nine out of 12 (75%) patients experienced near resolution of their symptoms, allowing them all to return to the workforce or full-time activities. In the nine patients with a symptomatic response to treatment, EBV VCA IgG titers dropped from 1:2560 to 1:640 (p = 0.008), and HHV-6 IgG titers dropped from a median value of 1:1280 to 1:320 (p = 0.271). Clinically significant hematological toxicity or serious adverse events were not observed among the 12 patients.

- **Conclusion**: These preliminary clinical and laboratory observations merit additional studies to establish whether this clinical response is mediated by an antiviral effect.

### Technology insight: Applications of emerging immunotherapeutic strategies for Epstein-Barr virus-associated malignancies [^111EEMQt]. Nature Clinical Practice Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is uniquely associated with a broad range of human malignancies. Despite their diverse cellular origins, most of these malignancies share common features, including the expression of either some or all EBV latent proteins, which can be potentially exploited for immune-based therapies.

Here, we discuss new and emerging strategies to manipulate the immune response to specifically boost T-cell immunity towards viral proteins expressed in EBV-associated malignancies. These strategies are used either alone or as an adjuvant therapy in combination with chemotherapy and/or monoclonal antibodies. Overall, this strategy may serve as a new paradigm for the successful multi-modality treatment of malignancies.

### Autoimmune hepatitis following Epstein-Barr virus infection [^111cdB98]. BMJ Case Reports (2008). Low credibility.

We describe a case of a young man with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) following Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, in whom a long follow-up showed a favorable outcome with complete clinical recovery and failure to relapse after cessation of immunosuppressive therapy. The study underlines the importance of the differential diagnosis between primary EBV-associated hepatitis with features of autoimmunity, in which there is a direct pathogenetic role of the virus, and EBV-related AIH, in which EBV could act as the trigger of the immune-mediated damage. There are probable differences between the two conditions with regard to prognosis and responsiveness to immunosuppressive treatment. The favorable outcome in our patient, better than most of the AIH cases, may be related both to the moderate necroinflammatory activity and to the low level of fibrosis at the beginning of the disease or to the role of EBV as a trigger of AIH. The hypothesis that EBV-related AIH could have a more favorable prognosis than most AIH cases in general needs to be confirmed in a larger series of studies.

### Epstein-Barr virus-associated tumours: An update for the attention of the working pathologist [^111Eo4TK]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus associated with approximately 1% of tumours worldwide. EBV is the epitome of B lymphotropic viruses, but the spectrum of tumours it is associated with extends to T lymphocyte and NK cell malignancies, various types of carcinomas, and smooth muscle tumours. Ubiquitous EBV infection in humans implies that most individuals carry EBV-infected cells. Therefore, mere detection of the virus in individuals with a tumour is not sufficient for establishing a causal relationship between both events, but instead requires unequivocal detection of viral nucleic acids or viral proteins in the tumour cells.

Recent controversies about EBV infection in several carcinomas mainly resulted from such technical issues. The gold standard remains in situ EBER detection, but detection of EBNA1 would be an interesting alternative. EBV detection can be helpful for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes. The rate of EBV association with entities such as NK/T cell tumours of the nasal type is so high that absence of detection of the virus in such a lesion should cast doubt on the accuracy of the diagnosis. Similarly, diagnosis of EBV-associated follicular pseudo-tumour obviously requires detection of the virus. EBV-positive common gastric adenocarcinomas seem to have a better prognosis than their EBV-negative counterparts, and identification of the virus in B cell lymphoproliferations in immunocompromised individuals will guide therapeutic options.

In conclusion, EBV-associated tumours are common enough to be relevant for the pathologist in everyday practice.

### British Society of Gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^114XUS2d]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

There is increasing interest in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in IBD patients due to the risk of severe complications, such as haemophagocytic syndrome and post-mononucleosis-type lymphomas following primary infection, and haemophagocytic syndrome and post-transplant-type lymphoma during latent infection. A Spanish tertiary care center studied 1,483 patients aged over 17 years between 2006 and 2016. They assessed EBV seroprevalence and seroconversion and documented those who developed complications while on azathioprine. EBV played a role in tumor development in three out of five patients on azathioprine; however, only one case (in a 66-year-old man) occurred during a primary infection. The authors conclude that the risk of haemophagocytic syndrome and lymphoma on thiopurine therapy is not restricted to young males. This is confirmed in a USA pediatric IBD follow-up cohort, where 3 out of 5 patients with haemophagocytic syndrome (all on thiopurines) were female.

There was no association with the use of infliximab or methotrexate, although the number of patients on methotrexate was much smaller. It remains unclear whether routine screening for EBV status should be conducted in adults. In pediatric patients who are particularly at risk from primary EBV infection, there may be more justification for screening to avoid thiopurine use in those who are seronegative. Routine EBV testing prior to thiopurine therapy remains controversial.

### Epstein-Barr virus in the multiple sclerosis brain: a controversial issue — report on a focused workshop held in the Centre for Brain Research of the Medical University of Vienna, Austria [^117LgwYd]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

In an attempt to identify the reasons underlying these discrepant results, a two-day workshop organized by the European Union FP6 Integrated Project 'NeuroproMiSe' was held at the Centre for Brain Research of the Medical University of Vienna in July 2010. The event aimed to bring together all research groups that have addressed the issue of EBV infection in the multiple sclerosis brain. The workshop sought to provide an update on EBV biology, discuss the individual experiences regarding the search for EBV in pathological tissues, and define future research directions.

### Epstein-Barr virus specific salivary antibodies as related to stress caused by examinations [^117V6Ru9]. Journal of Medical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is prevalent in 90% of the population. After primary infection, it remains in a latent state, and the majority of virus carriers are asymptomatic during their life. Among immunocompromised patients, such as organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, individuals lacking T cell immunity, and patients treated with corticosteroids, cancer, and AIDS patients, EBV primary infection and reactivation can cause life-threatening diseases. Immunosuppression may also occur during stressful events, which induce corticosteroid release and thus activate EBV.

The effect of examination stress on EBV reactivation among female students was studied by detecting the values of EBV-specific IgG and IgA salivary antibodies. Sequential saliva samples were obtained from first-year female students before, during, and after two important examinations. EBV-specific IgG and IgA salivary antibodies were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Hepatitis A virus (HAV) salivary antibodies served as a non-latent virus control. A statistically significant increase in the values of EBV-specific IgG and IgA antibodies was detected in samples collected during the examinations, compared to the samples collected two months before and one month after the exams (P < 0.05).

HAV antibody levels did not change significantly between the four time points. The menstrual cycle had no significant effect on the results. No significant symptoms were reported during the whole study. These results indicate that among female students who endure stress during academic examinations, there is a significant reactivation of EBV.

### Establishment and operation of a good manufacturing practice-compliant allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific cytotoxic cell bank for the treatment of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease [^112CBG4J]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects most humans, sometimes causing infectious mononucleosis, but always establishing a lifelong latent infection in B lymphocytes. This state is usually considered to be asymptomatic, but it has been associated with both a predisposition to autoimmune diseases and several malignancies, including post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD).

Initial treatment for PTLD comprises the reduction of immunosuppression and rituximab, with or without chemotherapy. However, the condition continues to have high mortality from both refractory disease and complications of treatment. Additionally, as it often occurs in the context of otherwise successful transplants, it may cause donated organs to be wasted.

Data from infected but healthy individuals show the importance of cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses in the control of latent EBV infection. The risk of PTLD correlates inversely with anti-EBV T cell activity in patients, particularly in children who have not previously encountered the virus. Cellular therapy was first shown to be effective against PTLD in the form of unmanipulated donor lymphocyte infusions after bone marrow transplantation.

- **Autologous or donor-derived CTLs**: Directed specifically against EBV were subsequently developed and are a non-toxic but still effective form of treatment. However, several factors have worked against their widespread adoption.

### Epstein-Barr virus in the multiple sclerosis brain: a controversial issue — report on a focused workshop held in the Centre for Brain Research of the Medical University of Vienna, Austria [^115vjisL]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Recent epidemiological and immunological studies provide evidence for an association between Epstein–Barr virus infection and multiple sclerosis, suggesting a role of Epstein–Barr virus infection in disease induction and pathogenesis. A key question in this context is whether Epstein–Barr virus-infected B lymphocytes are present within the central nervous system and the lesions of patients with multiple sclerosis. Previous studies on this topic provided highly controversial results, showing Epstein–Barr virus reactivity in B cells in the vast majority of multiple sclerosis cases and lesions, or only exceptional Epstein–Barr virus-positive B cells in rare cases.

In an attempt to explain the reasons for these divergent results, a workshop was organized under the umbrella of the European Union FP6 NeuroproMiSe project. The outcome of this workshop is presented here, summarizing the knowledge of Epstein–Barr virus biology and illustrating that Epstein–Barr virus infection is highly complex. There are still major controversies regarding how to unequivocally identify Epstein–Barr virus infection in pathological tissues, particularly in situations other than Epstein–Barr virus-driven lymphomas or acute Epstein–Barr virus infections. It further highlights that unequivocal proof of Epstein–Barr virus infection in multiple sclerosis lesions is still lacking, due to issues related to the sensitivity and specificity of the detection methods.

### Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: a case-based review [^113B93LS]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is characterized by immune dysregulation that results in an uncontrolled hyperinflammatory state. It has two main categories: primary HLH, which includes cases associated with genetic mutations and primary immune deficiencies, and secondary (acquired) HLH. Secondary HLH can be triggered by a range of underlying conditions, including infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (IAHS), malignancy-associated HLH, HLH associated with rheumatologic diseases–most commonly systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), referred to as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)–as well as HLH linked to immunodeficiency and HLH of unknown origin.

Extensive studies of IAHS in various cohorts have revealed that the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is the pathogen most commonly associated with IAHS. In immunocompetent children, EBV infection classically is asymptomatic or manifests with characteristics of infectious mononucleosis such as fever, fatigue, cervical lymphadenopathy, and upper respiratory tract symptoms. A minority of EBV-infected children may exhibit neurological manifestations of encephalitis, meningitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, which commonly occur in immunocompromised children. Despite being the most common virus-associated IAHS and causing significant mortality, the pathogenesis of EBV-associated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) remains incompletely understood. Three main mechanisms have been proposed: direct invasion of the CNS by EBV.

### Primary immunodeficiencies reveal the molecular requirements for effective host defense against EBV infection [^113p5Z1x]. Blood (2020). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an enigma; on one hand, it infects and persists in latent form in the vast majority of the global population, causing relatively benign disease in otherwise healthy individuals. On the other hand, EBV represents the first identified oncogenic virus, capable of causing ≥ 7 different types of malignancies, usually in immunocompromised individuals. Furthermore, some individuals with defined inborn errors of immunity exhibit extreme susceptibility to EBV-induced disease, developing severe and often fatal infectious mononucleosis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, lymphoproliferative disease, and/or EBV+ B-cell lymphoma. Thus, host and pathogen have coevolved to enable viral persistence and survival with minimal collateral damage to the healthy host. However, acquired or genetic disruptions to host defense that tip the balance in favor of EBV can have catastrophic effects.

The study of primary immunodeficiencies has provided opportunities to define nonredundant requirements for host defense against EBV infection. This has not only revealed mechanisms underlying EBV-induced disease in these primary immunodeficiencies but also identified molecules and pathways that could be targeted to enhance the efficacy of an EBV-specific vaccine or treat severe EBV infection and pathological consequences in immunodeficient hosts.

### Establishment and operation of a good manufacturing practice-compliant allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific cytotoxic cell bank for the treatment of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease [^111MKw5w]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

Enquiries resulting in a clinical decision not to issue CTLs: In 11 patients, the treating clinicians decided not to pursue CTL therapy after the initial enquiry. Six did not have PTLD. In three of these six cases, it was decided there was no malignancy present; in one of these cases, infectious mononucleosis was diagnosed. In two cases, there was an EBV-driven malignant disorder (EBV+ diffuse large B cell lymphoma of the elderly, haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), but it was decided by the referring clinicians not to proceed with infusions. The other six cases of PTLD for whom infusions were not pursued improved with conventional therapy after contacting the cell bank.

HLA matching of patients with bank donors: After receipt of the Initial Patient Enquiry form, the HLA types of CTLs and patients at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 were reviewed. The maximum number of shared antigens was therefore 10. No locus was preferentially matched. Where a patient had an antibody specific to a CTL antigen, this CTL was not considered further in the allocation process. Where possible, allelic level matching between CTLs and patients was assessed to optimize CTL activity. Blood samples were requested to monitor patients after each of the four weekly infusions and 12 weeks afterward. No CTL-directed HLA-specific antibodies have been detected post-infusion in any of the patients.

At the time of writing, 36 HLA matching requests have been processed and 32 allocation reviews completed. The minimum number of antigens shared for both HLA class I and class II combined was 2/10, and the maximum was 9/10.

### Incidence of Epstein-Barr virus reactivation is elevated in COVID-19 patients [^112HpXmk]. Virus Research (2023). Low credibility.

COVID-19, which emerged in December 2019, became a worldwide pandemic and has claimed over 6.6 million lives. While many infected individuals experience mild or moderate symptoms and recover in 7–10 days, it has been reported that almost 16% of patients developed severe disease in a study conducted through January 29, 2020. The mortality rate among severe cases of COVID has been reported to be as high as 61.5%. Since the initial emergence of COVID-19, four prominent variants have emerged: Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron. Omicron, the most recent and highly mutated variant of concern, was first identified in November 2021 and quickly became the dominant strain worldwide.

Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been reported among the critically ill and patients suffering from long COVID, and EBV viremia has been correlated with COVID severity. A longitudinal multi-omic study suggested that four main risk factors for developing long COVID are type-2 diabetes, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, specific auto-antibodies, and Epstein-Barr virus viremia. Reactivation of EBV may contribute to COVID symptoms, severity, and length of illness. The mechanism by which EBV reactivation may contribute to COVID is not quite clear; however, Verma et al. reported that EBV lytic replication promotes ACE2 expression and, therefore, could facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2.

Epstein-Barr virus is one of nine known human herpesviruses and infects more than 90% of the world's population. It is the first human oncogenic virus discovered and is associated with the development of Burkitt's lymphoma.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^115qGjB2]. Gut (2025). Low credibility.

Use of azathioprine and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status

About 90% of adults have evidence of prior EBV infection, but only 50–70% of children and adolescents do. As discussed in Section I, immunosuppressive drugs might be associated with an increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs). In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), this risk has been specifically associated with the use of thiopurines. Most LPDs occur in older EBV-positive patients.

There is also an increased risk of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and other LPDs, associated with primary EBV infection in younger (< 35) previously EBV-naïve patients taking thiopurines. The estimated absolute risk in these patients is 3/1000 patient years. Thus, some IBD guidelines suggest routine testing of EBV status and advise caution with thiopurine use in EBV-naïve patients.

Few equivalent data are available in AIH. In a recent series of 229 children with AIH or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (most receiving either azathioprine (168) or mycophenolate (69)), EBV status had been checked at AIH diagnosis in only 10%. Five patients developed symptomatic acute primary EBV infection (four on azathioprine and one on mycophenolate). Liver tests were abnormal in two, and no patients developed LPD pre-transplant. However, of 39 patients who underwent liver transplantation, a further two (who had initially received azathioprine) subsequently developed LPD (EBV-negative patients, EBV-positive donor).

Thiopurines are central to the management of AIH, and unlike in IBD, there are limited alternatives (but see Section F).

### Recommendations for Epstein-Barr virus-based screening for nasopharyngeal cancer in high- and intermediate-risk regions [^111TBLU2]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). Low credibility.

For screen-positive, asymptomatic individuals with negative nasoendoscopy and MRI, certain follow-up actions are recommended.

- **What to do during follow-up**: Endoscopy is useful for detecting an emerging small nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) during follow-up. Performing interval nasopharyngeal endoscopy with photo documentation can facilitate the recognition of subtle changes. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-based biomarkers could be repeated to evaluate if the status (positive vs. negative) has changed. Specifically, there is a lack of data on the complementary roles of EBV-based biomarkers. For example, it is unclear whether plasma EBV DNA could help differentiate those who need follow-up among EBV antibody screen-positive subjects. For individuals with persistent positive EBV-based testing results, MRI is useful for excluding small, concealed tumors. In cases where an MRI has already been performed or where a suspicious abnormality appears on the initial MRI without biopsy-proven NPC, follow-up MRI using a short screening protocol without contrast can evaluate interval changes indicative of disease.

- **Optimal timing and frequency of follow-up**: The optimal timing and frequency for follow-up is unknown. However, more frequent follow-up (e.g. every 6 months) should generally be arranged in the first year when most NPCs are diagnosed.

- **Termination of follow-up**: As available data suggest an elevated risk of NPC for the initial 1–2 years following a positive screen, termination of follow-up could be considered 2 years after the screening test. Follow-up may need to be extended to 3–4 years if MRI is not available. Given the high negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI, future studies may determine if EBV tests alone are sufficient.

### The high burden of hospitalizations for primary EBV infection: A 6-year prospective survey in a French hospital [^1123HHYw]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Primary Epstein-Barr virus infection (PEI) is increasingly acquired later in life in developed countries, involving a growing number of adults. No studies have examined the effect of age on PEI. We conducted a prospective, single-centre, non-interventional survey to assess the clinical and economic effects of PEI care according to age. We included all serology-confirmed cases observed in all departments of a large regional hospital. Clinical and biologic data, therapeutics, and costs of care were examined.

Over a 6-year period, we included 292 subjects (148 children and 144 adults) with a median age of 15.4 years (range 9 months to 79 years). Adults were hospitalized more often (83% vs. 60%) and for longer periods of time (median 4 days vs. 2 days) than children (p ≤ 0.0001 for both). Two adults required a secondary transfer to the intensive care unit, although no children did. Typically, adults showed higher levels of activated lymphocytes and liver abnormalities. They also required the use of systemic corticosteroids more often (45% vs. 23%, p < 0.0001) and for longer periods of time (median 7 days vs. 3 days, p = 0.02) than children. Overall, the costs were significantly higher for adults than for children (median, €1940 vs. €1130, p < 0.0001), mainly due to the frequency and duration of hospitalizations. Age increases the immune response and clinical severity of PEI, resulting in substantial additional costs for the community. Better recognition of the disease in adults could shorten the average length of hospital stay.

### Epstein-Barr virus: Dermatologic associations and implications: Part I. Mucocutaneous manifestations of Epstein-Barr virus and nonmalignant disorders [^115HZji5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous virus that has been implicated in a wide range of human diseases, many of which have mucocutaneous manifestations. As a member of the Herpesviridae family, EBV causes lifelong infection by establishing latency in B lymphocytes. An intact immune response is critical in preventing the progression of EBV disease, and the clinical manifestations of infection depend on the intricate relationship between the virus and the host immune system. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnostic testing in EBV infection. In Part I of this continuing medical education article, the mucocutaneous manifestations of EBV infection are reviewed with an emphasis on pathophysiology and management.

### Molecular diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus-related diseases [^111VQtjo]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2001). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis and may also be found in a wide variety of benign and malignant lesions, including oral hairy leukoplakia, inflammatory pseudotumor, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma. Molecular testing is increasingly important in diagnosing and monitoring patients affected by these diseases. In biopsy tissues, molecular detection of EBV-encoded RNA transcripts by in situ hybridization remains the gold standard for proving that a histopathological lesion is EBV-related. EBV-encoded RNA hybridization and EBV LMP1 immunostains are routinely used to detect latent EBV in tissues affected by posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) or in enlarged nodes from patients with infectious mononucleosis.

Traditional serology is the best test for evaluating acute versus remote infection in healthy individuals. High serological titers serve as a tumor marker for some EBV-related malignancies, but titers are not a dependable tumor marker in immunocompromised hosts. EBV viral load testing by quantitative DNA amplification of blood samples is a promising new laboratory test that has proven useful for early diagnosis and monitoring of patients with PTLD. Recent studies suggest a role for EBV viral load testing in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin's disease, and AIDS patients with brain lymphoma. Further research is needed to fully define the clinical utility of viral load tests across the full spectrum of EBV-associated diseases.

### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation and therapeutic inhibitors [^111g8NjT]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous human virus that infects almost all humans during their lifetime, and following the acute phase, it persists for the remainder of the individual's life. EBV infects B lymphocytes, leading to their immortalization, with the persistence of the EBV genome as an episome. In the latent phase, EBV is prevented from reactivating through efficient cytotoxic cellular immunity.

EBV reactivates (lytic phase) under conditions of psychological stress, with a consequent weakening of cellular immunity. EBV reactivation has been shown to occur in a subset of individuals with a variety of cancers, autoimmune diseases, the autoimmune-like disease chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalitis, and under other circumstances, such as being an inpatient in an intensive care unit. Chronic EBV reactivation is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of many such diseases, yet it is rarely tested for in immunocompetent individuals.

This review summarizes the pathogenesis of EBV infection, EBV reactivation and its role in disease, and methods that may be used to detect it. Known inhibitors of EBV reactivation and replication are discussed, including drugs licensed for treatment of other herpesviruses, licensed or experimental drugs for various other indications, compounds at an early stage of drug development, and nutritional constituents such as vitamins and dietary supplements.

### Host genetics of Epstein-Barr virus infection, latency and disease [^114GR6Wc]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

To further our understanding of the mechanisms by which EBV causes pathology and to predict which individuals are at the greatest risk of EBV-mediated disease, an increased focus on the host genetics of EBV infection is required. The methodology of these studies must shift from investigating candidate genes for associations with a disparate range of disorders in small populations to using genome-wide approaches. Only large, well-powered studies can reliably identify common genetic polymorphisms contributing to the risk of EBV-related disease, with the hope of improving the screening and treatment of these conditions. As the cost of such studies continues to fall, the next 50 years of EBV research may see more progress in this area.

### Epstein-Barr virus reactivation induced myeloperoxidase-specific antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA)-associated vasculitis [^1172SJJF]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

We present a patient with systemic symptoms including four months of dyspnoea worsened with exertion, fatigue, rhinorrhoea, intermittent facial swelling, generalised lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Laboratory studies demonstrated proteinuria and eosinophilia. His serology was consistent with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation. A lymph node biopsy was consistent with EBV-associated reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. He was told to continue symptomatic treatment for EBV infection.

After several admissions, vasculitis workup and myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) studies were positive. Evolution of clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters, and our literature review suggested the diagnosis of EBV-associated ANCA vasculitis. Steroids were started after the patient continued to deteriorate; the viral load started increasing, so we added valganciclovir with favourable clinical response and no relapse during the follow-up for six months. This suggests that with evidence of viraemia (primary or reactivation), antiviral treatment likely has clinical benefit while immunosuppression is being considered.
