## Question

LDL exercise

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how exercise affects LDL cholesterol and what that means for prescribing exercise in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength and consistency of evidence for exercise lowering LDL-C. Then, I should verify how exercise volume and intensity modify LDL-C changes. Next, I will examine whether LDL-C reduction requires weight loss or can occur independent of adiposity changes. After that, I need to consider the quality of LDL changes beyond total concentration. I will then compare aerobic versus resistance training, and HIIT versus moderate-intensity continuous training. Finally, I should synthesize practical dosing recommendations, set expectations about magnitude, and align with guideline positions and patient counseling, before concluding with clinical implications and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the evidence signal for LDL-C lowering with exercise. High-quality guidance from the National Lipid Association notes that exercise has a small average LDL-C reduction of about 2.5–6.0 mg/dL in adults, which corresponds to roughly a 4–7% reduction when programs achieve sufficient volume and, particularly, when accompanied by reductions in fat mass, while noting variability across individuals and interventions, and a dose–response with total energy expenditure rather than intensity per se [^117P1w3P] [^112qEgjx] [^113FLihH]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; some reviews and meta-analyses of aerobic exercise alone in overweight/obese populations show minimal or no significant LDL-C change without weight loss, underscoring that exercise's effect on LDL-C is modest and context dependent [^111DZJQs] [^116SCMuq].

> Wait, let me verify the volume thresholds because that is pivotal. The NLA advises that meaningful LDL-C reduction typically requires 200–300 minutes per week of moderate- or higher-intensity activity, approximating at least 2000 kcal/week of energy expenditure, and notes that 150 minutes/week is often insufficient for LDL-C lowering though it can improve triglycerides and HDL-C, with higher-volume programs showing the clearest lipid benefits when weight is relatively stable [^113T1BTn] [^112i8per] [^112qEgjx]. I should double-check that these targets align with general physical activity guidance; indeed, cardiometabolic benefit starts at 150 minutes/week, but LDL-C effects rise with greater volume and caloric expenditure [^112i8per].

> Next, I should review whether LDL-C changes can occur without weight loss, because this determines how I counsel patients. In STRRIDE, when body weight was intentionally stabilized, high-amount exercise still reduced small LDL particles and improved the lipoprotein profile even when total LDL-C concentration was unchanged, suggesting that volume, not just weight loss, drives favorable remodeling of LDL particles toward larger, less atherogenic subfractions [^117Sjvn6] [^1116tSRc]. Hold on, I should verify that other sources concur; the NLA explicitly notes that with sufficient exercise volume, LDL-C can fall modestly even in the absence of weight change, although effects are amplified when adiposity declines [^112QgMHj] [^117P1w3P].

> I will now examine the qualitative changes in LDL because particle biology may be as important as concentration. Meta-analyses of lipoprotein subclass studies show exercise consistently reduces small LDL particle number and increases mean LDL particle size, which is atheroprotective, and some training programs also lower apoB despite small changes in LDL-C concentration, reflecting fewer atherogenic particles rather than large shifts in cholesterol content per particle [^114Qn7oa] [^112ohTJ8]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "exercise reduces oxidized LDL in all populations"; I should correct that and note the evidence is mixed overall, though one small study showed improved resistance of LDL I to oxidation after training in older adults, which is a plausible mechanism linking exercise to reduced atherogenicity even without major LDL-C changes [^111wQBrV].

> Let me consider modality, since patients often ask whether weights help with LDL. Aerobic exercise remains the primary modality for LDL-C lowering, with consistent benefits when volume is adequate; resistance training can yield small average reductions in LDL-C in meta-analyses, but effects are heterogeneous and may depend on program volume and energy expenditure, so I should frame resistance as supportive rather than a substitute for aerobic work [^1164BK8Q] [^112N9ziN] [^115JanoV]. But wait, what if we add resistance to aerobic during weight loss; recent evidence suggests that during caloric restriction, adding resistance may not further improve LDL-C beyond weight loss alone, reinforcing that the main driver of LDL-C reduction in that context is energy deficit, with resistance primarily preserving lean mass and supporting other cardiometabolic outcomes [^112VYKCB].

> Now, I should review intensity, and whether HIIT is superior to moderate-intensity continuous training for LDL-C. High-quality meta-analyses comparing HIIT to MICT generally show no superiority for LDL-C changes, and benefits appear more tied to total energy expenditure and session frequency than to intensity per se, with STRRIDE showing that high amount, not high intensity, drove lipid improvements when caloric expenditure was matched [^115DzCVS] [^117SCnwW] [^117Sjvn6]. Hold on, I should verify whether fitness gains with HIIT change this; even with greater VO2max gains, LDL-C effects remain comparable, supporting the primacy of total volume and caloric expenditure for lipid outcomes [^115DzCVS].

> Let me translate this into practical dosing while keeping feasibility in mind. For LDL-C lowering, I recommend aiming for 200–300 minutes per week of moderate- or higher-intensity aerobic activity, accumulated in bouts of at least 10 minutes, which approximates 2000–2200 kcal/week, with a minimum of three sessions per week to maintain continuous effects on triglycerides; walking at brisk pace can achieve roughly 100 kcal per mile, so 20–25 miles per week is a reasonable target to discuss with patients, with step-count goals around 40,000 steps/week when used for tracking [^113T1BTn] [^112i8per] [^112qEgjx]. I need to ensure I set expectations about intensity; 40–75% VO2max or 60–80% of age-adjusted maximum heart rate is appropriate, and progression should prioritize increasing duration or frequency before pushing intensity to avoid injury and to sustain adherence [^113T1BTn].

> I should confirm expected magnitude so counseling is realistic. With adequate volume, average LDL-C reductions are about 4–7% in many programs, roughly 5–15 mg/dL depending on baseline, with larger responses when fat mass decreases; meta-analyses of exercise plus prudent diet report larger LDL-C reductions, on the order of 7–10%, underscoring synergy between caloric restriction and exercise rather than exercise alone [^117P1w3P] [^115waoFU] [^116Vq8Y2]. Hold on, I should verify the dose–response again; the NEJM trial shows that high-amount exercise produces broader lipoprotein improvements than lower-amount programs even when weight is stable, reinforcing that more volume yields more benefit, though the absolute LDL-C change may still be modest [^117Sjvn6].

> Next, I should review guideline alignment to avoid overpromising. ACC/AHA and VA/DoD emphasize lifestyle, including regular aerobic activity and weight management, as foundational for ASCVD risk reduction, but they also note that pharmacotherapy is required when risk is elevated and that LDL-C should be measured and managed aggressively in higher-risk patients, with a "lower for longer" paradigm to reduce events [^117GMSF2] [^113VtcDM] [^115Uzs9s]. I need to ensure patients understand that exercise complements, but does not replace, statins or other LDL-lowering therapies when indicated, and that the small average LDL-C change from exercise still contributes to risk reduction when sustained over time and paired with diet and weight control [^117GMSF2] [^115xWnpu].

> I should also tailor by population, since responses vary. In people with diabetes, combined lifestyle interventions with weight loss can improve triglycerides and HDL-C, but LDL-C changes are often small unless weight loss is substantial, so I should emphasize caloric deficit and higher-volume aerobic activity in this group while reinforcing medication adherence for LDL-C targets [^115WaUFD] [^1143TRH3]. In chronic kidney disease, evidence for exercise improving LDL-C is limited or null, so I should avoid overpromising lipid benefits and focus on fitness, blood pressure, and glycemic outcomes, with individualized lipid management plans [^115BdD8e]. For women of reproductive potential, the same volume principles apply, with counseling to progress toward at least 2000 kcal/week when LDL-C lowering is a priority and to incorporate resistance training for musculoskeletal health [^114PXDnN].

> Let me reconsider mechanisms to guide counseling. Beyond modest LDL-C reduction, exercise lowers apoB and small LDL particles, increases LDL particle size, and accelerates clearance of atherogenic particles, all of which reduce cardiovascular risk even when the LDL-C concentration change is small; these mechanistic benefits justify prioritizing volume and consistency rather than chasing intensity alone [^114Qn7oa] [^112ohTJ8] [^114V6EM7]. I should confirm that these changes are clinically meaningful; yes, because particle number and size track more closely with atherogenesis than total LDL-C, and exercise reliably shifts the profile in a favorable direction when volume is sufficient [^114Qn7oa].

> Finally, I need to ensure the counseling is actionable and measurable. I will set a specific weekly minute target and energy expenditure goal, pair it with a dietary pattern that lowers saturated fat and promotes weight loss if BMI is elevated, and arrange follow-up lipid testing in 3–6 months to document response and adjust the plan; if LDL-C remains above goal, I will escalate pharmacotherapy per risk category while maintaining lifestyle as the foundation [^117GMSF2] [^117P1w3P]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not implying exercise is ineffective; even small LDL-C reductions, when sustained, contribute to plaque regression and event reduction in the context of comprehensive risk management, which is precisely why guidelines continue to emphasize lifestyle for all patients regardless of statin use [^115xWnpu] [^115Uzs9s].

Exercise lowers LDL cholesterol by **3–7%** [^117P1w3P] with moderate-intensity aerobic activity (150–300 minutes/week) [^113T1BTn] [^112i8per], with larger reductions when combined with dietary changes and weight loss [^115waoFU] [^116Vq8Y2]. LDL-C reductions are modest and **vary with baseline LDL, exercise volume, and adiposity** [^117P1w3P]; higher-volume or higher-intensity programs yield greater effects [^117Sjvn6]. Exercise also shifts LDL to larger, less atherogenic particles [^114Qn7oa] and lowers apoB [^112ohTJ8], further reducing cardiovascular risk [^115xWnpu]. For optimal LDL lowering, combine aerobic exercise with dietary changes and weight loss, and consider resistance training for additional benefit [^117GMSF2] [^1164BK8Q].

## Mechanisms of LDL cholesterol reduction through exercise

Exercise lowers LDL through **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Increased LDL receptor activity**: Exercise upregulates hepatic LDL receptors, enhancing LDL clearance from plasma [^notfound].

- **Reduced hepatic cholesterol synthesis**: Exercise may lower hepatic cholesterol synthesis, decreasing LDL production [^notfound].

- **Changes in LDL particle size and composition**: Exercise shifts LDL toward larger, less atherogenic particles, reducing cardiovascular risk even without major LDL-C changes [^114Qn7oa] [^1116tSRc].

- **Reduction in apolipoprotein B (apoB)**: Exercise lowers apoB, reflecting fewer atherogenic particles [^112ohTJ8].

## Magnitude of LDL cholesterol reduction

The LDL-C reduction from exercise is **modest but clinically meaningful**:

| **Exercise intervention** | **Ldl-c reduction** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (150–300 min/week) | 3–7% | - Greater reductions with higher baseline LDL-C <br/> - Higher volume <br/> - And weight loss [^117P1w3P] [^113T1BTn] |
| High-intensity or high-volume aerobic exercise | 5–10% | More pronounced with increased intensity/volume [^117Sjvn6] [^112qEgjx] |
| Resistance training | 2–5% | Modest LDL-C reduction; greater with higher volume/intensity [^1164BK8Q] [^112N9ziN] |
| Combined exercise and dietary intervention | 7–15% | Synergistic effects from diet plus exercise [^115waoFU] [^116Vq8Y2] |

## Factors influencing LDL cholesterol response to exercise

Several factors **modulate LDL-C response to exercise**:

- **Baseline LDL-C levels**: Higher baseline LDL-C yields larger absolute reductions [^117P1w3P].

- **Exercise intensity and duration**: Higher intensity and longer duration produce greater LDL-C reductions [^112qEgjx] [^113T1BTn].

- **Body weight and adiposity**: Weight loss amplifies LDL-C lowering [^117P1w3P] [^111DZJQs].

- **Individual variability**: Genetic and metabolic differences cause variable responses [^112qEgjx].

---

## Comparison with pharmacological interventions

Exercise-induced LDL-C reductions are smaller than with statins but are **important for cardiovascular risk reduction**. Statins typically lower LDL-C by 30–50%, whereas exercise lowers LDL-C by about 3–10% [^117JUPp4] [^117P1w3P]; however, exercise provides additional cardiovascular benefits — improved endothelial function, reduced inflammation, and enhanced insulin sensitivity — that amplify risk reduction beyond LDL-C lowering [^115Wv5Hx] [^1138pXCY].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize exercise as a cornerstone of LDL-C management:

- **Minimum recommendation**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity [^112i8per] [^115KiQoT].

- **Enhanced LDL-C lowering**: 200–300 minutes/week or ≥ 2000 kcal/week [^113T1BTn] [^112i8per].

- **Resistance training**: ≥ 2 sessions/week for additional lipid and cardiovascular benefits [^113FLihH] [^1164BK8Q].

- **Combined lifestyle interventions**: Diet plus exercise yield greater LDL-C reductions than either alone [^1116tSRc] [^116Vq8Y2].

---

## Long-term cardiovascular benefits

Regular exercise lowers LDL-C and confers **sustained cardiovascular benefits**, including reduced ASCVD events, improved endothelial function, and slower atherosclerosis progression [^117P1w3P]. These benefits are amplified when exercise is maintained long term and combined with dietary changes and weight management [^116sMg84].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current research

Key limitations include **variability in study designs** and populations, which limit generalizability; many trials are short-term (< 6 months), leaving long-term LDL-C effects uncertain; and most studies focus on total LDL-C rather than particle number/size or apoB, which may better reflect risk [^114Qn7oa] [^112ohTJ8].

---

Exercise lowers LDL-C by about 3–7% [^117P1w3P], with larger effects at higher volume/intensity and when combined with diet and weight loss [^112qEgjx] [^115waoFU]. Exercise also improves LDL particle quality and lowers apoB [^114Qn7oa] [^112ohTJ8], further reducing cardiovascular risk. For optimal LDL lowering, **combine aerobic exercise with dietary changes and weight loss**, and consider resistance training for additional benefit [^113T1BTn] [^1164BK8Q].

4.2 Lipid metabolism

Aerobic exercise has been associated with a beneficial effect on lipoprotein levels in both normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic individuals, even though the overall effect is small and concurrent weight loss may have contributed in the positive findings of some of the relevant studies. Beneficial effects have been noted mostly for high‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol (HDL‐C) levels but also for low‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol (LDL‐C) particle size and apolipoprotein B and triglyceride levels. 32 The combination of exercise with dietary changes provides greater reductions in LDL‐C compared to either measure alone. Exercise volume rather than intensity seem to be better associated with lipid changes. It has been estimated that the minimal exercise volume in order to increase HDL‐C level is 900 kcal of energy expenditure or 120 minutes of exercise per week. 33 The Studies of Targeted Risk Reduction Interventions through Defined Exercise (STRRIDE) was a randomized controlled study that examined the effects of 7 months of two different volumes and intensities of aerobic exercise on risk factors in overweight and obese individuals with mild and moderate dyslipidaemia. 34 All exercise programs showed evidence of beneficial changes in the lipoprotein profile. The high‐volume high‐intensity group showed the greatest decreases in small LDL‐C without affecting the total LDL‐C concentration. The same amount of exercise led to increases in HDL‐C cholesterol as well as in decreases in triglycerides. In terms of outcome, among dyslipidaemic individuals with a mean age of 58 years, statin treatment and increased physical fitness have been independently associated with lower mortality, while combined statin treatment and high fitness levels were associated with a better prognosis compared to either intervention alone. 35

LDL-C response to physical activity — Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reductions are most likely when exercise produces weight/fat loss, as "Exercise programs have the best chance of reducing LDL-C when there is associated body fat reduction". With sufficient volume, moderate-intensity training "will reduce LDL-C by 4 to 7%", and responses are greater with "higher baseline LDL-C, greater total energy expenditure of the exercise program, and more loss of fat mass". A meta-analysis "of 13 studies" showed a "non-significant decrease of < 1% in LDL-C" with an "average training stimulus of ∼ 40 min/session, 3.9 times a week", equating to "∼ 1600 to 1800 kcal/week", which "is insufficient by current recommendations (≥ 2000 kcal/week) to demonstrate meaningful reductions in LDL-C".

### Impact of exercise on blood lipids and lipoproteins [^117EcmoH]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2007). Low credibility.

Abnormal blood lipids are a significant cardiovascular health risk. Drug therapy and diet continue to be standard management strategies. However, considerable evidence supports physical activity and exercise as having a positive impact on abnormal lipids and such are often recommended as adjunctive interventions. The purpose of this review is to clarify the mechanisms by which exercise facilitates favorable changes in levels of blood lipids and lipoproteins. Studies relative to the effects of exercise on blood lipid levels are notable: The impact of exercise on high-density lipoproteins (HDL-C) is best studied and specify effects of intensity and amount of exercise as well as a genetic influence. Exercise also exerts an effect on HDL-C maturation and composition, cholesterol efflux, and cholesterol delivery to receptors (reverse cholesterol transport). Positive effects of exercise are also seen with blood triglycerides (TG), but little specific effect is seen on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC). Abundant evidence supports the benefits of exercise on levels of certain blood lipids (namely HDL-C and TG). Although standard management of abnormal blood lipids is drug therapy and diet, it seems prudent to incorporate aerobic exercise as an important component of a healthy lifestyle. In certain individuals, drug therapy may be decreased in dosage or perhaps discontinued in the patient who is "exercise trained", especially if there is associated weight loss.

### Present status of statin therapy [^113CCdo8]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Statins are cardioprotective agents that reduce the adverse effects of increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. For significantly dyslipidemic persons, who are at higher cardiovascular risk, combined statin therapy substantially reduces the mortality risk, thus potentially being an ideal risk-reducing combination with added risk reduction by lifestyle changes. Decisions regarding the initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention where the absolute risk reduction is much less are more difficult, involving LDL-C levels and higher C-reactive protein levels. For significantly dyslipidemic persons, combined intense exercise and statin therapy substantially reduces the mortality risk, thus potentially being an ideal risk-reducing combination.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112qEgjx]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Exercise and physical activity in dyslipidemia — lipid effects and dose targets: Exercise training in the absence of a change in adiposity has effects to reduce the circulating triglyceride (TG) concentration and modestly raise the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and if the volume of exercise is sufficient to lower body fat this will typically enhance these changes while also resulting in a modest to moderate reduction in the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration. In order to reduce LDL-C, the quantity of physical activity needed is 200–300 min/week of moderate intensity physical activity or ≥ 2000 kcal/week, which may be accumulated in repeated bouts of at least 10 min each; use of well-engineered pedometers for recording walking step counts has been successfully employed in outpatient clinic settings as a means of tracking activity for managing dyslipidemia and promoting weight loss, and in general the amount of walking required to produce weight loss is ≥ 40,000 steps/week, approximately equivalent to 2000 kcal/week energy expenditure (based on ~2,000 steps/mile and ~100 kcal gross energy cost/mile). The magnitudes of changes in lipid and lipoprotein levels depend on variables beyond the type, frequency, intensity, and duration of physical activity, including gender and menopausal status, race/ethnicity, nature and severity of the lipid/lipoprotein disorder, accompanying changes in diet (including alcohol intake), changes in body fat, plasma volume changes, genetic factors (e.g., apo E and C isoforms), and seasonal and diurnal changes in lipoprotein lipid levels.

### The acute versus the chronic response to exercise [^115Wv5Hx]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

There is strong and consistent evidence that a single exercise session can acutely reduce triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C), reduce blood pressure, and improve insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. Such observations suggest that at least some of the effects on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors attributed to exercise training may be the result of recent exercise.

Results

These acute and chronic exercise effects cannot be considered in isolation. Exercise training increases the capacity for exercise, thereby permitting more vigorous and/or more prolonged individual exercise sessions and a more significant acute effect. The intensity, duration, and energy expenditure required to produce these acute exercise effects are not clearly defined. The acute effect of exercise on triglycerides and HDL-C appears to increase with overall energy expenditure possibly because the effect maybe mediated by reductions in intramuscular triglycerides. Prolonged exercise appears necessary for an acute effect of exercise on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The acute effect of exercise on blood pressure is a low threshold phenomenon and has been observed after energy expenditures requiring only 40% maximal capacity. The acute effect of exercise on glucose metabolism appears to require exercise near 70% maximal, but this issue has not been carefully examined.

Conclusions

Exercise has definite acute effects on blood lipids, blood pressure, and glucose homeostasis. Exercise also has acute effects on other factors related to atherosclerosis such as immunological function, vascular reactivity, and hemostasis. Considerable additional research is required to define the threshold of exercise required to produce these putatively beneficial effects.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^113T1BTn]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Physical activity dosing for LDL-C and weight — exercise guidance includes moderate-intensity aerobic activity on 5 days each week (i.e., ≥ 150 min per week) or vigorous-intensity aerobic activity for a minimum of 20 min on 3 days each week, and combinations may be used. The weekly volume required to lower LDL-C and body weight is greater, i.e., ≥ 2000 kcal/week, which generally requires 200–300 min/week of moderate or higher intensity physical activity. For management of body weight and LDL-C, recommendations are: primary activity aerobic exercise; intensity 40–75% aerobic capacity; frequency 5 or more days a week; duration 30–60 min per session; and 200–300 min/week of moderate or higher intensity physical activity (≥ 2000 kcal/week). Aerobic exercise is the preferred mode of physical activity, resistance exercise can, and should, play a supportive role, and for significant weight loss, 250–300 min or more per week of moderate aerobic exercise is near optimum.

### Efficacy of aerobic exercise and a prudent diet for improving selected lipids and lipoproteins in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115waoFU]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Studies addressing the effects of aerobic exercise and a prudent diet on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in adults have reached conflicting conclusions. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of aerobic exercise combined with a prudent diet on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in adults.

Methods

Studies were located by searching nine electronic databases, cross-referencing, and expert review. Two independent reviewers selected studies that met the following criteria: (1) randomized controlled trials, (2) aerobic exercise combined with diet recommendations (saturated/trans fat intake less than 10% of total calories and cholesterol less than 300 mg/day and/or fiber intake ≥ 25 g/day in women and ≥ 35 grams per day in men), (3) intervention ≥ 4 weeks, (4) humans ≥ 18 years of age, (5) published studies, including dissertations and Master's theses, (6) studies published in any language, (7) studies published between January 1, 1955 and May 1, 2009, (8) assessment of one or more of the following lipid and lipoprotein concentrations: total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), ratio of TC to HDL-C, non-HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG). Two reviewers independently extracted all data. Random-effects models that account for heterogeneity and 95% confidence intervals were used to pool findings.

Results

Of the 1,401 citations reviewed, six studies representing 16 groups (8 intervention, 8 control) and up to 559 men and women (282 intervention, 277 control) met the criteria for analysis. Statistically significant intervention minus control reductions were found for TC (-15.5 mg/dl, 95% CI, -20.3 to -10.7), TC:HDL-C (-0.4 mg/dl, 95% CI, -0.7 to -0.2), LDL-C (-9.2 mg/dl, 95% CI, -12.7 to -5.8) and TG (-10.6 mg/dl, 95% CI, -17.2 to -4.0) but not HDL-C (-0.5 mg/dl, 95% CI, -4.0 to 3.1). Changes were equivalent to reductions of 7.5%, 6.6%, 7.2% and 18.2% respectively, for TC, TC:HDL-C, LDL-C and TG. Because of missing variance statistics, non-HDL-C was excluded.

Conclusions

Aerobic exercise combined with a prudent diet is highly efficacious for improving TC, TC:HDL-C, LDL-C and TG, but not HDL-C concentrations, in adults. However, additional studies are needed, including effectiveness studies using intention-to-treat analysis.

### Exercise for people with high cardiovascular risk [^113vHjAp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

When two or more cardiovascular risk factors occur in one individual, they may interact in a multiplicative way promoting cardiovascular disease. Exercise has proven to be effective in controlling individual risk factors but its effect on overall cardiovascular risk remains uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the effects of exercise training in people with increased cardiovascular risk but without a concurrent cardiovascular disease on general cardiovascular mortality, incidence of cardiovascular events, and total cardiovascular risk.

Search Methods

A search was conducted in CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 10 of 12), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to week 2 November 2013), EMBASE Classic + EMBASE via Ovid (1947 to Week 47 2013), CINAHL Plus with Full Text via EBSCO (to November 2013), Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) (1970 to 22 November 2013), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) (1990 to 22 November 2013) on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters). We did not apply any date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomized clinical trials comparing aerobic or resistance exercise training versus no exercise or any standard approach that does not include exercise. Participants had to be 18 years of age or older with an average 10-year Framingham risk score of 10% for cardiovascular disease over 10 years, or with two or more cardiovascular risk factors, and no history of cardiovascular disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

The selection of studies and subsequent data collection process were conducted by two independent authors. Disagreements were solved by consensus. The results were reported descriptively. It was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis because of the high heterogeneity and high risk of bias in the included studies.

Main Results

A total of four studies were included that involved 823 participants, 412 in the exercise group and 411 in the control group. Follow-up of participants ranged from 16 weeks to 6 months. Overall, the included studies had a high risk of selection, detection, and attrition bias. Meta-analysis was not possible because the interventions (setting, type and intensity of exercise) and outcome measurements were not comparable, and the risk of bias in the identified studies was high. No study assessed cardiovascular or all‑cause mortality or cardiovascular events as individual outcomes. One or more of the studies reported on total cardiovascular risk, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, blood pressure, body mass index, exercise capacity, and health-related quality of life but the available evidence was not sufficient to determine the effectiveness of exercise. Adverse events and smoking cessation were not assessed in the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence to date is entirely limited to small studies with regard to sample size, short-term follow-up, and high risk of methodological bias, which makes it difficult to derive any conclusions on the efficacy or safety of aerobic or resistance exercise on groups with increased cardiovascular risk or in individuals with two or more coexisting risk factors. Further randomized clinical trials assessing controlled exercise programmes on total cardiovascular risk in individuals are warranted.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112i8per]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Exercise/physical activity recommendations — For cardiometabolic benefit, "The recommended minimal quantity of exercise for supporting cardiovascular health and improving the lipid profile (lowering TG and sometimes raising HDL-C) is 150 min per week of moderate to higher intensity aerobic activity. This level of physical activity is consistent with public health recommendations" (Strength: "A High"). To further improve triglycerides (TG), HDL-C, and reduce LDL-C and body fat, " ≥ 2000 kcal per week of energy expenditure (generally 200 to 300 min per week) of moderate or higher intensity physical activity is recommended" (Strength: "B Moderate"). Additionally, "Resistance exercise is also recommended to play a supportive role in maintaining strength, balance, and bone density" (Strength: "B Moderate").

### Efficacy of aerobic exercise and a prudent diet for improving selected lipids and lipoproteins in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114rgf1f]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

In conclusion, aerobic exercise and a prudent diet are efficacious for improving TC, TC:HDL-C, LDL-C and TG, but not HDL-C concentrations, in adults. However, a need exists for additional studies on this topic, including effectiveness studies using intention-to-treat analysis.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^111nL2Pb]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Lifestyle modification to lower LDL-C — patient counseling priorities and dietary guidance are emphasized. Guidelines for treating high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) state these topics should be discussed with every patient at every visit, including healthy eating patterns, regular exercise, adequate restorative sleep, avoiding risky behaviors (e.g., tobacco use, excessive alcohol), stress management, and fostering healthy relationships. Nutrition guidance notes that if cooking oil is used, oils rich in unsaturated fatty acids are preferred over saturated fatty acids.

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^117JUPp4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Cholesterol

Cholesterol‐containing lipoproteins are central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Elevated total cholesterol and LDL‐C are associated with increased ASCVD risk, – and lipid‐lowering medications can reduce this risk. – Intensive lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, should be recommended as first‐line therapy for all patients.

The newest iteration of the guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol (to reduce atherosclerotic CV risk in adults) have markedly changed the approach to lipid management, identifying statins as the preferred drug class to lower LDL‐C. Randomized controlled trial data support the use of statins to reduce CV risk in 4 groups: (1) those with known ASCVD, (2) those with an LDL‐C level ≥ 190 mg/dL, (3) those aged 40 to 75 years with DM and LDL‐C 70 to 189 md/dL, and (4) those aged 40 to 75 years with LDL‐C 70 to 189 mg/dL and an estimated ASCVD 10‐year risk of ≥ 7.5% (Table 4). The new pooled cohort risk estimator weighs age quite heavily; therefore, many more adults may be considered eligible for statin therapy despite having well‐controlled risk factors. Consequently, a central component of the new guideline recommendations is to have an informed discussion with the patient about the relative benefits and risks of drug therapy before starting a statin.

Table 4.
Groups in Who Randomized Controlled Trial Evidence Demonstrated a Reduction in ASCVD With Statin Therapy

Intensity of statin therapy is chosen to match the risk of those who are most likely to benefit (Table 4). A high‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by ≥ 50%, and a moderate‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by 30% to < 50%. Recommendations for statin intensity based on indication are summarized in Table 4. In addition, appropriate periodic monitoring (every 3 to 12 months) of lipid values should be obtained to monitor adherence, adequacy of response, and safety measures, as stated in the 2013 cholesterol guidelines.

Patients with increased concentrations of LDL‐C particles, decreased HDL‐C particles, and increased triglycerides carry an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and type 2 DM. This form of atherogenic dyslipidemia can be assessed by non–HDL‐C or by measuring an apolipoprotein B level. In addition, lipoprotein(a), which is a modified form of LDL that confers atherogenic risk independent of LDL‐C, can be elevated in the absence of other lipid abnormalities.

### Exercise and type 2 diabetes: the American College of Sports Medicine and the American diabetes association: joint position statement [^1143TRH3]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Lipids and lipoproteins.

Small RCTs involving type 2 diabetes have reported that aerobic training decreases total and LDL cholesterol and raises HDL cholesterol. One larger RCT found decreases in total cholesterol with both aerobic and yoga training but no changes in HDL cholesterol or LDL cholesterol, although most have found no effect of any form of exercise training on lipids. RCTs designed to increase PA also had no effect on the cholesterol profile in type 2 diabetes, with most also finding no change in triglycerides. A meta-analysis of training effects on blood lipids in adults with type 2 diabetes found, however, that LDL cholesterol may be reduced by ∼5%.

Lipid profiles may benefit more from concomitant exercise training and weight reduction. Some studies using intensive diet and aerobic exercise interventions reported large reductions in total cholesterol and triglycerides but failed to include controls. In the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study, intensive lifestyle participants exhibited greater decreases in triglycerides and increases in HDL cholesterol than the control group, while both the intensive lifestyle and usual care groups decreased LDL cholesterol. Most lifestyle interventions have been accompanied by an approximate 5-kg weight loss.

Evidence statement.

Blood lipid responses to training are mixed but may result in a small reduction in LDL cholesterol with no change in HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. Combined weight loss and PA may be more effective than aerobic exercise training alone on lipids. ACSM evidence category C.

Hypertension.

Hypertension is a common comorbidity affecting more than 60% of individuals with type 2 diabetes. The risk of vascular complications in hypertensive individuals with type 2 diabetes is 66–100% higher than with either condition alone. Both aerobic and resistance training can lower BP in nondiabetic individuals, with slightly greater effects observed with the former. Most observational studies show that both exercises lower BP in diabetic individuals. Several RCTs have shown reductions in systolic BP (4–8 mmHg), but only one reported a slightly lower diastolic BP. The Look AHEAD trial found reductions in both systolic and diastolic BP with exercise and weight loss, but several studies have reported no changes in BP with training in type 2 diabetes. Carefully designed RCTs using increasing levels of PA also failed to show any change in BP despite substantially increased PA.

Evidence statement.

Aerobic training may slightly reduce systolic BP, but reductions in diastolic BP are less common, in individuals with type 2 diabetes. ACSM evidence category C.

### Aerobic exercise and lipids and lipoproteins in women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115wmbhH]. Journal of Women's Health (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women is the leading cause of mortality in the United States, and less than optimal lipid and lipoprotein levels are major risk factors for CVD. The purpose of this study was to use the meta-analytic approach to examine the effects of aerobic exercise on lipids and lipoproteins in women.

Methods

Studies were retrieved via computerized literature searches, review of reference lists, hand searching selected journals, and expert review of our reference list. The inclusion of studies was limited to randomized controlled trials published in the English language literature between January 1955 and January 2003 in which aerobic exercise was used as the primary intervention in adult women aged ≥ 18 years. One or more of the following lipids and lipoproteins were assessed: total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG).

Results

Using a random effects model, statistically significant improvements were observed for all lipids and lipoproteins (TC, ± SEM, -4.3 ± 1.3 mg/dl, 95% CI -6.9 to -1.7 mg/dl; HDL-C, ± SEM, 1.8 ± 0.9 mg/dl, 95% CI 0.1 to 3.5 mg/dl; LDL-C, ± SEM, -4.4 ± 1.1 mg/dl, 95% CI -6.5 to -2.2 mg/dl; TG, ± SEM, -4.2 ± 2.1 mg/dl, 95% CI -8.4 to -0.1 mg/dl). Reductions of approximately 2%, 3%, and 5%, respectively, were observed for TC, LDL-C, and TG, whereas an increase of 3% was observed for HDL-C.

Conclusions

Aerobic exercise is efficacious for increasing HDL-C and decreasing TC, LDL-C, and TG in women.

### Exercise effects on lipids in persons with varying dietary patterns-does diet matter if they exercise? Responses in studies of a targeted risk reduction intervention through defined exercise I [^115fS4qe]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The standard clinical approach for reducing cardiovascular disease risk due to dyslipidemia is to prescribe changes in diet and physical activity. The purpose of the current study was to determine if, across a range of dietary patterns, there were variable lipoprotein responses to an aerobic exercise training intervention.

Methods

Subjects were participants in the STRRIDE I, a supervised exercise program in sedentary, overweight subjects randomized to 6 months of inactivity or 1 of 3 aerobic exercise programs. To characterize diet patterns observed during the study, we calculated a modified z-score that included intakes of total fat, saturated fat, trans fatty acids, cholesterol, omega-3 fatty acids, and fiber as compared with the 2006 American Heart Association diet recommendations. Linear models were used to evaluate relationships between diet patterns and exercise effects on lipoproteins/lipids.

Results

Independent of diet, exercise had beneficial effects on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol particle number, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol size, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol size, and triglycerides (P < .05 for all). However, having a diet pattern that closely adhered to American Heart Association recommendations was not related to changes in these or any other serum lipids or lipoproteins in any of the exercise groups.

Conclusions

We found that even in sedentary individuals whose habitual diets vary in the extent of adherence to AHA dietary recommendations, a rigorous, supervised exercise intervention can achieve significant beneficial lipid effects.

### Efficacy of aerobic exercise and a prudent diet for improving selected lipids and lipoproteins in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116sMg84]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The changes observed in TC, LDL-C and TG in the current investigation appear to be greater than those achieved with aerobic exercise alone. For example, previous meta-analytic work addressing the effects of aerobic exercise on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in women and men yielded significant reductions in TC, LDL-C and TG that were less than half those observed in the current investigation. The ratio of TC to HDL-C was not assessed in either study. In contrast, prior meta-analytic work that examined the effects of Step 1 and 2 diets from the American Heart Association reported improvements in lipid and lipoprotein concentrations that were similar to or larger than the current investigation with respect to TC, ratio of TC to HDL-C and LDL-C. However, changes in TG were less in this prior work. The results of the prior meta-analysis should be viewed with caution as it appears that traditional statistical approaches versus those specific to the conduct of meta-analysis were used. Consequently, the reported changes in lipid and lipoprotein concentrations may be exaggerated.

### Effects of exercise training on cardiorespiratory fitness and biomarkers of cardiometabolic health: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116SCMuq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The results from the subgroup analyses also may have important clinical implications. Consistent with previous evidence, both moderate and vigorous exercise training appeared to have favorable effects on cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiometabolic health. We found that the differences in CVD risk between exercise groups and control groups were not significantly modified by lifestyle, body mass index, or intervention duration. These findings suggest that exercise interventions may have similar effects on cardiovascular health in populations regardless of these factors. Alternatively, the effectiveness of exercise training appeared to be different across strata of age, sex, and health status. The effects of exercise interventions on CRF measures were modified by age, sex, and health status such that people aged < 50 years, men, and people with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or metabolic syndrome appeared to benefit more from exercise interventions. We also observed significant modification of the effects on total cholesterol and LDL-C by preexisting medical conditions (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or metabolic syndromes), and that may explain why we did not find significant effects of exercise on total cholesterol and LDL-C. This finding also suggests that exercise interventions may provide significant benefits for people with those preexisting conditions by lowering total cholesterol and LDL-C.

Strengths of this meta-analysis include the comprehensive and systematic review of both conventional and novel CVD biomarkers, detailed subgroup analyses for potential effect modifiers that have not been conducted previously, assessment of robustness with regard to exercise intensity, and evaluation of the risk of different bias. The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Report included a number of comprehensively systematic reviews and meta-analyses based mostly on observational studies. The evidence from RCTs has been relatively scarce, especially for novel cardiometabolic biomarkers. Our study is the first that synthesized evidence from the RCT setting and covered a comprehensive set of both traditional and novel biomarkers. Our findings are corroborated by several previous meta-analyses of RCTs, but the inclusion of both sexes, more studies, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses allowed us to achieve higher precision in the estimates and to determine the effect modification in subgroups.

### Aerobic exercise, lipids and lipoproteins in overweight and obese adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111DZJQs]. International Journal of Obesity (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Use the meta-analytic approach to examine the effects of aerobic exercise on lipids and lipoproteins in overweight and obese adults.

Data Sources

(1) Computerized literature searches, (2) cross-referencing from review and original articles, (3) hand searching, and (4) expert review of reference list.

Study Selection

(1) randomized controlled trials, (2) aerobic exercise ≥ 8 weeks, (3) adult humans ≥ 18 y of age, (4) all subjects overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²), (5) studies published in journal, dissertation, or master's thesis format, (6) studies published in the English-language, (7) studies published between 1 January 1955 and 1 January 2003, (8) assessment of one or more of the following lipid and/or lipoprotein variables: total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and triglycerides (TG).

Data Abstraction

Dual-coding by the first two authors (inter-rater agreement = 0.96).

Results

In total, 13 studies representing 31 groups (17 exercise, 14 control), 613 subjects (348 exercise, 265 control), and up to 17 outcomes were available for pooling. Across all categories, random-effects modeling resulted in statistically significant improvements for TC (X ± s.e.m., - 3.4 ± 1.7 mg/dl, 95% CI, - 6.7 to - 0.2 mg/dl) and TG (X ± s.e.m., - 16.1 ± 7.3 mg/dl, 95% CI, - 30.2 to - 2.1 mg/dl) but not HDL (X ± s.e.m., 1.6 ± 0.8 mg/dl, 95% CI, - 0.02 to 3.2 mg/dl) or LDL (X ± s.e.m., - 0.5 ± 1.3 mg/dl, 95% CI, - 3.0 to 2.0 mg/dl). Changes were equivalent to improvements of 2% (TC), 11% (TG), 3% (HDL), and 0.3% (LDL). After conducting sensitivity analyses (each study deleted from the model once), only decreases in TG remained statistically significant. Increases in HDL were associated with increases in maximum oxygen consumption (VO₂max in mL/kg/min, r = 0.75, P = 0.002) and decreases in body weight (r = 0.77, P < 0.001), while decreases in LDL were associated with decreases in body weight (r = 0.75, P = 0.009).

Conclusions

Aerobic exercise decreases TG in overweight and obese adults. However, a need exists for additional randomized controlled trials in various overweight and/or obese populations above and beyond those included in our analysis.

### Efficacy of aerobic exercise and a prudent diet for improving selected lipids and lipoproteins in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^11578mv8]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health problem with more than 81 million American adults (about one in three) having one or more types of CVD. In terms of mortality, the estimated annual death rate from CVD in the United States was 831,272, approximately 34.3% of all deaths, in 2006. The costs associated with CVD are also high. In 2010, the annual total direct and indirect costs associated with CVD in the United States were estimated to be $503.2 billion. One of the major risk factors for CVD is less than optimal lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, a common problem among American adults. In 2006, the prevalence of less than optimal concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins was estimated to be 102.2 million for total cholesterol (TC), 35.1 million for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and 71.2 million for low-density lipoproteins cholesterol (LDL-C), the primary target of lipid lowering therapy in adults. These prevalence rates included 46.8% of all American adults for TC, 16.2% for HDL-C and 32.6% for LDL-C.

Physical activity and a prudent diet, defined as a diet in which saturated/trans fat intake is less than approximately 10% of total calories and cholesterol is less than 300 mg/day and/or fiber intake is ≥ 25 g/day in women and ≥ 35 g/day in men, are low cost lifestyle changes that have been recommended for improving lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, especially LDL-C, in adults. However, randomized controlled trials that have employed diets aimed at improving lipids and lipoproteins but may or may not meet the previously stated definition, have led to conflicting findings. Meta-analysis is an approach that can increase statistical power for primary endpoints and subgroups, resolve uncertainty when studies disagree, improve estimates of treatment effect and answer questions not posed at the start of individual trials. Given the conflicting findings and strengths of meta-analysis, the purpose of this study was to use the aggregate data meta-analytic approach to determine the effects of recommendations to perform aerobic exercise combined with recommendations to consume a prudent diet on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in adults.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^114Zrxgo]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Exercise and HDL-C — In adults, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) changes with exercise are variable, with a small "3 to 5% increase" on average and a range "from −5 to +25%" after training, and significant aerobic effects are estimated at "∼ 1000 to 1500 kcal/week (i.e., ∼ 7 to 14 miles/week of walking or jogging)". "6 to 9 weeks of resistance training (8 to 10 exercises, 3 times/week)" can "increase HDL-C 4 to 9% in men and women". Response is influenced by "baseline HDL-C, gender, training volume, and, to a lesser degree, training intensity", is greater "in those who have relatively low HDL-C and high TG levels", shows sex differences as "Average TG levels are higher and HDL-C levels lower in men compared to women", and has genetic determinants with polymorphisms "explaining up to 50% of the variation in HDL-C".

### Short and long term effect of treatment non-pharmacological and lifestyle in patients with metabolic syndrome [^114GhpML]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Some authors report that the exercise can reduce total and fractionated cholesterol as well as contribute to blood pressure control Similar to the results found in this study. Most studies have shown beneficial changes in the levels and chemical composition of fractions and subfractions of HDL-cholesterol (HDL2-cholesterol, the main anti-atherogenic subfraction and HDL3-cholesterol) and LDL-cholesterol (small and dense LDL-cholesterol transformation considered more atherogenic, in large and less dense), after a program of aerobic exercises with different intensities, durations and frequencies, performed by individuals of different age groups and levels of cardiorespiratory fitness. Few were those who did not find significant changes in HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels with aerobic exercise.

In a systematic review on the effects of physical rehabilitation on the relationship between HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol changes and aerobic training seems to be well defined. The acute or chronic effect of aerobic exercise, both low and high intensity and duration, can improve lipoprotein profile, stimulating the better functioning of enzymatic processes involved in lipid metabolism (increased lipoprotein lipase and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase; decrease in hepatic lipase), favoring, mainly, increases in HDL-cholesterol and HDL2-cholesterol subfraction, as well as modifying the chemical composition of LDL-cholesterol, making them less atherogenic. These may be the mechanisms by which patients with metabolic syndrome improved their lipid profile during the rehabilitation program, and maintained during 1-year follow-up.

Physical activity and lipid profile — increased dynamic ("aerobic") physical activity generally includes an increase in blood HDL‑C levels, a reduction in blood triglyceride levels, and variable effects on blood LDL‑C levels; resistance training ("anaerobic") similarly may result in an increase in blood HDL‑C levels, a reduction in blood triglyceride levels, and variable effects on blood LDL‑C levels, and it is unclear whether combining dynamic and resistance training has any greater effect compared to either alone for the same time engaged.

### Effect of exercise intensity and frequency on lipid levels in men with coronary heart disease: training level comparison trial [^112EkmSU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of the Training Level Comparison Trial was to determine whether a more intense exercise program versus a less intensive program has additional favorable effects on blood lipids in men with coronary heart disease (CHD) over a 12-month period. The study-a randomized, controlled trial conducted at 2 clinical centers-enrolled 185 patients with documented CHD. A simple randomization procedure led to unequal numbers of patients in the 2 interventions: 82 in the low-intensity and 103 in the high-intensity group. Target heart rate during exercise corresponded to 50% of maximum oxygen uptake (VO₂max) ± 5 beats/min in the low-intensity group and 85% ± 5 beats/min in the high-intensity group. The intensity of exercise made little difference on lipid improvements. However, the attendance rates for the 6- and 12-month periods (percentage of total exercise sessions attended) were significantly related to increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (r(s) [Spearman rank correlation coefficient 0.20 to 0.26, p < 0.05]), and decreases in the ratios of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-to-HDL cholesterol (LDL:HDL, r(s) = -0.24 to -0.28, p < 0.01) and total-to-HDL cholesterol (total:HDL, r(s) = -0.25 to -0.29, p < 0.01) at 6 and 12 months. The relation of the attendance rate to LDL:HDL and total:HDL ratios remained significant in repeated-measures regression analysis. Exercise frequency may be more important than intensity in improving HDL cholesterol and LDL:HDL and total:HDL ratios in men with CHD.

### Efficacy of aerobic exercise and a prudent diet for improving selected lipids and lipoproteins in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111MrNKv]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Primary outcomes (changes in lipids and lipoproteins)

Changes in lipid and lipoprotein concentrations are shown in Table 3 and Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. As can be seen, statistically significant intervention minus control reductions were found for TC, ratio of TC to HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG but not for HDL-C. Changes in non-HDL-C could not be calculated because none of the studies reported variance statistics for such. None of the studies reported changes in non-HDL-C. Changes were equivalent to intervention minus control reductions of 7.5%, 6.6%, 7.2% and 18.2%, respectively, for TC, ratio of TC to HDL-C, LDL-C and TG. Significant heterogeneity and inconsistency as well as overlapping prediction intervals were found for all lipid and lipoprotein concentrations. With each study deleted from the model once, results remained statistically significant for TC, ratio of TC to HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG while HDL-C remained non-significant [see Additional Files 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. When adjusted for publication bias, results remained statistically significant for TC (-14.7 mg/dl, 95% CI, -19.3, -10.1) and LDL-C (-8.0 mg/dl, 95% CI, -11.3, -4.8). No adjustment for publication bias was necessary for HDL-C, ratio of TC to HDL-C, LDL-C or TG. Cumulative meta-analysis ranked by year, showed that results have remained non-significant for HDL-C and significant for TC, ratio of TC to HDL-C, LDL-C and TG since at least 1998 [see Additional Files 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The direction of results did not change when multiple groups from the same studies were collapsed so there was only one effect size from each study (TC,-16.5 mg/dl, 95% CI, -22.3, -10.8; HDL-C, -1.2 mg/dl, 95% CI, -5.3, 2.8; ratio of TC to HDL-C, -0.4, 95% CI, -0.5, -0.3; LDL-C, -9.6 mg/dl, 95% CI, -13.2, -6.1; TG, -8.4 mg/dl, 95% CI, -14.1, -2.8).

### Impact of progressive resistance training on lipids and lipoproteins in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1164BK8Q]. Preventive Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Given the discrepant findings of progressive resistance training (PRT) on lipids and lipoproteins in adults, we used the meta-analytic approach to examine this issue.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials ≥ 4 weeks dealing with the effects of PRT on lipids and lipoproteins in adult humans ≥ 18 years of age and published between January 1, 1955 and July 12, 2007 were included. Primary outcomes included total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG). A random-effects model was used for analysis with data reported as means and 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Twenty-nine studies representing 1329 men and women (676 exercise, 653 control) were included. Statistically significant improvements were found for TC (-5.5 mg/dl, -9.4 to -1.6), TC/HDL-C (-0.5, -0.9 to -0.2), non-HDL-C (-8.7 mg/dl, -14.1 to -3.3), LDL-C (-6.1 mg/dl, -11.2 to -1.0) and TG (-8.1 mg/dl, -14.5 to -1.8) but not HDL-C (0.7 mg/dl, -1.2 to 2.6). Changes were equivalent to -2.7%, 1.4%, -11.6%, -5.6%, -4.6%, and -6.4%, respectively, for TC, HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG.

Conclusions

Progressive resistance training reduces TC, TC/HDL-C, non-HDL-C, LDL-C and TG in adults.

### Effect of financial incentives for process, outcomes, or both on cholesterol level change: a randomized clinical trial [^113cTyjk]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Given these concerns, an intervention directly rewarding a surrogate health outcome, such as lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (an outcome incentive), could be appealing compared with daily adherence incentives. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lies on the causal pathway between statin use and clinical outcomes, such as a myocardial infarction or death. Furthermore, LDL-C levels can be improved by diet, exercise, and weight loss as well as statin therapy, so a cholesterol-targeted intervention could allow patients to choose their preferred healthy behaviors. A disadvantage of incentivizing LDL-C level improvement is that any change in behavior would likely take weeks to affect LDL-C levels and trigger a financial reward. Furthermore, because many health outcomes, such as LDL-C level lowering, are measured infrequently in usual care, the feedback to patients would take place sporadically. Patients who did not qualify for an outcome incentive might feel that they lacked timely guidance or the ability to take beneficial steps to earn incentives.

Direct comparison of process and outcome incentives for medication adherence is novel. We designed a 4-group randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of 12-month interventions involving financial incentives for process, outcomes, and a combination of both for statin users with evidence of nonadherence. The primary outcome was a change in LDL-C levels over 12 months.

### Lipoprotein subfraction changes after continuous or intermittent exercise training [^1148KAGc]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study compared total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and their respective subfractions after completing 4 wk of either intermittent (INT-EX) or continuous (CON-EX) aerobic exercise training (TRAIN).

Methods

Untrained males (N = 7) and females (N = 11) completed 4 wk of TRAIN of supervised treadmill jogging occurring 5 d.wk(-1) for 30 min per session at 60% VO2max (75% HRmax). CON-EX was a single 30-min bout. INT-EX consisted of three 10-min bouts separated by 20 min of seated rest. Pre- and post-TRAIN fasting plasma samples were collected after subjects had followed 48 h of activity restriction and a 24-h repeated diet including a 12-h dietary fast. Postprandial lipemia was measured for 8 h following a standardized high-fat meal.

Results

Fasting triglycerides and very LDL-C were not affected by TRAIN, and TRAIN did not change postprandial area under the curve or peak in either group. With groups combined, TRAIN significantly decreased TC, total LDL-C, and the TC:HDL ratio, and increased HDL-C subfraction 2 and LDL mean particle size. Total intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol remained unchanged at post-TRAIN, and was not different between groups.

Conclusions

To prevent dyslipidemia, our findings suggest that persons who are normolipidemic can improve the lipoprotein profile equally with CON-EX and INT-EX by lowered TC through the sum of changes in LDL-C subfractions, increased mean LDL particle size, and increased HDL-C subfraction 2 concentration.

### HIIT is not superior to MICT in altering blood lipids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115DzCVS]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol

HIIT showed significance compared with MICT for affecting HDL-C, however sensitivity analysis (K–1) contradicted this result. Our findings agree with a previous meta-analysis, although this work compared exercise with no exercise only and focussed on overweight and obese populations. We also agree with the results of a recent meta-analysis comparing intensity, although this work focussed on studies of subjects with cardiovascular conditions. Our results are dissimilar to other systematic reviews, and two (one female and one male) meta-analyses, although none of these works compared for intensity. Given the greater impact on cardiorespiratory fitness of HIIT compared with MICT, our result is not unexpected, as HIIT would most likely outperform MICT in optimising lipid transport via an improved microvascular capillary network. However, both HIIT and MICT have been shown to equally improve muscle microvascular density.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol

We found no significance for preferring HIIT to MICT for positively changing LDL-C. Our findings agree with other meta-analyses. We differ from two meta-analyses comparing exercise with no exercise and examining general populations, as well as a meta-analysis comparing intensity and examining LDL-C in overweight and obese populations. We surmise this is a corollary of our inclusion of studies with healthy participants, although our subanalyses of clinical and subclinical participants did not affect significance. Previous work showing that LDL-C falls when accompanied by weight loss has been corroborated by a later meta-analysis comparing exercise with no exercise in overweight and obese groups. A recent meta-analysis of HIIT compared with MICT in these populations showed no preference for either protocol in achieving weight loss. Existing higher base levels of lipids in these populationsmay have led to sufficient decrease in LDL-C to demonstrate significance for HIIT protocols. According to one systematic review, increasing intensity is required to impact LDL-C, hence MICT by its nature should have shown inferiority to HIIT. Insufficient intervention duration and probable similar overall intensity in the protocols of included studies may have obfuscated our results.

TC/HDL-C ratio

HIIT and MICT were equivalent in reducing TC/HDL-C ratio.

### The effects of exercise on the lipoprotein subclass profile: a meta-analysis of 10 interventions [^114Qn7oa]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal was to examine lipoprotein subclass responses to regular exercise as measured in 10 exercise interventions derived from six cohorts.

Methods

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to quantify average particle size, total and subclass concentrations of very low-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein particles (VLDL-P, LDL-P, and HDL-P, respectively) before and after an exercise intervention in 1555 adults from six studies, encompassing 10 distinct exercise programs: APOE (N = 106), DREW (N = 385), GERS (N = 79), HERITAGE (N = 715), STRRIDE I (N = 168) and II (N = 102). Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to evaluate the overall estimate of mean change across the unadjusted and adjusted mean change values from each exercise group.

Results

Meta-analysis of unadjusted data showed that regular exercise induced significant decreases in the concentration of large VLDL-P, small LDL-P, and medium HDL-P and mean VLDL-P size, with significant increases in the concentration of large LDL-P and large HDL-P and mean LDL-P size. These changes remained significant in meta-analysis with adjustment for age, sex, race, baseline body mass index, and baseline trait value.

Conclusions

Despite differences in exercise programs and study populations, regular exercise produced putatively beneficial changes in the lipoprotein subclass profile across 10 exercise interventions. Further research is needed to examine how exercise-induced changes in lipoprotein subclasses may be associated with (concomitant changes in) cardiovascular disease risk.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113FLihH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Physical activity — lipid effects and recommended amounts — US government guidelines recommend a total of 150 to 300 minutes a week of moderate intensity aerobic physical activity, or 75 to 150 minutes a week of vigorous exercise, as well as resistance training at least twice a week; across reviews, physical activity decreased LDL-C by 2.5 to 6.0 mg/dL (0.1 to 0.2 mmol/L) but had no consistent effect on TG.

### ApoB but not LDL-cholesterol is reduced by exercise training in overweight healthy men. results from the 1-year randomized oslo diet and exercise study [^112ohTJ8]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

(i) To estimate changes in apoB and apoB/apoA-I, reflecting the balance between atherogenic and anti-atherogenic lipoprotein particles, by exercise training and compare with changes in LDL-C and TC/HDL-C ratio, and (ii) To compare strengths of relationships between physical fitness and various lipoprotein variables.

Design, Setting, and Subjects

The study was a 1-year open randomized trial comprising 219 healthy middle-aged subjects aged 40–49 years who were allocated to exercise or no exercise, dietary advice or no advice in a 2 x 2 factorial design. This study includes 188 men who completed the trial, 45 to diet, 48 to exercise, 58 to diet + exercise and 37 to control.

Interventions

Exercise; supervised endurance exercise three times a week. Diet; reduce weight, increase intake of fish and reduce total fat intake.

Main Outcome Measure

One-year change in apoB and apoB/apoA-I ratio.

Results

Exercisers decreased their ApoB and ApoB/ApoA-I values significantly compared to non-exercisers. LDL-C was not, but LDL-C/HDL-C was marginally but statistically significantly reduced by exercise. One-year change in ApoB and ApoB/ApoA-I correlated more strongly to 1-year changes in physical fitness than LDL-C or LDL-C/HDL-C. Adjusting for changes in LDL-C or LDL-C/HDL-C did not influence the correlation between changes in fitness and ApoB or ApoB/ApoA-I. However, adjusting for changes in ApoB or ApoB/ApoA-I wiped out the correlation between change in fitness and LDL-C or LDL-C/HDL-C. Relationships weakened when adjusting for changes in waist circumference, but Apo B or ApoB/ApoA-I still correlated significantly to changes in fitness.

Conclusion

Physical exercise reduced the atherogenic burden as experienced by the reduction in apoB or apoB/apoA-I levels, but not by LDL-C in healthy middle-aged men. Possibly, regular physical activity might increase the LDL-C particle size, thereby making LDL less atherogenic. Monitoring of apolipoproteins rather than the cholesterol moiety of lipoproteins might improve the assessment of lipoprotein changes after exercise training.

### Recent national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III update: adjustments and options [^116ixYTH]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

In the summer of 2004, an evidence-based update of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines for management of hypercholesterolemia was published. This detailed assessment of 5 major clinical trials, published since the ATP III report in 2001, was designed to provide guidance for physicians in decision making for patients at high risk and very high risk. We have tried to summarize this assessment by suggesting the following to clinicians: (1) Calculate global risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) to determine an overall strategy for cholesterol management. (2) Emphasize the benefits of diet, exercise, and weight control or therapeutic lifestyle change, especially in those with lifestyle risk factors. (3) Use 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) as first-line drugs to reduce risk of CAD and stroke in those at moderate to high risk. (4) If statins are prescribed, use moderate doses that reduce plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by ≥ 30% to 40%. (5) Strongly consider statin therapy in those with diabetes (with the exception of severe hypertriglyceridemia). (6) Consider LDL cholesterol-lowering drug therapy for lipids in older patients at risk. (7) Consider adding either a fibrate or nicotinic acid in high-risk patients with elevated plasma triglyceride values or low levels of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol after statin therapy has achieved the LDL cholesterol goal. (8) Continue to treat those at low risk in similar fashion as before. This update is to inform current physician judgment in this area. Further clinical trial data that may modify or extend these recommendations are eagerly awaited.

### Efficacy of aerobic exercise and a prudent diet for improving selected lipids and lipoproteins in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111LrYRn]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

While statistically significant and practically important improvements were observed for TC, the ratio of TC to HDL-C, LDL-C and TG, no such differences were observed for HDL-C. The lack of effect on HDL-C may not be surprising given that aerobic exercise alone has been shown to increase concentrations of HDL-C in both women and men while low total and saturated fat diets have been shown to significantly decrease HDL-C. Thus, it appears that the positive effects of aerobic exercise on HDL-C may not override the lowering effect of diets generally low in total and saturated fat but may help to mitigate these changes given that the current meta-analysis found a non-significant decrease in HDL-C of 1.3% while low-fat only diets resulted in a statistically significant decrease of 7%. Given that participants with low concentrations of HDL-C may respond less to exercise than those with high concentrations, it is important to note that results remained consistent when each study was excluded from the model once, including the one study that enrolled participants with initially low concentrations of HDL-C. With the former in mind, other forms of therapy, for example, fibrates or niacin, may be necessary for raising HDL-C in adults who exercise aerobically and consume a low-fat diet. However, as previously noted, the results of the low-fat diet meta-analysis may have been exaggerated. Based on this observation, it appears that a need exists for an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to determine the effects of low-fat only diets on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, especially HDL-C, in adults.

### Effects of lifestyle interventions on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [^111brZeX]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2007). Low credibility.

This review summarizes intervention studies that evaluated the effects of lifestyle behaviors on high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Current diet and lifestyle recommendations beneficially affect HDL-C. Individual lifestyle interventions that increase HDL-C include: a healthful diet that is low (7–10% of calories) in saturated fat and sufficient in unsaturated fat (15–20% of calories), regular physical activity, attaining a healthy weight, with moderate alcohol consumption, and cessation of cigarette smoking. Combining a healthy diet with weight loss and physical activity can increase HDL-C 10% to 13%. When combined with interventions that beneficially affect other cardiovascular disease risk factors, this increase in HDL-C is expected to contribute to a overall reduction in cardiovascular disease risk.

Greater decreases in the ratio of TC:HDL-C were associated with being male (β 1, -0.44, 95% CI, -0.82, -0.06) and greater decreases in body weight (β 1, 0.10, 95% CI, 0.03, 0.18). Greater decreases in TG were also associated with larger decreases in body weight (β 1, 3.20, 95% CI, 1.05, 5.35). No other significant associations were observed for any of our lipid and lipoprotein concentrations.

### Low and moderate, rather than high intensity strength exercise induces benefit regarding plasma lipid profile [^117WM93X]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

It is well established that physical inactivity is related to decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and exceeded triglycerides (TG) concentrations, which contribute, at least partially, to increased atherosclerotic disease(s) risk. On the other hand, chronic exercise training has favorable effects on lipid profile. In this context, increased exercise practice, mainly continuous aerobic exercise, has been considered one of the best non-pharmacological strategies in preventing and treating cardiovascular diseases.

Although the effect of chronic aerobic exercise upon lipid profile has been demonstrated, few studies have shown this effect under resistance exercise conditions. Sallinen et al. showed that older men submitted to chronic resistance training schedule by 21 weeks (80% of 1-RM), do not improved blood lipid profile, while systolic blood pressure and muscle strength was improved. The authors suggested that chronic resistance exercise improved markers of cardiovascular risk and the resistance exercise alone was not enough to induce a favorable lipid profile. A similar result was observed by Elliott et al. were postmenopausal women, executing resistance training sessions by 16 weeks (80% of 10-RM, three times a week) did not show changes in lipid profile, although presented improved muscle strength. On the other hand, premenopausal women trained during 14 weeks (85% of 1-RM, three times a week) showed a 9% decrease in total cholesterol, 14% decrease in LDL-cholesterol, and 14.3% in the ratio total cholesterol/HDL-c.

In another study performed with untrained males comparing two different protocols (low vs. high-repetition; 5-RM and 15-RM, respectively) by 10 weeks (three times a week) Kokkinos et al. showed no difference in lipoprotein profiles. Finally, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial showed that chronic resistance training decreased total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, TG, and increased HDL-c.

When the main issue is acute exercise, little is known about the acute resistance training upon blood lipid profile in healthy people. Thus, few information exist about the effects of different resistance exercise intensities on lipid profile.

The effective exercise training in lipid profile is dependent of exercise intensity, duration and frequency of each session associated with the length of the exercise training period. Therefore, we hypothesized that acute resistance exercise may induce changes in lipid profile in a specific-intensity manner. We aimed to compare the effect of four different acute strength resistance intensities (50%, 75%, 90% and 110%-1 RM) on the lipid profile in healthy men.

### Moderate-and high-intensity exercise improves lipoprotein profile and cholesterol efflux capacity in healthy young men [^114j3FJn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that moderate‐intensity exercise has a beneficial effect on fitness, body composition, lipid and lipoprotein profile, and HDL function in a homogeneous, well‐controlled group of male army recruits with a high level of baseline fitness. This study showed that such benefits can be achieved with moderate‐intensity exercise, and that a sequential high‐intensity exercise program showed either a sustained or incremental benefit. On the other hand, we found that the subjects showed unexpected but subtle exercise‐associated increases in plasma hsCRP, triglyceride levels, and insulin resistance. The absolute changes in these parameters were small and the clinical significance is unknown. It does, however, raise the possibility that some of the benefits of exercise could be partly offset by mildly increased systemic inflammation and impaired glycemic control.

This study found that moderate‐ and high‐intensity exercise are both associated with a less atherogenic lipid/lipoprotein profile, as evidenced by the increase in apoA‐I and HDL‐C levels. Most of the improvements seen after moderate‐intensity exercise were sustained after high‐intensity exercise. However, there was a clear benefit of a sequential high‐intensity exercise program after the moderate‐intensity program with a further incremental increase in HDL‐C and apoA‐I levels. This was independent of age, BMI, percentage of body fat, fitness, and HDL‐C. As there was no high‐intensity exercise‐only group, it is not known whether the benefits that were observed after the high‐intensity exercise program are due to exercise intensity or exercise volume given that those who participated in the high‐intensity exercise program were subjected to both a more intense and longer duration program. Previous studies have demonstrated an improvement in lipid/lipoprotein profile with exercise but have not shown an added benefit of high‐ over moderate‐intensity exercise. Those studies also showed that exercise does not change or modestly decreases LDL‐C levels. This is consistent with the present results, where moderate‐intensity exercise reduced apoB and LDL‐C levels and also showed that the change in fitness level was negatively correlated with apoB and LDL‐C levels after moderate‐intensity exercise.

Subgroup Analyses

Our metaregression results suggest that the differences in CRF between exercise and control groups were modified by age and sex (absolute CRF: P = 0.008 and P < 0.001 for age and sex, respectively; relative CRF: P = 0.003 and P = 0.001 for age and sex, respectively) (Table 5, Figure 3). In addition, the effects of exercise on levels of total cholesterol (P = 0.04), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; P = 0.06), and fasting insulin (P = 0.05) were modified by the presence of at least 1 of the following comorbidities: type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome (Tables 6 and 7, Figure 3). Sex differences in the effects of exercise were also found for fasting insulin (P = 0.04).

### Exercise-mediated changes in high-density lipoprotein: impact on form and function [^113aWMAP]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The goal of this systematic review was to assess the current understanding of the effects of exercise intervention on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C) and changes in HDL function as well as modification of these effects by genomic factors. The reviewed studies demonstrate that exercise has modest effects on HDL-C with limited data suggesting an effect on HDL function. Genetic polymorphisms in proteins associated with HDL metabolism play a role in modifying the HDL-C response to exercise and possibly its function. Exercise as an intervention for patients at risk for cardiovascular events can lead to small improvements in HDL-C and potential changes in HDL function. There is an important modifier effect of genetics in determining these changes.

### LDL-C: lower is better for longer-even at low risk [^111WyLVK]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Proposed approach to the management of cardiovascular risks in individuals with low (< 1%) 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease, but elevated (> 140 mg/dL, 3.6 mmol/L) LDL-C

The first and most important approach to low 10-year risk individuals is to provide education and information relating to the benefits of lifestyle interventions (LSI). The dietary approach to LDL-C reduction includes the promotion of a well-balanced diet, which derives a low proportion of energy from saturated fatty acids, and a high proportion from polyunsaturated fatty acids. ESC/EAS guidelines suggest that carbohydrate intake should range between 45 and 55% of total energy intake and that intake of added sugar should not exceed 10% of total energy. In the short-term, low-carbohydrate diets (LCD) improve lipid profile, although a recent well-designed investigation found a potentially unfavourable association of LCD with overall and cause-specific mortality, based on both analyses of an established cohort and by pooling previous cohort studies in a meta-analysis. Dietary fibre (particularly when it replaces saturated fat in the diet) has beneficial effects on plasma lipid profile. The benefits of smoking cessation, exercise, and weight reduction, on cardiovascular risk, are more closely associated with elevation of HDL-C and reduction of triglycerides, than reduction of LDL-C, but these strategies should nevertheless be encouraged in all individuals, especially those with any risk factors for CVD.

### Moderate-and high-intensity exercise improves lipoprotein profile and cholesterol efflux capacity in healthy young men [^1138pXCY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Exercise has been shown to reduce overall mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, in a dose‐dependent manner. However, the mechanisms by which CVD risk is reduced by exercise have not been fully elucidated. Also, the optimal type, volume, and intensity of exercise have not been clearly determined for CVD risk reduction.

Exercise has consistently been shown to increase high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) levels, and HDL‐C levels have been shown in large‐scale epidemiologic studies to be inversely related to CVD risk. However, the effect of exercise on other lipids and lipoproteins is less consistent. Despite the strength of the epidemiologic data, and the beneficial effects of increasing HDL‐C levels in animal studies, large‐scale clinical outcome trials of effective HDL‐raising therapies have not reduced CVD events. In light of this, attention has shifted away from using HDL‐C to reduce CVD risk toward strategies with the potential to improve HDL function. HDLs have several putative atheroprotective functions. They accept the cholesterol that effluxes from macrophages in the artery wall in the first step of reverse cholesterol transport. Cholesterol efflux is inversely associated with cardiovascular events independent of HDL‐C level, HDL size, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors and may underlie at least part of the cardioprotective effects of HDLs.HDLs also have anti‐inflammatory and antioxidant properties and have been shown to inhibit monocyte activation and proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine synthesis. However, knowledge about the effects of exercise on cholesterol efflux and the other cardioprotective functions of HDLs is limited.

In addition to its ability to increase HDL‐C, several studies have indicated that exercise is associated with lower levels of circulating markers of inflammation and decreased CVD risk. More recently, the CANTOS study (Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study) established that inhibiting systemic inflammation was causally related to decreased cardiovascular events in people with prior myocardial infarction. However, the effects of exercise on markers of systemic inflammation in healthy populations are inconsistent. Exercise does, however, decrease inflammation in endothelial cells in patients with established cardiovascular risk factors, but the effect on healthy individuals is not known. In contrast to the chronic effects of exercise, acute endurance exercise has been shown to increase CRP (C‐reactive protein) and inflammatory cytokine levels. These inconsistent results may be a reflection of heterogeneity in the study populations and poor control of external factors such as diet, exercise, and sleep patterns.

### Functional training added to intradialytic cycling lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and improves dialysis adequacy: a randomized controlled trial [^1119F7Jd]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients in the last stage of chronic kidney disease usually have either normal or increased LDL and decreased levels of HDL. There is clear evidence that lower LDL in population with normal or slightly altered kidney function is beneficial in preventing major cardiovascular risks and mortality. However, in dialysis patients, LDL cholesterol shows a negative association with cardiovascular outcomes at below-average LDL cholesterol levels and a flat or weakly positive association with mortality at higher LDL cholesterol levels. It is known that aerobic exercise can reduce LDL and increase HDL levels in patients on HD. De Moura et al. on the contrary, in a study that included 12 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise training during HD showed an increase in triglycerides and LDL. In the present study, there was a significant decrease in total cholesterol and LDL concentrations in the intervention group, with a significant difference in LDL cholesterol between groups after 16 weeks. While KDOQI guidelines do not advocate de-novo statin therapy for lipid-lowering in dialysis patients, this does not extend automatically to lipid-lowering with exercise interventions, which provide other important benefits beyond lipid control. It is well documented that the addition of resistance training to aerobic exercise can improve the lipid profile. This was confirmed in a recent study, which showed that interdialytic endurance-resistance training reduced triglycerides and LDL levels and increased HDL. Our findings suggest that with increased volume of exercise in the INT group, there may be a significant effect on total cholesterol and especially on LDL, opposite to a more limited exercise volume in the CON group. Additionally, one study showed that high-load intradialytic resistance training improved lean leg mass in HD patients. Having in mind that cholesterol is associated with skeletal muscles' response, it was expected that LDL levels would reduce in the current study. The 0.35 mmol/l between-group difference is much smaller than expected with a statin therapy where LDL lowering in the range of 0.85–1.27 mmol/l difference was found in major trials.

Effects of Sequential Moderate‐ and High‐Intensity Exercise Program on Plasma Lipid and Apolipoprotein Levels, Glucose Metabolism, and Inflammation

In the subgroup that completed both exercise programs, HDL‐C and apoA‐I levels increased after moderate‐intensity training by 8.2% (P < 0.05) and 13.5% (P < 0.001) respectively and increased further after the high‐intensity exercise training program (8.2%, P < 0.001 and 6.3%, P < 0.05 respectively) (Table 2). ApoA‐II levels decreased after moderate‐intensity exercise (P < 0.01) but were increased relative to baseline and moderate‐intensity exercise after the high‐intensity exercise program (both P < 0.001). In this subgroup LDL‐C and apoB levels did not change in response to either the moderate‐ or high‐intensity exercise program. TC levels were comparable at baseline and after moderate‐intensity exercise but increased significantly relative to baseline and moderate‐intensity exercise after the high‐intensity exercise program (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). All of these changes remained significant after adjusting for age, BMI, percentage of body fat, fitness, and HDL‐C. Exercise had no effect on plasma pre‐β 1 HDL levels.

Triglyceride and blood glucose levels increased after moderate‐intensity exercise (both P < 0.001), and these increases persisted after the high‐intensity exercise program (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Plasma insulin levels and HOMA‐IR significantly increased relative to baseline after moderate‐ (both P < 0.01) but not high‐intensity exercise. hsCRP levels were increased after the high‐ (P < 0.01) but not moderate‐intensity exercise program compared with baseline but did not differ between the moderate‐ and high‐intensity exercise program.

### Effects of the amount and intensity of exercise on plasma lipoproteins [^117Sjvn6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Increased physical activity is related to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, possibly because it leads to improvement in the lipoprotein profile. However, the amount of exercise training required for optimal benefit is unknown. In a prospective, randomized study, we investigated the effects of the amount and intensity of exercise on lipoproteins.

Methods

A total of 111 sedentary, overweight men and women with mild-to-moderate dyslipidemia were randomly assigned to participate for six months in a control group or for approximately eight months in one of three exercise groups: high-amount-high-intensity exercise, the caloric equivalent of jogging 20 mi (32.0 km) per week at 65 to 80 percent of peak oxygen consumption; low-amount-high-intensity exercise, the equivalent of jogging 12 mi (19.2 km) per week at 65 to 80 percent of peak oxygen consumption; or low-amount-moderate-intensity exercise, the equivalent of walking 12 mi per week at 40 to 55 percent of peak oxygen consumption. Subjects were encouraged to maintain their base-line body weight. The 84 subjects who complied with these guidelines served as the basis for the main analysis. Detailed lipoprotein profiling was performed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with verification by measurement of cholesterol in lipoprotein subfractions.

Results

There was a beneficial effect of exercise on a variety of lipid and lipoprotein variables, seen most clearly with the high amount of high-intensity exercise. The high amount of exercise resulted in greater improvements than did the lower amounts of exercise (in 10 of 11 lipoprotein variables) and was always superior to the control condition (11 of 11 variables). Both lower-amount exercise groups always had better responses than the control group (22 of 22 comparisons).

Conclusions

The highest amount of weekly exercise, with minimal weight change, had widespread beneficial effects on the lipoprotein profile. The improvements were related to the amount of activity and not to the intensity of exercise or improvement in fitness.

### Clinical practice guideline exercise and lifestyle in chronic kidney disease [^115BdD8e]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Blood lipids

The effects of physical activity and exercise on blood lipids has been examined in 5 systematic reviews. Of these, two also included ESRD patients and showed no significant changes in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) or triglycerides. One systematic review did infer beneficial effect on triglyceride levels in the short term (< 3 months); however, the benefit was not apparent in analysis of longer duration intervention (up to 12 months). Pei and colleagues reported a small but significant increase in HDL-C (3.54 mg/dL) from six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which looked at exercise interventions in non-dialysis CKD, but no further benefits were noted. The above findings were recently confirmed in the most recent systematic review and meta-analysis which concluded that current available evidence suggests that exercise interventions have little to no effect on blood lipid levels in non-dialysis CKD patient populations. Our own systematic review found an additional two RCTs which studied the effect to exercise therapy on blood lipids; they both found no benefit of combined exercise training on any component of the blood lipid profile. Overall, our conclusion of the current research base is that there is no beneficial effect of exercise in total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C or triglycerides. Thus, we are currently unable to recommend exercise as an intervention to improve blood lipid levels or composition.

Glycaemic control

There are currently no published systematic reviews which have examined the effects of exercise or physical activity interventions on fasting blood sugar levels or HbA1C in non-dialysis CKD patients. One systematic review reports that aerobic and resistance exercise can reduce mean HbA1C, though the studies included were not designed for this purpose and included patients with CKD alongside other diabetic populations. Following a review of the current RCTs available, seven were noted to report HbA1C as an outcome. These RCTs reported a variety of exercise interventions, including home-based, aerobic, and exercise combined with other lifestyle interventions. Only one study, using aerobic exercise either supervised or at home for 24 weeks, showed beneficial effects on HbA1c. One other study has reported a benefit on glycaemic control: Barcellos and colleagues did report reduced fasting glucose levels in response to an exercise intervention 16 weeks in length (reduced by 11.3 mg/dL). With this in mind, based upon the current research we are unable to make recommendations for the use of exercise to induce beneficial changes in glycaemic control, though further research is required which is specifically designed to address this question in non-dialysis CKD patients.

### Walking, lipids, and lipoproteins: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112QgMHj]. Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to use the meta-analytic approach to examine the effects of walking on lipids and lipoproteins in adults.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials that examined the effects of walking on total cholesterol (TC), high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C and LDL-C), the ratio of TC/HDL, and triglycerides (TG) in adults ages 18 years and older were retrieved via computerized literature searches, cross-referencing, hand-searching, and expert review of our reference list.

Results

Twenty-five studies that included 1,176 subjects (692 walkers, 484 controls) and up to 33 outcomes were available for pooling. Using random-effects modeling, statistically significant, walking-induced decreases of 5% and 6% were observed for LDL-C and TC/HDL-C (LDL-C, mean ± SE, -5.5 ± 2.2 mg/dL, 95% CI, -9.9 to -1.2 mg/dL; TC/HDL-C, mean ± SE, -0.3 ± 0.1, 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.1). No statistically significant changes were observed for TC, HDL, or TG (P > 0.05), although changes were in the direction of benefit. No statistically significant changes occurred in body composition (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Walking reduces LDL-C and TC/HDL-C in adults independent of changes in body composition.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Lifestyle intervention and monitoring of response to LDL-C–lowering therapies — For all patient groups, the consensus emphasizes lifestyle modifications (adherence to a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise habits, avoidance of tobacco products, and maintenance of a healthy weight) and that these remain critical components of ASCVD risk reduction, both before and in concert with the use of cholesterol-lowering drug therapies. Dietary adjuncts for lowering atherogenic cholesterol may also be considered for patients with dyslipidemia, including phytosterols and viscous soluble dietary fibers, and referral to a registered dietitian (RD)/registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) may be considered to improve understanding of heart-healthy dietary principles and individualize nutrition recommendations. Adherence to lifestyle modifications should be regularly assessed at the time of initiation or modification of statin therapy and during monitoring of ongoing therapy, and it is critical that the clinician assess and reinforce adherence to intensive lifestyle changes before initiation of these additional agents. For response monitoring, the writing committee recommends the use of an initial fasting lipid panel (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, and LDL-C).

### Low and moderate, rather than high intensity strength exercise induces benefit regarding plasma lipid profile [^116vuSgJ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present investigation examined four different intensities of an acute resistance exercise protocol on the blood lipid profile at rest and after 1, 24, 48 and 72 h. Endurance exercise-induced changes in HDL-c is the resulting interaction between exercise intensity, duration and frequency of each session coupled with the length of the exercise training period. Both, acute and chronic effects of endurance exercise on the lipoprotein metabolism have been extensively documented and reviewed. On the other hand, the effects of resistance exercise on the lipoprotein concentrations remain equivocal.

We observed that the moderate resistance exercised group (75%-1 RM) reduced the TG compared to 50%, 90% and 110% intensities. Interestingly, the low and moderate resistance exercised group (50% and 75%) increased HDL-c when compared to the high intensity group (110%) and no significant differences in LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol concentrations were observed. Collectively, these results suggest by the first time, for our knowledge, that there may be a dose-response relationship between resistance training intensity and lipid profile modulation.

The effect of resistance training upon blood lipid profile has been shown to favorably modify the lipoproteins, while others have reported no changes. For example, Wallace et al. comparing acute high volume (10–12 RM) vs. acute low volume (1–5 RM loads) exercise showed, in healthy trained males, an increased in HDL-c 24 h after acute high volume exercise bout, without changes in total cholesterol and TG. However, this study presented an important bias, due to the equalization absence in the work produced by the exercise bouts (sets × repetitions × weight). Therefore, it is possible that the different volumes of training used in the supra-cited study could have contributed to the differences in the results obtained. Hill et al. showed that acute high intensity (10-RM) vs. low intensity (5-RM) does not modulate TG, total cholesterol and LDL-c, and only high intensity resistance exercise increased HDL-c immediately after the exercise bout. The authors suggested that HDL-c response is intensity-dependent, supporting the concept that an adaptive threshold may exist in resistance exercise.

### Revisiting traditional Chinese exercise in prediabetes: effects on glycaemic and lipid metabolism-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Ax8EE]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

LDL is traditionally considered a cardiovascular risk factor, but its role in diabetes progression remains controversial. A large retrospective study in Chinese adults found that increased LDL (≥ 2.16 mmol/L) may reduce prediabetes risk through mechanisms such as decreased pancreatic β-cell uptake of LDL particles. Recent research suggests elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol does not necessarily increase cardiovascular risk. Beebe et al. found that after 16 weeks of Tai Chi, LDL concentrations did not significantly decrease. TCEs appeared to optimize LDL particle size, resulting in a slight increase in total LDL concentration. Our meta-analysis also did not observe significant changes in LDL concentrations, possibly due to the optimization of LDL particle size by TCEs rather than a direct reduction in LDL concentration. TCEs promote the generation and activity of lipoprotein lipase, reducing the likelihood of TG-LDL exchange, thereby increasing LDL particle size and transforming it into a healthier phenotype, which lowers cardiovascular risk. Thus, the metabolic role of LDL in individuals with prediabetes may have a dual nature, and focusing solely on its concentration changes may not fully assess metabolic health status.

### Effect of resistance exercise on body composition, muscle strength and cardiometabolic health during dietary weight loss in people living with overweight or obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112VYKCB]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Despite fat-free mass and muscle strength being associated with a variety of positive health outcomes, and resistance exercise resulting in improvement in cardiometabolic health markers, we did not find any impact of the addition of resistance exercise to a weight loss intervention on markers of cardiometabolic health. The certainty of evidence for these outcomes ranged from low to high, with total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol being particularly uncertain due to high heterogeneity. Instead of simply reflecting the importance of weight loss itself in changes in these outcomes, this may indicate several possibilities. The level of caloric restriction in weight loss interventions may mask the cardiometabolic benefits of resistance exercise that are seen in non-calorie-restricted settings. It is also possible that the prescribed resistance exercise training volume, intensity or progression in these interventions was not sufficient to produce further cardiometabolic benefits over and above those from weight loss alone. Additionally, the timing of outcome assessments may not have captured the whole adaptive response, especially if metabolic benefits from resistance training follow time frames that are distinct from the metabolic benefits of dietary restriction. It is crucial to emphasise that there is strong evidence supporting resistance training as an effective single intervention for improving cardiometabolic outcomes frequently with few or no changes in body weight. Alternatively, there were fewer studies and greater uncertainty in our analysis of these outcomes, and we would suggest that further work, including larger RCTs with carefully designed protocols and appropriate assessments, is needed on this topic.

### Sport in ischemic heart disease: focus on primary and secondary prevention [^1146rta8]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The components of lipids that are most amenable to change with exercise implementation are TG and HDL In particular the enzyme lipoprotein lipase that is critical in the formation of HDL is increased with aerobic exercise. A large cross‐sectional study by Da Silva et al.assessed the association of physical activity with HDL, LDL, and TG on 12 688 individuals who were not on lipid‐lowering medication: moderate and vigorous physical activity increased mean HDL level by 0.89 and 1.71 mg/dL, respectively, and reduced TG geometric mean by 0.98 and 0.93 mg/dL, respectively. Vigorous physical activity was also associated with lower LDL. Many studies and metanalysis focused their attention on plasma TG: Lampman et al.showed that the effects of exercise on subjects with mild to moderate elevated TG levels were more marked and longer‐lasting when associated with diet, while other Authors observed a significant reduction in TG despite the calories dietary intakeand independently from the weight loss. A more recent systematic review by Jimenez et al.including 36 studies, evaluated the comparative effectiveness of statins versus aerobic exercise in reducing fasting and postprandial TG (PPTG) concentrations in individuals at high risk of developing IHD. The results showed that statin and exercise interventions carried similar reductions in PPTG levels. Evidence regarding the effect of exercise on LDL is conflicting: most studies have shown favorable effects, especially when high‐amount–high‐intensity exercise was performed, while some other papers did not observe similar results.

### The role of exercise in modulating the impact of an ultralow-fat diet on serum lipids and apolipoproteins in patients with or at risk for coronary artery disease [^112b9AZY]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Ultralow-fat diets are known to reduce high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. In the setting of a multicomponent lifestyle intervention program, relationships between exercise variables and HDL-C levels were examined to determine whether exercise moderates this dietary effect on serum lipids and apolipoproteins.

Methods

We performed a 3-month, prospective, nonrandomized lifestyle intervention study (≤ 10% dietary fat; aerobic exercise [180 min/wk], group support, and yoga [60 min/day]) in 120 subjects with or at risk for coronary artery disease.

Results

After 3 months, dietary fat intake was reduced to 8.7% ± 2.6% of total intake and the median weekly exercise time was 194 minutes. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased by 8.3 ± 11.3 mg/dL (P < .001), and triglyceride levels increased by 17.6 ± 102.7 mg/dL (P = 0.026). A small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) phenotype emerged indicated by a 13.8% LDL-C reduction accompanied by only a 2.3% reduction in apolipoprotein B levels (P = 0.064). Among subjects with exercise amounts less than those of the group median, HDL-C reductions were greater in those with more than (-13.5 ± 16.0 mg/dL) versus less than (-2.5 ± 7.5 mg/dL) the median reductions in fat intake (P = 0.026). Even among subjects who exercised > 194 min/wk, HDL-C was reduced compared with baseline (-7.4 ± 7.9 mg/dL, P < .001).

Conclusions

An ultralow-fat diet as a component of a comprehensive lifestyle intervention induces reductions in HDL-C and the emergence of a dyslipidemic lipid profile. Aerobic exercise only partially mitigates this effect.

### Implications of recent clinical trials for the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III guidelines [^1158JvLe]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) of the National Cholesterol Education Program issued an evidence-based set of guidelines on cholesterol management in 2001. Since the publication of ATP III, 5 major clinical trials of statin therapy with clinical end points have been published. These trials addressed issues that were not examined in previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The present document reviews the results of these recent trials and assesses their implications for cholesterol management. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain an essential modality in clinical management. The trials confirm the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy in high-risk patients and support the ATP III treatment goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 100 mg/dL. They support the inclusion of patients with diabetes in the high-risk category and confirm the benefits of LDL-lowering therapy in these patients. They further confirm that older persons benefit from therapeutic lowering of LDL-C. The major recommendations for modifications to footnote the ATP III treatment algorithm are the following. In high-risk persons, the recommended LDL-C goal is < 100 mg/dL, but when risk is very high, an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is a therapeutic option, ie, a reasonable clinical strategy, on the basis of available clinical trial evidence. This therapeutic option extends also to patients at very high risk who have a baseline LDL-C < 100 mg/dL. Moreover, when a high-risk patient has high triglycerides or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), consideration can be given to combining a fibrate or nicotinic acid with an LDL-lowering drug. For moderately high-risk persons (2+ risk factors and 10-year risk 10% to 20%), the recommended LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL, but an LDL-C goal < 100 mg/dL is a therapeutic option on the basis of recent trial evidence. The latter option extends also to moderately high-risk persons with a baseline LDL-C of 100 to 129 mg/dL. When LDL-lowering drug therapy is employed in high-risk or moderately high-risk persons, it is advised that intensity of therapy be sufficient to achieve at least a 30% to 40% reduction in LDL-C levels. Moreover, any person at high risk or moderately high risk who has lifestyle-related risk factors (eg, obesity, physical inactivity, elevated triglycerides, low HDL-C, or metabolic syndrome) is a candidate for TLC to modify these risk factors regardless of LDL-C level. Finally, for people in lower-risk categories, recent clinical trials do not modify the goals and cutpoints of therapy.

### Moderate-and high-intensity exercise improves lipoprotein profile and cholesterol efflux capacity in healthy young men [^1161jgWC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Cholesterol efflux was positively correlated with apoA‐I and HDL‐C at baseline (both P < 0.01), and after moderate (both P < 0.01) and high‐intensity exercise (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively) (Figure S2A and S2B). It was not correlated with apoA‐II at any point (not shown). Cholesterol efflux was positively correlated with pre‐β HDL at baseline (P < 0.05) and after moderate‐intensity exercise (P < 0.01) (Figure S2C). ApoB, LDL‐C, fitness level, and percentage of body fat did not correlate with cholesterol efflux at baseline or after either exercise intervention (Figure S2D through S2G).

The change in cholesterol efflux capacity in response to exercise was assessed to see if it was associated with change in fitness, body fat percentage, and key lipid and metabolic parameters (Figure 2). The change in cholesterol efflux capacity after moderate‐intensity exercise was positively associated with the change in apoA‐I, HDL‐C, pre‐β HDL, apoB, LDL‐C, and TC (all P < 0.01 except LDL‐C P < 0.05) levels (Figure 2A through 2F). This association remained significant only for apoA‐1 and TC (both P < 0.05) at the end of the high‐intensity exercise intervention. Change in cholesterol efflux capacity was positively associated with change in triglycerides (P < 0.05), insulin resistance (P < 0.01), and fitness (P < 0.05) after sequential moderate‐ and high‐intensity exercise but not after the moderate‐intensity exercise program. Cholesterol efflux capacity was not significantly correlated with percentage of body fat or glucose level.

### Exercise training protects the LDL I subfraction from oxidation susceptibility in an aged human population [^111wQBrV]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Exercise training is considered an effective strategy to improve metabolic disease. Despite this, less is known regarding exercise training in the prevention and susceptibility of LDL subfraction oxidation, particularly in an aged population.

Methods

Eleven aged (55 ± 4 yrs) and twelve young (21 ± 2 yrs) participants were randomly separated into an experimental or control group as follows: young exercise (n = 6); young control (n = 6); aged exercise (n = 6) and aged control (n = 5). The participants assigned to the exercise groups performed 12 weeks of moderate intensity (55–65% VO2max) exercise training. Venous blood was extracted at baseline, and 48 h following 12 weeks of exercise and assayed for a range of metabolites associated with lipid composition and lipoprotein susceptibility to oxidation.

Results

Although there was no difference in the oxidation potential (time ½ max) of LDL I, II or III between groups at baseline (p > 0.05), there was an increase in time ½ max for LDL I following exercise within the aged exercise group (p < 0.05). Moreover, α-tocopherol concentration was selectively lower in the aged exercise group, compared to the young exercise at baseline. The lipid composition of LDL I, LDL II, LDL III, VLDL, HDL2, HDL3 and serum lipid hydroperoxides remained unchanged as a function of exercise training and ageing (p > 0.05).

Conclusion

The primary finding of this study demonstrates that adaptations in LDL resistance to oxidation occur following 12 weeks of exercise training in the aged, and this may be of clinical significance, as oxidation of LDL has been implicated in atherosclerosis.

### Comparing the benefits of diet and exercise in the treatment of dyslipidemia [^115tM3ie]. Preventive Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Lifestyle changes are advocated as a first line of treatment for dyslipidemia. However, few studies have directly compared various combinations of diets and exercise.

Methods

In a randomized controlled pilot study, we compared the standard lifestyle recommendations (NCEP step I diet with regular exercise) and more intense interventions including the NCEP step I diet with a supervised aerobic exercise program and the step II diet with and without a supervised aerobic exercise program. We measured risk factors, dietary intake, time on treadmill, and health-related quality of life at baseline and after 3 months.

Results

Out of 198 eligible subjects, 47 (24%) were willing to participate and 41 completed the study. No significant change were observed with standard lifestyle recommendations. In contrast, participants in the more intense interventions lost weight (-1.7 to -3.7 kg) and reduced their total cholesterol (-4% to -6%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-6%), and systolic blood pressure (-7.3 to -8.8 mmHg). Participants in the exercise program significantly increased their exercise capacity (1.6 to 1.9 METS). Overall, each 10% reduction in body weight was associated with a 7.6% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Conclusion

Standard lifestyle recommendations had little effect on blood lipid levels but more intense lifestyle interventions may be effective at improving blood lipids, other risk factors, and quality of life.

### Oxidative and nitrative changes seen in lipoproteins following exercise [^11624acy]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

Oxidative damage to lipoproteins, in particular low density lipoprotein (LDL), is known to play a role in a number of diseases associated with ageing such as cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, arthritis, dementia and the metabolic syndrome. Physical activity or exercise can alter the balance of oxidative and anti-oxidative species within the human body. A number of studies have assessed the effect of exercise training or a single exercise bout on plasma lipid oxidation or nitration, protein oxidation and circulating lipoprotein oxidation, but results are extremely mixed and the message arising from current literature in regard to exercise and its effect upon the oxidative status of lipoproteins is somewhat confusing. This review aims to summarise the studies investigating the effect of exercise on lipoprotein oxidation and nitration, and highlight areas in need of future research.

### The importance of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol measurement and control as performance measures: a joint clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^112f9wF2]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction and ASCVD event risk — the primary endpoint incidence showed a stepwise pattern with 11.2, 9.2, 6.7, and 4.8 per 1000 person-years across placebo, no LDL-C reduction, LDL-C reduction of < 50%, and LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50%, respectively, and high-intensity statin prescription does not guarantee a robust lipid-lowering response or preclude the need to measure the response to ensure ongoing efficacy.

### Paradox of hypercholesterolaemia in highly trained, keto-adapted athletes [^1172M84j]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ketogenic diets are effective in the management of obesity, metabolic syndromeand type 2 diabetes. Athletes, especially those in the ultra-endurance community, have increasingly embraced lower carbohydrate/higher fat eating patterns. Whereas carbohydrate restriction and nutritional ketosis consistently improve dyslipidaemia (high triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and predominance of small low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles), the effects on total and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) are less predictable. Based on our prior ketogenic diet intervention studies in both sedentary and recreationally active men and women with a wide range of adiposity and insulin resistance, serum LDL-C responses varied widely in magnitude and direction, with the mean response often not significantly different from baseline.

Regular aerobic exercise consistently increases HDL-C, specifically the larger HDL2-C fraction, with more robust effects observed with higher levels of training. Aerobic exercise also decreases LDL-C, smaller LDL particles and triglycerides, but the effects are variable and are more consistent with higher volumes of exercise. Studies in ultra-endurance athletes indicate they have significantly lower total and LDL-C, and higher HDL-C concentrations, compared with sedentary individuals.

Knowledge of how ketogenic diets interact with high levels of exercise training to impact cholesterol/lipoprotein profiles is limited. Elite cyclists fed a 4-week eucaloric ketogenic diet during training increased total cholesterol from 156 mg/dL to 208 mg/dL. It remains unclear if serum cholesterol would have continued to rise if the ketogenic diet was extended. Male monozygotic twins with vastly disparate habitual levels of physical activity who consumed both a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet and a moderate-fat/moderate-carbohydrate diet for 6 weeks showed the expected decrease in HDL-C and size of LDL particles with high-carbohydrate intake, with a high degree of concordance within twin pairs. This result suggests that extreme differences in exercise have little impact on serum lipoprotein responses to diets varying in carbohydrate and fat.

To study whether chronic high levels of exercise training would be associated with attenuation or accentuation of the 'normal' cholesterol and lipoprotein responses associated with a ketogenic diet, we measured fasting serum cholesterol and lipoprotein profiles in ultra-endurance athletes who had been habitually consuming a very low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet for > 6 months compared with a matched group of athletes consuming a high-carbohydrate diet.

### Effects of 1 year of exercise training versus combined exercise training and weight loss on body composition, low-grade inflammation and lipids in overweight patients with coronary artery disease: a randomized trial [^114HW1Yc]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Lipids and density profiling

After 1 year a significant decrease in chemically determined total cholesterol, non-HDL-C and triglycerides was observed in both groups while LDL-C and HDL-C remained unchanged. A decrease in total cholesterol/HDL-C-ratio was only seen after LED + AIT. Density profiling was used to provide additional information on lipoprotein particle density and subclass distribution. The main finding was a shift in HDL subclass distribution and increased HDL particle size in the LED + AIT group while no changes were seen following AIT alone. The limited effect seen following exercise differs from outcomes from a recent meta-analysis comprising six trials, with a total of 1555 participants without CAD and 10 different exercise interventions. That analysis found that exercise resulted in a shift toward larger LDL and HDL particles. The total amount of exercise in our trial was possibly insufficient to achieve similar effects on particle size. Overall, the exercise interventions in the meta-analysis lasted 20–35 weeks, the intensities were generally lower than in the current trial while the weekly amount of time spent exercising was higher. Additionally, some methodological differences may occur, since particle size in the meta-analyses was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, while it was calculated from density distributions in the current trial. In the STRRIDE study, participants who underwent 8 months' high-amount of high-intensity exercise training obtained a shift toward larger HDL and LDL particles while the effects of a low amount of high-intensity exercise were less pronounced. Two previous studies comparing weight loss induced by either exercise or diet also found varying effects on LDL and HDL levels and particle size. As in the current trial, the populations in those studies were small (15–47 participants in each group) and some of the discrepancies could be related to sample size. In the present trial all participants exhibited a preponderance of small dense LDL particles, the so called LDL pattern B throughout the study. The inability to maintain the improvements in LDL distribution and particle size obtained after LED could be due to return to neutral or even positive energy balance. Furthermore, the participants in LED + AIT group stabilised their BMI at ~ 30 kg/m². An interventional trial including 100 participants showed that BMI < 25 kg/m² was required to convert LDL pattern B to LDL pattern A suggesting that the weight loss in the present trial may not have been sufficient. Finally, participants in the present study were contemporarily treated with statins. Since statins have been shown to decrease LDL levels and increase HDL and LDL particle size this could attenuate the effect of the intervention compared with a healthy, statin naïve population.

### Effect of short and long moderate-intensity exercises in modifying cardiometabolic markers in sedentary Kenyans aged 50 years and above [^111Zih4a]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Males and females in both exercise regimes had an increase in HDL. This finding is consistent with other studies that show exercise affects HDL. Specifically, males and females in short-bout exercise regime whose baseline HDL was < 0.9 mmol/L (18.5% and 7.7%, respectively) decreased to 0. In the F L group, those with HDL < 0.9 mmol/L, also decreased from 15.4% to 3.8%, and there was no change in the M L group. What our study adds and that could be a beneficial interventional approach is that the short sessions appeared more beneficial in improving HDL levels when compared with the traditional regimes. For LDL and TG, the change was marginal. Males and females on long-bout exercise regime had slight rise in both LDL and TG, but there was slight improvement in the short-bout exercise participants.

### Diet, exercise or diet with exercise: comparing the effectiveness of treatment options for weight-loss and changes in fitness for adults (18–65 years old) who are overfat, or obese; systematic review and meta-analysis [^115kLwMn]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

*Indicates significantly greater response than diet-only intervention, $ Indicates difference between modes of endurance exercise intervention, # indicates difference between intensity used for resistance exercise intervention, ¢ indicates difference in gender response (male > female), ¢* indicates difference in gender response (female > male), for χ²-value > χ² CV, p < 0.05.

In comparison of blood lipid profiles, e.g. total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and triglycerides (TG), all treatment options once again provided an effective means for change relative to either the pre-intervention status or in comparison to the control conditon. The responses invoked by RT, whether alone or in combination with diet, showed a greater effectiveness for eliciting changes in TC and LDL relative to the diet only options (χ² = 7.18, 4.95, respectively) and trends toward significance for HDL (χ² = 3.38, p = 0.068). But showed no difference to the responses invoked by ET, either with or without the combination of diet. While the use of ET either alone, or in combination with diet, show no difference for effectiveness at eliciting changes blood lipids (TC, LDL and TG) versus the changes elicited by a diet only intervention. Yet trended toward favoring ET for effectiveness in changes seen in HDL (χ² = 2.842, p = 0.089). Additionally, there were no differences noted on the pooled effect for treatment based on the gender of the participant groups for any of the treatment intervention options. However there was a trend for women utilizing ET in combination with diet for having a great effect in the changes in HDL levels versus those seen in men (χ² = 2.0, p = 0.12).

Mild exercise training does not improve lipoprotein profile in men with obesity

To investigate the effects on lipoprotein metabolism in humans, nine men with obesity followed a mild exercise protocol for 12 weeks. We performed NMR spectroscopy on plasma samples collected before and after the 12‐week exercise training regime to measure their plasma lipoprotein profile. Mild exercise training did not affect the concentration and composition of the main lipoprotein fractions VLDL, intermediate‐density lipoproteins, LDL, and HDL (Figures 7A‐7C) or their subfractions (Supporting Information Figures S2A‐S2C) despite a mild but significant reduction of body fat from 29.8% (3.0%) to 28.7% (3.0%) (−1.1%; P = 0.0021).

### Moderate-and high-intensity exercise improves lipoprotein profile and cholesterol efflux capacity in healthy young men [^112nuHGq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The relationship between change in fitness level and the change in apoA‐I, apoA‐II, HDL‐C, apoB, LDL‐C, TC, cholesterol efflux, and percentage body fat was also assessed (Figure S5). There was no association between change in fitness and change in apoA‐I or HDL‐C after the moderate‐ or high‐intensity exercise program; change in fitness level was, however, negatively associated with change in apoA‐II levels after the moderate‐ (P < 0.01) and sequential high‐intensity exercise program (P < 0.05) (Figure S5A through S5C). There was a negative association between change in fitness and change in apoB (P < 0.01), LDL‐C (P < 0.01), TC (P < 0.05), and percentage of body fat (P < 0.001) after the moderate‐intensity exercise program (Figure S5D through S5G). Only the association with change in percentage of body fat persisted after the high‐intensity exercise program (P < 0.01). Change in fitness level was, by contrast, significantly associated with change in cholesterol efflux capacity after the combined moderate‐ and high‐intensity exercise program (P < 0.05) but not after the moderate‐intensity program (Figure S5 H).

The guideline notes that the Physical Activity Guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic exercise per week, and studies demonstrated an association between recommended physical activity levels and a reduction in CV mortality by 21–91% and all-cause mortality by 19–70%. Observational data indicate associations between regular physical activity and the main components of lipids, including reductions in TC and LDL and increases in HDL. These associations were found in both primary and secondary prevention populations.

### Improvement of the lipid profile with exercise in obese children: a systematic review [^113vaTLH]. Preventive Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of different physical exercise interventions on the lipid profile (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG)) of obese children.

Method

A computerized search was made of seven databases using keywords. Effect sizes (ES) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and the heterogeneity (I(2)) of the studies was estimated using Cochran's Q-statistic applied to the effect size means. The studies were grouped according to the intervention program-aerobic alone or combined (aerobic fitness, strength, and flexibility).

Results

Seven studies were selected for review as satisfying the inclusion criteria. Six were randomized controlled trials (n = 318) and one was a controlled clinical trial (groups not randomly assigned) (n = 38). The main cumulative evidence indicates that the programs based on aerobic exercise alone have a moderate (ES = -0.49; I² = 87) and a large effect (ES = -0.55; I² = 77) on LDL-C and TG concentrations, respectively; and the programs based on combined exercise have a moderate effect (ES = 0.50; I² = 0) on HDL-C concentration.

Conclusions

The programs based on aerobic exercise (60 min, 3 times/week, ≤ 75% maximum heart rate) improve the LDL-C and TG concentrations. Moreover, the programs based on combined exercise (≥ 60 min, > 75% maximum heart rate) also improve the HDL-C concentration.

Results

Moderate‐Intensity Exercise Program

Effects of Moderate‐Intensity Exercise on Anthropometry and Fitness in all Participants

Of the enrolled 140 participants, 115 completed the recruit course and were included in the analysis.

Baseline fitness was high as all participants were required to pass the Army entry fitness test before inclusion in the study. Nevertheless, the moderate‐intensity exercise program significantly improved fitness as well as decreased BMI and percentage of body fat (all P < 0.001) (Table 1). Diastolic blood pressure and heart rate decreased after the moderate‐intensity exercise program (both P < 0.01); however, systolic blood pressure was unchanged.

Effects of Moderate‐Intensity Exercise on Plasma Lipid and Apolipoprotein Levels, Glucose Metabolism, and Inflammation in All Participants

Moderate‐intensity exercise increased HDL‐C and apoA‐I levels by 6.6% and 11.6% (respectively) and decreased LDL‐C, apoB, and apoA‐II levels by 7.2%, 4.9%, and 11.1% respectively (Table 1, P < 0.001 for all except apoB P < 0.01). Moderate‐intensity exercise had no effect on TC levels but increased plasma triglyceride levels (P < 0.001). Fasting blood glucose levels (P < 0.001), insulin levels (P < 0.001), HOMA‐IR (P < 0.001), and hsCRP (P < 0.01) were all increased by moderate‐intensity exercise. Results remained significant after adjustment for age, BMI, body fat percentage, fitness, and HDL‐C.

Moderate‐ and High‐Intensity Exercise Program

The following results apply to the subgroup of 51 participants who commenced the high‐intensity exercise program immediately after completing the moderate‐intensity exercise program.

### Exercise / physical activity in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a consensus statement from the American College of Sports Medicine [^115WaUFD]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease risk reduction in adults with T2D using intensive lifestyle (ILS) interventions — Most ILS trials with weight reduction as a goal have resulted in < 5% weight loss and a few beneficial metabolic outcomes, whereas weight loss of > 5% seems to be necessary for beneficial effects on A1C, blood lipids, and blood pressure in most individuals. In the Look AHEAD trial, ILS participants with T2D lowered triglycerides and increased HDL-C levels. During the first year of the trial, ILS participants experienced greater reductions in A1C, initial improvements in fitness, and attenuation of all cardiovascular risk factors except for LDL-C levels. ILS did not reduce a composite cardiovascular outcome over 9.6 yr despite greater sustained weight loss, but participants had fewer hospitalizations, medications, and health care costs over 10 yr.

### Paradox of hypercholesterolaemia in highly trained, keto-adapted athletes [^113G8gfU]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Ketogenic diets in normal-weight and overweight non-athletes result in a moderate increase in total, LDL-C and HDL-C concentrations relative to low-fat diets. The observation that highly trained, ultra-endurance athletes consuming a very low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet exhibited a more dramatic and uniform hypercholesterolaemia is counterintuitive since high-volume exercise tends to lower total and LDL-C levels. The explanation for this paradox may involve high intake of cholesterol and saturated fat combined with high-energy demands for lipid metabolism characteristic of the keto-adapted phenotype. LC athletes who adopt a ketogenic diet may experience an expansion of their endogenous cholesterol pool during the adaptation phase of the diet, after which they maintain greater circulating cholesterol levels.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^113ZGZv5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Exercise and triglycerides (TG) — training effects include that circulating TG levels frequently decline with exercise training to a degree that depends on baseline value, exercise energy expenditure, and timing of post-exercise measurement. In intervention trials, fasting TG have been lowered by 4 to 37% (approximate median reduction of 24%), and TG generally decline immediately after a session of high-volume endurance exercise and remain lower for up to 48 hours. The magnitude of TG decreases after a single exercise session before and after training is similar, i.e., 15 to 50%. Because benefits are transient without repeated bouts, exercise should be performed on a regular and uninterrupted basis to maintain a lower TG concentration, and changes in TG are highly correlated with changes in VLDL-C concentration.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^1133U76Z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Physical activity — blood pressure and lipid effects in adults at metabolic risk indicate that in hypertension, the estimated effect is greater (∼8.3/ 5.2 mm Hg lower) with aerobic exercise. Effective BP-lowering programs were of at least 12 weeks' duration, supporting three to four sessions of aerobic physical activity per week, lasting on average 40 minutes per session, and involving moderate- to vigorous-intensity activity. The 2018 NHLBI scientific report highlights that aerobic and dynamic resistance exercise may be equally effective in reducing BP at a lower volume of physical activity. Aerobic physical activity reduces LDL-C by an average of 2.5 to 6.0 mg/dL and non–HDL-C by an average of 6.0 mg/dL, while aerobic activity did not have a consistent effect on TGLs and HDL-C; resistance training reduces LDL-C, TGLs, and non–HDL-C by 6 to 9 mg/dL on average and reported no consistent effect on HDL-C.

### Impact of progressive resistance training on lipids and lipoproteins in adults: another look at a meta-analysis using prediction intervals [^112N9ziN]. Preventive Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Given recently developed prediction intervals (PIs) in which a random mean effect for a new study is estimated from meta-analytic data, we used the results from our previously published meta-analysis to calculate PIs for changes in lipids and lipoproteins as a result of progressive resistance training (PRT) in adults.

Methods

Twenty-nine studies representing 1329 men and women (676 exercise, 653 control) were included. The primary outcomes included total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C,) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG). Separate PIs (95%) were calculated for all lipids and lipoproteins.

Results

The expected outcomes of a new study on this topic were as follows: TC, -5.5 (-24.0, 13.0) mg/dl; HDL-C, 0.7 (-8.9, 10.4) mg/dl; TC/HDL-C, -0.5 (-1.8, 0.8); non-HDL-C, -8.7 (-35.7, 18.3) mg/dl; LDL-C, -6.1 (-28.9, 16.4) mg/dl; TG, -8.1 (-34.5, 18.3) mg/dl.

Conclusions

Caution may be warranted in recommending that PRT improves TC, HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG in adults. Future research should continue to examine the effects of PRT on lipids and lipoproteins in adults so as to determine optimal programs and populations in which PRT may have a positive effect.

Secondary outcomes

For HbA1c involving 30 studies comprising 4411 patients, motivational and goal setting (MD − 0.28%, 95% CrI − 0.46 to − 0.10%, SUCRA 78%) and multi-component (− 0.24%, − 0.47 to − 0.02%, SUCRA 67%) interventions were significantly better at reducing HbA1c levels compared to usual care (Additional File 4: Fig. S4). For total cholesterol involving 21 studies with 2683 patients, multi-component interventions (SMD − 0.23, 95% CrI − 0.43 to − 0.03) were also significantly better at reducing the total cholesterol level compared to usual care. None of the interventions significantly affected sedentary time, BMI, weight loss, SBP, DBP, HDL-C and LDL-C.

### HIIT is not superior to MICT in altering blood lipids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117SCnwW]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

High intensity interval training (HIIT) is a protocol of short work intervals < 60 s–8 minof vigorous (70%–90% MHR or RPE Borg scale 14–16)to high intensity (≥ 90% MHR or ≥ RPE Borg scale 17)interspersed with active (40%–70% MHR or RPE Borg scale 8–13)or passive (cessation of movement) recovery periods of 1–5 min.HIIT has been employed since the mid-20th century to improve athletic exercise performance. Contemporary protocols developed for non-athletes are intended to reduce session time and provide a greater stimulus for physiological and psychological adaptation compared with MICT.

HIIT has been shown to increase peak oxygen consumption (VO₂max or VO₂peak) compared with MICT in cardiovascular disease (CVD) populations, despite VO₂MAX being only one component of positive changes to cardiorespiratory fitness. Studies indicate that a positive impact on biomedical health indices is protocol dependent in clinicaland healthypopulations.

To encourage individuals to undertake aerobic physical activity, both HIITand MICTare promoted as enjoyable and effective, although no consensus exists as to which aerobic exercise protocol is more so. Studies have shown a minimum volume of weekly aerobic exercise for a minimum durationand a weekly aerobic exercise energy expenditure (EEE) threshold of 1200–2200 kcalis necessary to induce positive changes to lipids. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the effect of aerobic physical activity on lipid levels have established that longer intervention and session duration results in greater effects.

A systematic review comparing HIIT against MICT found no difference on blood lipids in healthy and clinical populations, but no meta-analysis was conducted. A pooled analysis comprising only three studies and consisting of CVD, MetS and overweight populations unsurprisingly showed equivocal effects on serum lipids. Other systematic reviewsand meta-analyseshave investigated the effect of exercise on lipids, but have not compared HIIT against MICT. Thus no previously published meta-analysis exists that has examined the effects of HIIT versus MICT on lipids in subclinical populations.

The aim of this study was therefore to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the effects of HIIT and MICT on TC, TRG, HDL-C, LDL-C and TC/HDL-C in subclinical populations and to examine whether one protocol surpassed the other.

### Age and menarcheal status do not influence metabolic response to aerobic training in overweight girls [^113wMkj8]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

It has been reported that moderate intensity of aerobic activities, two or more times a week, lasting at least six weeks, has positive effects in the metabolic profile in the paediatric population. The benefits of physical activity are more evident in obese children and adolescents with previous changes in metabolic profile, such as inadequate lipid profile. The characteristics of intensity, frequency and duration of exercise intervention used in the present study are in agreement with previous studies, to induce modifications in metabolic profile. We have found that total cholesterol and LDL-C levels remained unchanged after 12 weeks of physical training and nutritional guidance. There was a substantial decline in the triglyceride level, while HDL-C fasting levels substantially increased with exercise and nutritional guidance. However, such variables did not change in the control group during the 12 weeks (see Figure 2). In the present study, improvements in the lipid profile were observed, since HDL-C levels increased 17% (90% CL 11.9 to 22.3) and TG levels decreased 22% (90% CL 15.1 to 29.5), suggesting possible to likely benefits to metabolic health of adolescent obese girls. These results corroborate with similar interventions in which lipid profile in children and adolescents improves with exercise practice, mainly demonstrated by the increase in HDL-C and the reduction in TG. Observation of reduction in total cholesterol and LDL is not always consistent. Regular physical exercise may not reduce the levels of total cholesterol and LDL, but result in changes in size and density of LDL subfractions, increasing concentrations of larger LDL and decreasing concentrations of smaller LDL. Nevertheless, studies analysing subfractions of LDL concentrations in intervention programs in obese populations are sparse. A trend of reduction in LDL-C seems to be apparent when interventions focus mainly on food intervention.

### Nutrition and physical activity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^116Xs3FM]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement 2022 — Management of lipid changes with ketogenic diet notes that when weight reduction is achieved, increases in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and/or LDL particle number are generally modest, but rare cases of moderate to marked increases can occur and warrant confirmation and evaluation. Any unexpected or unexplained clinically meaningful lipid change should initially be addressed with repeat lipid testing; if confirmed, evaluate for secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia and recent medication changes that may worsen cholesterol levels. If weight loss via a ketogenic diet is likely causal, this may reflect increased intestinal cholesterol absorption, and in severe cases clinicians might consider evaluation for diet-sensitive genetic dyslipidemias.

### Low and moderate, rather than high intensity strength exercise induces benefit regarding plasma lipid profile [^114NN8qz]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

The factors modulating the lipid profile in chronic resistance exercise remain still unclear. However, although decreased body mass and body fat have also been associated with decreased total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and increased HDL-c, longitudinal studies employing chronic resistance training were not related with body fat and lipid profile changes.

Another possible mechanism modulating the HDL-c is the pathway of reverse cholesterol. This route removes cholesterol from the circulation and distributes it to the peripheral tissues and the liver. Basically this mechanism follow the principle that during acute and chronic aerobic exercise, lecithin activity cholesterol aciltransferase (L-CAT), the enzyme responsible for the cholesterol ester transfer to the HDL-c is increased, and plasmatic cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) activity is reduced (the enzyme responsible for the transfer of ester of HDL cholesterol to the other lipoproteins). In fact, this hypothesis, which is now accepted in endurance exercise training, can be applied in acute resistance training. Although Wallace et al. did not equalized the total exercise volume, they showed an increased in 27% in L-CAT activity in the high volume group 24 h after the exercise bout. Thus, it is possible to speculate that decreased concentrations of total cholesterol in the plasma might be attained through the exchange of cholesterol ester between tissues and lipoproteins to the HDL-c. However, the precise mechanisms by which low (50% 1-RM) and moderate (75% 1-RM) resistance exercise intensities modulate the concentration of HDL-c needs to be better examined.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^113UZSdP]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion — LDL-C management emphasizes that LDL-C is a well-established causal factor for the development of ASCVD that should be monitored in a timely manner and may be modified through both lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions. It reiterates, "for LDL-C: lower for longer is better". It also notes that measurement and management of LDL-C does not lessen the importance of attention to other lipid profile elements, including lipoprotein (a), triglycerides, very low-density lipoproteins, and other modifiable ASCVD risk factors.

### Moderate-and high-intensity exercise improves lipoprotein profile and cholesterol efflux capacity in healthy young men [^113soM34]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This is the first study to show that moderate‐intensity exercise is associated with enhanced HDL function and that this improvement is sustained after a sequential high‐intensity exercise intervention in a cohort of healthy young men where the exercise regimen and external variables were well controlled. It also demonstrates that exercise improves fitness and body composition and is associated with a less atherogenic lipoprotein profile. Most of these benefits were attained after a 12‐week moderate‐intensity exercise program, with the longer and higher intensity exercise program showing a sustained or incremental benefit. This study is important for understanding the mechanism(s) by which exercise reduces CVD risk and provides insights into the intensity and volume of exercise that brings about significant improvements in the cardiometabolic profiles of healthy young men.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^115Uzs9s]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

National Lipid Association guidance for adult low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management — atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the #1 cause of death in the United States, and LDL-C is described as a causal factor that should be monitored and may be modified through lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. The objective is to summarize numerous guidelines and recommendations from leading professional organizations to help clinicians and patients improve evidence-based measurement and management of LDL-C. Methods systematically reviewed guidelines and updates from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, National Lipid Association, and other organizations, and key recommendations were synthesized and translated into a simplified, patient-centered message for clinical application. The synthesis revealed consistent recommendations emphasizing early identification of risk, aggressive lipid lowering in high-risk populations, and shared decision-making to improve adherence; the resulting simplified message aligns with current evidence and is intended to support clinical teams in delivering consistent, guideline-directed care. The conclusion states that integrating major cardiovascular and lipid management guidelines into a unified, simplified message may improve provider clarity and patient understanding, supports team-based care, reduces variation in practice, and enhances implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

### Lipid profiles after changes in alcohol consumption among adults undergoing annual checkups [^115JSrRT]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Other lifestyle factors than alcohol, such as obesity, exercise, smoking, and dietary habits, may also affect cholesterol levels. Individuals who consume alcohol tend to be obese and have distinctive dietary patterns characterized by lower intake of carbohydrates and sweets and higher consumption of fish, a pattern that was observed in our study. While low-carbohydrate diets reduce body weight compared with low-fat diets, they have potential adverse effects on cholesterol, such as increasing LDL-C levels. The impact of lifestyle changes regarding alcohol consumption on lipid profiles needs to be considered within this complex interplay of factors. This study comprehensively adjusted for these lifestyle factors, including detailed dietary components assessed at prior visits. Additionally, its longitudinal design, which examined intrapersonal changes over time, accounts for variations in lifestyle among study participants. However, our analyses did not consider other lifestyle changes that concurrently occurred with alcohol intake changes, because these factors could serve as either confounders or mediators. For instance, if alcohol cessation is accompanied by dietary or lifestyle changes that improve the lipid profile, this study may underestimate the effect of alcohol cessation. Comprehensive lifestyle management would be crucial for cardiovascular risk reduction in clinical practice.

### Efficacy of aerobic exercise and a prudent diet for improving selected lipids and lipoproteins in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117Ce2aS]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Data abstraction

Prior to coding all studies, an electronic codebook was developed. The major categories that were coded included (1) study characteristics, (2) subject characteristics, (3) diet and exercise program characteristics and (4) changes in primary and secondary outcomes. All studies were coded by the first two authors, independent of each other. They then reviewed every item for accuracy and consistency. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. When consensus could not be reached, the other two authors served as arbitrators. Using Cohen's kappa statistic, the overall agreement rate (yes/no) prior to correcting discrepant items was 0.94.

The original study protocol included an examination of study quality using a previously developed instrument. However, since the time that the original study protocol was developed, the use of quality scales has been discouraged by the Cochrane Collaboration because of the lack of empirical evidence, including validity, to support the use of such. Therefore, the study protocol was revised in favor of the risk of bias assessment tool recently recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. This tool assesses bias across six domains: (1) sequence generation, (2) allocation concealment, (3) blinding to group assignment, (4) incomplete outcome data, (5) selective outcome reporting, and (6) other potential bias. Each domain is classified as having either a high, low, or unclear risk of bias. For this study, risk of bias was limited to the primary outcomes (TC, HDL-C, ratio of TC to HDL-C, non-HDL-C, LDL-C and TG). The decision rule for blinding was that all studies were at a low risk for bias given the methods that are used to assess lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in adults. Risk of bias was also assessed with respect to whether participants had been participating in a regular program of physical activity prior to enrollment. All assessments were conducted by the first two authors, independent of each other. Both authors then met and reviewed every item for agreement. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Using Cohen's kappa statistic, overall inter-rater agreement prior to correcting discrepant items was 0.72, considered to be substantial.

### Efficacy of aerobic exercise and a prudent diet for improving selected lipids and lipoproteins in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117Xi1te]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Calculation of treatment effects from each study

The primary outcomes included in this meta-analysis were concentrations of TC, HDL-C, ratio of TC to HDL-C, non-HDL-C, LDL-C and TG. Effect sizes for lipid and lipoprotein variables for each group from each study were calculated by subtracting the change score in the intervention (aerobic exercise and diet) group from the change score in the control group. Variances were calculated from the pooled standard deviations of change scores in the intervention and control groups. If change score standard deviations were not available, these were calculated from 95% confidence intervals or pre and post standard deviation values according to procedures developed by Follmann et al. Each effect size was then weighted by the inverse of its variance. The original metric (milligrams per deciliter) versus some type of standardized metric was used based on the belief that the former is more clinically meaningful.

Secondary outcomes (changes in body weight, body mass index (BMI) in kg/m², waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), maximum oxygen consumption (VO₂max mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹), intake of total kilocalories, carbohydrates, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol) were calculated using the same approach as those used for lipid and lipoprotein outcomes. Insufficient data were available for pooling non-HDL-C, percent body fat, lean body mass, waist circumference, fiber and trans-fat.

Total cholesterol

Six articles 28, 29, 35, 41, 44, 45 involving 408 patients were included to estimate the effect of TCEs on the amount of total cholesterol (TC). TC of the patients performing TCEs significantly improved (SMD −1.12, 95% CI −1.97 to −0.27, P = 0.01; I² = 93%, P < 0.00001) compared with that of the patients in the control group based on a random‐effects model (Figure 3 B and Table 3).

Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol

Four articles 28, 29, 44, 45 involving 324 patients compared the low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels between patients performing TCEs and those in the control group. In a random‐effects model, the LDL‐C of patients performing TCEs significantly decreased (SMD −0.81, 95% CI −1.24 to −0.38, P < 0.001; I² = 71%, P = 0.02) compared with that of the patients in the control group (Figure 3 C and Table 3).

### Resistance training changes LDL metabolism in normolipidemic subjects: a study with a nanoemulsion mimetic of LDL [^114V6EM7]. Atherosclerosis (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of resistance training (RT) on the metabolism of an LDL-like nanoemulsion and on lipid transfer to HDL, an important step of HDL metabolism.

Methods

LDL-like nanoemulsion plasma kinetics was studied in 15 healthy men under regular RT for 1–4 years (age = 25 ± 5 years, VO(2)peak = 50 ± 6 mL/kg/min) and in 15 healthy sedentary men (28 ± 7 years, VO(2)peak = 35 ± 9 mL/kg/min). LDL-like nanoemulsion labeled with (14)C-cholesteryl-ester and (3)H-free-cholesterol was injected intravenously, plasma samples were collected over 24-h to determine decay curves and fractional clearance rates (FCR). Lipid transfer to HDL was determined in vitro by incubating of plasma samples with nanoemulsions (lipid donors) labeled with radioactive free-cholesterol, cholesteryl-ester, triacylglycerols and phospholipids. HDL size, paraoxonase-1 activity and oxidized LDL levels were also determined.

Results

The two groups showed similar LDL and HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerols, but oxidized LDL was lower in RT (30 ± 9 vs. 61 ± 19 U/L, p = 0.0005). In RT, the nanoemulsion (14)C-cholesteryl-ester was removed twice as fast than in sedentary individuals (FCR: 0.068 ± 0.023 vs. 0.037 ± 0.028, p = 0.002), as well as (3)H-free-cholesterol (0.041 ± 0.025 vs. 0.022 ± 0.023, p = 0.04). While both nanoemulsion labels were removed at the same rate in sedentary individuals, RT (3)H-free-cholesterol was removed slower than (14)C-cholesteryl-ester (p = 0.005). HDL size, paraoxonase 1 and the transfer rates to HDL of the four lipids were the same in both groups.

Conclusions

RT accelerated the clearance of LDL-like nanoemulsion, which probably accounts for the oxidized LDL levels reduction in RT. RT also changed the balance of free and esterified cholesterol FCR's. However, RT had no effect on HDL metabolism related parameters.

### Effects of 1 year of exercise training versus combined exercise training and weight loss on body composition, low-grade inflammation and lipids in overweight patients with coronary artery disease: a randomized trial [^116mymbt]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Lipids and lipoprotein subgroups

The 12-week intervention caused a significant decrease in chemically determined total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio and triglycerides in both groups with no significant between-group differences. No changes were seen in HDL-C. After 1 year a significant decrease was seen in triglycerides, total and non-HDL-C cholesterol in both groups while LDL-C and HDL-C remained unchanged. A decrease in total cholesterol/HDL-C-ratio was only seen after LED + AIT. There was no difference between the intention to treat and per protocol analyses (Additional file 1: Tables S3 and S4).

Based on density profiling the 12-week intervention reduced AUC total lipoprotein and LDL in both groups while a shift toward a less atherogenic lipid profile was only seen after LED. Decreases in total lipoprotein, LDL and HDL AUC in both groups as well as reductions in small, dense LDL AUC following weight loss were not maintained after 1 year. Reduced triglyceride-rich lipoprotein persisted only in the LED + AIT group (Fig. 2 a, Additional file 1: Table S5). After 1 year LED + AIT but not AIT, showed increased HDL particle size and induced a shift in the HDL distribution to increase the proportion of large HDL subclasses, HDL 2a and HDL 2b (Fig. 2 b). Furthermore, the contribution of HDL to total lipoprotein AUC increased following LED + AIT (baseline: 56.4%, difference: 2.5% (0.7%; 4.3%) p = 0.005). However, no significant between-group differences were seen at 1 year. All participants had LDL pattern B (LDL particle size ≤ 25 Å) both before and after the intervention. At 1 year there was no difference between the intention to treat and per protocol analyses (Additional file 1: Table S6).

### Time trajectories in the transcriptomic response to exercise-a meta-analysis [^111xzHs3]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Performing regular exercise is one of the most important actions by which individuals of all ages can improve their health. It prevents multi-system chronic diseases, reduces anxiety, improves cognitive function, and overall quality of life. Recent studies applying mendelian randomization have also established the causal benefit of exercise in the prevention of depression, bipolar disorderand breast and colorectal cancer, while no effect was observed for Parkinson's diseaseor schizophrenia. Both acute effects and long-term adaptation have been studied in response to endurance (repeated contractions of low force) and resistance (fewer contractions of greater force) exercise in humans, where skeletal muscle and blood are the most accessible and well-studied tissues. Exercise-induced adaptation occurs in working skeletal muscles, however, multiple myokines are released from skeletal muscle into blood, with the potential to affect all organs. Resistance training specifically leads to skeletal muscle hypertrophy, while endurance training leads to increased capillary density, ATP-producing capacity and improves cardiorespiratory fitness. Both exercise modalities improve insulin sensitivity, decrease blood pressure, and improve the blood lipid profile by increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reducing low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels –. Several key transcriptional pathways in skeletal muscle are also common between the two exercise modalities.

### Dyslipidemia management in women of reproductive potential: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^114PXDnN]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Physical activity for dyslipidemia in women of reproductive years — evidence-based targets and pregnancy considerations — notes that for ASCVD prevention and overall health, it is recommended that adults accumulate at least 150 minutes/week of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, as well as resistance exercises two times/week. For dyslipidemia, recommended interventions include a minimum quantity of 150 min/week of moderate to higher intensity aerobic activity to decrease triglycerides (TG) and > 2000 kcal/week of energy expenditure (generally 200 to 300 min/week) of moderate or higher intensity activity to enhance the effects of lowering TG, as well as reduce LDL-C levels and excess adiposity, and European guidelines recommend participation in ≥ 30 min/day of moderate to vigorous physical activity. During pregnancy, physical activity can be safe for generally healthy women, and women with uncomplicated pregnancies should be encouraged to participate in aerobic and strength-training activities before, during, and after pregnancy, with a thorough clinical evaluation conducted before recommending an exercise program and monitoring during the progress of the pregnancy.

Children and adolescents — lifestyle modification for obesity-related lipid disorders: In children and adolescents with lipid disorders related to obesity, it is recommended to intensify lifestyle therapy, including moderate caloric restriction and regular aerobic physical activity, and supportive text specifies that therapy should include moderate caloric restriction and sufficient physical activity (eg, 30–60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity on most days); in children and adolescents with lipid abnormalities, lifestyle counseling is beneficial for lowering LDL-C.

Moderate‐Intensity Exercise Program

The 12‐week moderate‐intensity exercise program was part of the Army Recruit Course. It is a mixed strength and endurance program with ≈75% of the activities being combined strength and endurance activities (endurance activity with weighted load, ie, pack marching); ≈10% of the program could be classified as solely endurance focused (running sessions) and < 15% could be classified as predominantly strength focused (ie, weight‐based circuits). The average total physical activity time/wk was ≈9.3 hours, or 1.3 h/d. The average METs for each activity was 5.9, indicating moderate‐intensity. This is a graded exercise program with increasing intensity (ie, increasing intensity of circuits, progressive increase in distance traveled, progressive increase in weights/load carried and speed) as well as increasing volume (progressive increase in distance for load bearing and nonload bearing endurance activities). The majority of the activities were done within a group at the same pace and with the same load bearing.

The program culminated in a final moderate‐ to high‐intensity physical challenge that consisted of ≈6.7 hours of physical activity. The activity consisted of ≈160 minutes of moderate intensity and 240 minutes of high intensity with an average METS of 6.5.

### Effects of exercise, dietary cholesterol, and dietary fat on blood lipids… [^111Ynyau]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Exercise, a low fat diet, or a diet low in saturated fat content can each lower plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. We investigated whether these factors together could prevent the lipid-raising effects of dietary cholesterol. Ten healthy, athletic, normolipidemic male volunteers were studied. Two diets of 4 weeks duration each were compared in a randomized, blind crossover design. Diets were identical except for cholesterol content: one contained 600 mg/d; the other 200 mg/d. Both diets contained 15% of calories as protein, 55% as carbohydrate, 30% as fat, and the polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat ratio was 1.
5. Exercise level and body weight were kept constant in each subject. As compared with plasma values obtained following the 200-mg/d cholesterol diet, mean values following the 600-mg/d cholesterol diet significantly increased for LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B by 10% and 13%, respectively.

Mean plasma triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein 2 and 3, and apolipoprotein A-1 levels did not change significantly. Individual responses, however, were highly variable. Three subjects increased LDL cholesterol by more than 25%; 2 subjects increased LDL cholesterol by 10% to 25%; and 5 subjects had 5% or less change in LDL cholesterol. A dietary cholesterol increase can significantly elevate plasma LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B in certain normolipidemic, healthy men even when they are exercising regularly and consuming a moderately fat restricted, low saturated fat diet. Dietary cholesterol restriction may therefore be justifiable even when other life-style and dietary measures to minimize blood cholesterol are undertaken. Johnson C, Greenland P. Effects of Exercise, Dietary Cholesterol, and Dietary Fat on Blood Lipids. Arch Intern Med. 1990; 150: 137–141.

### Moderate exercise and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol… [^1118eA9p]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The effects of a 13-week moderate exercise program on fasting plasma insulin, lipids, and lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were studied in 32 sedentary, middle-aged men with coronary artery disease. The preponderant component of the exercise program was walking or slow jogging. There was no significant change in the systolic blood pressure and pulse rate product response to a standard exercise load. The high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level increased, and the fasting plasma insulin concentration decreased. There were no significant changes in plasma triglycerides or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In sedentary subjects with coronary artery disease, a modest increase in activity can result in an increase in the HDL-C level and a decrease in the plasma insulin concentration. These changes occurred in the absence of variations in diet, smoking habits, adiposity, or plasma triglyceride concentrations and did not require a cardiovascular training effect.

### Combined changes in diet… [^116Vq8Y2]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

The effects of exercise on serum lipid levels have been studied extensively. Published data have been subjected to meta-analysis, demonstrating that one positive effect of regular aerobic exercise is to raise HDL cholesterol levels by an average of 1. 9 to
2. 5 mg per dL. 29, 30 Other effects include decreases in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels by an average of 3. 9,
3. 9, and 7. 1 mg per dL, respectively. 29 The minimal amount of exercise needed to increase HDL cholesterol levels is 900 kcal of energy expenditure per week, or about 120 minutes of typical aerobic exercise. 32 There is a great deal of variability in HDL cholesterol responses to exercise, ranging in one study from decreases of 9. 3 percent in the least responsive quartile to increases of 18 percent in the most responsive quartile.

33 Improvements in HDL cholesterol levels seem to be related more to the amount of activity than to the intensity of exercise or improvement in fitness. 34 Physical inactivity has profound negative effects on lipid metabolism, including increases in LDL cholesterol levels, but this can be prevented by modest regular exercise.
35. Combined Changes in Diet and Exercise Because dietary approaches tend to lower total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, and exercise tends to raise HDL cholesterol levels and lower triglyceride levels, it seems logical to combine these approaches. Combinations of dietary interventions and exercise have been studied, and the resulting data have been critically reviewed. 36 The two reviewed approaches were exercise combined with a diet low in saturated fats, and exercise combined with nutritional supplements.

Exercise plus a low–saturated fat diet reduced LDL cholesterol levels by 7 to 15 percent and triglyceride levels by 4 to 18 percent, while increasing HDL cholesterol levels by 5 to 14 percent. Exercise plus nutritional supplements reduced LDL cholesterol levels by 8 to 30 percent and triglyceride levels by 12 to 39 percent, while increasing HDL cholesterol levels by 2 to 8 percent. Therefore, combining diet and exercise interventions seems additive, or at least synergistic. Effectiveness of Counseling Physicians have many challenges to address in encouraging lifestyle changes to improve blood lipid profiles and other cardiovascular risks in their patients.
