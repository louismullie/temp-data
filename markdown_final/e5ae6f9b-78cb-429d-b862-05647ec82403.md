## Question

cervical spine xray Mild hypertrophic changes at C5–6.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage "mild hypertrophic changes at C5–6" on a cervical spine X-ray, and what to do next clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what this radiographic finding means anatomically and how common it is. Then, I should verify whether it can explain symptoms like neck pain or radiculopathy and how reliable X-ray is for that purpose. Next, I need to check for red flags or signs of spinal cord involvement that would change urgency. After that, I should confirm the appropriate next imaging and why MRI is preferred in certain contexts. Finally, I will outline management pathways for different clinical scenarios, including when surgery might be indicated and how to monitor if we choose nonoperative care.

> Let me first confirm the terminology. "Mild hypertrophic changes at C5–6" on a plain cervical radiograph typically reflect early degenerative spondylosis: small osteophytes, facet or uncovertebral joint hypertrophy, and possibly mild disc space narrowing at the C5–6 level, which is among the most commonly affected cervical segments due to load and motion. Hold on, I should verify the prevalence data to avoid overcalling significance; indeed, degenerative changes are present in a majority of adults by later decades and increase steadily with age, with C5–6 and C6–7 most frequently involved, so this is often an incidental, age-related finding rather than a definitive cause of pain or neurologic symptoms [^111rvaMf] [^111g5Q46].

> Wait, let me verify how well X-ray correlates with symptoms before I jump to conclusions. I need to ensure I don't ascribe pain to these changes reflexively. Multiple studies and consensus statements show a weak association between cervical spondylosis on plain films and neck pain or radicular symptoms; asymptomatic individuals commonly have similar radiographic findings, and facet-related pain generators are not reliably predicted by radiography or even CT, which themselves can show abnormalities in people without pain. So, the mere presence of "mild hypertrophic changes" on X-ray does not establish causality for pain or radiculopathy; clinical correlation is essential [^114YbLmS] [^116GVwh3] [^112YffQa].

> I will now examine whether these changes threaten the spinal cord, because that would change urgency. "Mild" degenerative changes may still coexist with clinically important stenosis, and the X-ray cannot assess the degree of canal compromise or cord signal change; thus, I need to check for myelopathy features such as hand clumsiness, gait imbalance, hyperreflexia, or bowel/bladder disturbance. Hold on, I should verify guideline direction: if there are neurologic signs or persistent symptoms, MRI is the appropriate next imaging to evaluate cord compression and intramedullary signal, since it directly informs whether we are dealing with degenerative cervical myelopathy and its severity [^112bMHmB] [^114rZrBw].

> Next, I should review what to do with persistent axial neck pain or suspected radiculopathy without myelopathy. The ACR recommends MRI as the next imaging when chronic neck pain persists and degenerative changes are already seen on X-ray, particularly when we need to evaluate neural foramina, discs, or soft tissues; MRI better defines foraminal stenosis, disc herniation, and nerve root compression that could guide targeted therapy or interventions. Let me reconsider the role of CT: CT is useful when MRI is contraindicated or when fine bony detail is needed (for instance, to clarify osteophyte impingement), but for most nontraumatic radicular or persistent axial pain scenarios, MRI is preferred [^114rZrBw] [^112zDJ3q].

> Now, I need to outline management when there is no myelopathy. For isolated neck pain with only mild C5–6 spondylosis on X-ray, conservative care is first-line: analgesics, physical therapy, posture and ergonomic modification, and activity as tolerated, recognizing that most degenerative changes are not inherently painful and may be incidental. But wait, what if pain localizes to the facet and remains refractory? Diagnostic medial branch blocks can help identify facet-mediated pain in carefully selected patients, acknowledging that imaging alone cannot confirm a painful facet source; if blocks are positive, radiofrequency ablation may provide longer relief. I should double-check that I'm not implying surgery for axial pain here; surgery is generally not indicated for isolated axial neck pain without a clearly identified pain generator and failed exhaustive conservative care, and outcomes for surgery solely for neck pain are mixed and controversial [^114YbLmS] [^113ov2ev] [^117Jb2Co].

> Hold on, I should verify the radiculopathy pathway. For cervical radiculopathy without myelopathy, most patients improve with conservative therapy over weeks to months; if symptoms persist or deficits progress, epidural steroid injection or surgical decompression can be considered based on concordant imaging. Let me verify level prevalence to ensure I'm not missing a key localization point: C6 and C7 roots are most commonly affected, frequently at C5–6 and C6–7, aligning with this patient's level and supporting the need for MRI when radicular features are present or persistent [^116TbxQx] [^1144zgVv] [^112JjCVH] [^111pEere].

> If myelopathy is suspected or confirmed, I need to ensure timely escalation. Moderate-to-severe DCM warrants surgical decompression to halt progression, whereas mild myelopathy (mJOA 15–17) may be managed with structured rehabilitation and close surveillance or with early surgery in selected patients, balancing risks and preferences. I should confirm that evidence shows surgery can halt progression and improve quality of life even in mild cases, though decisions are individualized; importantly, prolonged delay risks irreversible deficits. Frequent monitoring is prudent in nonoperative strategies for mild DCM, with a low threshold to proceed if there is any decline [^114mGYrE] [^1161pkAJ] [^112TSoxC].

> But wait, what about prognosis and natural history nuances? I should double-check that I'm not overpromising stability. Class II evidence suggests some patients with mild-to-moderate CSM remain stable over a few years, yet 20–60% can deteriorate over longer follow-up, and longer symptom duration portends worse outcomes; thus, surveillance must be active and objective, ideally with mJOA tracking and interval MRI if deterioration is suspected. This reinforces the need for clear return precautions and scheduled follow-up in nonoperative care plans [^111AKCFs] [^112TSoxC].

> I need to ensure imaging choices are appropriate for follow-up and contingency planning. If MRI is contraindicated, CT myelography can delineate cord compression and foraminal disease; conversely, routine repeat plain radiographs add little once the diagnosis is established. Let me verify the ACR stance on post-degenerative-change X-rays: they do not recommend routine serial plain films for chronic neck pain management, emphasizing symptom-driven, problem-focused imaging instead [^notfound].

> Finally, I should synthesize the key takeaways. "Mild hypertrophic changes at C5–6" on X-ray are common, often incidental, and poorly predictive of pain; they neither confirm nor exclude radiculopathy or myelopathy. Next steps depend on symptoms: with neurologic signs or persistent radicular symptoms, obtain MRI to evaluate the cord and roots; with isolated neck pain, prioritize conservative care and consider facet interventions only after targeted diagnostics; with myelopathy, expedite MRI and refer for surgical evaluation because progression is unpredictable and early decompression can improve outcomes. I should double-check that each recommendation aligns with guidelines and evidence before concluding, which it does [^112bMHmB] [^114mGYrE].

A cervical spine X-ray showing mild hypertrophic changes at C5–6 reflects **early degenerative changes** — such as small osteophytes, facet hypertrophy, or mild disc space narrowing — and is common with aging. These changes are often **asymptomatic** but may cause neck pain or stiffness; if neurological symptoms are present, obtain MRI to assess for cord or nerve root compression [^115rtJ4w] [^112bMHmB]. Management is typically **conservative** (NSAIDs, physical therapy, posture correction) unless symptoms persist or progress, in which case advanced imaging and specialist referral are indicated [^117BSnWs].

## Radiographic features of mild hypertrophic changes at C5–6

Mild hypertrophic changes at C5–6 on a cervical spine X-ray typically include:

- **Osteophyte formation**: Small bony spurs at the C5–6 disc space margins or uncovertebral joints.

- **Facet joint hypertrophy**: Enlargement of the facet joints, contributing to foraminal narrowing.

- **Disc space narrowing**: Mild reduction in disc height due to degenerative disc disease.

- **Endplate sclerosis**: Subchondral bone thickening adjacent to the disc space.

These features reflect early **degenerative spondylosis** at C5–6, a common level due to its high mechanical load and range of motion [^111rvaMf].

---

## Clinical significance and symptoms

Mild hypertrophic changes at C5–6 are often **asymptomatic** and discovered incidentally; when symptomatic, they may cause:

- **Neck pain**: Localized or referred, often mechanical and activity-related.

- **Stiffness**: Reduced cervical range of motion, especially after inactivity.

- **Radiculopathy**: Rare with mild changes, but possible if foraminal narrowing compresses the C6 nerve root (C6 radiculopathy: shoulder, lateral arm, thumb/index finger pain/numbness, biceps weakness) [^notfound].

- **Myelopathy**: Uncommon with mild changes; consider if gait imbalance, hand clumsiness, or hyperreflexia are present [^115rtJ4w].

Symptom severity correlates poorly with radiographic severity; **imaging-clinical correlation is essential** [^112YffQa].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for mild hypertrophic changes at C5–6 includes:

| **Condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Degenerative disc disease | Age-related disc degeneration with osteophytes and disc height loss [^111rvaMf] |
| Facet arthropathy | Degeneration/hypertrophy of facet joints causing foraminal stenosis [^112JjCVH] |
| Cervical spondylosis | Generalized degenerative changes of cervical spine [^116QLLM1] |
| Cervical radiculopathy | Nerve root compression from foraminal stenosis or osteophytes [^112JjCVH] |
| Cervical myelopathy | Spinal cord compression from spondylotic changes [^1161pkAJ] |

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

For mild hypertrophic changes at C5–6, **routine advanced imaging is not indicated** unless neurological symptoms are present or symptoms persist despite conservative therapy:

- **MRI**: Preferred if radiculopathy or myelopathy is suspected, to assess cord/root compression, disc herniation, or soft-tissue changes [^112bMHmB].

- **CT**: Useful for detailed bony anatomy if MRI is contraindicated or to assess ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) [^1156VQ3e].

- **Flexion-extension X-rays**: Consider if instability is suspected [^1137S3Le].

---

## Management strategies

Management of mild hypertrophic changes at C5–6 is **primarily conservative**:

- **Conservative management**: NSAIDs, physical therapy, posture correction, ergonomic modifications, and lifestyle changes [^1144zgVv].

- **Patient education**: Activity modification, avoiding prolonged neck flexion, and ergonomic workplace adjustments.

- **Follow-up**: Regular clinical reassessment; MRI or specialist referral if symptoms persist or neurological deficits develop [^115rtJ4w].

Surgical intervention is rarely indicated for mild changes alone; consider only if significant neurological deficits or refractory symptoms persist despite conservative care [^1144zgVv].

---

## Prognosis and potential complications

The prognosis for mild hypertrophic changes at C5–6 is **generally favorable**; most patients remain stable or improve with conservative management. Potential complications include progression to significant foraminal stenosis or cord compression, though this is uncommon with mild changes [^116TbxQx].

---

Mild hypertrophic changes at C5–6 on cervical spine X-ray reflect early degenerative spondylosis and are often **asymptomatic**. Management is conservative unless neurological symptoms are present or symptoms persist, in which case MRI and specialist referral are indicated.

### Efficacy and safety of surgery for mild degenerative cervical myelopathy: results of the AOSpine north America and international prospective multicenter studies [^114mGYrE]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive degenerative spinal condition, and the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction among adults worldwide. This clinicopathological entity encompasses osteoarthritic degeneration (ie, cervical spondylosis) and ligamentous aberrations (eg, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum [HLF]). Over 70% of individuals over 60 to 65 yr old demonstrate pathological or radiological evidence of cervical degeneration, and approximately one-quarter of these people become clinically symptomatic from mechanical neural compression. The proportion of the United States population 65 yr or older is expected to nearly double from 13% in 2010 to 22% in 2050, making optimal diagnosis and treatment of DCM a key public health priority.

Controversy in the treatment of DCM has stemmed by and large from mixed reports regarding the natural history of this condition. Although there is some variability, a large number of patients, ranging from 20% to 60%, will deteriorate neurologically over time when treated nonoperatively. Traditionally, surgical decompression for DCM was performed to halt progression of neurological dysfunction and prevent further disability. However, more recent evidence indicates that surgical intervention for DCM is actually associated with improvement in function and quality of life. As a result, surgery is now becoming standard of care for patients with clearly symptomatic DCM. Nonetheless, controversy persists regarding the optimal management of patients with only mild symptomology. The latest clinical guidelines recommend surgery for patients with moderate and severe DCM, and nonoperative treatment with serial clinical follow-up for asymptomatic patients with imaging evidence of cervical spinal cord compression. For patients with mild DCM, the guidelines suggest that either surgery or a supervised trial of structured rehabilitation is reasonable initial management strategy; the less definitive nature of this suggestion likely reflects the paucity of clinical evidence surrounding the effectiveness of surgery for patients with mild DCM. These patients present a conundrum to the surgeon. On one hand, if the disease is only causing mild symptoms, the risk-benefit scale may tip in favor of risk, with a lot to be lost, and little to be gained. The contrary view is that these patients stand to gain the most from intervention by halting progression of potentially irreversible neurological deficits early on in the course of the pathological process. Moreover, even "mild" DCM may be associated with a derangement in quality of life that patients consider unacceptable, and can perhaps be helped with operative intervention. To this end, the objectives of the present study were 2-fold: (1) to evaluate quality of life in mild DCM compared to population norms and (2) to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients with mild DCM following surgical intervention. We hypothesized that (1) patients would have significant derangement in quality of life, despite having what is considered only "mild" DCM and (2) surgery in these patients would halt progression of symptoms, and in fact lead to improved functional status and quality of life.

### Radiographic cervical spine degenerative findings: a study on a large population from age 18 to 97 years [^111rvaMf]. European Spine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aims of this study were (1) to determine the prevalence of radiographic cervical disc degeneration in a large population of patients aged from 18 to 97 years; (2) to investigate individually the prevalence and distribution of height loss, osteophyte formation, endplate sclerosis and spondylolisthesis; and (3) to describe the patterns of cervical disc degeneration.

Methods

A retrospective study was performed. Standard lateral cervical spine radiographs in standing, neutral position of 1581 consecutive patients (723 males, 858 females) with an average age of 41.2 ± 18.2 years were evaluated. Cervical disc degeneration was graded from C2/C3 to C6/C7 based on a validated quantitative grading system. The prevalence and distribution of radiographic findings were evaluated and associations with age were investigated.

Results

53.9% of individuals had radiographic disc degeneration and the most affected level was C5/C6. The presence and severity of disc degeneration were found to be significantly associated with age both in male and female subjects. The most frequent and severe occurrences of height loss, osteophyte formation, and endplate sclerosis were at C5/C6, whereas spondylolisthesis was most observed at C4/C5. Age was significantly correlated with radiographic degenerative findings. Contiguous levels degeneration pattern was more likely found than skipped level degeneration. The number of degenerated levels was also associated with age.

Conclusions

The presence and severity of radiographic disc degeneration increased with aging in the cervical spine. Older age was associated with greater number of degenerated disc levels. Furthermore, the correlations between age and the degree of degenerative findings were stronger at C5/C6 and C6/C7 than at other cervical spinal levels.

Minimum Standard Institution Spine MR protocol for degenerative disease (noting some machine to machine variation): T2 3-plane localizers, Sagittal T1 FSE, Sagittal T2 frFSE, Sagittal FSE STIR, axial T1, axial T2.

Independent radiology trainees and attendings with subspecialty training in nuclear medicine evaluate NM bone SPECT/CT for foci of increased uptake relative to background uptake on both planar and fusion CT images. Foci of increased uptake are graded as mild, moderate, and severe, and only moderate and severe foci are considered possible pain generators. Mild uptake was considered barely perceptible over background osseous uptake. Moderate uptake was perceptible as a distinct focus over background uptake on multiple planes but did not reach the highest levels measurable by the SPECT/CT heat map. Severe uptake was identified as a distinct focus of uptake with some foci of the highest measurable heatmap data. Based on a combination of findings including the quality of the scan and amount of background uptake, the level of uptake intensity, the circumscribed/focal nature of uptake, and anatomic location, these are further labelled and reported as either definite, probable or possible pain generators. Cervical MRI was performed in all patients with standard protocols for detecting degenerative changes including spondylosis, facet hypertrophy, uncovertebral arthropathy, and degenerative disc disease. The presence of degenerative changes on MRI was compared with SPECT/CT findings to determine concordance between the imaging modalities. Patients who had increased uptake on SPECT/CT and abnormal findings at the corresponding level and anatomical structure on MRI were considered concordant. Findings were localized to spinal levels and specific anatomical structures such as facet joint, uncovertebral joint, disc. Radiologists were not blinded to clinical data when providing clinically relevant reports. Inter-rater reliability was not assessed. Patient exams interpreted by standard practices of 3 attending Nuclear Medicine physicians were included.

Data collection

Demographic data (age, sex, prior surgeries), clinical characteristics (pain history), and imaging findings were extracted from patient records. The study also recorded the presence of pre-existing cervical instrumentation and the level(s) of instrumentation. Each patient either underwent surgical or conservative management. Primary outcome measures (VAS and NDI) were assessed over an average follow-up period of 8 weeks in both the surgical and conservatively managed patient groups. A 30% reduction in NDI from the baseline represented the minimal clinically important difference (MCID).

### Role of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT / CT) in cervical spine surgery decision making [^115HKuPe]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 53 patients with cervical spinal pathology who underwent both SPECT/CT and MRI within 6 months of each other between 2021 and 2024 were identified. The average age was 62.1 years and 27 patients (50.9%) were male. The cohort included a mix of patients with degenerative cervical conditions, some of whom had prior spinal surgery. Among the 53 patients, 50 (94%) demonstrated foci of increased uptake graded as moderate or severe, suggesting potential areas of pain generation. Of these, 40 patients (75.5%) had corresponding evidence of degenerative changes (spondylosis, facet hypertrophy, uncovertebral arthropathy, and degenerative disc disease) at the same level and anatomical structure on MRI, reflecting concordant findings between the two imaging modalities. Patient demographic data and imaging findings are listed in Table 1. An example of concordance is a patient with SPECT/CT finding of markedly increased uptake at C3–4 facet joints and MRI finding of uncovertebral hypertrophy and facet arthropathy resulting in severe foraminal stenosis at the same level. An example of discordance is a patient with SPECT/CT finding of markedly increased activity involving the left anterior C2-C3 vertebral bodies with only mild stenosis from a central disc herniation at the same level.

Twenty-nine patients (54.7%) had pre-existing cervical instrumentation, and of these, 16 patients (55%) exhibited increased uptake at the level of the instrumentation, raising concern for possible pseudarthrosis. In contrast, 12 patients (41%) had areas of increased uptake identified at adjacent spinal levels, highlighting the potential for pathology beyond the instrumented segments such as proximal or distal junctional failure. Uptake occurred at anatomic structures at the level or adjacent to the level of existing surgical cervical hardware from prior posterior or anterior fusion. For example, a patient with prior C7-T1 ACDF had increased uptake at bilateral C7-T1 facet joints and increased uptake noted about the C7-T1 hardware.

Patient demographics and imaging findings

A subgroup of 20 patients underwent surgical intervention targeting the areas of increased uptake identified by SPECT/CT. The types of surgical procedures performed in the operative cohort is listed in Table 2. These patients had previously trialed and failed conservative measures including medication, physical therapy, and epidural steroid injections. Patient outcomes were assessed at 8 weeks following surgery.

### Management of mild degenerative cervical myelopathy and asymptomatic spinal cord compression: an international survey [^116GVSes]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations and future work

The survey was principally disseminated by two global spinal organisations; AO Spine and CSRS and it is noted that some groups may have been underrepresented. For example, Asia contributed 29% of responses, and Africa only 3%. Further the survey used a clinician's recollection of practice, making it vulnerable to recall bias. The overall large sample size, and the broad heterogeneity, with absence of trends event amongst subgroups, suggest this has not limited the findings.

The most pressing future work is to generate robust guidelines for non-operative patients.

This would benefit from a more detailed characterisation of DCM natural history, including the identification of any predictors of deterioration. Standardised patient follow-up is necessary to perform this analysis. A combination of clinician education and practical decision support tools may form first steps to ensure that this is conducted, using expect opinion to bridge known evidence gaps.

Introduction

There are few subjects in interventional pain and spine medicine as controversial as the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of neck pain. Neck and posterior head pain have a high prevalence rate in both developed and undeveloped regions, being particularly common in the USA, Western Europe, East Asia, Northern Africa, and the Middle East. A systematic review estimated the annual and lifetime prevalence rates to be 37.2% (range 16.7–75.1%), and 48.5% (range 14.2–71%), respectively. According to the Global Burden of Disease 2016 study, spine pain (including neck and low back) is the most common cause of disability in North America and globally for people 25–64 years of age. Age is positively related to the risk of neck pain, obesity is probably unrelated, and women are more likely to experience neck pain. When prevalence is broken down by spine joint or segment, the cited frequency of atlanto–axial (AA) joint pain ranges from as low as 16% to as high as 60% in patients with suspected cervicogenic headaches. Cervical facet (also known as zygapophysial or zygapophyseal) joints are considered to be the primary source of pain in 26–70% of patients with chronic neck painand 54–60% of neck pain following whiplash injury. The C2–3 and C5–6 joints are the most common clinically implicated levels in neck pain, with C2–3, C3–4, and C4–5 being the most radiologically affected. The wide disparity in reported prevalence raises questions regarding the use and accuracy of historical and physical exam signs as non-interventional diagnostic reference standards. The poor correlation between facet joint pathology on imaging and neck pain provokes further debateand disagreements with insurance payers. For diagnostic and/or prognostic criteria, the literature on the ideal patient response for designating a block as 'positive' and the optimal number of blocks that should be performed before cervical medial branch radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment is contentious and inconsistent, with no consensus emerging.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^1139dJPN]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Cervical and lumbar facet joint degeneration — morphology and prevalence in the elderly — show articular cartilage thinning, subchondral sclerosis, osteophyte formation, and hypertrophy, with high prevalence in individuals aged 50 years and more and specimens evaluated from 59 to 92 aged persons. Pathological changes attributed to facet joint degeneration were articular cartilage thinning, sclerosis of the subchondral bone, osteophyte formation, and hypertrophy; after evaluating cervical facet joints in the elderly, the prevalence of cervical facet joint degeneration was concluded to be probably very high in individuals aged 50 years and more, with severity tending to increase with age; all levels of the cervical spine were affected to almost the same degree, whereas in the lumbar spine degeneration increased towards the lower levels; cervical cartilage was often evenly degenerated over the joint surface while in the lumbar spine certain regions were affected predominantly; in this study, only specimens of facet joints from 59 to 92 aged persons were evaluated.

### Prevalence of and risk factors for modic change in patients with symptomatic cervical spondylosis: an observational study [^114AyAse]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

There are several limitations in our study. First, because of the low prevalence of MC in the cervical spine, the sample of patients was relatively small, limiting our ability to conclude which factors cause specific types of MC. Secondly, we did not take the size of the MC in MRI into consideration; thus, we cannot determine whether the size of MC affects the clinical symptoms of patients. Quantitative measurement of MC in further studies may provide more valuable information. Finally, this study analyzed only patients with neurological symptoms. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution in the general population.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^111g5Q46]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Cervical spondylosis — prevalence, age association, and affected levels are described, noting that in most symptomatic cases spondylosis is associated with aging and with compression of the spinal cord in patients older than 55. Degenerative changes of the cervical spine are seen in approximately 10% of individuals by age 25 and in 95% by age 65, and the levels most commonly affected by both disc herniation and chronic spondylosis are C6/C7 followed by C5/C6. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy refers to clinically evident spinal cord dysfunction with the presence of long-track signs due to compression of the spinal cord.

### Cervical disc degeneration and neck pain [^1115sJWp]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neck pain is a significant public health problem worldwide. Cervical intervertebral disc has long been considered a common source of neck pain.–Although it has always been there, there has been no clear definition of pain from the disc itself, and its diagnosis and treatment has been highly controversial. The main factors contributing to this ambiguity may be deficient of understanding of its pathogenesis and lack careful observation and thorough reflection on some clinical studies. In a review of the causes of neck pain, Evanswrote "Although possible, there is no strong evidence that intervertebral discs (through degenerative or other changes) are a source of pain (discogenic pain). This area remains controversial". A systematic review and guidelines from the Bone and Joint 2000–2010 task force on neck pain insisted that "there is no evidence (that was deemed scientifically admissible) demonstrating that disc degeneration is a risk factor for neck pain". So, what is the truth? Is the degenerative cervical disc a source of neck pain? Can existing basic and clinical studies give an accurate answer scientifically?

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^112zVXsi]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy — single-level versus multi-level surgical decompression long term results lack comparative evidence, as a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this comparison. After this review, most patients with true radiculopathy suffer from one level and occasionally two level disease, and the incidence of multilevel disease without the additional presence of myelopathy is rare, leading to the conclusion that there is likely little to gain and a low probability of generating meaningful data to answer this question. For research prioritization, the work group would not recommend further pursuit of this question.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy: a spectrum of related disorders affecting the aging spine [^111hyT1W]. Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Cervical spinal cord dysfunction can result from either traumatic or nontraumatic causes, including tumors, infections, and degenerative changes. In this article, we review the range of degenerative spinal disorders resulting in progressive cervical spinal cord compression and propose the adoption of a new term, degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). DCM comprises both osteoarthritic changes to the spine, including spondylosis, disk herniation, and facet arthropathy (collectively referred to as cervical spondylotic myelopathy), and ligamentous aberrations such as ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. This review summarizes current knowledge of the pathophysiology of DCM and describes the cascade of events that occur after compression of the spinal cord, including ischemia, destruction of the blood-spinal cord barrier, demyelination, and neuronal apoptosis. Important features of the diagnosis of DCM are discussed in detail, and relevant clinical and imaging findings are highlighted. Furthermore, this review outlines valuable assessment tools for evaluating functional status and quality of life in these patients and summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each. Other topics of this review include epidemiology, the prevalence of degenerative changes in the asymptomatic population, the natural history and rates of progression, risk factors of diagnosis (clinical, imaging and genetic), and management strategies.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^115kMZw6]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Spondylotic degeneration in the cervical spine may result in static and/or dynamic spinal cord compression that can lead to the associated signs and symptoms of myelopathy. Clinical examination combined with appropriate imaging studies help to confirm the diagnosis. Classic natural history and basic science studies suggest a pernicious course of demyelination and neurologic decline in a large subset of patients. The characterization of disease severity and progression in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy has improved in recent years with imaging and data from prospective and multicenter studies. Additionally, advances in surgical techniques, implants, and imaging modalities have improved the identification of surgical candidates with cervical spondylotic myelopathy and associated treatment strategies. Surgical treatment, via an anterior, posterior, or a combined approach, is primarily intended to arrest neurologic progression, although it can improve function in many patients. Alignment and the characteristics and location of spinal cord compression help determine the ideal surgical approach. Distinct complications associated with each technique may be mitigated by appropriate patient selection and should be discussed preoperatively to ensure informed decision making.

### Is neck pain a marker for something serious? Like myelopathy [^114GXQxX]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Degeneration of the intervertebral disk – as a cause of pain

The intervertebral discs in the cervical spine undergo age-related degeneration, leading to structural changes and clinical symptoms, such as cervical region pain exacerbated by movement. Aging reduces the water content in the nucleus pulposus, subsequent protrusion or extrusion can irritate local neural structures, serving as a potential neurological pain source in the cervical region. Progressive IVD changes lead to an unequal distribution of forces across the endplates, resulting in the remodelling of the adjacent vertebral bodies. These changes include increased anteroposterior length of the vertebrae, decreased intervertebral height, osteophytes, and bone spur formation. IVD degeneration can also have downstream consequences such as ligamentous changes, and cervical alignment adverse alterations including the development of kyphosis, scoliosis, hyperlordosis, or listhesis. All of these changes can individually or collectively be often associated with pain. It is important to note that not everyone with degenerative changes in the spine will experience pain. Some people may have degenerative changes on imaging without any accompanying symptoms. Additionally, pain can be influenced by various factors such as the extent of degeneration, overall health and lifestyle, cultural factors, and individual pain thresholds.

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a guide to diagnosis and management [^115rtJ4w]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a neurologic condition that develops insidiously over time as degenerative changes of the spine result in compression of the cord and nearby structures. It is the most common form of spinal cord injury in adults; yet, its diagnosis is often delayed. The purpose of this article is to review the pathophysiology, natural history, diagnosis, and management of CSM with a focus on the recommended timeline for physicians suspecting CSM to refer patients to a spine surgeon. Various processes underlie spondylotic changes of the canal and are separated into static and dynamic factors. Not all patients with evidence of cord compression will present with symptoms, and the progression of disease varies by patient. The hallmark symptoms of CSM include decreased hand dexterity and gait instability as well as sensory and motor dysfunction. magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging modality of choice in patients with suspected CSM, but computed tomography myelography may be used in patients with contraindications. Patients with mild CSM may be treated surgically or nonoperatively, whereas those with moderate-severe disease are treated operatively. Due to the long-term disability that may result from a delay in diagnosis and management, prompt referral to a spine surgeon is recommended for any patient suspected of having CSM. This review provides information and guidelines for practitioners to develop an actionable awareness of CSM.

Results

A total of 699 responses were received, comprising mostly orthopaedic surgeons (64.0%, n = 458) and neurosurgeons (33.2%, n = 238), along with a few responses from neurologists/AHPs/academics (2.8%, n = 20). The largest proportion of respondents worked in Asia (28.8%, n = 206), followed by Latin/South America (24.2%, n = 173), Europe (23.3%, n = 167), North America (16.8%, n = 120), Africa (2.7%, n = 19), the Middle East (2.4%, n = 17) and Oceania (2.0%, n = 14). A majority of respondents (50.14%, n = 359) had greater than 10 years of experience managing patients with DCM (Fig. 1).

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy-update and future directions [^1161pkAJ]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults worldwide. DCM encompasses various acquired (age-related) and congenital pathologies related to degeneration of the cervical spinal column, including hypertrophy and/or calcification of the ligaments, intervertebral discs and osseous tissues. These pathologies narrow the spinal canal, leading to chronic spinal cord compression and disability. Owing to the ageing population, rates of DCM are increasing. Expeditious diagnosis and treatment of DCM are needed to avoid permanent disability. Over the past 10 years, advances in basic science and in translational and clinical research have improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of DCM and helped delineate evidence-based practices for diagnosis and treatment. Surgical decompression is recommended for moderate and severe DCM; the best strategy for mild myelopathy remains unclear. Next-generation quantitative microstructural MRI and neurophysiological recordings promise to enable quantification of spinal cord tissue damage and help predict clinical outcomes. Here, we provide a comprehensive, evidence-based review of DCM, including its definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and non-operative and operative management. With this Review, we aim to equip physicians across broad disciplines with the knowledge necessary to make a timely diagnosis of DCM, recognize the clinical features that influence management and identify when urgent surgical intervention is warranted.

Clinical aspects of degenerative spine disease and reporting

The role of imaging is to provide accurate morphological information and influence therapeutic decision-making. The presence of degenerative change is not itself an indicator of symptoms. In the majority of cases, when patients with degenerative spine diseases are referred for imaging, clinicians are looking for answers to two simple questions: what is the cause of the patient's pain or neurological symptoms, and what treatment option should be primarily considered in this particular situation? Therefore, these imaging findings must be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical condition. In the majority of cases, even in advanced cases of degenerative spine disease with multilevel involvement, it is possible to identify one leading cause of the patient's problem or to provide a list of potential choices or culprits so that the referring physician can select the right answer based on the presentation, clinical symptoms and physical examination of the patient.

### Symptomatic progression of cervical myelopathy and the role of nonsurgical management: a consensus statement [^112TSoxC]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

This section of the cervical spondylotic myelopathy Spine focus issue collates the existing evidence related to natural history and nonoperative management. In the case of patients with symptomatic cervical spondylotic myelopathy treated nonoperatively, while 20% to 62% will deteriorate at 3 to 6 years of follow-up, no specific patient or disease characteristics have been shown to predict this change reliably. For patients without myelopathy with spondylotic cord compression, the rate of myelopathy development is approximately 8% at 1 year and approximately 23% at 4 years of follow-up. Clinical and/or electrophysiological evidence of cervical radiculopathy has been shown to predict such progression and should prompt strong consideration of surgical decompression. With respect to nonoperative care, in the case of mild myelopathy, there is low evidence that such treatment may have a role; for moderate and severe myelopathy, this treatment results in outcomes inferior to those of surgery and is not recommended. Given the unpredictably progressive nature of cervical myelopathy, the indications for nonoperative management are ostensibly limited. Finally, the preclinical rationale and clinical translation of a putative neuroprotective drug, which may one day serve to augment the effects of surgery in the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, is presented and discussed.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^116GVwh3]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

CT represents a more sensitive imaging modality for the assessment of cervical facet pathology and may yield abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals, with one study finding a 33% prevalence of cervical facet arthritis in patients who underwent CT scans for non-spinal pain Morishita et al performed a retrospective study in 215 patients with cervical spine degenerative disease. Although the authors reported a significant association between hypertrophic changes on CT studies and the presence of neck pain, the statistical analysis was flawed in that it failed to control for important covariates such as age and gender known to affect the prevalence of facet degenerative changes and neck pain. Similar cross-sectional studies with limited numbers of patients report a weak association, but the lack of statistical power in describing small cohorts of patients represents a serious limitation CT can demonstrate osteophytes and hyperostosis, but not changes in articular cartilage, which presents limitations in identifying painful facet joints The high prevalence of asymptomatic cervical facet osteoarthritis (33%) decreases the prognostic value of this imaging modality Given that CT evidence of cervical facet arthrosis is common among older patients with neck pain at the C2–6 levels, additional imaging techniques may need to be incorporated to differentiate the characteristics of painful cervical facet joints from those that are asymptomatic At present, the limited research that has examined the association of CT findings with cervical facet-mediated pain is inconclusive.

Study design

Cross-sectional survey.

Objective

Currently there is limited evidence and guidance on the management of mild degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) and asymptomatic spinal cord compression (ASCC).

Anecdotal evidence suggest variance in clinical practice. The objectives of this study were to assess current practice and to quantify the variability in clinical practice.

Methods

Spinal surgeons and some additional health professionals completed a web-based survey distributed by email to members of AO Spine and the Cervical Spine Research Society (CSRS) North American Society. Questions captured experience with DCM, frequency of DCM patient encounters, and standard of practice in the assessment of DCM. Further questions assessed the definition and management of mild DCM, and the management of ASCC.

Results

A total of 699 respondents, mostly surgeons, completed the survey. Every world region was represented in the responses. Half (50.1%, n = 359) had greater than 10 years of professional experience with DCM. For mild DCM, standardised follow-up for non-operative patients was reported by 488 respondents (69.5%). Follow-up included a heterogeneous mix of investigations, most often at 6-month intervals (32.9%, n = 158). There was some inconsistency regarding which clinical features would cause a surgeon to counsel a patient towards surgery. Practice for ASCC aligned closely with mild DCM. Finally, there were some contradictory definitions of mild DCM provided in the form of free text.

Conclusions

Professionals typically offer outpatient follow up for patients with mild DCM and/or asymptomatic ASCC. However, what this constitutes varies widely. Further research is needed to define best practice and support patient care.

### Spine injury [^117VWFMm]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

Awake symptomatic patient — imaging for cervical spine injury: When initial assessment is failed, plain films have a sensitivity ranging from 45 to 64 percent while modern helical cervical computed tomography (CT) scans have sensitivity as high as 100 percent, with CT sensitivity reported at 98.5 percent and 100 percent for cervical injury. After a negative CT with persistent neurological symptoms, study authors recommended that patients have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); abnormal MRI was reported in 27.6 percent with only 1.4 percent undergoing surgery, and in another series 20.6 percent had an abnormal MRI with 0.42 percent having a change in management, while a meta-analysis of 23 studies found 16 missed injuries in 5,286 patients by CT that were found on MRI. For adult blunt trauma patients who are neurological asymptomatic with a negative helical cervical CT, removal of a cervical collar is recommended; MRI is not required for removal, and at the treating physician's discretion it can be considered in patients with persistent neurological symptoms, concern for ligamentous damage, or high risk degenerative/pathological changes despite a negative CT scan.

AO and AA joint disease may be a source of both neck pain and headache. Accurate diagnosis and management of neck and head pain can be challenging. Pain may be referred from other cervical sources including cervical intervertebral discs, cervical facet joints, ligaments, fascia, and muscles. Detailed history and physical examination can be valuable to help distinguish the etiology of the pain and to target diagnostic and therapeutic injection targets.

Table 3
Comparison of the Smallest Oblique Sagittal Area of the Neural Foramen Between Two Groups of Patient (X ± SD, mm²)

Figure 4
A case of cervical 5/6 bony foraminal stenosis was observed. Preoperative X-rays and CT scans (A – E) revealed stenosis of the right intervertebral foramen at the C5/6 level, which was caused by hypertrophy of the uncinate process. Postoperative X-rays and CT scans (F – H) demonstrated incomplete removal of the right uncinate process, complete elimination of hypertrophic osteophytes, and a noticeable enlargement of the right neural foramen.

Safety Results

In the control decompression group, 2 patients (4.2%) had a dural tear, while none of the patients in the ultrasonic bone cutter group had a dural tear (p = 0.49). This risk reduction suggests the potential advantage of ultrasonic technology in dural protection, although it did not reach statistical significance in this smaller sample. Neither technique resulted in complications such as nerve root injury, spinal cord injury, wound infection, vertebral artery injury, or esophageal injury. One patient in the ultrasonic bone scalpel group experienced mild and transient hoarseness of voice, which resolved one-month post-surgery. No cases of recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis were observed. Additionally, there were no reports of neurological deficits or deterioration, graft loosening, or failure of internal fixation.

### Is neck pain treatable with surgery? [^117Jb2Co]. European Spine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neck pain is one of the most common complaints in clinical practice and can be caused by a wide variety of conditions. While cervical spine surgery is a well-accepted option for radicular pain and myelopathy, surgery for isolated neck pain is controversial. The identification of the source of pain is challenging and subtle, and misdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a thorough literature review to discuss and compare different causes of neck pain. We then supplemented the literature with our senior author's expert analysis of treating cervical spine pathology.

Conclusions

This study provides an in-depth discussion of neck pain and its various presentations, as well as providing insight into treatment strategies and diagnostic pearls that may prevent mistreatment of cervical spine pathology.

### Operative treatment of the patient with neck pain [^1144zgVv]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Most patients with axial neck pain and cervical radiculopathy can be managed conservatively. Surgical intervention for radiculopathy is considered only when conservative management has failed unless the neurologic deficits are very significant. In cases of myelopathy, surgery may be considered earlier, but if the myelopathy is mild, conservative treatment and close observation are still appropriate. For patients with axial neck pain, surgery is generally not considered except for rare cases caused by single- or two-level degenerative disk disease with severe and unrelenting pain. There are many surgical options for the patients with the degenerative cervical spine, but the indications are different. Surgical intervention involves a complete understanding of the disease process both from physical examination and from radiographic studies. If surgery is undertaken without appropriate clinical correlation, poor results often occur. Although the operative planning is the responsibility of the surgeon. the referring physician should also have some awareness of the basic principles behind the different surgeries.

### Clinical example… [^116QLLM1]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

4, 7 From a radiologic standpoint, a diagnosis of spondylosis could be made if osteophytes, disk space narrowing, or facet disease are present. Other imaging options included facet injections 8–10 and provocative tests using diskography. 11–14 More recent literature has focused on the use of magnetic resonance imaging, particularly in those with whiplash-associated disorders. 5, 6, 15–21 However, the ability of MRI to identify specific soft tissue changes in persons with whiplash-associated disorders is controversial. Physical examination was unremarkable, with the exception of a slight decrease in the left biceps reflex. Strength and sensory test results were normal. Initial lateral radiographs revealed narrowing of the C5-C6 disk space, and osteophytes protruding into the vertebral canal. Subsequent cervical computed tomography showed narrowing of the vertebral canal by the osteophytes.

6, 17–21, 27, 28 Krakenes and Kaale concluded that MRI can show structural changes in ligaments and membranes, and that there is a correlation between clinical impairment and morphologic findings. 21 On the other hand, Kongsted and colleagues found that trauma-related MRI findings are rare in patients with whiplash-associated disorders. Patients with normal radiographic findings and no neurologic signs or symptoms need no further imaging. Patients with normal radiographic findings and neurologic signs or symptoms should undergo MRI. 5, 15, 16 Patients with whiplash-associated disorders should undergo MRI to evaluate for disk herniations, spur encroachment of the vertebral canal, or ligament abnormalities of the lower cervical region. The value of MRI of the craniocervical junction in patients with whiplash-associated disorders is controversial. 6, 17–21 If MRI is contraindicated, CT myelography with multiplanar reconstruction is recommended. Patients with radiologic evidence of cervical spondylosis or a previous trauma without neurologic signs or symptoms need no further imaging. Patients with radiographic evidence of cervical spondylosis or previous trauma and neurologic signs and symptoms should undergo MRI. If MRI is contraindicated, CT myelography is recommended. Patients with radiographic evidence of bone or disk margin destruction should undergo MRI. If an epidural abscess is suspected, the examination should be performed with intravenous contrast media. CT is indicated only if MRI cannot be performed.

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: a systematic review [^112JjCVH]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cervical radiculopathy (CR) is a widespread diagnosis. Typically, CR is associated with symptoms of neck, shoulder, and upper limb pain as well as upper limb paraesthesia and weakness, which are attributed to cervical nerve root irritation. The clinical diagnosis of CR relies mainly on the outcome of history taking and a physical examination in which diminished muscle tendon reflexes, sensory disturbances, or motor weakness with dermatomal/myotomal distribution can be found.

Epidemiological data on CR are sparse. A population-based study indicated that CR had an annual incidence rate of 107.3 per 100,000 for men and 63.5 per 100,000 for women, while the age-specific annual incidence rate reached a peak of 202.9 for the age group 50–54 years. Another study reported a prevalence of 3.5 per 1,000 people and a peak annual incidence of 2.1 case per 1,000 people, which increased to a peak at age 50–59 years.

The aetiology in 70–75% of cases is a foraminal compression of the spinal nerve. This can be due to several factors, including reduction in disc height and anterior and posterior degenerative changes of the uncovertebral and zygapophyseal joints. The most common level of nerve root compression is C7, followed by C6; compression of roots C5 and C8 are less frequent. A herniated disc in the cervical spine accounts for only 20–25% of the cases of CR. CR as a direct result of cervical trauma or metastases is infrequent. Although CR is a common diagnosis, there is still no consensus on the definition. The differential diagnosis of CR can be extensive and includes many musculoskeletal or neurological conditions that may mimic the signs and symptoms of CR.

It has been suggested that CR is a diagnosis based on clinical impression, advanced testing, electrophysiology tests, or a combination of these tests. There are no generally accepted, well-defined clinical criteria for the diagnosis of CR. A clear definition of terms is required to establish definitive diagnostic criteria for evaluating the (cost)effectiveness of treatment of patients with CR. An unambiguous diagnostic classification of CR is necessary to be able to select a homogeneous patient population for daily practice and research. It will facilitate communication and help in identifying subgroups of patients differing from the overall population in prognosis or treatment benefit.

Therefore, this systematic review aims to assess the uniformity of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in intervention studies (with at least one conservative treatment group) to select patients with CR.

### Does age affect surgical outcomes in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy? Results from the prospective multicenter AOSpine international study on 479 patients [^112FqACS]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Subjects

Between October 2007 and January 2011, 479 patients with symptomatic DCM were prospectively enrolled in the AOSpine CSM-International study at 16 global institutions. Participating sites were either academic centres or high volume private practices and all had the resources necessary to conduct prospective clinical research, adequate subject availability and experienced research personnel. Investigators were orthopaedic surgeons or neurosurgeons who specialised in treating disorders of the spine.

Patients were asked to participate in this study if they were referred for surgical consultation and if they satisfied the following inclusion criteria: (1) aged 18 years or older; (2) presenting with symptomatic DCM with at least one clinical sign of myelopathy; (3) image-evidence of cervical spinal cord compression on MRI or CT; and (4) no previous cervical spine surgery. Patients were included in this study if they had myelopathy due to spondylosis, hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, OPLL, disc herniation, subluxation or a combination of these degenerative changes. Patients were excluded if they were asymptomatic or diagnosed with active infection, neoplastic disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or concomitant lumbar stenosis.

Surgical techniques

At their respective sites, all patients underwent surgical decompression of the cervical spinal cord. For each case, the attending surgeon decided what approach to use, the number of levels to decompress and whether or not to use fusion or instrumentation. Anterior surgeries included cervical discectomy and/or corpectomy with or without fusion. Patients treated posteriorly underwent either laminectomy with or without fusion or laminoplasty. A minority of patients was treated with a two-stage circumferential surgery.

Data collection

Extensive data were collected for each participating subject, including demographic information, disease causation, medical history and current comorbidities, symptomatology, surgical summary and level of impairment and disability. Each subject was neurologically examined at baseline and 24 months postoperatively and evaluated using a variety of functional and quality of life outcome measures, including the Neck Disability Index (NDI), SF-36, the Nurick and the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scales. In addition, each attending surgeon was required to record all adverse events throughout the study period. A central panel of investigators classified each event as related to surgery, related to myelopathy or unrelated. Perioperative complications were defined as surgery-related events occurring within 30 days of surgery.

### The relationship between the cervical spinal canal diameter and the pathological changes in the cervical spine [^116QSDDU]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Moreover, the transverse area of the cord measured using MRI has been reported to have a strong correlation with the severity of myelopathy, postsurgical recovery of patients with cervical compressive myelopathy, and the pathological changes in the cord. Additionally, Kuwazawa et al. demonstrated the dynamic effects of postural changes on the cervical cord using positional MRI.

The sagittal diameter of the spinal cord is nearly constant in adults averaging approximately 8 mm from C3 to C7. Therefore, patients with a congenitally narrow canal may be more susceptible to spinal cord compression with less pathological changes in the FSUs, i.e. herniated discs, osteophytic spurs, and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum or facet joints.

In our results, there were no significant differences among the groups with regards to age. When subjects with a normal and a wide canal were compared, the pathological changes in cervical intervertebral discs at all segments, except C5–6, were almost identical. However, when cervical cord compression was evaluated in subjects with a normal and a wide canal, the C4–5, C5–6, and C6–7 segments in subjects with a normal canal demonstrated significantly greater cervical cord compression than those observed in subjects with a wide canal. This may be due to the fact that subjects with a wide canal were able to better accommodate the cervical spinal cord, and therefore, the conditions of the spinal cords were less affected by the pathological changes in the FSUs. Additionally, when subjects with a congenitally narrow canal were compared with subjects with a wide canal, those with a congenitally narrow canal demonstrated significantly greater pathological changes in cervical intervertebral discs at all segments, except C2–3. Therefore, in subjects with a congenitally narrow canal, all segments, except C2–3, inevitably, demonstrated significantly greater cervical cord compression when compared to subjects with a wide canal. These results may affirm previous studies which stated that a congenitally narrow cervical spinal canal is an important risk factor for the development of cervical spinal canal stenosis. In addition, our results suggest that a cervical spinal canal diameter of less than 13 mm was associated with an increased risk for development of pathological changes in cervical intervertebral discs. Initially, patients with a congenitally narrow canal may be exposed to an increased risk for development of pathological changes in cervical intervertebral discs. These same individuals may be subsequently exposed to a greater risk for development of cervical cord compression.

### Degenerative lesions in the cervical portion of the spine… [^113akint]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The current concept that the hypertrophic variety of spondylitis is not an arthritis but a spondylosis arising as a reaction to changes primary in the intervertebral disks is based on the views promulgated by Schmorl and his followers. 1 The intervertebral disks, through the effect of age and of continuous functional stress, pass through stages of fibrillation, dehydration, fissuring and "brown degeneration". Defects in the cartilage plates, which may be congenital, traumatic or infectious in origin, permit extrusion of disk material into the vertebral bodies and penetration of vessels from the spongiosa into the normally avascular intervertebral disks, which may become calcified or ossified. The thinning of the disks and the loss of their normal buffer effect are attended by sclerosis of the adjacent vertebral borders and by marginal proliferation which may proceed to bony ankylosis. This progressive series of events has been duplicated experimentally.

### Cervical spondylolysis: three cases and a review of the current literature [^113ZNNMy]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objectives

To describe a rare case of cervical spondylolysis with an adjacent secondary dysplastic change, and to review the current literature regarding cervical spondylolysis.

Summary Of Background Data

Three patients presented with minor trauma history and radiographical C6 level spondylolysis.

Methods

Cervical spines were analyzed with plain radiography, multidetector computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.

Results

In all 3 patients, plain radiographs revealed a bilateral cleft of the C6 articular mass. The patients presented with long-term minimal discomfort of the posterior neck. In 2 patients, a trauma event increased the pain and produced neurologic deficits. In addition, an adjacent dysplastic change was present on imaging studying in 2 of the patients, 1 of whom also presented with a cord signal change above the spondylolytic level.

Conclusion

Early diagnosis and appropriate management of cases of spondylolysis are important. In addition, surgical plans for cervical spondylolysis should be considered if the adjacent levels are unstable or fragile.

### Which kind of prognosis is better in the treatment of cervical and lumbar disc herniation with coblation nucleoplasty? [^113aT9Lz]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cervical or lumbar discogenic pain affects more than 50% of patients, which severely impair quality of life and impose a huge socioeconomic burden. Various treatments are available for discogenic pain, such as medication, physical therapy, nerve block, behavior management, psychotherapy, minimally invasive interventions, and fusion or non-fusion surgery. However, these treatments have obvious limitations and complications, and do not always yield satisfactory results.

In CDH and LDH, the discs in the spine bulge or protrude from their normal positions, which can cause pain or numbness in the corresponding region. Disc herniation is primarily occurring at levels of C6/7, L4/5 and L5/S1. In consistent with this finding, our results showed that CDH was mostly observed at the levels of C5/6 (52.73%) and C6/7 (41.82%), whereas LDH was mainly detected at the levels of L4/5 (50.79%) and L5/S1 (42.86%). Conservative treatment is the first choice for most patients with disc herniation, including physical therapy, anti-inflammatory and epidural steroid injection. Decompression surgery may be considered when the conservative treatment fails to improve the condition, including discectomy for radiculopathy from herniated intervertebral disc, decompressive laminectomy for symptomatic spinal stenosis with or without degenerative spondylolisthesis, and fusion for nonradicular pain with degenerative changes.

### Destructive cervical spine osteoblastoma at C5 in a young patient initially presenting with quadriparesis: case report and review of the literature [^115mMnjo]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoblastomas are rare benign bone tumors that are mostly found in the posterior spinal elements; about 20% are located in the cervical spine.

Objective

The case of a destructive cervical osteoblastoma at C5 is reported in a 19-year-old man who initially presented with spastic quadriparesis.

Case Report

A 19-year-old man was self-referred, reporting symptoms in keeping with a progressive spastic quadriparesis, which had suddenly developed 6 days earlier. Preceding symptoms included mild non-specific neck pain for 3 weeks. The patient was afebrile, and no ambulatory X-ray study had been performed until the time of referral. A cervical spine computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a lytic lesion involving the spinal process and the pedicles of the C5 vertebra. Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging performed on an inpatient basis revealed a well-circumscribed, destructive lesion of the C5 vertebra, measuring approximately 3 cm. The spinal cord was significantly compressed. The patient underwent open surgical resection of the tumor through a midline posterior approach. Histopathology of the tumor specimen was in keeping with a diagnosis of osteoblastoma.

Conclusion

Neuroimaging should be performed with either conventional plain X-ray study, which seems to be sufficient in patients presenting with non-specific symptomatology related to cervical spine damage, or with advanced techniques in the case of patients with persistent neck pain or neurological deficit.

### Management of mild degenerative cervical myelopathy and asymptomatic spinal cord compression: an international survey [^1156XKun]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is an umbrella term for symptomatic spinal cord compression, secondary to degenerative changes of the cervical spine. Symptoms are often debilitating and progressive, typically resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.

Disease severity is often quantified using the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score, an objective physician evaluation of neurological dysfunction. Moderate and severe DCM are defined as cases where mJOA ≤ 14 and surgery has been recommended for such patients, as outlined in the most recent clinical practice guidelines. Prior to surgery, many factors contribute to a delay in diagnosis in moderate/severe DCM. Nonetheless, there is a consensus amongst surgeons in support of operative management.

In contrast, there is weak evidence informing the management of mild DCM, most commonly defined in the literature as mJOA 15–17. Amongst mild DCM patients, there is a subpopulation that deteriorates and another which remains stable. An absence of prognostic biomarkers and symptoms means that there are no strong predictions to support decision making.

Guidelines therefore currently suggest surgical intervention or a trial of structured rehabilitation in mild DCM, with the latter escalating to the former in cases of deterioration. This tentative guidance is reflected in variable practice, as has been anecdotally reported by surgeons. There is no specification on what structured rehabilitation or surveillance should entail.

Similar heterogeneity is believed to exist in the management of ASCC, a precursor to DCM. In this case, the guidelines cite weak evidence supporting non-operative management, involving counselling and education. Likewise, what this should constitute remains undefined.

Whilst widespread underdiagnosis so far limits the number of patients with mild or asymptomatic disease in spinal clinics, this is estimated to be vast (one meta-analysis estimates 1 in 5 adults could have ASCC) and rising with aging. Initiatives to accelerate diagnosis are on-going, and anticipated to increase case ascertainment.

On this background of weak evidence and variable practice, and driven by projected demand, efforts to better inform care for mild DCM and ASCC are a critical priority. The objective of this study was to assess current practices in the assessment and management of mild DCM and ASCC. This work also aligns with two other research priorities of the AO Spine RECODE-DCM initiative: diagnostic criteria and assessment and monitoring. We hypothesise that there is substantial variability in the definition, assessment, and management of mild DCM and ASCC.

### Posterior cervical decompression and instrumented fusion for cervical spondylotic myelopathy: 2-dimensional operative video [^111jJime]. Operative Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a common cause of progressive quadriparesis in adults. It is characterized by compression of the cervical spinal cord due to degenerative changes including intervertebral disc protrusion, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and osteophyte formation. Clinically, patients can present with declining motor control in the extremities, gait imbalance, spasticity, hyperreflexia, or possibly frank weakness. Surgical treatment options include ventral and dorsal approaches, whose indications vary depending on spinal alignment, number of levels requiring decompression, the dorsal/ventral/circumferential location of compression, and patient-specific anatomic constraints. Posterior cervical decompression and instrumented fusion is a mainstay of treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy when a dorsal approach is indicated. In this video, we present a case of a 60-yr-old female who presented with signs and symptoms of cervical myelopathy, with MRI findings of C3 on C4 anterolisthesis and circumferential central stenosis worst at C4–5 and C5–6. We demonstrate the operative steps to complete a C3 to C6 decompression and instrumented fusion with lateral mass screws. Appropriate patient consent was obtained.

### Cervical spine involvement in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-MRI follow-up study [^117RE46o]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

In adult rheumatoid arthritis controversy exists as to whether to perform conventional radiographs or MRI for diagnosis of cervical spine arthritis. Studies on imaging procedures in childhood report low sensitivity of radiography: in one study 15 of 29 patients revealed limited cervical spine motion whereas there was radiographic evidence of atlanto-axial subluxation in only 5. In another study of 20 patients, 65% had soft tissue involvement, pannus formation or erosions on the surface of atlanto-axial joints while only 20% had erosions on plain x-ray views. Given the severity of changes seen in our patients at the onset of disease and the high prevalence of structural cervical spine changes, we would advocate MRI as the procedure of choice for the diagnosis and follow-up of cervical spine involvement in JIA. Only this technique enables a visualization of synovial thickening, increased joint fluid, spinal cord, brainstem and the relationship between occiput, atlas and axis. With projection radiography it would probably not have been possible to monitor the extent of spinal involvement in our patients including those with multiple joint involvement. Moreover MRI reduces radiation exposure, which is especially important in young children. Clearly not all JIA patients need an MR examination of the cervical spine: patients with persistent oligoarthritis do not, or only rarely, develop cervical spine disease, however in polyarticular disease cervical spine involvement is frequent both in rheumatoid factor positive and negative patients. Hence we would recommend MR imaging in the following situations: (1) signs and symptoms of cervical spine involvement, (2) rheumatoid factor positive and (3) rheumatoid factor negative polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis with recalcitrant disease necessitating intensive therapy. In cases with narrowing of the spinal canal at cranio-cervical junction or clinically worsening courses, we would recommend control MRI in 6–9 monthly intervals (in milder cases 12 monthly) in order to consider options for treatment intensification.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^114YbLmS]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Is there any correlation between radiological findings and prognostic block or RFA outcomes?

Radiological findings and painful facet joints

In order to correlate radiological findings with a painful facet joint, or outcomes of prognostic IA blocks, MBB or RFA, radiological findings must be compared with patient-reported pain outcomes. Degenerative changes noted in radiological studies may not always be symptomatic, and the presence of findings does not always correlate with clinical symptoms.

Plain film radiographic examinations of the cervical spine represent a simple imaging modality for the evaluation of spine pathology. However, research to date has not found a strong association between the presence of cervical spondylosis on x-rays and clinical pain symptoms. Heller et al described a retrospective case–control study in 653 patients referred for x-ray examination of the cervical spine for neck pain compared with 365 asymptomatic patients referred for barium studies. No significant differences were noted in the presence of cervical spondylosis between groups, and there were also no significant associations between pain in the arm, shoulder, scapula, neck, and back of the head, and neck stiffness with pathologic x-ray findings. Similar findings have been noted in other retrospective cohort studies, with a lack of association between longitudinal plain film changes and the presence or severity of pain 10 years after the onset of neck pain The lack of association between facet joint osteoarthritis on cervical spine radiographs with reports of neck pain has been reported in larger population studies of women and men aged 20–65 years More recently, a retrospective cohort study confirmed these earlier findings of the lack of association between facet or uncinate process hypertrophy and pain intensity, headaches, referred shoulder/hand pain, radiculopathy, or numbness More high-quality prospective research is needed to understand the relationship between cervical spine x-ray findings and facet-mediated pain.

Through the myriad of abnormalities encountered by spine surgeons, neck pain is one of the most perplexing. The nature, onset, and location of the pain all provide information as to what the potential pain generator may be. By synthesizing data garnered from the physical examination, imaging studies, and history, a spine surgeon must formulate a differential diagnosis and treatment plan. The surgeon must determine whether the patient has cervical radiculopathy, myelopathy, or simply cervical spondylosis because the treatment of each of these is vastly different.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^113ov2ev]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Cervical facet joint pain — diagnostic considerations indicate limited certainty from routine history, examination, and imaging. The diagnosis of facet joint pain may not be made based on a radiologic evaluation or clinical assessment with certainty, and local tenderness and a manual examination of the cervical spine are not diagnostic. There is little information on the validity or utility of a self-reported history, although some features of inspection, range of motion, strength, palpation, and provocation tests can be useful, and range of motion has been described to be moderately reliable. Chronic whiplash-associated disorder patients and subjects with neck pain and myalgia have less cervical spine mobility, and patients with chronic neck pain may have slightly lower neck muscle strength compared with controls. Diagnosis prediction guides may allow practitioners to use a patient's history, self-report measures, and physical examination toward selecting the patient for cervical diagnostic facet joint blocks. Imaging statements include that there is no evidence that common degenerative changes on a cervical MRI are strongly correlated with neck pain symptoms; the evidence illustrates that these changes are highly prevalent in asymptomatic subjects and are also prevalent with increasing age; there is no evidence that such changes are associated with pain in patients with suspected cervicogenic headache; evaluation of acute unilateral neck pain with restricted motion showed no synovial effusion or inflammation around the cervical joints on MRI; and single photon emission computerized tomography scan uptake into the facet joints was present in only 43% of patients.

Cross-sectional spinal imaging is common, and extraspinal findings are often incidentally identified during interpretation. Although some of these findings may cause symptoms that mimic a spinal disorder, the majority are entirely asymptomatic and incidental. It is essential that the radiologist not only identify those abnormalities that may have clinical significance but also recognize those that are clinically irrelevant and thereby prevent patients from being subjected to further unnecessary, expensive and potentially harmful interventions. This article focuses on those abnormalities that are commonly encountered and provides practical guidance for follow-up and management based on current recommendations.

### Clinical and MRI outcome of cervical spine lesions in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis treated with anti-TNF α drugs early in disease course [^112xepTC]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cervical spine arthritis is a well-recognized complication of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), usually presenting in patients with systemic or polyarticular forms of the disease. More commonly, the upper cervical spine is affected because the atlanto-occipital and the atlanto-axial joints are synovial and are thus primary targets for rheumatic inflammation. Early detection of cervical involvement is essential for identification of children that require more aggressive treatment including early introduction of biologic therapy. Untreated chronic inflammation of the cervical joints can lead to morphological changes and functional impairment, which can be even life-threatening due to instability and potential risk of spinal cord injury.

Clinical signs and symptoms of cervical spine arthritis may include neck pain, stiffness, torticollis, limited range of motion (LROM), headache, facial and ear pain, and signs of cervical myelopathy. Absence of clinical symptoms does not exclude subclinical inflammation and imaging abnormalities of cervical spine.

Imaging modalities used in assessment of cervical spine arthritis include radiography, computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Radiography has been most evaluated imaging modality for assessment of cervical spine lesions and is particularly useful for evaluation of malalignment, functional impairment, morphological changes of bones, and vertebral body growth disturbances. In general, MRI is the method of choice in evaluation of cervical spine arthritis and is most useful in detecting synovitis with hypertrophic, enhanced synovia and pannus formation, joint effusion, erosions, bone marrow edema and possible neural structure compressions. The diagnostic accuracy and predictive value of conventional MRI in JIA patients with axial joint involvement have been poorly investigated. The role of MRI in detecting early changes in cervical spine in JIA was first evaluated in a Turkish study showing higher sensitivity of MRI compared to radiography for detection of erosions in children. More recently, a German study evaluating MR changes of cervical spine arthritis at diagnosis and response to treatment in 13 patients with JIA was published. It was concluded that close MRI monitoring of these patients appears to be sensitive tool for early diagnosis and may help to detect further disease progression and complications.

### Is neck pain a marker for something serious? Like myelopathy [^113CoFVj]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

The severity of DCM can vary depending on the extent of the damage to the spinal cord and the location of compression. Some individuals may experience only mild symptoms that do not significantly impact their daily lives, while others may experience significant disability and may require surgery. Not all of the clinical manifestations present as pain. Whilst the etiological factors for non-specific neck pain are poorly understood, neck pain correlates with spinal degeneration such as cervical spondylosis, however, in the context of DCM, neck pain is a confounder.

### Radiographic changes in the cervical spine following anterior arthrodesis: a long-term analysis of 166 patients [^112VyZzX]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Adjacent segment degeneration frequently develops following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. The objectives of the present study were to characterize the long-term evolution of degenerative radiographic changes at segments adjacent to anterior cervical fusion and to identify factors associated with the development of these changes, including the preoperative condition of the cervical spine and parameters related to arthrodeses.

Methods

One hundred and sixty-six patients who underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for symptomatic cervical spondylosis or disc herniation were followed radiographically for a mean time of 12.7 years (range, 5 to 30 years). Radiographic changes representing degeneration at adjacent levels, including disc height loss, osteophyte formation, end-plate sclerosis, and facet arthrosis, along with changes in sagittal alignment of the fusion segment and cervical spine, were recorded preoperatively and at the time of the latest follow-up. Regression models were used to identify the parameters that affect these degenerative changes.

Results

More than 90% of patients had worsened anterior and posterior osteophytes at segments immediately adjacent to the fusion. Degenerative changes were significantly affected by the proximity of the level to the fusion and were inversely affected by the preoperative degenerative changes present at the segment (p < 0.0001). The time elapsed since the surgical procedure was a significant predictor of degenerative changes (p < 0.0001). However, the patient age, the number of levels fused, and the sagittal alignment of the fusion segment had no influence on the degenerative changes at adjacent segments.

Conclusions

Multiple factors likely contribute to adjacent segment degeneration following cervical arthrodesis. Although mechanical parameters associated with arthrodesis, such as length and alignment of the fusion, did not appear to play a role, the preoperative degenerative condition of the spine and inclusion of C5-C6 in the arthrodesis influenced the incidence of adjacent segment degeneration.

### Surgery for degenerative cervical myelopathy: a nationwide registry-based observational study with patient-reported outcomes [^114RvLNn]. Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive spine disorder and the most common cause of spinal cord impairment in adults over 55 yr. The cervical spine is prone to degenerative changes such as disk herniation, ligament hypertrophy or ossification, and osteophyte formation that may lead to spinal cord compression and dysfunction. DCM should be considered in patients > 50 yr with progressive neurological symptoms, such as pain and stiffness in the neck, pain and numbness in limbs, poor coordination, imbalance, loss of dexterity, frequent falls, and bowel and/or urinary incontinence. As nonspecific and subtle initial early features of DCM overlap with other neurological conditions, it is frequently challenging to catch the diagnosis early. Lack of awareness and incomplete neurological assessments can also delay diagnosis, and this may also increase patients' risk of developing life-long disability and impaired quality of life. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the investigation of choice to detect spinal cord compression with or without intramedullary signal abnormalities and electrophysiologic testing can sometimes help exclude alternative diagnoses. Incidental degenerative changes in the cervical spine with spinal cord compression are commonly encountered on MRI and do not correlate well with the severity of symptoms. As the oldest sector of the population continues to grow and wishes to remain active, physicians will be required to manage an increasing number of patients with degenerative changes in the spine and DCM.

Indications and optimal timing for surgical treatment of DCM remain unclear, and additional high-quality data from daily clinical practice including all disease severities are warranted. According to current guidelines, surgery is recommended for moderate-to-severe or progressive DCM to prevent further deterioration. Two prospective multicenter AOSpine studies showed that decompressive surgery in selected patients can halt disease progression and achieve meaningful, albeit limited, recovery in pain, function, and quality of life. These 2 large studies were instrumental in driving the development of the 2017 AOSpine and Cervical Spine Research Society guidelines for management of DCM. Still, it is a common perception among health-care providers that chances of clinically relevant improvement following surgery for DCM are slim.

In this nationwide study with prospectively collected data from the Norwegian Registry for Spine Surgery (NORspine), we investigated clinical outcomes in patients undergoing decompressive surgery for DCM.

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a brief review of its pathophysiology, clinical course, and diagnosis [^1137nQcF]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Degenerative disease of the cervical spine commonly occurs in the natural process of aging. This can lead to compression of the spinal cord and symptomatic myelopathy. We review the pathophysiological factors that lead to myelopathy and the controversial natural history of untreated myelopathy. Signs and symptoms at presentation, examination findings, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic studies are also discussed.

### Degenerative disorders of the lumbar and cervical spine [^117BSnWs]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Degenerative disorders in the spine are normal, age-related phenomena and largely asymptomatic in most cases. Conservative management of lumbar and cervical spondylosis is the mainstay of treatment, and most patients with symptomatic degenerative changes respond appropriately with nonsurgical management. Surgical intervention can be considered an appropriate and viable option when conservative measures have failed. Treatment options should always be directed toward the specific nature and location of the patient's individual pathology. Although current standards in the surgical management of lumbar and cervical degenerative disorders include discectomy, neural decompression, and instrumented spinal arthrodesis, new approaches that address this often-challenging clinical entity are on the horizon.

### Cervical spine involvement in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-MRI follow-up study [^1132dP1G]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion this first MRI based follow-up study shows that cervical spine arthritis can follow a severe course of juvenile arthritis. While malalignments and inflammation sites decreased, osseous changes with erosions, ankylosis and narrowing of the cervical spine junction increased despite minor subjective complaints and treatment with biological agents. Close MRI monitoring of these patients appears to be a sensitive tool for early diagnosis and may help to detect further disease progression and complications.

Imaging predictors in cervical spondylotic myelopathy — there appears to be a consensus that the presence of a low signal on preoperative T1-weighted images, multisegment and focal high signal on T2-weighted images, and the presence of cord atrophy on MR images are indicators of a poor outcome, and these changes occur late in the evolution of CSM with a continuing challenge to find indicators with prognostic power in mild myelopathy or cervical stenosis with minimal clinical symptoms.
