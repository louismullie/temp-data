## Question

Which medications are appropriate for a patient with bipolar disorder who is depressed and unable to tolerate Lamictal?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications are appropriate to treat bipolar depression when lamotrigine (Lamictal) cannot be tolerated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether we are treating acute bipolar depression versus maintenance prevention of depressive relapse. Then, I should verify first-line FDA-approved options and recommended doses. Next, I will consider augmentation and combination strategies if there is a partial response. After that, I need to review second-line options and the role of adjunctive antidepressants with cautions. Then, I will address treatment-resistant pathways including ECT, TMS, and ketamine. Finally, I should outline a decision framework and safety monitoring plan tied to major guidelines and trial data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and phase, because the choice of agents differs between acute bipolar depression and maintenance prevention of depressive episodes, and lamotrigine intolerance removes one common option from both phases. Hold on, I should verify guideline anchors before moving on: CANMAT/ISBD emphasize phase-specific selection and hierarchy of first- and second-line treatments for acute bipolar depression, while also detailing maintenance strategies and general assessment principles, including suicide risk and medical contributors, which I need to keep in mind throughout [^1132hWd6]. Next, I will align acute-phase choices with high-credibility U.S. primary-care and specialty guidelines to ensure consistency [^1171DHch] [^1167QH1L].

> For acute bipolar depression, I need to identify first-line, FDA-approved options with dose ranges and practical advantages. Quetiapine monotherapy is recommended as first-line and FDA-approved, with typical dosing 300–600 mg/day and response NNT around 6; wait, let me verify the harm profile as well — sedation/somnolence has an NNH around 5, which I should factor into shared decision-making [^1171DHch] [^115ZDjwt]. Lurasidone is approved as monotherapy and as adjunct to lithium or valproate, with dose ranges commonly 20–120 mg/day and a favorable metabolic profile; I should confirm that dose-response clarity is still evolving, which recent meta-analysis highlights, even though efficacy is established [^117LqWFq] [^1147Mawd]. The olanzapine–fluoxetine combination is also FDA-approved and has robust efficacy with a response NNT about 4, though I need to caution about metabolic adverse effects, including weight gain with an NNH near 6 [^115ZDjwt] [^112iUf11].

> I should add two more FDA-approved options that are often underutilized. Cariprazine monotherapy is recommended in primary care guidelines for acute bipolar depression, with a usual dose range of 1.5–3 mg/day; let me double-check that its inclusion aligns with contemporary definitions of approved options in bipolar I depression — it does, and it appears in consensus definitions for adequacy in trials as well [^1171DHch] [^1174mPAa]. But wait, what if I'm missing a newer agent for depressive polarity in bipolar disorder? Lumateperone 42 mg/day is also approved for bipolar depression and included as an adequate trial in recent consensus on treatment-resistant bipolar depression; I should ensure patients and clinicians know it is a viable alternative when sedation or metabolic concerns limit choices [^1174mPAa].

> Lithium needs separate consideration because of its unique anti-suicide benefits and cross-phase efficacy. Let me think about dosing targets — maintaining serum concentrations at or above 0.8 mEq/L is recommended for efficacy in bipolar depression, and I should confirm this is consistent with multiple guideline sets, which it is, including summaries citing several international guidelines [^1147Mawd]. I should also remember lithium's role across acute and maintenance phases and discuss it early when suicide risk is salient, given unmatched evidence for suicide prevention, although this is sometimes underemphasized in acute-depression focused discussions [^112iUf11].

> Next, I should clarify preferred combination strategies for partial responders or when a more robust effect is needed. Lurasidone combined with lithium or valproate is guideline-recommended and often improves effect size in acute bipolar depression; I need to check that this is anchored in high-credibility guidance, which AAFP explicitly supports [^117HSYZq]. Quetiapine with lithium or valproate has evidence for preventing relapse comparably to monotherapy in maintenance settings, which reassures me about continuing successful acute regimens into continuation phases with a mood-stabilizing backbone when indicated [^116vFeoZ] [^117FAZD7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about anticonvulsants beyond lamotrigine. If first-line options fail, divalproex/valproate monotherapy has second-line support in guidelines and may be especially reasonable in patients with rapid cycling or comorbid anxiety profiles, though the acute bipolar depression data are less robust than for quetiapine or lurasidone [^111Vz1W6]. I should also revisit the historical perspective that lamotrigine is effective acutely; wait, I need to correct that assumption — four of five double-blind acute bipolar depression trials were negative on primary endpoints, which is crucial for expectation setting when patients cannot tolerate lamotrigine anyway [^1166YUEm].

> Adjunctive antidepressants merit careful, risk-mitigated use. I should double-check the magnitude of benefit and switch risk when used with an antimanic agent. Meta-analytic and guideline syntheses suggest a small effect size with modest benefit, and when combined with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic the switch risk approximates placebo; however, they should be avoided in those with prior antidepressant-induced mania, prominent mixed features, or recent rapid cycling, and never used as monotherapy in bipolar I depression [^111Vz1W6]. The benefit signal is modest compared with first-line atypical antipsychotics, with an estimated response NNT around 29, so they are best reserved for carefully selected patients and always as adjuncts, which I should make explicit with patients during consent [^115ZDjwt].

> Let me consider novel or adjunctive agents for partial response that have some supporting evidence. Pramipexole has shown antidepressant efficacy as augmentation in bipolar depression, and omega-3 fatty acids may confer an adjunctive benefit; I need to recognize these as lower-tier options supported primarily by smaller or earlier trials and incorporate them when first- and second-line choices are insufficient or poorly tolerated [^111PaQ6C]. For other third-line or ancillary strategies, evidence-based options like adjunctive eicosapentaenoic acid, N-acetylcysteine, light therapy, and even total sleep deprivation plus light can be considered case-by-case with appropriate monitoring and patient education [^116wriQT].

> If treatment resistance emerges, I need to shift to somatic and rapid-acting strategies with clear informed consent about benefits and risks. ECT remains a highly effective option for refractory bipolar depression, including in older adults when cognitive risks are weighed and mitigated; I should review maintenance planning post-ECT to preserve gains [^111Vz1W6]. TMS can be considered for those declining or unsuitable for ECT, though data are less robust, and IV ketamine may be considered for severe, urgent presentations with suicidality as a third-line option given short duration of benefit and safety considerations, with careful monitoring for potential switch and misuse risk [^112iUf11] [^116wriQT].

> For maintenance when lamotrigine is off the table, I should prioritize lithium given its strong prophylaxis and anti-suicide profile, and I must remember that while lamotrigine is often used to prevent depressive relapse, the patient's intolerance means I should emphasize alternatives such as quetiapine monotherapy or combination strategies tailored to prior response and polarity of relapse risk [^117FAZD7]. I need to ensure accuracy about mania prevention — VA/DoD advises against lamotrigine monotherapy to prevent manic recurrence, which ironically supports my focus on lithium or antipsychotic adjuncts for patients with a manic-predominant relapse pattern, even though lamotrigine intolerance makes this point less directly actionable here [^113H7LAr].

> I should double-check safety monitoring and education elements that cut across choices. Before and during pharmacotherapy, assess and monitor suicide risk, mixed features, adherence barriers, and substance use; evaluate thyroid status and metabolic parameters as relevant to chosen agents; and educate patients and caregivers to recognize emerging hypomanic or manic symptoms, particularly when adding antidepressants or adjusting antipsychotics, with a low threshold to discontinue antidepressants if switching or cycle acceleration appears [^1132hWd6] [^111Vz1W6]. Let me also remember to target therapeutic lithium levels, titrate atypicals thoughtfully to minimize sedation or akathisia, and document shared decision-making around metabolic risks and monitoring when using agents like OFC or quetiapine [^1147Mawd] [^115ZDjwt].

> Pulling this together into a pragmatic decision framework for acute bipolar depression without lamotrigine, I would start with quetiapine 300–600 mg/day or lurasidone 20–120 mg/day based on metabolic profile and patient preference, consider lithium initiation or optimization to ≥ 0.8 mEq/L especially with elevated suicide risk, and if response is partial, add lurasidone to lithium or valproate or pivot to cariprazine 1.5–3 mg/day or OFC while monitoring metabolic and extrapyramidal risks; if two adequate, approved trials fail, I should define treatment resistance and escalate to ECT or consider TMS or ketamine in selected urgent cases with clear safety plans [^1171DHch] [^117HSYZq] [^1174mPAa] [^115ZDjwt]. For maintenance, continue the effective acute agent when tolerated, prioritize lithium for recurrence prevention and anti-suicide benefit, use quetiapine when dual-polarity relapse prevention is desired, and employ combination maintenance with lithium plus valproate or a second-generation antipsychotic in high-risk courses, reassessing regularly for adverse effects and adherence [^117FAZD7] [^116vFeoZ].

---

For bipolar depression when lamotrigine is not tolerated, the best evidence-based alternatives are **quetiapine or lurasidone** as first-line monotherapy [^1171DHch] [^1147Mawd], with **lithium or valproate** as additional options [^112iUf11], and cariprazine or olanzapine-fluoxetine as second-line choices. Use **antidepressants only with a mood stabilizer** due to switch risk [^111Vz1W6], and ECT or ketamine are reserved for severe or treatment-resistant cases [^116wriQT]. Selection should be individualized based on comorbidities, side effects, and prior response [^1132hWd6].

## First-line pharmacological alternatives

### Quetiapine

- **Efficacy**: Strong evidence for acute bipolar depression [^115ZDjwt]; recommended first-line by AAFP and CANMAT/ISBD [^1171DHch] [^111Vz1W6].
- **Dosage**: 300–600 mg/day [^117MVWsG].
- **Side effects**: Sedation, weight gain, metabolic syndrome [^115ZDjwt].

---

### Lurasidone

- **Efficacy**: Effective as monotherapy or adjunct to lithium/valproate [^1147Mawd] [^115ZDjwt] recommended first-line by AAFP and VA/DoD.
- **Dosage**: 20–120 mg/day [^1147Mawd].
- **Side effects**: Akathisia, nausea, minimal metabolic effects [^115ZDjwt] [^1147Mawd].

---

### Lithium

- **Efficacy**: Effective for acute depression, maintenance, and suicide prevention [^116eJqr7] [^117FAZD7] [^112iUf11].
- **Dosage**: 0.6–1.2 mEq/L serum level [^1147Mawd].
- **Side effects**: Tremor, hypothyroidism, renal effects; requires monitoring [^1171DHch].

---

### Valproate

Valproate is useful for **acute depression**, especially with mixed features or rapid cycling. Target a serum level of 50–125 µg/mL. Adverse effects include weight gain and sedation; hepatic effects can occur, so monitoring is required [^1171DHch].

---

## Second-line pharmacological alternatives

### Cariprazine

Cariprazine is effective for **acute bipolar depression** and is recommended as a second-line option [^1171DHch] [^1132hWd6]. Usual dosing is 1.5–3 mg/day [^1174mPAa]. Adverse effects include akathisia and insomnia, with minimal metabolic effects.

---

### Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)

The olanzapine-fluoxetine combination is **effective for acute bipolar depression** and recommended as a second-line option [^115ZDjwt] [^1132hWd6]. Typical dosing is olanzapine 6–12 mg/day with fluoxetine 25–50 mg/day. Adverse effects include weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and sedation [^115ZDjwt].

---

## Adjunctive antidepressants (with mood stabilizers)

When used adjunctively, **SSRIs or bupropion** may be considered, but only alongside a mood stabilizer due to switch risk [^111Vz1W6]. The concern is antidepressant-induced mania/hypomania; avoid monotherapy [^111tLRp5].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

ECT is indicated for **severe, treatment-resistant, or urgent cases** [^111Vz1W6], and **ketamine** is a rapid-acting option [^116wriQT] for treatment-resistant depression [^111Vz1W6].

---

## Clinical considerations

Selection should be tailored to **medical and psychiatric comorbidities**, matching side-effect profiles to patient tolerance and preferences. Prior treatment response should also guide choice [^1132hWd6].

---

Quetiapine, lurasidone, lithium, and valproate are **first-line options** for bipolar depression when lamotrigine is not tolerated, with cariprazine and olanzapine-fluoxetine as second-line [^1132hWd6]; antidepressants require a mood stabilizer [^111Vz1W6], and ECT or ketamine are for refractory cases [^116wriQT].

### Treatment of bipolar depression: an update [^112iUf11]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

This article attempts to summarize the status of our knowledge and practice in the acute treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar depression. For prophylactic treatment, our knowledge about lithium firmly supports its usefulness against bipolar depression and its specific effectiveness for suicide prevention. Valproic acid and carbamazepine could be effective as well, while lamotrigine seems to be preferably effective against depression but not mania. The FDA has approved the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination and quetiapine monotherapy for the treatment of acute bipolar depression.

The usefulness of antidepressants in bipolar depression is controversial for both acute and prophylactic treatment. Guidelines suggest their cautious use, always in combination with an antimanic and mood stabilizer agent, because in some patients they may induce switching to mania or hypomania, mixed episodes, and rapid cycling. Data on psychosocial intervention are restricted to the maintenance phase. Electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation are additional options for refractory patients. Bipolar depression seems to be a more difficult condition to treat than mania. Most patients need complex combination treatment, although the published evidence on this type of treatment is limited.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and international society for bipolar disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111Vz1W6]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

In patients who are inadequately responsive to first-line agents, monotherapy with divalproex (level 2) is included as a second-line option.

- **Adjunctive use**: Antidepressant therapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or bupropion, with lithium/divalproex or an atypical antipsychotic may also be considered as a second-line add-on treatment. While some individual studies have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant therapy, a recent meta-analysis (level 1) supports efficacy, albeit with a small effect size.

	- This is a key aspect of decision-making regarding antidepressants, since historically much of the focus has been on the risk of manic switch or rapid cycling, with an underappreciation of the relatively weak efficacy data. This new appreciation, exemplified by the small benefit seen in the above meta-analysis, led to the change from the last CANMAT guidelines, which previously gave add-on SSRI/bupropion antidepressants a first-line recommendation.

- **ISBD Antidepressant Task Force recommendations**: Antidepressants should ideally be avoided, or used cautiously if necessary, in patients with a history of antidepressant-induced mania or hypomania, predominant mixed features, or recent rapid cycling. Patients and caregivers (as appropriate) should receive education regarding early warning symptoms of mood switching or cycle acceleration, and antidepressants should be discontinued if these emerge. Antidepressant monotherapy should NOT be used for the treatment of BDI depression.

ECT (level 3) is another option considered in the guidelines.

### Efficacy and acceptability of lurasidone for bipolar depression: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^1147Mawd]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder has a reported lifetime prevalence of approximately 2% and is diagnosed when patients experience manic or hypomanic episodes. While the disease course does not always involve major depressive episodes, at least 70% of patients with bipolar disorder do experience depressive symptoms, such as decreased interest, lack of energy, feelings of guilt, and suicidal ideation. This condition often severely affects the patient's life, resulting in impaired social functioning. Therefore, treatment of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder is crucial.

Lithium, quetiapine, and lurasidone are the currently recommended first-line treatments for bipolar depression according to several medical guidelines, including the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, the International Society for Bipolar Disorders, the International College of Neuro-Psychopharmacology, and the Taiwanese Society of Biological Psychiatry and Neuropsychopharmacology. Most of these guidelines also provide recommended dosages for these medications.

For example, lithium should be maintained at therapeutic serum concentrations of at least 0.8 mEq/L, and quetiapine should be administered at a dose of at least 300 mg. However, there is no consensus on the dosage of lurasidone used to treat bipolar depression. Recommendations either lack specific dosing guidance or only provide a broad range of doses within safety thresholds (20–120 mg). This underscores the lack of clarity regarding the optimal use of lurasidone.

### Canadian Network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^116vFeoZ]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Monotherapy with quetiapine (level 1), lithium (level 2), and lamotrigine (level 2) are first-line options.

- **Quetiapine**: In two 52-week maintenance studies, patients with BDII who achieved remission from depression with quetiapine monotherapy either continued it or switched to placebo. A pooled analysis reported that patients treated with quetiapine had a significantly longer time to relapse into any mood episode (hazard ratio [HR] 0.33, representing a 67% reduction in the risk of relapse) and into depression (HR 0.28, indicating a 72% risk reduction). Time to relapse into hypomania was not significantly greater (HR 0.65, denoting a 35% risk reduction). The latter finding may be related to the low base rate of hypomania, which occurred in only 10% of all study participants. Quetiapine was at least as effective in BDII as in BDI, with risk reductions of 42% for any relapse, 48% for depression, and 30% for mania.

- **Adjunctive quetiapine**: This was also studied in a 6-month single-blind trial which randomly assigned patients with either BDI or BDII to lithium or quetiapine added to treatment as usual. They were equally effective in preventing relapse. Results were not presented separately for BDII, but BDII patients responded better to both treatments than did BDI patients.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^1131QDA8]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bipolar disorder, particularly in relation to maintenance therapy, the DoD/VA 2023 guidelines recommend offering lamotrigine for the prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes.

### Acute and maintenance treatments for bipolar depression [^116y4x86]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with bipolar disorder are symptomatic about half of the time, experiencing depression more often than mania or hypomania. Since patients usually seek treatment during a depressive episode rather than a manic episode, bipolar depression is commonly misdiagnosed as unipolar depression. Providing an accurate and timely bipolar depression diagnosis is critical for the proper treatment of the patient.

Some FDA-approved treatments are helpful during both acute and maintenance phases of therapy. However, there is a significant unmet need for effective bipolar depression treatments with favorable side-effect profiles. Newer agents offer the promise of improvements in tolerability, but additional research is needed to actualize this promise into better treatments for patients struggling with bipolar depression.

### A 52-week, open-label continuation study of lamotrigine in the treatment of bipolar depression [^117U3WKJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Lamotrigine has demonstrated efficacy for the acute treatment of depression in bipolar I patients in a placebo-controlled, monotherapy study. We describe the results of a 52-week, open-label continuation of that trial.

- **Method**: Patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder with a major depressive episode who completed a 7-week, double-blind study of bipolar depression were offered 1 year of open-label lamotrigine therapy (flexible doses of 100–500 mg/day) in a continuation study. To maintain the acute study blind, the first 3 weeks of the continuation study remained blinded while patients previously randomly assigned to placebo were titrated to a lamotrigine dose of 50 mg/day. Patients who had been randomly assigned to lamotrigine continued at their fixed doses. Beginning at week 4, all patients received open-label lamotrigine for up to 49 additional weeks. Concomitant psychotropic medications were permitted during the open-label phase. Effectiveness (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale) and safety assessments were administered at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 52. The study was conducted from June 1996 to December 1998.

- **Results**: Of 135 patients completing the acute study, 124 (92%) entered the continuation study: 77 had received lamotrigine and 47 had received placebo in the acute study. The mean duration of lamotrigine exposure was 10.4 months, with a mean modal dose of 187 mg/day. Sixty-nine patients (56%) completed 1 year of treatment. Significant and sustained improvement from baseline.

### Newer treatment studies for bipolar depression [^111PaQ6C]. Bipolar Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Depressive symptoms of bipolar disorder have a more negative impact on a patient's life than manic symptoms. This review focused on the emerging efficacy data for treatments in bipolar depression.

- **Methods**: English-language literature cited in Medline was searched using the terms bipolar depression, clinical trial, and trial. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of newer studies with older agents and all studies with newer or novel agents were prioritized. Open-label studies of novel agents presented at major scientific meetings were also included.

- **Results**: Olanzapine, olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC), and quetiapine were superior to placebo in the acute treatment of bipolar depression. Lamotrigine significantly reduced core symptoms of depression compared with placebo. Pramipexole, a dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist, and omega-3 fatty acids, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, augmented to mood stabilizer (MS), showed superiority to placebo in reducing depressive symptoms. Topiramate augmentation of an MS was as effective as bupropion-SR. Patients treated with an MS responded well to the addition of agomelatine, a melatonin receptor agonist with 5-HT2C antagonist properties. However, inositol and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation did not separate from placebo. Lamotrigine and olanzapine, and to a lesser extent, divalproex, were superior to placebo in preventing depressive relapses. All agents were relatively well tolerated.

- **Conclusions**: Olanzapine, OFC, and quetiapine are effective in the acute treatment of bipolar depression compared with lithium.

### Biochemical and genetic predictors and correlates of response to lamotrigine and folic acid in bipolar depression: Analysis of the CEQUEL clinical trial [^111mqonv]. Bipolar Disorders (2017). High credibility.

Depression, rather than mania, accounts for the majority of the burden of increased mortality and long-term disability in bipolar disorder. Treatment of bipolar depression remains a major clinical challenge with few treatment trials, particularly beyond the acute phase of illness, nor have many examined combination therapies, which are the norm in clinical practice.

We recently reported the results of the CEQUEL trial (Comparative Evaluation of QUEtiapine plus Lamotrigine combination versus quetiapine monotherapy [and folic acid versus placebo] in bipolar depression). CEQUEL was a multi-centre, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, with a 2×2 factorial design. It examined the efficacy of adding lamotrigine and/or folic acid (FA) to quetiapine monotherapy for depressive symptoms in participants with bipolar disorder. Participants were followed up at 12, 22, and 52 weeks, with changes in self-reported depressive symptoms at 12 weeks as the prespecified outcome. The rationale for CEQUEL was that adding lamotrigine, which has a lengthy (6-week) titration period, to quetiapine, which is relatively quick-acting and is thought to act via different pharmacological mechanisms, might lead to synergistic long-term outcomes. Similarly, FA, which is widely used as an over-the-counter vitamin supplement, has shown some clinical benefit in major depression, consistent with reports of a cerebral folate deficiency in patients with treatment-refractory depression. Thus, we hypothesized that adding lamotrigine to quetiapine would be superior to quetiapine monotherapy.

### Effects of lamotrigine in patients with bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence [^116siH1c]. Bipolar Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is significantly associated with alcohol use disorders. Anticonvulsant drugs are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, and they have also been used to treat alcohol dependence. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the tolerance and safety of lamotrigine in a dual-diagnosis population presenting bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence. Open-label lamotrigine was examined in 28 outpatients with DSM-IV bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence. Lamotrigine was added to existing medication regimens.

- **Method**: Lamotrigine was started at a dose of 25 mg/day and titrated to a maximum dose of 300 mg/day. Subjects received a baseline evaluation, which included a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), and weekly assessments for 12 weeks with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Severity of Alcohol Dependence Scale (SADS), a visual analogue scale for craving severity (VASC), and alcohol consumption. The concentration of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) was used as an indirect measure of alcohol consumption. The sample consisted of 18 men and 10 women diagnosed with alcohol dependence and bipolar disorder I (n = 21) or bipolar disorder II (n = 7), with a mean age of 36.5 ± 7.7 years.

- **Results**: Significant improvement was observed in HAM-D, YMRS, and BPRS scores (p < 0.01). Craving and CDT also significantly decreased (p < 0.001). Lamotrigine was well tolerated, with no dropout subjects due to adverse events.

In conclusion, lamotrigine is safe and well-tolerated in patients with bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence, showing significant improvements in mood and reduction in alcohol cravings.

### Reevaluating therapies for bipolar depression [^115GWPcg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The most commonly employed pharmacotherapies for bipolar depression include antidepressants, lithium, and anticonvulsants, such as lamotrigine, valproate, and carbamazepine. A combination of these agents, usually an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer, is often required to achieve an optimal response. However, some treatment guidelines still caution that antidepressant exposure should be minimized in patients with bipolar depression due to concern that they may trigger treatment-emergent mania or cycle acceleration. This advice prevails despite data showing that antidepressants are effective in treating bipolar depression and evidence that the coadministration of a mood-stabilizing medication, at least with modern antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, can reduce the risk of treatment-emergent mania to levels comparable with those observed with mood stabilizer monotherapy.

Although the antidepressant efficacy of most mood stabilizers has not been satisfactorily proven, first-line therapy with one mood stabilizer alone or a combination of two mood stabilizers is still recommended by many guidelines. Inappropriate treatment of bipolar depression may leave patients at high risk of suicide and increased chronicity of symptoms; effective therapy should, therefore, be provided as early as possible. The efficacy and safety of antidepressants for bipolar depression both as monotherapy and when combined with a mood stabilizer should be studied in adequately powered trials in order to revise treatment guidelines. Electroconvulsive therapy remains an option for treatment-resistant cases of bipolar depression.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^115m8nwC]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Quetiapine (level 1), lithium (level 2), lamotrigine (level 2), and lurasidone (level 2) are all recommended as first‐line treatment options with evidence for efficacy as monotherapy.

Lurasidone (level 1) and lamotrigine (level 2) are also recommended as first‐line adjunctive treatments. Although quetiapine and lithium have not been assessed for efficacy as adjunctive treatments for acute bipolar depression, clinicians may choose to apply this combination in patients who experience depression when optimized on one of these medications.

Recommendations as to which first‐line treatment should be considered first are outlined in our hierarchy. We recommend that the agents listed first in the hierarchy be tried first, in the order listed, unless there are patient-specific reasons for choosing an agent lower down in the order, such as a previous history of response/non-response or clinical features (see Clinical features which help direct treatment choices).

For instance, if a patient presents with an acute bipolar depressive episode and is not taking any treatment and has not been treated for this episode, that patient should be commenced on quetiapine monotherapy if there is no previous history of non-response or tolerability concerns with quetiapine.

### Long-term treatment of bipolar disorder with lamotrigine [^11645EME]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression is as debilitating as mania in bipolar disorder, but the treatment of bipolar depression has historically received less attention. At the time of writing, there is no mood stabilizer (liberally defined as a medication that decreases episode severity, duration, or frequency in one phase of bipolar illness without producing a negative effect in other phases) that demonstrates similar efficacy in both the depressive and manic phases of bipolar disorder. However, bipolar depression — which is prevalent, sometimes chronic, and associated with a low quality of life and a high risk of suicide — must be addressed as energetically as mania.

Recent research into the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder has raised several questions about the generalizability of early lithium studies due to these studies' designs. Researchers conducting more recent studies of mood stabilizers in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder have attempted to clarify their results by, for example, performing survival analyses of the data. Until pharmacotherapy is found that is equally efficacious in treating both manic and depressive episodes in bipolar disorder, the use of combination therapy to manage bipolar disorder is advised.

Lithium and divalproex sodium remain the first-line treatments for mania. Lamotrigine has been found to have acute efficacy in treating episodes of bipolar depression without increasing cycling or provoking a switch into mania, as well as a long-term role in delaying relapse and recurrence of depressive episodes.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^117FAZD7]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, and lamotrigine monotherapies have the best combination of clinical trials, administrative data, and clinical experience to support their use as first-line therapies for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder (BD). Recent data suggest that asenapine is effective in preventing both manic and depressive episodes, and thus is recommended as a first-line treatment. Aripiprazole, both oral and once monthly, is also recommended as a first-line monotherapy due to its efficacy in preventing any mood or manic episode as well as its safety and tolerability profile; however, it has not been shown to be effective in preventing depression.

- **Summary of evidence for divalproex as a first-line maintenance therapy for bipolar I disorder**: Divalproex has demonstrated efficacy in various randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Additional combination therapies included as first-line options are quetiapine adjunctive therapy with lithium or divalproex, which has demonstrated efficacy in preventing any mood, manic, or depressive episode. Aripiprazole combined with lithium or divalproex should also be considered as a first-line option.

For patients who experience a recurrence or who remain symptomatic while on a first-line agent or combination, dosing should be optimized and issues of non-adherence identified and addressed prior to moving to the next step.

### Lamotrigine as adjunct to paroxetine in acute depression: a placebo-controlled, double-blind study [^115GEszw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Mood stabilizers appear to be more potent in treating mania than depression. The anticonvulsant lamotrigine has been shown to be effective for bipolar depression. This study examines putative antidepressive properties of lamotrigine in a mainly unipolar routine clinical patient population.

- **Method**: Forty patients with a depressive episode (DSM-IV criteria) requiring psychiatric intervention received lamotrigine or placebo using a fixed dose escalation scheme with a target dose of 200 mg/day for 9 weeks. Additionally, all patients were treated with paroxetine. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) ratings were used to monitor therapeutic efficacy.

- **Results**: Adjunctive treatment with lamotrigine did not result in a significant difference in HAM-D total score at the endpoint of the study compared with paroxetine alone. However, lamotrigine demonstrated significant efficacy on core depressive symptoms as reflected by HAM-D items 1 (depressed mood; p = .0019), 2 (guilt feelings; p = .0011), and 7 (work and interest; p = .049) and the CGI-Severity of Illness scale (p < .0001). Patients receiving lamotrigine had fewer days on treatment with benzodiazepines and fewer withdrawals for treatment failure. Lamotrigine appeared to accelerate the onset of action of the antidepressant. Two patients on lamotrigine treatment developed neutropenia, and one developed a benign rash. There was no detectable pharmacokinetic interaction between lamotrigine and paroxetine.

- **Conclusion**: Lamotrigine might have antidepressive properties.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^117LqWFq]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Although treatment guidelines commonly recommend maintenance therapy with lamotrigine or quetiapine as first-line treatments in bipolar disorder patients at risk for depressive episode recurrence, there clearly is a need for additional options that are safe, well-tolerated, and effective for the maintenance therapy of patients at risk for depression recurrence.

Lurasidone has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute bipolar depression, both as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. Three randomized, double-blind, 6-week trials have been completed: a monotherapy trial comparing two flexible-fixed doses of lurasidone (20–60 mg/day; 80–120 mg/day), and two flexible dose trials of lurasidone (20–120 mg/day) administered adjunctively with lithium or valproate. We report here the results of the 6-month, open-label, uncontrolled extension of the three 6-week studies, designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of lurasidone in patients with bipolar depression. A secondary aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of lurasidone in maintaining improvement in depressive symptoms.

### Comparative economic evaluation of quetiapine plus lamotrigine combination vs quetiapine monotherapy (and folic acid vs placebo) in patients with bipolar depression (CEQUEL) [^11247T5W]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Although not licensed for acute bipolar depression, lamotrigine has shown evidence for efficacy in trials, and its use is recommended in guidelines. So far, there had been no prospective health economic evaluation of its use.

Cost‐utility analysis of the CEQUEL trial compared quetiapine plus lamotrigine versus quetiapine monotherapy (and folic acid versus placebo in an add‐on factorial design) for patients with bipolar depression (n = 201) from the health and social care perspective. Differences in costs together with quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) between the groups were assessed over 52 weeks using a regression‐based approach.

Health‐related quality of life improved substantially for all randomization groups during follow‐up, with no significant difference in QALYs between any of the comparisons (mean adjusted QALY difference: lamotrigine vs placebo −0.001 [95% CI: −0.05 to 0.05], folic acid vs placebo 0.002 [95% CI: −0.05 to 0.05]). While medication costs in the lamotrigine group were higher than in the placebo group (£647, P < 0.001), mental health community/outpatient costs were significantly lower (−£670, P < 0.001). Mean total costs were similar in the groups (−£180, P = 0.913).

Lamotrigine improved clinical ratings in bipolar depression compared with placebo. However, this differential effect was not detected using the EQ‐5D‐3L. The additional cost of lamotrigine was balanced by significant savings in other medical costs, rendering its use cost-neutral to the health service. Compared to placebo, folic acid produced neither clinical improvement nor cost-effectiveness.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^1132hWd6]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Pharmacological treatment for acute bipolar depression involves multiple agents: lithium, anticonvulsants, atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants, all investigated for their efficacy in managing bipolar depression. These treatments have been assessed based on the strength of evidence for efficacy as well as safety and tolerability. Recommendations are detailed and ranked in Table 14, which provides a hierarchy of first and second-line treatments recommended for managing acute bipolar I depression.

- **Review of general principles and assessment of medication status**: Assessment of patients presenting in a depressed state should comprehensively evaluate the nature and severity of the depression and any associated symptoms. It is crucial to assess the risk of suicide or self-harm behavior, the patient's ability to adhere to a treatment plan, the availability of a psychosocial support network, and any functional impairment. Laboratory investigations should be completed as per guidelines in Section 8.

	- The results from these evaluations should inform the most appropriate treatment setting, whether ambulatory or inpatient, with a focus on managing safety risks. Before pharmacological treatment, it is critical to ensure depression symptoms are not due to alcohol or drug use, medications, other treatments, or a general medical condition. Patients are advised to discontinue stimulant use and limit nicotine, caffeine, drug, and alcohol intake. Additionally, the course of the illness and treatments used in prior depressive episodes should be carefully reviewed and assessed.

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: A systematic review [^117MVWsG]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

In a randomized pilot trial conducted by Wang et al, 56 participants with bipolar disorder (BD) and mixed features (defined as 2 or 3 manic symptoms during a major depressive episode) received quetiapine monotherapy for 2 weeks. They were administered 100 mg on day 1, with the dosage increased by 100 mg each day until day 3. Subsequently, the dose range was adjusted to 300–600 mg/day. Participants who responded (MADRS score reduction ≥ 20%) to quetiapine monotherapy continued their treatment for another 6 weeks. Those who did not respond sufficiently (MADRS score reduction < 20%) were randomly assigned to either quetiapine combined with valproate or quetiapine combined with lithium for 6 weeks. The quetiapine + lithium group received 300 mg on day 1, then increased to 600–900 mg/day within 3 days. The quetiapine + valproate group started at 500 mg/day, and the dose was adjusted to 1000 mg/day within 3–5 days.

Study assessments included the MADRS, YMRS, Clinically Useful Depression Outcome Scale supplemented with questions for the DSM-5 mixed features specifier (CUDOS-M), and HAMA. No significant differences in changes of MADRS, YMRS, or CUDOS scores were observed between the quetiapine + valproate group and the quetiapine + lithium group from baseline to week 8. The quetiapine + lithium group showed a significant reduction of mean MADRS (–7.18, p = 0.025) and YMRS (–4.82, p = 0.047) scores from baseline to week 8. All measures at each visit were lower than the previous visit. For the quetiapine + valproate group, a significant reduction was only observed in mean MADRS (–8.6, p = 0.027) score between baseline and week 8.

### What is a "mood stabilizer"? An evidence-based response [^116eJqr7]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The term "mood stabilizer" is widely used in the context of treating bipolar disorder, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not officially recognize the term, and no consensus definition is accepted among investigators. The authors propose a "two-by-two" definition by which an agent is considered a mood stabilizer if it has efficacy in treating acute manic and depressive symptoms and in prophylaxis of manic and depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder. They review the literature on the efficacy of agents in any of these four roles to determine which, if any, agents meet this definition of mood stabilizer.

- **Method**: The authors conducted a comprehensive review of English-language literature describing peer-reviewed, U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality class A controlled trials to identify agents with efficacy in any of the four roles included in their definition of a mood stabilizer. The trials were classified as positive or negative on the basis of primary outcome variables. An "FDA-like" criterion of at least two positive placebo-controlled trials was required to consider an agent efficacious. The authors also conducted a sensitivity analysis by raising and relaxing the criteria for including trials in the review.

- **Results**: The authors identified 551 candidate articles, yielding 111 class A trials, including 81 monotherapy trials with 95 independent analyses published through June 2002. Lithium, valproate, and olanzapine had unequivocal evidence for efficacy in acute manic episodes, lithium in acute depressive episodes, and in prophylaxis of both manic and depressive episodes.

### Decision tree for the treatment of bipolar disorder [^11545LBW]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Clinicians managing patients with bipolar disorder confront a myriad of complex treatment decisions. This complexity limits the practicality of treatment guidelines, which attempt to be comprehensive. A user-friendly guide can, however, be constructed by considering only the most common early critical decision points likely to be encountered in the management of bipolar patients: new onset of an acute manic or mixed episode, interepisode treatment entry, and initial treatment for acute bipolar depression.

Three general treatment principles can be applied to guide decision-making at critical decision points following entry into clinical care: use proven treatments first, use a mood stabilizer in every phase of the illness, and use a multiphase treatment strategy to link assessment with an appropriate treatment plan. To guide the selection of appropriate therapeutic agents, a simple grading system can be used to evaluate the weight of evidence supporting the use of various options.

Multiple high-quality studies with positive results support the use of lithium, divalproex, carbamazepine, olanzapine, and haloperidol as initial interventions for acute mania; other agents with positive results in one double-blind mania trial are reasonable first-line alternatives. In the absence of high-quality evidence to guide treatment selection for nonacutely ill bipolar patients, guidelines recommend maintenance mood stabilizer treatment. Standard antidepressant medications do not appear to add statistically significant benefit beyond that of mood stabilizers alone.

### Randomized, double-blind pilot trial comparing lamotrigine versus citalopram for the treatment of bipolar depression [^114wGZDj]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Uncertainty exists regarding the best approach for treating bipolar depression among patients already receiving a first-line mood stabilizer. The aim of this pilot study was to compare adding a second mood stabilizer or an antidepressant at this treatment decision point.

- **Methods**: Twelve-week, randomized, double-blind pilot trial comparing the addition of lamotrigine or citalopram for bipolar depressed patients on mood stabilizer medication. Change in depressive symptoms and risk of switch were examined.

- **Results**: Twenty subjects were randomized. Each treatment group experienced a significant mean reduction in total MADRS scores (citalopram Delta - 14.2, p = 0.002; lamotrigine Delta - 13.3, p = 0.001), and there was no significant difference between treatment groups (p = 0.78). Total response rates increased from 31.6% at week 6 to 52.6% at week 12. One out of ten patients in each group experienced a switch to hypomania.

- **Limitations**: Small sample size. Lack of a placebo arm.

- **Conclusions**: Results of this small trial suggest that both lamotrigine and citalopram appear to be reasonable choices as add-on acute treatment for bipolar depression, with response rates continuing to rise considerably past 6 weeks of treatment.

- **Titration**: Increase to 200 mg per day in week 5 and 300 mg per day during week 6.
- **Maintenance dosing**: 300–500 mg per day, administered in 2 divided doses.

### Treatment options for bipolar depression [^115LYdCc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is often misdiagnosed as major depressive disorder due to the high frequency of depressive symptoms in many patients with bipolar disorder. Depressive episodes resistant to treatment may also be associated with a worse illness course in bipolar disorder, yet the factors connecting bipolar disorder and depression are not fully understood. The data on the effectiveness of antidepressants in treating depression in bipolar disorder vary significantly, with few prospective, randomized studies on the subject. Current data suggest that the rates of mania induction for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and lamotrigine are similar to those seen with placebo. The optimal duration for continuing antidepressant treatment in patients with bipolar disorder has not been established; however, research suggests that a longer treatment period (6 months or more) may help prevent relapse. Recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for depression in bipolar disorder include a combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine for depressive episodes in bipolar disorder, and lamotrigine for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder. Psychoeducation has also been studied as a potential treatment for depression in bipolar disorder, with findings indicating that patients receiving psychoeducation along with medication may experience a lower relapse rate than those receiving medication alone.

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: A systematic review [^11785PNk]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

A systematic search was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines on PubMed and OVID, which includes MedLine, Embase, AMED, PsychINFO, and JBI EBP, from inception to July 22, 2024. Additionally, the reference lists of obtained articles were manually searched. The pharmacological agents included in the search terms were lithium salts, antidepressants, typical or atypical antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants that are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD).

The following Boolean logic search string was used to search the databases: ("Amitriptyline" OR "Citalopram" OR "Clomipramine" OR "Fluvoxamine" OR "Mirtazapine" OR "Nortriptyline" OR "Paroxetine" OR "Phenelzine" OR "Desipramine" OR "Duloxetine" OR "Escitalopram" OR "Sertraline" OR "Venlafaxine" OR "Agomelatine" OR "Desvenlafaxine" OR "Gepirone" OR "Levomilnacipran" OR "Moclobemide" OR "Selegiline" OR "Tranylcypromine" OR "Vilazodone" OR "Vortioxetine" OR "Bupropion" OR "Dextromethorphan" OR "Dextromethorphan-bupropion" OR "Ketamine" OR "Esketamine" OR "Fluoxetine" OR "Zuranolone" OR "Cariprazine" OR "Lurasidone" OR "Quetiapine" OR "Olanzapine" OR "Lumateperone" OR "Aripiprazole" OR "Asenapine" OR "Haloperidol" OR "Paliperidone" OR "Risperidone" OR "Ziprasidone" OR "Iloperidone" OR "Clozapine" OR "Amisulpride" OR "Brexpiprazole" OR "Carbamazepine" OR "Valproate" OR "Valproic Acid" OR "Divalproex" OR "Gabapentin" OR "Oxcarbazepine" OR "Pregabalin" OR "Topiramate" OR "Lamotrigine" OR "Lithium") AND ("M

### Balancing benefits and harms of treatments for acute bipolar depression [^115ZDjwt]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression is more pervasive than mania but has fewer evidence-based treatments. Using data from multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses, we assessed the number needed to treat (NNT) for response and the number needed to harm (NNH) for selected side effects for older and newer acute bipolar depression treatments.

The two older FDA-approved treatments for bipolar depression, olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC) and quetiapine (QTP) monotherapy, were efficacious (response NNT = 4 for OFC, NNT = 6 for QTP) but similarly likely to yield harms (OFC weight gain NNH = 6; QTP sedation/somnolence NNH = 5). Commonly used unapproved agents, such as lamotrigine monotherapy and adjunctive antidepressants, tended to be well-tolerated (with double-digit NNHs). However, this advantage was at the cost of inadequate efficacy (response NNT = 12 for lamotrigine, NNT = 29 for antidepressants). In contrast, the newly approved agent lurasidone was not only efficacious (response NNT = 5 for monotherapy, NNT = 7 as adjunctive therapy) but also had enhanced tolerability (NNH = 15 for akathisia [monotherapy], NNH = 16 for nausea [adjunctive]). Although adjunctive armodafinil appeared well tolerated, its efficacy in bipolar depression has not been consistently demonstrated in randomized controlled trials.

NNT and NNH are categorical metrics; only selected NNHs were assessed. There is limited generalizability of efficacy (versus effectiveness) studies. For acute bipolar depression, older approved treatments may have utility in specific contexts depending on individual patient needs.

### Comparative economic evaluation of quetiapine plus lamotrigine combination vs quetiapine monotherapy (and folic acid vs placebo) in patients with bipolar depression (CEQUEL) [^1153xGGj]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Both the available EQ‐5D utility values and the full imputed EQ‐5D dataset for baseline, 12 weeks, and 52 weeks follow-ups showed substantial improvement for all randomization groups during the 52 weeks follow-up period.

- **Outcomes**: Regression adjusted mean EQ‐5D utility and QALY differences between randomization groups are given in Table 3. No between-group differences were seen for any of the group comparisons. Participants taking lamotrigine had slightly lower QALYs (−0.001; P = 0.972) than participants taking placebo, whereas participants randomized to folic acid had slightly higher QALYs (0.002, P = 0.938) than those allocated to placebo. However, these differences were neither statistically nor clinically significant. Relevant sensitivity analyses of the QALY calculation methods confirmed the main results and are therefore not presented separately.

- **Costs**: Table 4 summarizes the regression adjusted mean costs per participant for the different resource use categories based on the full imputed dataset. Mean total costs from the health system perspective were £5,823 (SE: £1,156) for the lamotrigine group and £6,003 (SE: £1,162) for the placebo group and not significantly different overall (−£180, P = 0.913, n = 201). However, looking at subgroup categories, some potentially interesting differences emerged between the lamotrigine and placebo treatment groups. As expected, total medication costs were higher for the lamotrigine group (£713).

### Pharmacotherapy of bipolar depression: an update [^1154Cds8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Bipolar affective disorder is a virulent illness with high rates of recurrence, disability, social impairment, and suicide. Although the manic or hypomanic episodes define the disorder, the depressions are more numerous and less responsive to treatment. As the initial depressive episodes are commonly misdiagnosed, initiation of therapy with mood stabilizers is often delayed, increasing the likelihood of treatment-emergent affective switches on antidepressant monotherapy. The empirical basis for selecting treatments for people with bipolar depression is weak, and only the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine has received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Conventional mood stabilizers are preferred for first-line therapies, although atypical antipsychotics are increasingly used, and FDA approval of quetiapine is pending. Antidepressants — particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and bupropion — are indicated when mood stabilizers are ineffective and for "breakthrough" depressions.

In step 4, addressing the addition or switch of therapy involves considering second-line agents.

Second-line treatments include olanzapine (level 1), which is effective in preventing mood, manic, or depressive episodes. However, due to safety concerns such as metabolic syndrome, it remains a second-line treatment. Biweekly long-acting injectable risperidone monotherapy (level 1) or adjunctive therapy (level 2) has shown efficacy in preventing any mood or manic episode, although it lacks clear evidence for preventing depressive episodes. Notably, oral risperidone adjunctive therapy showed a trend towards superiority at six months in preventing any mood episode and mania, though not depression.

Carbamazepine (level 2) has yet to be assessed in extensive placebo-controlled trials but is supported by active comparator trials for its efficacy. Paliperidone (level 2) demonstrated more significant effectiveness than placebo in preventing mood or manic episodes, though it was less effective than olanzapine.

Ziprasidone oral adjunctive therapy (level 2) has been effective in preventing mood or manic episodes, despite conflicting data for acute treatment. There was a trend for the superiority of lurasidone adjunctive therapy in preventing mood episodes (but not manic or depressive episodes individually) in a controlled trial, significantly separating from placebo in those with an index depressive episode. Therefore, lurasidone adjunctive therapy may be appropriate for patients who responded to this medication during an index depressive episode.

### Efficacy and safety of lamotrigine as add-on treatment to lithium in bipolar depression: A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1155pfm9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Lamotrigine is one of the pharmacologic options for the treatment of bipolar depression, but it has only been studied as monotherapy. This study aimed to compare the acute effects of lamotrigine and placebo as add-on therapy to ongoing lithium treatment in patients with bipolar depression.

Outpatients (N = 124) aged 18 years and older, diagnosed with DSM-IV bipolar I or II disorder and experiencing a major depressive episode, were included. All participants had a Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score of ≥ 18 and a Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Version (CGI-BP) severity of depression score of ≥ 4 while receiving lithium treatment (0.6–1.2 mmol/L). Patients were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with either lamotrigine (titrated to 200 mg/d) or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the mean change from baseline in total score on the MADRS at week 8. Secondary outcomes included response rates (a reduction of ≥ 50% on the MADRS and/or "much improved" or "very much improved" on the CGI-BP compared to baseline) and a switch to mania or hypomania, defined as a CGI-BP severity of mania score of at least mildly ill at any visit. The study included patients from between August 2002 (with Spain starting in October 2003) and May 2005.

The endpoint mean change from baseline in MADRS total score was -15.38 (SE = 1.32) points for lamotrigine and -11.03 (SE = 1.36) points for placebo (t = -2.29, df = 104, p = .024). Significantly more patients responded to lamotrigine than to placebo on the MADRS (51.6% vs. 31.7%, p = .030), but not on the CGI-BP.

### Is ECT a viable option to treat depression in older adults with bipolar disorder who are vulnerable to cognitive side effects [^1163JkQJ]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

A 72-year-old woman had been treated for bipolar II disorder at our outpatient clinic since 2010. The age of onset of her first mood symptoms was 19 years, when she experienced depressive symptoms. In 1975, six months after her first child was born, she had a depressive episode with a suicide attempt. She jumped from a balcony, leading to a fracture of her first lumbar vertebra and irreversible cauda equina syndrome (CES), for which she has a sacral neurostimulator.

In 2010, financial stressors precipitated a depressive episode, which was treated with nortriptyline 70 mg daily. Subsequently, she experienced hypomania, which was treated by adding lithium 600 mg daily. In retrospect, between her suicide attempt and 2010, she had several episodes of hypomania, especially in the summer. The diagnosis of her depressive mood disorder was changed to bipolar II disorder. From 2010 until 2014, she was euthymic and treated with lithium 600 mg daily, maintaining therapeutic serum levels around 0.60 mmol/L. In 2014, she had an episode of hypomania. Overall, depressive episodes predominated the clinical picture.

Apart from CES, her medical history included hypothyroidism, for which she used levothyroxine 88 micrograms daily. Her family history was notable for depressive disorder in her mother, bipolar disorder in her son, and Alzheimer's dementia in her grandfather.

Armodafinil and modafinil are described as third-line agents for bipolar I depression, with a summary of evidence provided. Ancillary treatments such as adjunctive eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (level 2), N-acetylcysteine (level 3), and light therapy (level 3), including bright light delivered midday (level 3), are recommended as third-line treatment options to be used adjunctively with other medications.

There may be additional benefits to using light therapy in combination with total sleep deprivation (level 2), although clinical experience with this technique is limited. Intravenous ketamine (level 3) is noted as a highly effective and fast-acting antidepressant but is relegated to a third-line treatment due to its invasive nature, short duration of effect, and lack of long-term safety data. It is recommended for patients with severe symptoms or significant suicidal ideation when other treatments have been unsuccessful. In situations that prioritize rapid response, ketamine may be considered earlier; however, clinicians should be aware of limited efficacy data and the non-lasting effects of ketamine. There are reports of manic switch without confirmatory clinical trial evidence. Additionally, there is a need for caution regarding the potential abuse of ketamine, especially in domiciliary use situations.

- **Pharmacological treatment of manic episodes**: There are a range of strategies that have been investigated for use in mania, including lithium, divalproex, other anticonvulsants, typical and atypical antipsychotics, and other agents and therapies. These treatments have been evaluated using the criteria for strength of evidence for efficacy as well as safety and tolerability.

The evidence for efficacy and the recommendations for treating acute mania are summarized in a hierarchical ranking of first and second-line treatments. As stated previously, the first and second-line agents are listed hierarchically, taking into consideration not only their efficacy for acute mania but also their efficacy in preventing mania or depression, treating acute bipolar depression, safety/tolerability, and the risk of treatment-emergent switch. The implication of this hierarchical recommendation is that those listed higher up in the table should be considered first before moving on to the next on the list, unless other factors such as history of previous non-response or patient's preferences preclude such a strategy in a given patient.

Monotherapy and combination therapy are listed separately as first-line treatments for acute mania. This does not mean that all monotherapy agents should be tried first before considering combination therapy for acute mania. It is suggested that the treating clinician make a decision as to whether to treat a given patient with monotherapy or combination therapy.

### Efficacy of newer anticonvulsant medications in bipolar spectrum mood disorders [^116e6nkC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

More treatment options for all phases of bipolar disorder are needed. While lithium, valproate, and carbamazepine remain the standard of care for treatment of bipolar disorder, many patients do not respond adequately to these treatments. Some new antiepileptic medications such as lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, and zonisamide are beginning to be used to treat bipolar disorder.

- **Data sources**: Evidence for the effectiveness of these novel antiepileptic drugs in treating acute mania and depression, as well as in preventing the recurrence of mania and depression, is reviewed. A MEDLINE search (1966–2001) was performed for clinical trials published in English using the keywords lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, and zonisamide, plus the terms bipolar disorder and mania. Evidence for the effectiveness of monotherapy is presented first when it is available. Data from augmentation treatment studies and open case series in which standard ratings of symptoms were employed are presented when these are the only available data.

- **Data synthesis**: Twenty-eight reports of the efficacy of novel antiepileptic medications in bipolar disorder are reviewed. Evidence is strongest for lamotrigine monotherapy in patients with bipolar depression, in some patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, and as prophylaxis. Evidence for the efficacy of topiramate in acute and refractory mania is promising but comes predominantly from open trials. Although some very small studies have found that oxcarbazepine and zonisamide may have some effectiveness, the results are not definitive.

### Defining treatment-resistant bipolar depression: Recommendations from the ISBD task force [^1174mPAa]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Despite the availability of approved treatments, a substantial proportion of patients with bipolar disorder experience treatment-resistant bipolar depression (TRBD), characterized by persistent depressive symptoms unresponsive to standard therapies. However, a universally accepted definition of TRBD is lacking. This consensus document, developed by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) Task Force on TRBD, aims to provide a standardized definition of TRBD to facilitate clinical trials, research, and treatment strategies.

- **Methods**: The Task Force employed a literature review, clinical trials analysis, and expert consensus meetings to define TRBD.

- **Results**: TRBD was defined as the failure to achieve a significant and sustained clinical response after at least two approved and adequately dosed pharmacological treatments, administered for a sufficient duration with treatment adherence. For bipolar I (BD-I) depression, approved treatments included quetiapine (300–600mg/day for ≥ 8 weeks), lurasidone (20–120mg/day for ≥ 6 weeks), the combination of olanzapine (6–12mg/day) and fluoxetine (25–75mg/day for ≥ 8 weeks), cariprazine (1.5–3mg/day for ≥ 6 weeks), and lumateperone (42mg/day for ≥ 6 weeks). For bipolar II (BD-II) depression, approved treatments included quetiapine (300–600mg/day for ≥ 8 weeks) and lumateperone (42mg/day for ≥ 6 weeks).

- **Conclusion**: This consensus definition aims to provide clarity for clinical trials, improve consistency in research, guide treatment approaches, and inform regulatory pathways. It represents a foundational step in addressing treatment-resistant bipolar depression.

### Lamotrigine for the treatment of bipolar spectrum disorder: a chart review [^115vhbje]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Bipolar spectrum disorders are highly prevalent and disabling but are often misdiagnosed and inadequately treated. The use of mood stabilizers may be an important treatment option. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of lamotrigine in bipolar spectrum patients.

- **Methods**: Retrospective follow-up of 34 charts of bipolar outpatients treated with lamotrigine in monotherapy or as add-on therapy. Clinic notes were used to score the Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorders (CGI-BP-M) scale and to identify manic, hypomanic, mixed, or depressive relapses.

- **Results**: A mean dose of lamotrigine of 113.2 ± 66.6 mg/day for a mean duration of 29.7 ± 17.3 weeks (range 6–96 weeks) achieved remission on depression (score 1 on the CGI-BP-M depression subscale) in 47.1% of the patients. Eleven patients (32.4%) remained euthymic (score 1 on the CGI-BP-M overall subscale) during the follow-up after initiating treatment with lamotrigine. The effectiveness of lamotrigine was greater for those patients diagnosed with bipolar spectrum disorders other than bipolar I. Lamotrigine was well-tolerated, and only two patients discontinued due to side effects.

- **Limitations**: Chart review is open to several biases.

- **Conclusions**: In this sample of bipolar spectrum patients, lamotrigine was a safe and effective treatment.

### Comparative economic evaluation of quetiapine plus lamotrigine combination vs quetiapine monotherapy (and folic acid vs placebo) in patients with bipolar depression (CEQUEL) [^113ASfGG]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). High credibility.

This health economic analysis complements and amplifies the clinical findings and has important clinical and policy implications in terms of supporting calls for a wider use of lamotrigine to treat bipolar depression in published consensus guidelines.

### Comparative economic evaluation of quetiapine plus lamotrigine combination vs quetiapine monotherapy (and folic acid vs placebo) in patients with bipolar depression (CEQUEL) [^11391FD5]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

In this economic evaluation of the effects of adding lamotrigine and folic acid to quetiapine therapy to treat bipolar depression, quality of life improved substantially for all groups during follow-up, with no significant differences in health outcomes between any of the group comparisons. The same applies to costs, indicating no significant differences between groups in terms of total health and social care costs. Overall, this analysis suggests that the addition of lamotrigine to quetiapine is associated with good health outcomes and is cost neutral. Compared to placebo, folic acid produced neither clinical nor significant health economic benefits.

- **Quality of life**: The effect of treatment of bipolar depression has so far not been systematically measured from a health economic perspective. The change from around 0.5‐0.7 for quality of life is both statistically and clinically significant. Regular mood monitoring may have contributed to this overall positive outcome, as suggested by the earlier findings of Bopp and colleagues on steady improvement in patients using TrueColours. On the other hand, the EQ‐5D measure did not discriminate lamotrigine from placebo in the way that symptom ratings did. This is despite the fact that the EQ‐5D correlates quite well with depressive ratings on the QIDS scale in bipolar patients. Most likely, the EQ‐5D may also be confounded by an uncertain relationship to manic symptoms, as they may be viewed in a paradoxically positive way whenever they occur. This makes it a potentially less reliable outcome measure.

### Separate and concomitant use of lamotrigine, lithium, and divalproex in bipolar disorders [^111XAXvz]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2004). Low credibility.

Expert consensus emphasizes the need for better recognition and accurate diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Research on lithium, divalproex, and lamotrigine provides new insight into the effective management of this illness. Advances in identifying the mechanism of action of mood stabilization have focused on signaling pathways within the cell that are associated with neurotrophic effects. Clinical research has led to confirmatory evidence of the efficacy of lithium in all phases of bipolar disorder, with the greatest effects seen in the treatment and prevention of mania. Compared to divalproex, lithium also has been found to have greater efficacy in the prevention of suicide. Lamotrigine has emerged as a first-line treatment for bipolar depression, which is an area of weakness for other mood stabilizers. Oral loading of divalproex leads to rapid stabilization of mania without imposing a greater adverse effect burden than conventional dosing. Because no agent is universally effective in all phases of the illness, combination therapy with two or more agents often is the best option.

### Treatment strategies for bipolar depression [^112YHnmj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Resolving acute bipolar mood episodes is only one part of an overall strategy for treating bipolar disorder. Successful prevention of mood episode relapse, particularly bipolar depressive episodes, through effective continuation and maintenance therapies can greatly improve patient functioning and outcomes. Little evidence is available to guide decisions on the treatment of bipolar depression, especially in the maintenance phase, and additional research into effective options is urgently needed. General strategies for treating patients with bipolar disorder include continuing the acute pharmacotherapeutic regimen into the maintenance phase and considering tolerability.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^111P5Vu8]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The evidence for the efficacy of many currently available treatments for bipolar disorder is based on studies of non-refractory patients with the condition. Therefore, it is not surprising that most treatment recommendations and guidelines for managing bipolar disorder and its many comorbidities heavily depend on data from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs). However, these RCTs provide little direction for clinicians regarding optimal next steps for non-responders, partial responders, and those with ongoing medical and psychiatric comorbidities.

Given this limitation and the scarcity of RCTs at later treatment stages, we believe it is appropriate to begin a discussion about the quality of data that some experts might consider when choosing and sequencing drug combinations. We acknowledge that many clinical investigators may prefer different sequences. However, we hope the suggestions offered here may be useful to some clinicians in the field and could initiate discussions of other options in the literature. Simultaneously, this may provide a preliminary outline for a new round of much-needed clinical trials to better inform clinical practice.

Given the wide range of quality of data and clinical principles on which these suggestions are based, only minimal references are included. A comprehensive review of the literature supporting each option is beyond the scope of this manuscript.

### Lamotrigine in the acute treatment of bipolar depression: results of five double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials [^1166YUEm]. Bipolar Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

The efficacy of lamotrigine as maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder (BD), particularly for delaying depressive episodes, is well established, but its efficacy in the acute treatment of bipolar depression is less clear. This paper reports the results of five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of lamotrigine monotherapy for the acute treatment of bipolar depression.

- **Methods**: Adult subjects with bipolar I or II disorder experiencing a depressive episode were randomized to receive placebo or lamotrigine monotherapy. After titration, they were administered a fixed dose of 50 mg or 200 mg daily in Study 1, a flexible dose of 100–400 mg daily in Study 2, or a fixed dose of 200 mg daily in Studies 3, 4, and 5, for a duration of 7–10 weeks.

- **Results**: Lamotrigine did not differ significantly from placebo on primary efficacy endpoints [17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale in Studies 1 and 2; Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) in Studies 3, 4, and 5]. In Study 1, lamotrigine significantly separated from placebo on some secondary measures of efficacy, including the MADRS, the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S), and the CGI-Improvement (CGI-I), but seldom differed on secondary efficacy endpoints for the other studies.

- **Conclusions**: Lamotrigine monotherapy did not demonstrate efficacy in the acute treatment of bipolar depression in four out of five placebo-controlled clinical studies. Lamotrigine was well tolerated in the acute treatment of bipolar depression.

### Bipolar depression: Criteria for treatment selection, definition of refractoriness, and treatment options [^116hJeP9]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

This paper reviews controlled studies of bipolar depression, outlines criteria for choosing treatment, defines refractoriness in bipolar depression, and provides options for the treatment of refractory bipolar depression.

- **Methods**: Controlled studies that examined the efficacy of treatments for acute and long-term treatment of bipolar depression were located through electronic searches of several databases and by manual cross-searching of references and proceedings of international meetings.

- **Results**: Lithium comes close to fulfilling the proposed criteria for first-line treatment for bipolar depression, and those not responding to lithium should be considered to have refractory bipolar depression. Options for such patients include the addition of lamotrigine or a second mood stabilizer, or a newer-generation antidepressant such as a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor or bupropion, or the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine.

- **Conclusions**: Although there is a paucity of research in the treatment of refractory bipolar depression, available data could be used for providing rational treatment options for such patients. However, further studies are urgently needed to determine which options are most appropriate for which type of patients.

### The current understanding of lamotrigine as a mood stabilizer [^112cNUQT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

To examine whether lamotrigine has a unique role in the treatment of bipolar disorder, we evaluated the results of recent clinical trials and molecular and cell biological studies on lamotrigine.

- **Data sources**: Using keywords such as bipolar disorder, lamotrigine, clinical trial, outcomes studies, and mechanisms, we conducted a search for English-language articles on MEDLINE and Index Medicus and also on abstracts presented in recent research conferences.

- **Data synthesis**: Several studies have strongly suggested that lamotrigine is effective for the acute treatment of bipolar depression as well as for long-term maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a concern, but the incidence of this side effect may not be as high as previously believed if dosing is slowly titrated. The action mechanisms underlying the mood-stabilizing effects of lamotrigine are unknown at present, but recent studies have produced interesting leads. Lamotrigine modulates various ion channels, altering neuronal excitability.

	- The use-dependent inhibition of neuronal firing by lamotrigine is potentially important because it could result in attenuating supranormal neuronal activities that are possibly associated with bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine inhibits the release of glutamate, similarly to lithium, and its possible association with mood-stabilizing or antidepressant effects needs to be further examined. Unlike lithium or valproic acid, however, lamotrigine does not down-regulate the expression of protein kinase C or MARCKS, suggesting that lamotrigine employs different mechanisms.

### Global trends in the use of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of bipolar disorder [^111M9PzU]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic mental health condition characterized by significant mood swings, including periods of mania or hypomania and depression. Affecting approximately 1–2% of the global population, BD is associated with impaired social functioning, decreased quality of life, and an increased risk of suicide. The disorder presents a substantial burden on healthcare systems and imposes significant economic costs due to lost productivity and the need for extensive treatment and support services.

This comprehensive review synthesizes global trends in BD pharmacotherapy over the past 1 to 3 years, focusing on emerging medications, novel treatment protocols, and ongoing debates within the field. Additionally, the review explores differences in prescribing patterns across developed and developing countries and introduces the impact of pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine on treatment outcomes.

- **Purpose of review**: The primary purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of the global trends in the use of medications for the treatment of BD over the past 1 to 3 years. This review aims to outline the latest studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses relevant to BD pharmacotherapy, highlighting new discoveries and advancements. Furthermore, this review addresses ongoing debates and controversies in the field, such as the role of antidepressants in BD treatment and the long-term use of antipsychotics, aiming to bridge knowledge gaps and guide future research directions.

- **Recent findings**: Studies continue to reinforce the efficacy of l

Another caveat about this manuscript is that direct and indirect references supporting the recommendations given will only be sparsely cited. We will attempt to allude to the reasoning behind the recommendations, but a comprehensive discussion, rationale, and justification of each choice, sequence, and preference is not possible within the scope of this manuscript.

### Challenges in the management of bipolar depression [^111tLRp5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression has started to receive more attention in clinical trials only relatively recently, despite the fact that patients spend more time in the depressed phase than in the manic phase of bipolar disorder. The diagnosis and management of bipolar depression are challenging, and many patients are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to symptom similarities with unipolar depression or other illnesses and/or comorbidities. Untreated or inappropriately treated bipolar depression adds to the burden of illness and is associated with a greater risk of suicide.

Treatment options include lithium, lamotrigine, atypical antipsychotics, and traditional antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, traditional antidepressants are recommended with caution due to their potential risk of switching patients into mania. Some atypical antipsychotics have shown efficacy in bipolar depression, although longer-term studies are warranted.

The choice of treatment for different subgroups of patients with bipolar depression, including those with comorbid anxiety, may vary and also needs further study. Other important issues that require further investigation include the recognition of the core features of bipolar depression and the threshold symptoms for treatment, as well as the optimal treatment choices for monotherapy or combination therapy, and acute versus long-term management of bipolar depression.

### "How harmful is your mania to you or others?" Sharing decisions about antidepressant treatment in bipolar depression [^113P19w9]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Gap between guidelines and clinical practice**: Multiple studies have shown that the majority of bipolar patients are routinely treated with antidepressants for their depression. Previous authors have speculated on the considerations in the consultation rooms that encourage or warrant the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The severity of bipolar depression and the estimated suicide rate of 15%-20% prompt clinicians to suggest SSRI treatment. For many patients, the side-effect profile of dopamine-serotonin receptor antagonists and the need for regular laboratory monitoring for mood stabilizers are relevant considerations. The extrapolation of antidepressant efficacy in unipolar depression may be another contributing factor.

- **Guidelines reluctance**: In the past few decades, guidelines have been reluctant to endorse antidepressants as a treatment option for bipolar depression. Recent guidelines do not recommend tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or SSRI monotherapy, but they propose the combination of an SSRI with lithium/valproate/olanzapine as a first-line choice among other options such as lithium, lamotrigine, and quetiapine. Still, antidepressants have proven modestly efficacious, comparable to other treatments (number needed to treat = 5.75). A recent meta-analysis also showed that SSRI addition to lithium is superior over placebo in short-term regimes.

- **Risk of mania induction**: The hesitation to award antidepressants a more prominent role in the guidelines stems from the notion that they may induce (hypo)mania, particularly TCAs and venlafaxine. The risk of SSRIs triggering (hypo)mania is a concern that continues to influence clinical decisions.

### Rationale for using lithium in combination with other mood stabilizers in the management of bipolar disorder [^112K6B1c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a complex illness, and no single agent has been proven in randomized, placebo-controlled trials to effectively prevent and/or control all aspects of the illness — acute mania, rapid cycling, and breakthrough depression. However, for the most important issue — prophylaxis of episodes — lithium has more evidence of efficacy than any other agent. Like lithium, typical antipsychotics, carbamazepine, divalproex, and the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine are effective in the treatment of mania. Carbamazepine, divalproex, and olanzapine seem effective in preventing manic episodes but, like lithium, are less effective in preventing depression.

Few trials have been conducted on the more difficult-to-treat characteristics of bipolar disorder, specifically rapid cycling and breakthrough depression. For patients with rapid cycling, carbamazepine or divalproex therapy may improve symptoms, but only lamotrigine has been shown to reduce cycling, mostly in the bipolar II group, in a randomized, placebo-controlled study. For the treatment of depressive episodes, lithium and olanzapine have shown modest efficacy in controlled trials, and among mood stabilizers, lamotrigine has the most robust effect. Because manic symptoms may respond best to one agent and depressive symptoms to another, combination therapy may be the optimal treatment for many patients with bipolar disorder. For example, lithium augmentation may improve overall response rates to treatment with carbamazepine or divalproex, and the lithium-lamotrigine combination should provide effective prevention of both manic and depressive episodes.

### Treatment-resistant bipolar depression: a STEP-BD equipoise randomized effectiveness trial of antidepressant augmentation with lamotrigine, inositol, or risperidone [^111tojQh]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). High credibility.

Clinicians have few evidence-based options for the management of treatment-resistant bipolar depression. This study represents the first randomized trial of competing options for treatment-resistant bipolar depression and assesses the effectiveness and safety of antidepressant augmentation with lamotrigine, inositol, and risperidone.

- **Method**: Participants (N = 66) were patients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder enrolled in the NIMH Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD). All patients were in a major depressive episode that was nonresponsive to a combination of adequate doses of established mood stabilizers plus at least one antidepressant. Patients were randomly assigned to open-label adjunctive treatment with lamotrigine, inositol, or risperidone for up to 16 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the rate of recovery, defined as no more than two symptoms meeting DSM-IV threshold criteria for a mood episode and no significant symptoms present for 8 weeks.

- **Results**: No significant between-group differences were seen when any pair of treatments were compared on the primary outcome measure. However, the recovery rate with lamotrigine was 23.8%, whereas the recovery rates with inositol and risperidone were 17.4% and 4.6%, respectively. Patients receiving lamotrigine had lower depression ratings and Clinical Global Impression severity scores, as well as greater Global Assessment of Functioning scores, compared with those receiving inositol and risperidone.

- **Conclusions**: No differences were found in primary pairwise comparison.

### Bipolar depression: A new role for atypical antipsychotics [^111PEYHY]. Bipolar Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression, the most common phase of bipolar disorder, causes significant morbidity and mortality. Traditional drugs such as lithium, lamotrigine, or antidepressants each offer some clinical efficacy; however, efficacy can be limited, and side effects are sometimes problematic. Thus, there is a major unmet need for effective, well-tolerated agents for the treatment of bipolar depression. The atypical antipsychotics, with their proven efficacy against manic symptoms, are emerging as candidates for use against the depressive phase of bipolar disorder. Several studies have shown that some atypicals improve depressive symptoms in mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder; however, few studies have been performed in patients specifically with bipolar depressive episodes.

In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with acute bipolar I depression, olanzapine monotherapy and an olanzapine-fluoxetine combination significantly improved Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores compared with placebo (p < 0.001), with corresponding effect sizes (improvement of active treatment over placebo divided by pooled standard deviation) of 0.32 and 0.68, respectively. Importantly, there were no significant differences in rates of switch into mania among the three groups.

Recent results from an 8-week, randomized placebo-controlled trial in patients with bipolar I and II disorder who were experiencing a bipolar depressive episode showed that quetiapine (300 and 600 mg/day) had significantly greater efficacy compared with placebo in improving the core symptoms.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^114oQq4h]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Responders to lamotrigine have a predominantly depressive polarity as well as comorbid anxiety. Lamotrigine monotherapy is not appropriate for patients with frequent manic episodes, as it has limited efficacy in preventing mania.

Quetiapine has been shown to be effective in preventing manic, depressive, and mixed episodes in patients with index manic, depressive, and mixed episodes, and thus may be particularly valuable in those with mixed features. Asenapine appears to be effective in preventing both mania and depression, although the magnitude of prophylactic efficacy is greater for mania relative to depression. In a randomized open trial of carbamazepine versus lithium, responders to carbamazepine were more likely to have an atypical illness, BDII, or schizoaffective disorder.

Data to differentiate antipsychotic medication responders from non-responders are lacking. Overall, some of these possible predictors can have clinical utility, but not all are practical. For instance, it is difficult to evaluate a pre-treatment course in patients who started their treatment after one or two episodes, a practice recommended by most treatment guidelines. Additionally, biomarkers are intriguing but lack sufficient replication and are not readily available.

In patients with a history of a rapid cycling course, as indicated in previous sections, factors associated with rapid cycling must be addressed. These include discontinuation of stimulants and antidepressants and treating hypothyroidism if present. With regard to treatment options, the evidence suggests that monotherapy with appropriate agents is crucial.
