## Question

Montelukast for bacterial sinusitis monotherapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether montelukast is appropriate as monotherapy for bacterial sinusitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether we are dealing with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) versus chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Then, I should verify guideline-based therapy for ABRS. Next, I need to check montelukast's labeled indications and mechanism to see if it has any antibacterial role. After that, I will examine the evidence for leukotriene receptor antagonists in CRS or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Finally, I will consider safety signals and synthesize a recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the disease context and standard of care. ABRS is typically a bacterial complication of a viral upper respiratory infection, whereas CRS is a chronic inflammatory condition with different management principles; ABRS care emphasizes either watchful waiting or antibiotics plus symptomatic relief, and symptomatic measures include intranasal corticosteroids and saline, but I should confirm whether leukotriene receptor antagonists are recommended anywhere in ABRS pathways; hold on, I should verify guideline statements to avoid overgeneralizing from CRS to ABRS [^1156zny1] [^114RCeCn] [^11552ayP].

> Next, I should review ABRS treatment recommendations. I need to ensure I am aligned with first-line therapy: the AAFP rapid evidence review recommends amoxicillin/clavulanate or amoxicillin for ABRS, with symptomatic therapy as appropriate; fluoroquinolones may be reserved only when alternatives are unsuitable because of safety concerns, so they are not first-line for routine ABRS; critically, I should check whether leukotriene antagonists appear as a recommended option — wait, they do not appear as ABRS treatments in these guidelines [^11552ayP] [^116P9EVJ] [^115Gjq6e].

> I will now examine montelukast's pharmacology and labeled uses. Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist approved for asthma maintenance, allergic rhinitis, and prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction; it is anti-inflammatory but has no antibacterial activity and is not indicated to treat bacterial infections; let me double-check the label to be sure I am not missing any infectious disease indication — no, there is none [^112Ug5CU] [^111y8DdB].

> But wait, what if the question is really about CRS rather than ABRS; I should review whether montelukast has any role there. In CRS, especially in AERD, leukotriene-modifying drugs may be considered to relieve nasal symptoms and reduce polyp burden, generally as adjunctive therapy; small trials in chronic nasal polyposis suggest modest symptom benefits when added to steroids, but effects often fade after discontinuation; conversely, add-on montelukast postoperatively to intranasal steroids showed no long-term advantage versus steroids alone; this pattern supports a limited adjunct role in selected CRS phenotypes, not monotherapy for suspected bacterial disease [^1137eKQB] [^117NaXiV] [^115QaXzg].

> I should double-check safety signals to ensure there is no misleading impression of benefit. Interestingly, acute sinusitis is listed among common adverse events with montelukast in FDA safety summaries, which reinforces that it neither prevents nor treats bacterial sinusitis; pooled safety data show tolerability comparable to placebo in asthma/allergic settings, but this does not imply antibacterial efficacy; taken together, there is no therapeutic rationale for montelukast monotherapy in a bacterial infection [^11174BfW] [^116dd2L7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about anti-inflammatory monotherapy in ABRS overall. Even systemic corticosteroids — far more potent anti-inflammatories — do not reliably improve clinical outcomes as standalone therapy in acute sinusitis, underscoring that anti-inflammatory drugs without antibiotics are not appropriate when bacterial disease is suspected; this strengthens the inference that montelukast monotherapy would be inappropriate in ABRS [^112U5ttG].

> Let me synthesize and conclude clearly. Montelukast is not appropriate as monotherapy for bacterial sinusitis; if clinical criteria support ABRS, treat per guidelines with appropriate antibiotics and symptomatic care, reserving fluoroquinolones for patients without alternatives, and use intranasal corticosteroids or saline as adjuncts for symptom relief; montelukast may be considered as an adjunct only in selected CRS phenotypes (e.g. AERD), not as a treatment for ABRS [^11552ayP] [^1156zny1] [^1137eKQB].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered whether any ABRS guideline might permit montelukast, but on review those references pertain to CRS and AERD adjunctive management; ABRS guidelines do not recommend leukotriene receptor antagonists and instead emphasize antibiotics when indicated plus supportive care, so montelukast monotherapy would be inappropriate for bacterial sinusitis [^114RCeCn] [^11552ayP] [^1137eKQB].

Montelukast should not be used as **monotherapy for bacterial sinusitis** because it lacks antibacterial activity [^112Ug5CU] and is not recommended by clinical guidelines [^11552ayP] [^114RCeCn]. Montelukast may be considered adjunctive therapy for patients with coexisting asthma, allergic rhinitis [^112Ug5CU], or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, but it should not replace antibiotics in confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial sinusitis [^11552ayP]. The **standard of care is antibiotic therapy**, with amoxicillin/clavulanate or amoxicillin as first-line agents [^11552ayP] [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological properties of montelukast

Montelukast is a selective leukotriene receptor antagonist [^111y8DdB] that blocks cysteinyl leukotriene receptors, reducing inflammation, bronchoconstriction, and mucus production. It is primarily indicated for asthma maintenance therapy, allergic rhinitis, and prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^111y8DdB] [^112Ug5CU]. Montelukast has **no direct antibacterial activity** [^112Ug5CU] and does not target the pathogens commonly responsible for bacterial sinusitis, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis [^116P9EVJ].

---

## Clinical evidence for montelukast in bacterial sinusitis

Currently, there is **no robust clinical evidence** supporting the use of montelukast as monotherapy for bacterial sinusitis [^11552ayP] [^112Ug5CU]. Major guidelines and expert consensus do not recommend montelukast as standalone therapy [^114RCeCn]. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) guidelines emphasize antibiotics as the primary treatment, with amoxicillin/clavulanate [^117MFZ89] or amoxicillin as first-line agents [^11552ayP]. However, montelukast may have a role as adjunctive therapy for patients with coexisting asthma, allergic rhinitis, or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), but it is **not recommended as a substitute for antibiotic therapy**.

---

## Comparison with standard antibiotic therapies

Antibiotic therapy remains the **cornerstone of bacterial sinusitis treatment** [^11552ayP]. Antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, levofloxacin [^115JAziY], and moxifloxacin [^1176j7xN] have demonstrated high clinical success rates (approximately 88–91%) [^11552ayP]. These antibiotics directly target the bacterial pathogens responsible for sinus infections, leading to symptom resolution and prevention of complications [^116P9EVJ]. In contrast, montelukast lacks antibacterial activity [^112Ug5CU] and has not demonstrated clinical efficacy comparable to antibiotics. Therefore, montelukast **cannot be considered an effective alternative** to antibiotic therapy [^114RCeCn].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Montelukast is generally well-tolerated [^116dd2L7], with common adverse effects including abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and fatigue [^11174BfW]. However, **serious neuropsychiatric adverse effects** — such as mood changes, anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation — have been reported, particularly in pediatric populations. The FDA has issued warnings about these potential adverse effects, emphasizing caution when prescribing montelukast, especially when alternative treatments are available.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Clinical guidelines consistently recommend antibiotic therapy as the primary treatment for bacterial sinusitis [^11552ayP]. Montelukast is **not recommended as monotherapy** by major guidelines or expert consensus statements [^114RCeCn]. The AAO-HNSF and AAFP guidelines emphasize antibiotic therapy and do not list montelukast as a standalone treatment option [^11552ayP].

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

Montelukast may be considered **adjunctive therapy** for selected patients, such as those with coexisting asthma, allergic rhinitis, or AERD [^112Ug5CU]. In these patients, montelukast may help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms related to underlying allergic or inflammatory conditions. However, in these scenarios, montelukast should not replace antibiotic therapy in confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial sinusitis [^11552ayP] [^1137eKQB].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Montelukast should not be used as **monotherapy for bacterial sinusitis** [^11552ayP]. It lacks antibacterial activity [^112Ug5CU] and has not demonstrated efficacy comparable to standard antibiotic therapies. Clinical guidelines consistently recommend antibiotic therapy as the primary treatment for bacterial sinusitis, reserving montelukast for adjunctive use in selected patients with coexisting inflammatory conditions.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute sinusitis [^112U5ttG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Acute sinusitis is the inflammation and swelling of the nasal and paranasal mucous membranes and is a common reason for patients to seek primary care consultations. The impairment of daily functioning and quality of life is largely due to symptoms such as facial pain and nasal congestion.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of systemic corticosteroids on clinical response rates and to determine adverse effects and relapse rates of systemic corticosteroids compared to placebo or standard clinical care in children and adults with acute sinusitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February week 1, 2014), and EMBASE (January 2009 to February 2014).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing systemic corticosteroids to placebo or standard clinical care for patients with acute sinusitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Five RCTs with a total of 1,193 adult participants met our inclusion criteria. We judged the methodological quality to be moderate in four trials and high in one trial. Acute sinusitis was defined clinically in all trials. However, the three trials performed in ear, nose, and throat (ENT) outpatient clinics also used radiological assessment as part of their inclusion criteria. All participants were assigned to either oral corticosteroids (prednisone 24 mg to 80 mg daily or betamethasone 1 mg daily) or the control treatment (placebo in four trials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in one trial).

### Clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetics of montelukast in dyspeptic children with duodenal eosinophilia [^112je6rY]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Montelukast, a competitive cysteinyl leukotriene-1 receptor antagonist, reduces airway eosinophilia in asthmatics. We evaluated the effect of this drug in children with eosinophilic duodenitis, defined histologically as duodenal mucosa with a peak eosinophil count of more than 10 eosinophils/high power field (hpf).

- **Methods**: Forty children and adolescents (6–18 years) with dyspepsia and duodenal eosinophilia were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of montelukast therapy. Subjects were randomized to receive either 10 mg montelukast or an identical placebo once daily and were evaluated on day 14 for symptomatic and biochemical responses. Subjects were also randomized to one of two blood sampling schemes to evaluate montelukast pharmacokinetics.

- **Results**: Using a post-treatment global pain assessment, a positive clinical response was observed in 62.1% of patients receiving montelukast compared with 32.4% on placebo (p < 0.02). Pain assessment scores deteriorated in 45% of montelukast responders (5/11) after crossover to placebo and improved in 62% (8/13) of placebo non-responders on crossover to montelukast. In patients with peak duodenal eosinophil counts between 20–29/hpf (n = 19), a positive pain assessment response was observed in 84% of patients receiving montelukast compared to 42% receiving placebo (p < 0.01). Response rate did not differ by age, gender, or histologic findings at baseline. Pharmacokinetic analysis yielded parameter estimates for absorption rate constant (Ka), apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F), and elimination rate constant.

### Levofloxacin [^115Gjq6e]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Because fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1–5.15)], and because ABS is self-limiting for some patients, reserve Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection for treatment of ABS in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

- **Usage**: To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empirical selection of therapy.

- **Culture and susceptibility testing**: Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment to isolate and identify organisms causing the infection and to determine their susceptibility to levofloxacin [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Therapy with Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection may be initiated before results of these tests are available.

### Microbiology of acute maxillary sinusitis in children [^111D9Pho]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract illnesses are common during childhood and require frequent medical care. Acute rhinosinusitis frequently occurs as a complication of acute viral upper respiratory infection. Children with acute rhinosinusitis constitute approximately 6.5% to 13% of the patients with upper respiratory tract illnesses, and some acute rhinosinusitis patients need medical care. Although acute rhinosinusitis is a common pediatric disease, its etiology remains unknown. A few studies have reported the presence of viral and bacterial pathogens through microbiological analysis of sinus aspirates obtained from children with acute sinusitis. However, no study has comprehensively assessed viral and bacterial pathogens through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using sinus aspirates obtained from children with acute sinusitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the microbiology of acute pediatric rhinosinusitis through molecular biological analysis.

### Microbial keratitis (bacterial, fungal) [^115FyBKX]. COP (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for bacterial keratitis, specifically with respect to topical antibiotics, the CO 2022 guidelines recommend offering empirical fluoroquinolone monotherapy. This involves using levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, administered hourly day and night for 48 hours, then every 2 hours daily for 72 hours, followed by every 4 hours for 7 days. This regimen is suggested for patients with small lesions (< 1 mm) in the absence of sight-threatening characteristics.

### Cefuroxime axetil [^112dp3N5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

An adequate and well-controlled trial was performed in subjects with acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis. Each subject had a maxillary sinus aspirate collected by sinus puncture before treatment initiation for presumptive acute bacterial sinusitis. All subjects showed radiographic and clinical evidence of acute maxillary sinusitis. The clinical effectiveness of cefuroxime axetil in treating acute maxillary sinusitis was comparable to an oral antimicrobial agent containing a specific β-lactamase inhibitor.

However, microbiology data demonstrated cefuroxime axetil's effectiveness was limited to treating acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or non-β-lactamase–producing Haemophilus influenzae. Insufficient numbers of β-lactamase–producing Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were obtained in this trial to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of cefuroxime axetil for these organisms.

This trial randomized 317 adult subjects, 132 subjects in the U.S. and 185 subjects in South America.

- **Intent-to-treat analysis results**: In this trial and in a supporting maxillary puncture trial, 15 evaluable subjects had non-β-lactamase–producing Haemophilus influenzae as the identified pathogen. Of these, 67% (10/15) had this pathogen eradicated. Eighteen evaluable subjects had Streptococcus pneumoniae as the identified pathogen. Of these, 83% (15/18) had this pathogen eradicated.

### Microbiology of acute maxillary sinusitis in children [^116XX6ct]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

Few studies have performed bacteriological analyses of sinus aspirates from pediatric acute sinusitis patients. Maxillary sinus bacteriology was only performed by Wald et al, and there have been no reports of bacteriology with combined bacterial culture and molecular methods. In 1981, Wald et al. reported the bacterial composition of sinus aspirates in 30 children (47 sinuses) aged 1 to 16 years, wherein bacterial growth occurred in 34 of 47 sinus aspirate samples (72%), including S. pneumoniae in 17 (36%), H. influenzae in 11 (23%), and M. catarrhalis in 9 (19%).

In this study, bacterial cultures revealed at least one bacterium in 21 of 31 (68%) patients, including H. influenzae in 13 of 31 (42%) and S. pneumoniae in 6 of 31 (19%) patients. The total detection rate through bacterial culture was 68%, similar to that reported previously (68–72%). The detection rate of S. pneumoniae was less than previously reported due to the effectiveness of the PCV and prior antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment, especially amoxicillin, is effective for S. pneumoniae, while H. influenzae is frequently resistant to amoxicillin. PCV and antibiotic pretreatment did not influence the microbiology in acute sinusitis. PCV decreases pneumococcal infection, but the S. pneumoniae recently detected in pediatric respiratory infections are often non-serotypes. In Japan, non-PCV serotypes were detected in 71% of pediatric pneumococcal infections in 2014. We speculate that the herd immunity of PCV may suppress pneumococcal infections in unvaccinated groups.

### BTS/NICE/SIGN joint guideline on asthma: Diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (November 2024) - Summary of recommendations [^116MyCxN]. Thorax (2025). High credibility.

This section defines terms that have been used in a particular way for this guideline.

- **Air therapy**: Anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy is a treatment with a reliever inhaler that contains a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and formoterol. When this is used in response to symptoms without regular maintenance therapy, it is called as-needed AIR therapy. In November 2024, the only product licensed for as-needed AIR therapy contained budesonide/formoterol.

- **Asthma control**: Complete control of asthma is defined as no daytime symptoms, no night-time awakening due to asthma, no asthma attacks, no need for rescue medication, no limitations on activity including exercise, normal lung function (in practical terms forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV₁] and/or peak expiratory flow [PEF] more than 80% predicted or best), and minimal side effects from treatment.

- **Atopic disorder**: Atopic disorders are allergic conditions including allergic rhinitis (hay fever), atopic dermatitis (eczema), allergic asthma, and other specific and non-specific allergic conditions such as food allergies.

- **Bronchial challenge test**: A test to measure airway responsiveness (bronchial responsiveness). It is performed by giving small increments of a bronchoconstrictor (most commonly methacholine) and measuring the FEV₁ after each dose until it falls by a predetermined amount (usually 20% from baseline).

- **Bronchial hyperresponsiveness**: A measure of how easily bronchospasm can be induced in the airways. It is measured using a bronchial challenge test.

### Tezepelumab treatment in severe asthma with recurrent chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps: Case series [^115z9R5P]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 6 years ago; he underwent surgery 4 years ago. He is an ex-smoker, having smoked 0.75 packs per day from age 20 to age 57. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed bronchial wall thickness without a low-attenuation area, which is indicative of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was diagnosed with asthma 3 years ago, and his CRSwNP relapsed concurrently. He experienced exertional dyspnea, continuous nasal congestion, and loss of smell. Asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment occurred twice per year. Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated respiratory disease were not observed.

He was referred to our hospital for poorly controlled severe asthma and CRSwNP. He received a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) (fluticasone propionate/formoterol, 1000/40 μg per day) and a leukotriene receptor antagonist (montelukast, 10 mg per day) for 2 years and 3 months. However, his symptoms persisted and exacerbations continued. Subcutaneous tezepelumab (210 mg every 4 weeks) was initiated in April 2023.

Before tezepelumab administration, his Asthma Control Test (ACT) score was 18 and his Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) score was 53. His total serum IgE level was 483 IU/mL (normal range: 0–148 IU/mL). His Multiple Allergen Simultaneous Test result, classified into 7 levels (0–6) based on specific IgE concentration, indicated Dermatophagoides farina as class 2 and house dust as class 1. Despite receiving a high-dose ICS and LABA, his inflammatory markers included high levels.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): Adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include the addition of a consumer to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and three new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy. This includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should distin…

### Short-course versus long-course oral antibiotic treatment for infections treated in outpatient settings: A review of systematic reviews [^114hfBiD]. Family Practice (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence comparing the effectiveness of short and long courses of oral antibiotics for infections treated in outpatient settings.

- **Methods**: We identified systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials for children and adults with bacterial infections treated in outpatient settings from multiple databases, including Medline, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Database of Review of Effects. Data were extracted on the primary outcome of clinical resolution and secondary outcomes.

- **Results**: We identified 30 potential reviews, and included 9. There was no significant difference in the clinical cure rates for children treated with short or long course antibiotics for various conditions, such as Group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis (OR 1.03, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.11), community-acquired pneumonia (RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.01), acute otitis media [< 2 years old OR: 1.09 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.57); ≥ 2 years old OR: 0.85 (95% CI: 0.60, 1.21)], or urinary tract infection (RR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.64, 1.76). Similarly, for adults, there was no significant difference in clinical cure for conditions like acute bacterial sinusitis (RR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.81, 1.21), uncomplicated cystitis in non-pregnant women (RR 1.10, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.25) or elderly women (RR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.62, 1.54), acute pyelonephritis (RR 1.03, 95% CI: 0.80, 1.32), or community-acquired pneumonia (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.74, 1.26). We found inadequate evidence about the effect on antibiotic resistance.

- **Conclusions**: This overview of systematic reviews has identified good quality evidence that short-course antibiotics are as effective as longer courses for the treatment of outpatients.

### Clinical safety and tolerability of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, in controlled clinical trials in patients aged ≥ 6 years [^116dd2L7]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2001). High credibility.

Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist administered orally once daily for the treatment of chronic asthma in adults and children. A comprehensive analysis of safety data from double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials with montelukast had not been previously reported.

A pooled analysis of safety data from 11 multicenter, randomized, controlled montelukast Phase IIb and III trials and five long-term extension studies was performed. A total of 3,386 adult patients (aged 15–85 years) and 336 pediatric patients (aged 6–14 years) were enrolled in the trials; 2,031 adults received montelukast for up to 4.1 years, and 257 children received montelukast for up to 1.8 years. Summary statistics comparing incidences of adverse events among treatment groups were calculated.

The overall incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events among montelukast-treated patients, both adult and pediatric, was similar to that among patients receiving placebo. There were no clinically relevant differences in individual adverse events, including infectious upper respiratory conditions and transaminase elevations, between montelukast and placebo groups. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred with similar frequencies during placebo, montelukast, and inhaled beclomethasone therapy. No dose-related adverse effects of montelukast were observed in adults treated with dosages as high as 200 mg per day (20 times the recommended dose) for 5 months. This tolerability profile of montelukast observed in clinical trials has been generally reflected.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride [^1176j7xN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a controlled, double-blind study conducted in the US, moxifloxacin tablets (400 mg once daily for ten days) were compared with cefuroxime axetil (250 mg twice daily for ten days) for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. The trial included 457 patients valid for the efficacy analysis. Clinical success (cure plus improvement) at the 7 to 21-day post-therapy test-of-cure visit was 90% for moxifloxacin and 89% for cefuroxime.

An additional non-comparative study was conducted to gather bacteriological data and to evaluate microbiological eradication in adult patients treated with moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily for seven days). All patients (n = 336) underwent antral puncture in this study. Clinical success rates and eradication/presumed eradication rates at the 21 to 37-day follow-up visit were 97% (29 out of 30) for *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, 83% (15 out of 18) for *Moraxella catarrhalis*, and 80% (24 out of 30) for *Haemophilus influenzae*.

- **Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis**: Moxifloxacin tablets (400 mg once daily for five days) were evaluated for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis in a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the U.S. This study compared moxifloxacin with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily for ten days) and enrolled 629 patients. Clinical success was assessed at 7 to 17 days post-therapy. The clinical success for moxifloxacin was 89% (222/250) compared to 89% (224/251) for clarithromycin.

### Concomitant bilastine and montelukast as additive therapy for seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and mild-to-moderate asthma. The SKY study [^111UwLm8]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

We compared, for the first time, the efficacy and safety of the concomitant administration of bilastine with montelukast versus respective monotherapies in a large population of patients with seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (SARC) and asthma. Contrary to our original hypothesis, the concomitant administration of bilastine with montelukast was only as effective as either agent alone in the treatment of SARC symptoms. The reasons for not showing any additive effects of bilastine plus montelukast, compared with each agent alone, could likely be related to the overall mild intensity of SARC symptoms at baseline, which might have reduced the room for improvement and thus limited the probability of detecting differences between treatments. The absolute extent of the effect of treatments on symptoms or on the use of rescue medications is impossible to gauge, as a placebo arm was not included. Noteworthy, the improvement in total symptom score (TSS) values observed in our study was evident.

- **Results**:
	- The mean (SD) total symptom score (TSS) and asthma quality of life questionnaire (AQLQ) values were assessed in patients treated with bilastine plus montelukast and in those treated with either bilastine or montelukast alone. Estimated (SEM) changes in TSS and AQLQ from the corresponding baseline values were observed after each week of treatment with bilastine, montelukast, or their combination.

- **Statistical findings**:
	- B, baseline; *, P < 0.05 comparing TSS values in bilastine versus montelukast after 1 week of treatment; #, P < 0.001 comparing TSS values observed 4 weeks after treatment with bilastine plus montelukast, bilastine, or montelukast alone versus corresponding baseline values.

### Microbiology of acute maxillary sinusitis in children [^114oMv1G]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

In this study, at least one microorganism was detected in 30 of 31 (97%) patients using viral and bacterial PCR. In 10 (32%) patients, one respiratory virus was detected, and more than one virus was not detected in any patient. Among these detected viruses, rhinovirus (13%) was the most common, followed by the influenza virus type A/B (10%), consistent with the findings of Marom et al, that rhinovirus was most commonly detected, followed by the influenza virus, in viral PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs of children with acute rhinosinusitis. These data concur with our results, even though Marom et al. obtained their samples from nasopharyngeal swabs and not from sinus aspirates. In this study, all samples contained both respiratory viruses and bacteria, and none of them contained only respiratory viruses.

It remains unclear whether viral sinusitis is predominant in adults or children. Several studies have reported the occurrence of viral pathogens in adult acute sinusitis. Pitkäranta et al. reported the presence of rhinovirus or coronavirus in the sinus aspirates of 8 of 20 (40%) adult sinusitis patients. Puhakka et al. reported viral infections in 81.6% of nasopharyngeal aspirates (not sinus aspirates) of the young adult patients with sinusitis studied. They believed that early-stage acute sinusitis has a viral etiology, but to our knowledge, no studies have reported viral pathogens in acute pediatric sinusitis. The present results show that severe sinusitis in children results from bacterial infections or viral and bacterial co-infections. However, the patients investigated in this study…

### Singulair [^111y8DdB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors, as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD₄ in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD₄-induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n = 12), Singulair inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively.

The effect of Singulair on eosinophils in peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received Singulair, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received Singulair, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients, over the double-blind treatment periods. This reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of Singulair. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Clinical implications of the immunomodulatory effects of macrolides on sinusitis [^116Ea3Z4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This article reviews the treatment of chronic sinusitis with macrolides. Chronic sinusitis is often the result of bacterial infections that lead to chronic inflammation with thickening of the sinus mucosa and hypersecretion of mucus. In addition to their anti-infective properties, some macrolides possess immunomodulatory effects. These macrolides have been used successfully to treat diffuse panbronchiolitis, a progressive inflammatory lung disease, and may also be useful for the treatment of asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic sinusitis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis.

The clinical benefits of macrolides in patients with chronic sinusitis include decreased nasal secretions and postnasal drip, with improvement in nasal obstruction. In vivo and in vitro studies show that some macrolides affect neutrophil chemotaxis and infiltration, inflammatory cytokine production, mucus production, and the transportability of airway secretions. These findings indicate that macrolides are promising agents for treating chronic inflammation of the airways.

### Bacterium detected by gram stain and drug sensitivity in Chinese children with acute sinusitis [^116cD9h9]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is one of the most common infections of the upper respiratory tract in both children and adults. It is reported that 5–10% of children with upper respiratory tract infections are complicated with acute sinusitis, and 6–13% of children are diagnosed with sinusitis by the age of 3. Although pediatric ARS is common in outpatient clinics in China, there is a lack of relevant data on its epidemiology and economic burden. Both the mucosa of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses are involved in most ARS cases. Viruses and pathogenic bacteria are often found in the nasal secretion of ARS patients. Generally, most ARS cases are caused by viruses and are aggravated by bacterial coinfection or secondary infection.

Sinus puncture culture was previously believed to be the most accurate method for diagnosing ARS. However, recent meta-analysis found that endoscopic guided middle meatus samples may be more sensitive and less invasive compared with sinus puncture. Therefore, for this study, the samples were collected from the middle meatus with the help of endoscopy.

In pediatric ARS, it was discovered that respiratory bacteria were present in 65% of the sinus secretions, while both bacterial and viral agents were present in 32% of the secretions. Rhinovirus and influenza virus are the most prevalent viruses, while *Haemophilus influenzae* and *Streptococcus pneumoniae* rank first among bacterial species. However, the microbial composition contributing to ARS is not static. For example, the popularization of vaccines in children can lead to changes in the frequency and bacteriology.

### Ivabradine use in premature infants with accelerated idioventricular rhythm [^116TWWxd]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

Accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR) is a rare ventricular tachyarrhythmia observed in neonates. Although AIVR is generally benign and self-limiting, it can occasionally lead to significant hemodynamic instability, necessitating intervention, especially in vulnerable premature infants and those with congenital heart disease. Traditional antiarrhythmic drugs, including beta-blockers, amiodarone, and sotalol, have been used to manage AIVR with variable success. However, their use can be complicated by side effects such as hypotension and bradycardia.

Ivabradine is a selective inhibitor of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which decreases automaticity in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes without affecting myocardial contractility or causing significant hypotension. Ivabradine has been successfully used to treat inappropriate sinus tachycardia and sinus tachycardia associated with heart failure in children and adults. Recently, it has been utilized to treat other pediatric tachyarrhythmias with an enhanced automaticity mechanism, such as junctional ectopic tachycardia and focal atrial tachycardia.

In this report, we describe two premature infants with AIVR who were successfully treated with ivabradine as monotherapy after other antiarrhythmic agents had failed. These cases demonstrate ivabradine's potential to treat ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the premature neonatal patient population.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral montelukast in acute asthma exacerbation [^116RmnpS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Our study suggests that there is no added benefit of using montelukast along with the standard therapy for the management of acute asthma exacerbation in the hospitalized adult population. We recommend that larger-scale, multicenter trials would better help to evaluate the role of cysteinyl leukotriene antagonists in treating acute exacerbations of asthma.

### The effect of montelukast sodium on the duration of effusion of otitis media [^111WQtnt]. Clinical Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

This study tests the hypothesis that montelukast sodium, a selective leukotriene receptor antagonist, will decrease the duration of the effusion of otitis media. Tympanometry and spectral gradient acoustic reflectometry were used to confirm the effusion of otitis media in patients between 2 and 12 years of age. Patients were treated with amoxicillin for 10 days and montelukast sodium or placebo for 30 days in a randomized, double-blind manner. Sixty patients completed the study: 31 received placebo and 29 received montelukast sodium. At a 4-week follow-up visit, 5 ears (16%) were free of effusion in the placebo group and 17 (58%) in the montelukast sodium group. The difference was significant. The efficacy of montelukast sodium in clearing the effusion was 49%.

### Dupixent [^115ED7KR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies (SINUS-24 (NCT02912468) and SINUS-52 (NCT02898454)) involving 724 adult subjects 18 years of age and older on background intranasal corticosteroids (INCS). These studies included subjects with CRSwNP despite prior sino-nasal surgery or treatment with systemic corticosteroids, or those who were ineligible to receive or were intolerant to systemic corticosteroids in the past 2 years. Subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps were not included in these trials. Rescue with systemic corticosteroids or surgery was allowed during the studies at the investigator's discretion.

In SINUS-24, a total of 276 subjects were randomized to receive either 300 mg Dupixent (N = 143) or placebo (N = 133) every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. In SINUS-52, 448 subjects were randomized to receive either 300 mg Dupixent (N = 150) every 2 weeks for 52 weeks, 300 mg Dupixent (N = 145) every 2 weeks until week 24 followed by 300 mg Dupixent every 4 weeks until week 52, or a placebo (N = 153). All subjects had evidence of sinus opacification on the Lund Mackay (LMK) sinus CT scan, and 73% to 90% of subjects had opacification of all sinuses. Subjects were stratified based on their histories of prior surgery and co-morbid asthma/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated respiratory disease (NSAID-ERD).

A total of 63% of subjects reported previous surgeries.

### Singulair [^1112nhqJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors, as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD₄ in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD₄-induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n = 12), Singulair inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively.

The effect of Singulair on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received Singulair, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted compared with placebo over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received Singulair, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients over the double-blind treatment periods. This reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of Singulair. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known.

There have been no clinical trials in asthmatics to evaluate the relative efficacy of morning versus evening dosing. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar whether dosed in the morning or evening. Efficacy has been demonstrated for asthma when montelukast was administered in the evening without regard to time of administration.

### Acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis [^112jaiYY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis are two of the most common indications for antimicrobial agents in children. Together, they are responsible for billions of dollars of health care expenditures. The pathogenesis of both conditions is identical. In the majority of children with each condition, a preceding viral upper respiratory tract infection predisposes them to the development of the acute bacterial complication. It has been shown that viral upper respiratory tract infection predisposes to the development of acute otitis media in 37% of cases.

Currently, precise microbiologic diagnosis of acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis requires performance of tympanocentesis in the former and sinus aspiration in the latter. The identification of a virus from the nasopharynx in either case does not obviate the need for antimicrobial therapy. Furthermore, nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs are not useful in predicting the results of culture of the middle ear or paranasal sinus. However, it is possible that a combination of information regarding nasopharyngeal colonization with bacteria and infection with specific viruses may inform treatment decisions in the future.

### Management update of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and the use of cefdinir [^113acDkg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis, bacteriology, diagnosis, and antimicrobial treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) are reviewed. Most cases of ABRS arise as complications of rhinosinusitis resulting from colds and other acute viral respiratory infections. Nose blowing during colds may be a risk factor for ABRS by propelling bacteria-laden nasal fluid into the sinus cavity. The bacterial causes of ABRS include S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, other streptococcal species, M. catarrhalis, anaerobes, and S. aureus.

Clinical diagnosis of ABRS is based on a history of a cold or influenza-like illness that does not improve or worsens after seven days. A 10-day course of treatment with an antimicrobial effective against resistant S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae is recommended. A clinical trial reviewed the effectiveness of cefdinir in treating ABRS.

### AugmentinXR [^117MFZ89]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Augmentin XR extended release tablets are indicated for the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia or acute bacterial sinusitis due to confirmed or suspected β-lactamase-producing pathogens (i.e. H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, H. parainfluenzae, K. pneumoniae, or methicillin-susceptible S. aureus) and S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (i.e. penicillin MICs = 2 mcg/mL). Augmentin XR is not indicated for the treatment of infections due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL. Data are limited with regard to infections due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL [see Clinical Studies].

Of the common epidemiological risk factors for patients with resistant pneumococcal infections, only age > 65 years was studied. Patients with other common risk factors for resistant pneumococcal infections (e.g. alcoholism, immune-suppressive illness, and presence of multiple co-morbid conditions) were not studied.

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia in whom penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae is suspected, bacteriological studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility when Augmentin XR is prescribed.

Acute bacterial sinusitis or community-acquired pneumonia due to a penicillin-susceptible strain of S. pneumoniae plus a β-lactamase-producing pathogen can be treated with another Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium) product containing lower daily doses of amoxicillin (i.e. 500 mg every 8 hours or 875 mg every 12 hours).

### Treatment options for chronic rhinosinusitis [^112Dt9y7]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as persistent symptomatic inflammation of the nasal and sinus mucosa. Although insights into the pathophysiology of CRS have largely expanded over the last two decades, the exact etiology remains unknown and is likely due to multiple host and environmental factors. Treatments are aimed at reducing mucosal inflammation, controlling infection, and restoring mucociliary clearance within the sinuses. The principal goal of this article is to outline a rational approach to the treatment of chronic sinus disease based on currently available diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. Emphasis will be placed on the management, therapeutic response, and objective evaluation of therapeutic efficiency.

- **Pelvic floor re-education**: Pelvic floor re-education can help patients increase awareness and control of their pelvic floor muscles.

- **Local pelvic floor relaxation**: Techniques aimed at reducing tension in the pelvic floor muscles.

- **Biofeedback**: Use of electronic monitoring to improve control over pelvic muscle tension.

- **General relaxation**: Activities or techniques to promote overall relaxation in the patient.

- **Deep relaxation/mindfulness**: Methods that focus on reducing stress and promoting mental well-being.

- **Trigger point release**: Techniques aimed at identifying and releasing tight areas within muscles.

- **Myofascial release**: A therapy technique focused on releasing tension in the fascial tissues.

- **Stretches and exercise for pain management**: Tailored exercises to alleviate pain and improve function.

- **Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)**: Use of electrical impulses to relieve pain.

- **Acupuncture for trigger point release and pain management**: Utilizing traditional Chinese medicine techniques to relieve pain and tension.

- **Bladder retraining**: Techniques aimed at improving bladder control and reducing symptoms associated with prostatitis.

### Maxillary sinus puncture and culture in the diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis: the case for pursuing alternative culture methods [^115ruEEn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Traditional assessments of the microbial flora associated with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis have relied on maxillary sinus punctures (taps) and culture. These taps are now considered the gold standard for obtaining cultures and are used as the method of identifying bacterial pathogens in antimicrobial trials. Maxillary sinus taps are limited by discomfort to the patients and technical concerns. Because of these factors, the standard of performing taps has limited antibiotic trials and microbial surveillance. Alternatives to maxillary sinus taps have been explored.

- **Study design**: We conducted a retrospective, systematic review of the literature from 1950 to 2000 of articles comparing culture techniques in the nose and paranasal sinuses for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

- **Results**: Nasal cultures have poor correlation to maxillary sinus cultures, whereas there is 60% to 85% concordance between endoscopically guided middle meatal cultures and maxillary sinus cultures. These studies, however, are all limited by small sample sizes and therefore are inadequate to make any concrete recommendations regarding the relative role of endoscopically guided middle meatal cultures as a formal method of pathogen identification in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

- **Conclusion**: A formal prospective study with sufficient sample size to assess the concordance between the microbial flora of the maxillary sinus punctures and middle meatal cultures in acute rhinosinusitis is recommended.

### Lack of long-term add-on effect by montelukast in postoperative chronic rhinosinusitis patients with nasal polyps [^115QaXzg]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Eosinophils and mast cells are among the key cells in inflammatory diseases like chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and asthma. Leukotriene antagonists have proven to be effective in the treatment of asthma, but data about their efficacy in CRS are scarce, whereas data on montelukast as an add-on treatment to intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) in a postoperative setting are completely lacking.

- **Study design**: Prospective, randomized, open-label trial.

- **Methods**: In this trial with long-term follow-up, we evaluated the efficacy of montelukast as an add-on treatment to INCS in postoperative CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) patients. CRSwNP patients (N = 72) undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery were randomized into two arms for the postoperative treatment. One group (N = 36) received INCS in monotherapy, whereas the other group (N = 36) received INCS in association with montelukast for 1 year. The efficacy of montelukast with INCS was evaluated by assessing both subjective (total five-symptom score [T5SS]) and objective (nasal polyp score [NPS], Lund-Mackay [LMK] score, and subjective olfactometry [Barcelona Smell Test 24]) outcome parameters and compared with the gold standard of INCS in monotherapy.

- **Results**: After 1 year of surgery, T5SS, NPS, and LMK score were significantly reduced in patients treated with either INCS or INCS plus montelukast, without significant differences between the two treatment arms. Improvement of smell loss by olfactometry was also observed, with no differences between arms. Similar findings were observed at 3 and 6 months.

### Montelukast-associated Churg-Strauss syndrome [^117Wmtow]. Age and Ageing (2003). Low credibility.

A 68-year-old asthmatic presented markedly unwell with arthralgia, mononeuritis multiplex, peripheral neuropathy, and eosinophilia. His past medical history included perennial rhinitis and nasal polyps. Three months prior to admission, his prednisolone was stopped, and Montelukast was started. The diagnosis of Montelukast-associated Churg-Strauss syndrome was made. The drug was stopped, and steroids were started, which led to general improvement and reduction of eosinophilia; however, the neurological deficit persisted.

### Intranasal corticosteroid use is associated with lower rates of bacterial recovery in chronic rhinosinusitis [^115xuCA4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to determine whether the use of a topical intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) preoperatively had an effect on the bacterial recovery rate and flora recovered at endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS).

- **Study design and setting**: A prospective, multicenter, observational study was conducted in academic-based rhinology practices. Consecutive, unselected patients undergoing ESS had protected sinus cultures done at the time of ESS.

- **Results**: A total of 157 patients were assessed. The overall growth rate was 45.5%. INCS users had a positive culture rate of 35.4% compared to 61.7% in nonusers (P = 0.0001). This effect was most pronounced in the subgroup undergoing revision surgeries (bacterial recovery rate with INCS: 40.0%, no INCS: 82.6%, P = 0.001) and was most marked for S. aureus (INCS: 12.5%, no INCS: 40.0%, P = 0.04) and CNS (INCS: 12.5%, no INCS: 30.4%, P = 0.05). While the rate of nasal polyposis was higher in both revision and the INCS-treated groups, the rate of bacterial recovery was not influenced by a diagnosis of nasal polyposis.

- **Conclusion**: INCS use preoperatively is associated with a lesser rate of bacterial recovery at the time of ESS, especially in individuals with previous ESS.

- **Significance**: The results suggest a possible role of INCS in the management of post-ESS disease.

### Sinuva [^1162dp2k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Encourage patients to use saline irrigations or sprays regularly. Advise the patient that the implant is bioabsorbable and intended to soften over time. As the implant softens and polyps decrease, the implant may be expelled out of the nose on its own or with actions such as sneezing or forceful nose blowing.

Advise the patient to call a healthcare professional immediately if they experience any of the following: excessive nasal bleeding or symptoms of infection, such as excessive pain or discomfort, persistent headache, or increased sinus discharge. Additionally, symptoms suggesting the implant has migrated posteriorly, such as irritation or a choking sensation in the back of the throat or swallowing the implant, should prompt immediate medical attention.

- **Risks relating to the insertion and removal procedure**: Inform patients that there are risks associated with the insertion and removal of the Sinuva Sinus Implant. These risks are similar to those associated with other endoscopic sinus procedures.

- **Local nasal adverse reactions**: Patients should be informed that treatment with the Sinuva Sinus Implant may be associated with local adverse reactions such as nosebleeds (epistaxis), injury to nerves or blood vessels of the middle turbinate or septum, and bacterial or Candida infection. Because of the potential inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal septum ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use a nasal corticosteroid until healing has occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6)].

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Patients should be aware of potential hypersensitivity reactions and be advised to contact their healthcare provider if such reactions occur.

### Zithromax [^113ruKzV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below. Recommended dosages and durations of therapy in adult and pediatric patient populations vary in these indications [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

- **Adult patients**
- Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Moraxella catarrhalis*, or *Streptococcus pneumoniae*.
- Acute bacterial sinusitis due to *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Moraxella catarrhalis*, or *Streptococcus pneumoniae*.
- Community-acquired pneumonia due to *Chlamydophila pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, or *Streptococcus pneumoniae* in patients appropriate for oral therapy.
- Pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes* as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy.

### Effects of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor on nasal and sinus symptoms in children with cystic fibrosis [^114pC38L]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). High credibility.

In addition to the significant functional impact, some studies suggest that chronic nasal sinus involvement may contribute to the development of a bacterial reservoir, which may subsequently be responsible for pulmonary bacterial colonization and thus partly for the poor prognosis of the disease. In adults, two studies have also shown a reduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa carriage in the sinuses under ETI therapy, although this pathogen was not eradicated from the respiratory tract. Our study shows a trend toward reduction in the number of infections requiring systemic antibiotics. Therefore, we can hope for both a reduction in bacterial carriage and a decrease in antibiotic resistance. However, further studies with prolonged follow-up will be necessary to assess the long-term impact of ETI therapy on the bacterial reservoir in the sinuses and on the resistance profile of various bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The objective improvement observed during the study was associated with a reduction in the treatments, including fewer antibiotic courses and lighter local treatments. Therefore, if improvement continues, it seems reasonable to consider a reduction in specialized follow-ups, which could eventually reduce the number of day hospital visits, decrease school absenteeism, lessen the socioeconomic impact on parents, and thus become a significant public health financial issue.

### Clinical implications of microbial biofilms in chronic rhinosinusitis and orbital cellulitis [^1144g4UM]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

In view of the aforementioned observations relating to biofilm and microbial virulence in various systemic infections, we tried to explore similar occurrences in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and orbital cellulitis. It is justifiable to study these two disease entities together as they are clinically interrelated, especially regarding the pathogenesis of the latter condition, which often develops as a complication of the former, frequently ethmoidal sinusitis.

Cryer et al. first suggested the presence of biofilms on the sinus mucosa of CRS patients. This short study involved 16 CRS patients who had failed to respond to both surgical and medical treatments. The researchers utilized scanning electron microscopy to analyze the specimens of sinus mucosa. In their experiments, they found four specimens with a thicker coating than what is found in a normal muco-ciliary blanket. Further studies on the pathogenesis of various bacterial infections suggested that bacteria could adhere to solid surfaces and form a slimy, slippery coat. These so-called bacterial biofilms were prevalent on most wet surfaces, and bacterial cells embedded inside biofilms were resistant to antimicrobial agents and the host immune defense mechanism.

Ferguson and Stolz demonstrated the presence of bacterial biofilms in two of four patients with CRS. Using both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Sanclement et al. noted a prevalence of biofilms in 80% of the mucosal biopsies of CRS patients. Further electron microscopic research revealed the presence of biofilms in silast.

### Montelukast as an adjunct to oral and inhaled steroid therapy in chronic nasal polyposis [^117NaXiV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). High credibility.

To examine the potential of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, as an adjunct to oral and inhaled steroid in subjects with chronic nasal polyps, a prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted.

- **Subjects and methods**: Thirty-eight consecutive adult patients with bilateral nasal polyps were randomized into two groups. Eighteen subjects were treated with oral prednisolone for 14 days and budesonide nasal spray for 8 weeks. Twenty subjects received similar treatment with additional oral montelukast for 8 weeks. Subjects completed a modified nasal ICSD symptom score at 8 and 12 weeks after beginning treatment and the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire at 12 weeks.

- **Results**: Symptom scores improved in both groups after treatment. Subjects treated with montelukast reported significantly less headache (P = 0.013), facial pain (P = 0.048), and sneezing (P = 0.03) than controls. Four weeks after completing treatment, no significant differences were recorded.

- **Conclusion**: Montelukast therapy may have clinical benefit as an adjunct to oral and inhaled steroid in chronic nasal polyposis, but effects are not maintained after cessation of treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline: Adult sinusitis update [^1156zny1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, more specifically with respect to symptomatic treatment, AAO-HNSF 2025 guidelines recommend considering offering analgesics, topical intranasal corticosteroids, and/or intranasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief in patients with acute bacterial or viral rhinosinusitis.

### Systemic side effects of eye drops: A pharmacokinetic perspective [^1168VaHE]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

The following sheds light on the possible adverse systemic side effects for some drug classes that are frequently prescribed.

- **Antibiotics**: Bacterial inflammations of the eye are much less common than other causes of inflammation but, when present, can result in more serious diseases. Most ocular bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics, which may also cause systemic reactions. Some antibiotics have a wide therapeutic range; therefore, it is possible to administer these compounds systemically at high doses, and thus they are used for treating the posterior regions of the eye, which are normally difficult to access. Dermatological side effects, such as skin irritation, itching, or rashes, may be triggered by topical medications, e.g. sulfonamide and sulfacetamide. It is also possible that fluoroquinolone can affect taste. Discontinuation of therapy is usually not necessary, but patients should be informed and warned about these probable side effects before starting or continuing treatment. The most popular aminoglycosides in use are tobramycin and gentamicin, often used in combination with a corticosteroid and have a wide spectrum of activity against bacteria, as well as neomycin, which is less frequently used. Local intolerances have been reported after the application of the aminoglycoside antibiotic neomycin, such as the contact allergic reactions previously described.

- **Corticosteroids**: Ophthalmic steroids are therapeutically used for allergic or noninfectious conjunctivitis, to inhibit inflammation following cataract surgery.

### The use of montelukast for pruritus in neurofibromatosis 1 [^111Zv1yA]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

NF1 encodes the protein neurofibromin, which regulates p21ras activation and its downstream effects. Attempts to target p21ras itself have been challenging; therefore, therapy approaches focus on targeting the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) that activate p21ras. Sunitinib is a highly selective RTK inhibitor with activity against c-kit, PDGFR, FGFR, RET, and VEGFR, all pathways that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both pheochromocytomas and neurofibromas. Much of the literature at the time of writing has studied the effect of sunitinib on pheochromocytomas and plexiform neurofibromas, which have malignant potential. Nevertheless, cutaneous neurofibroma formation arises from similar biochemical pathways as pheochromocytomas and plexiform neurofibromas and is therefore also affected by therapy with sunitinib. Considering that many patients with plexiform neurofibromas or NF1-associated pheochromocytomas also have cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas, the effect of sunitinib on all types of neurofibromas is worth evaluating. In this case, the patient was treated with sunitinib for her pheochromocytoma and concomitantly experienced reduction in the size of her cutaneous neurofibromas.

In addition to the reduction in size of her neurofibromas with sunitinib therapy, the patient also experienced significant pruritus of her neurofibromas. Though adverse skin reactions occur in approximately 90% of cases treated with angiogenic inhibitors, pruritus is not a commonly reported side effect of sunitinib. Pruritus has been reported in studies of sorafenib and imatinib.

### Prevalence of pus in radiologically diseased sinuses in patients undergoing surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis [^111SHCj1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

To establish the prevalence of pus in radiologically diseased sinuses in patients undergoing sinus surgery and to correlate this with the bacterial load in the sinuses, a prospective study was performed. This study included adult patients diagnosed with chronic sinusitis who were undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery at an Adelaide group of academic hospitals.

In this study, 45 consecutive and unselected patients had a surgically opened radiologically diseased sinus. A specially designed suction aspirator was placed into the sinus under endoscopic control. These aspirates were Gram stained and cultured to quantify the polymorphonuclear neutrophil count, bacterial flora, and bacterial colony count. The CT scans of all patients were graded using the Lund-Mackay scoring system.

A variety of bacteria, most commonly staphylococci, were cultured from a radiologically diseased sinus in 88% of patients. There was no correlation between the bacterial colony count and the presence of pus, and only 11% of patients had microscopic evidence of inflammation in sinus aspirates. There was no correlation between the Lund-Mackay CT score and the presence of pus in the sinus.

The study concluded that the majority of patients undergoing surgery for chronic sinusitis did not have a purulent exudate, and there was no correlation with the bacterial load. The usefulness of antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis, in the absence of macroscopic pus, is questionable.

### Medical management strategies in acute and chronic rhinosinusitis [^116hidHG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis, historically, has been considered to be caused by upper airway anatomical abnormalities. However, today that concept has changed, as it is now recognized as an inflammatory disorder of the nasal and sinus mucosa. Acute rhinosinusitis is usually caused by a viral infection, whereas chronic rhinosinusitis is a persistent and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder with increased expression of type 1, 2, or 17 cytokines in the nasal and sinus mucosa, similar to what occurs in asthma. Exacerbations are triggered by aeroallergens in allergic individuals and by irritants, pollutants, and viral or bacterial infections in all subjects.

It may be categorized by phenotypes, such as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps. Defined endotypes are based on underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Knowledge of chronic rhinosinusitis endotypes helps optimize management by employing targeted medical therapies. Understanding that rhinosinusitis is a heterogeneous inflammatory disease has led to the identification of various predisposing conditions, new medical treatment options, and the concept that rhinosinusitis is primarily a medical problem.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of sinusitis [^114rNTrA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient. A subcommittee composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, was selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups, including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics, have reviewed and revised the guideline.

Three specific issues were considered:

1. **Evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children**:

2. **Evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, nonantibiotic regimens**:

3. **The diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography, and sinus aspiration**:

It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children less than or equal to 6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary to…

### Imaging findings of the orbital and intracranial complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis [^117Mzk8t]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

In patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, severe orbital and intracranial complications can occur. This review illustrates the anatomic relationship between the paranasal sinuses and the orbital and intracranial compartments. Subsequently, the spectrum of orbital and intracranial complications of rhinosinusitis and related imaging findings are discussed and illustrated by case material from daily practice.

- **Teaching points**:
	* Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis can cause severe orbital and intracranial complications.
	* If orbital or intracranial complications are suspected, cross-sectional imaging is mandatory.
	* Infection can spread from the ethmoid sinus to the orbit through the lamina papyracea.
	* Frontal sinusitis can spread intracranially through dehiscences or osteomyelitis.
	* Radiologists must recognize imaging findings of complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

### Xolair [^111zxib7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Xolair were evaluated in two randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (CRSwNP Trial 1 [NCT03280550] and CRSwNP Trial 2 [NCT03280537]). These trials enrolled patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) who exhibited an inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids (CRSwNP Trial 1, n = 138; CRSwNP Trial 2, n = 127). Patients received Xolair or a placebo subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks. The dosage and frequency of Xolair administration were according to Table 3, for a duration of 24 weeks, followed by a 4-week follow-up period.

All patients continued background nasal mometasone therapy during both the treatment and the 5-week run-in period. Prior to randomization, patients were required to exhibit evidence of bilateral polyps, determined by a nasal polyp score (NPS) of ≥ 5, with an NPS of ≥ 2 in each nostril, despite the use of nasal mometasone during the run-in period. NPS was measured via endoscopy and scored on a range of 0–4 per nostril: 0 = no polyps; 1 = small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching below the inferior border of the middle turbinate; 2 = polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate; 3 = large polyps reaching the lower border of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle turbinate; 4 = large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity. This resulted in a total NPS ranging from 0–8.

Furthermore, patients were required to have a weekly average nasal congestion score (NCS) of > 1 before randomization, despite the use of nasal mometasone. Nasal congestion was measured by daily assessments on a 0 to 3 point scale.

### A case of canine-transmitted postoperative sinusitis [^113GDCQf]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Low credibility.

We present the first documented acute bacterial sinus infection with Staphylococcus schleiferi in a 58-year-old male recovering from endoscopic sinus surgery while on postoperative oral corticosteroids. Within one month of surgery, the patient reported treating an outer ear infection in his dog, which was culture positive for Staphylococcus schleiferi and Corynebacterium sp. Subsequently, he developed an acute exacerbation of his sinus symptoms, characterized by increased purulent drainage, facial pain, and increased aural fullness. Nasal endoscopy revealed purulence and thick mucus in multiple sinuses, and cultures tested positive for S. schleiferi. He underwent treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which resolved the active infection.

S. schleiferi has rarely been transmitted to a human host, affecting both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. This bacterial pathogen commonly presents as a skin infection or outer ear infection in canines and poses a potential infection risk to humans who treat their canine companions. This case marks the first documented instance of acute bacterial sinusitis caused by this pathogen in human literature. It warrants continued observation as another potential zoonotic pathogen that may cause sinus exacerbations in susceptible populations.

### Effects of montelukast on patients with asthma after experimental inoculation with human rhinovirus 16 [^115AsCZC]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Leukotrienes are induced by viral infections. The objective of this study was to determine whether treatment with montelukast would improve asthma disease control in patients with mild allergic asthma during an experimentally induced rhinovirus infection.

Patients with mild allergic asthma were randomized to receive treatment with either montelukast or placebo. Seven days later, both groups were inoculated with human rhinovirus 16. Patients were evaluated at baseline, during the acute infection phase, and during the recovery phase for asthma and cold symptoms by questionnaire. Sputum, nasal lavage fluid, and blood were analyzed for viral shedding and cellular inflammation, and peak expiratory flow was measured daily.

A total of 19 patients (11 in the placebo group and 8 in the active group) completed the study. No significant differences were found in asthma control and cold symptom scores between the control and treatment groups. The change in peak expiratory flow from the randomization to acute illness phase was greater in the placebo group than the treatment group (mean, -22 vs. 0 L/min; p = 0.05). During the recovery phase, the percentage of sputum eosinophils increased in the placebo group and remained at baseline levels in the montelukast group (median, 2.7% vs. 0.2%; p = 0.05 between groups).

In this pilot study, montelukast did not improve asthma control or cold symptom scores caused by experimental rhinovirus infection. Analysis of secondary outcomes suggests that montelukast may prevent reductions in lung function and increases in sputum eosinophils.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral montelukast in acute asthma exacerbation [^111ch5SZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Our study did not reveal significant differences in pulmonary function tests, measured as FEV1 at admission and discharge, and PEF measured at specific intervals, or length of hospital stay in patients hospitalized with acute asthma exacerbation who were given oral montelukast versus placebo. The efficacy and tolerability profile of oral montelukast were comparable to placebo, and no serious adverse effects were encountered.

The pathology of asthma triggers the arachnoid acid cascade, leading to the formation of leukotrienes via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. The cysteinyl leukotrienes possess pro-inflammatory characteristics that can directly cause or potentiate airflow obstruction by increased mucosal secretion and bronchospasm. Leukotriene pathway modifiers are therefore a subject of interest as a possible adjunct therapy in the acute management of asthma exacerbation. However, our results contrast with a recently published study by Ramsay et al, which randomized 73 patients and found significantly higher peak expiratory flows (PEFs) measured in the morning after admission in patients who received montelukast (p = 0.046, 95% CI of 1.15–113.6 L/min) compared to those who did not.

A study by Silverman et al. evaluated the effects of another leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), zafirlukast. They randomized patients into three groups: oral zafirlukast at 20 mg and 160 mg versus placebo. They investigated the time to relapse in the outpatient setting after discharge from the emergency department and found a reduction in the absolute rate of relapse by 5.3% in patients treated with zafirlukast.

### Strategies for diagnosing and treating suspected acute bacterial sinusitis: A cost-effectiveness analysis [^111djKtt]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Symptoms suggestive of acute bacterial sinusitis are common, and available diagnostic and treatment options generate substantial costs with uncertain benefits. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of alternative management strategies to identify the optimal approach.

For such patients, a Markov model was created to examine four strategies: no antibiotic treatment, empirical antibiotic treatment, clinical criteria-guided treatment, and radiography-guided treatment. The model simulated a 14-day course of illness and included factors such as sinusitis prevalence, antibiotic side effects, sinusitis complications, direct and indirect costs, and symptom severity. Strategies costing less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained were considered "cost-effective".

- **Measurements and main results**: For mild or moderate disease, basing antibiotic treatment on clinical criteria was cost-effective in clinical settings where sinusitis prevalence is within the range of 15% to 93% or 3% to 63%, respectively. For severe disease, or to prevent sinusitis or antibiotic side effect symptoms, the use of clinical criteria was cost-effective in settings with lower prevalence (below 51% or 44%, respectively); empirical antibiotics were cost-effective with higher prevalence. Sinus radiography-guided treatment was never cost-effective for initial treatment.

- **Conclusions**: The use of a simple set of clinical criteria to guide treatment is a cost-effective strategy in most clinical settings. Empirical antibiotics are cost-effective in certain settings; however, their use results in many unnecessary treatments.

### Levofloxacin [^1145gu11]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

Levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) using either 750 mg by mouth for 5 days, or 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10–14 days. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high-dose short course of levofloxacin, 780 outpatient adults with clinically and radiologically determined ABS were assessed in a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multicenter study. This study compared levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth once daily for five days to levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 days.

Clinical success rates, defined as complete or partial resolution of ABS signs and symptoms to the extent that no further antibiotic treatment was required, were 91.4% (139/152) in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 88.6% (132/149) in the levofloxacin 500 mg group at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit (95% CI [-4.2, 10.0] for levofloxacin 750 mg minus levofloxacin 500 mg).

Rates of clinical success by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable population, who had specimens obtained by antral tap at study entry, showed comparable results for the five- and ten-day regimens at the TOC visit 22 days post-treatment.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride [^116P9EVJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Moxifloxacin is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. Because fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with serious adverse reactions and for some patients ABS is self-limiting, reserve moxifloxacin for treatment of ABS in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

Moxifloxacin is also indicated in adult patients for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ABECB) caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, or Moraxella catarrhalis. Because fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with serious adverse reactions and for some patients ABECB is self-limiting, reserve moxifloxacin for treatment of ABECB in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of moxifloxacin and other antibacterial drugs, moxifloxacin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

### Montelukast as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of mild to moderate asthma: A systematic review [^11364hb9]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

To systematically review the evidence for the medium to long-term benefits and risks of montelukast as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) compared with placebo and active controls in mild to moderate asthma, data was sourced from Medline, Embase, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, reference lists of retrieved articles, clinical trial registries, and study results databases.

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (duration ≥ 12 weeks) was conducted in adolescents and adults, comparing montelukast/ICS versus ICS monotherapy or montelukast/ICS versus active control/ICS. Meta-analyses were conducted where feasible, with the main focus on clinical outcomes, such as exacerbations. Adverse events were also assessed.

Thirteen studies meeting all of the inclusion criteria were identified. Seven studies, including constant or tapered doses of ICS, compared montelukast/ICS with ICS monotherapy. Six studies compared add-on montelukast with an add-on active control (salmeterol). Overall, the data indicated that montelukast/ICS was clinically more effective than ICS monotherapy. The ICS sparing potential of montelukast was clearly demonstrated in one study. Montelukast/ICS and ICS monotherapy showed similar safety profiles. In the active-controlled studies, montelukast/ICS was clinically less effective than salmeterol/ICS in the 12-week trials (pooled proportion of patients with ≥ 1 exacerbation: p = 0.006). However, separate analysis of active-controlled 48-week trials showed comparable proportions for patients with ≥ 1 exacerbation.

Levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) using either 750 mg by mouth for five days or 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 to 14 days. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high-dose short course of levofloxacin, 780 outpatient adults with clinically and radiologically determined acute bacterial sinusitis were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multi-center study. This study compared levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth once daily for five days to levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 days.

- **Clinical success rates**: Clinical success rates, defined as the complete or partial resolution of the pre-treatment signs and symptoms of ABS to such an extent that no further antibiotic treatment was deemed necessary, were 91.4% (139/152) in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 88.6% (132/149) in the levofloxacin 500 mg group at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit. The 95% confidence interval was [-4.2, 10] for levofloxacin 750 mg minus levofloxacin 500 mg.

- **Clinical success by pathogen**: Rates of clinical success by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable population, who had specimens obtained by antral tap at study entry, showed comparable results for both the five-day and ten-day regimens at the test-of-cure visit 22 days post-treatment.
