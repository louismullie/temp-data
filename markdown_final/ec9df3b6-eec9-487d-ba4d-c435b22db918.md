## Question

What should be the next steps for a patient with HbA1c 5.8 and normal fasting glucose?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the next steps should be for a patient with an HbA1c of 5.8% and a normal fasting glucose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this HbA1c meets ADA criteria for prediabetes and how to interpret discordance with a normal fasting plasma glucose. Then, I should verify assay quality and consider conditions that could falsely elevate or otherwise alter the A1C-glycemia relationship. Next, I will assess overall diabetes and cardiovascular risk to guide intensity of intervention. After that, I should decide whether to obtain additional glycemic testing such as a 75-g OGTT or consider CGM to clarify postprandial dysglycemia. Finally, I will outline lifestyle-first management, when to consider metformin in high-risk phenotypes, a monitoring cadence, patient education, referrals, and thresholds for escalation based on repeat testing and progression risk [^114V3E6i] [^1167MvKp].

> Let me first confirm the interpretation of the labs. An HbA1c of 5.8% falls within the ADA-defined prediabetes range of 5.7–6.4%, whereas a normal fasting glucose (< 100 mg/dL) does not meet impaired fasting glucose criteria, so this is prediabetes by A1C with discordant normal fasting glucose, a common pattern given the limited overlap between A1C-defined intermediate hyperglycemia, IFG, and IGT [^114V3E6i] [^117Ef2SU] [^1118hANQ].

> Wait, let me verify test quality before I anchor on the diagnosis. I need to ensure the A1C was measured in a laboratory using an NGSP-certified, DCCT-aligned method and not a point-of-care device that is not FDA-cleared for diagnosis; if results are unexpected or near a threshold, repeating the A1C to account for analytical and biological variability is prudent [^111zXqBN] [^114wiHZW] [^1154km5Y] [^112rErhy].

> Hold on, I should check for conditions that can uncouple A1C from true glycemia. Hemoglobinopathies, anemia or recent blood loss, hemolysis, CKD or dialysis, G6PD deficiency, HIV, and EPO therapy can alter A1C accuracy; if any are present or if discordance persists, I need to consider alternative markers like fructosamine or use CGM-derived metrics to monitor glycemia more reliably [^113RwGrs] [^1167MvKp] [^114RqarK].

> Next, I will assess overall diabetes and cardiovascular risk to calibrate the intensity of prevention. I need to review age, race/ethnicity, BMI and waist, blood pressure and fasting lipids, family and gestational diabetes history, sleep apnea, PCOS, physical inactivity, diet, and smoking; notably, an A1C ≥ 5.8% has been associated with a markedly increased 5-year risk of incident IGT/T2D in high-risk cohorts, supporting proactive intervention even with a normal fasting glucose [^115gZ4Kh] [^113PeXqL].

> I should now decide whether to pursue additional glycemic testing to uncover postprandial dysglycemia. An OGTT can detect IGT missed by fasting glucose and is reasonable here given discordance and any added risk factors; several analyses show many individuals with A1C 5.7–6.4% have normal fasting glucose yet abnormal postchallenge levels, underscoring the value of OGTT in this setting [^114V3E6i] [^113rTcpK] [^117Ef2SU].

> But wait, what if the patient or setting favors continuous profiling over a single challenge test. I can consider short-term professional CGM to characterize daily glycemic patterns, quantify time in range and time above range, and corroborate or refute the A1C signal; CGM metrics are endorsed as alternatives when A1C is unreliable or discordant, and normative CGM data support interpretation of excursions in people without diabetes [^114RqarK] [^111mMJV5] [^1134KEgu].

> I will now initiate evidence-based management with lifestyle as first-line for everyone with prediabetes. I need to target 5–10% weight loss if overweight or obese, achieve at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity plus resistance training, and adopt an energy-restricted, fiber-rich Mediterranean or DASH-style eating pattern; referral to a structured Diabetes Prevention Program or a registered dietitian improves adherence and outcomes [^114BoucV] [^111nU5CS] [^114dK8ee].

> Let me not forget comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction given the shared risk profile. I should measure blood pressure and a fasting lipid panel, treat hypertension and dyslipidemia per guidelines, reinforce smoking cessation, and counsel on moderated alcohol intake, as cardiometabolic risk modification is integral to prediabetes care alongside glycemic prevention strategies [^114BoucV] [^116FCnUd].

> Now, I need to consider pharmacologic therapy for those at highest risk or with progression despite lifestyle. Metformin is reasonable to consider particularly for patients younger than 60 years, with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², a history of gestational diabetes, or rising A1C despite structured lifestyle intervention; I should also plan to monitor vitamin B12 periodically with long-term metformin use [^114s1n2M] [^111nU5CS].

> I should confirm a follow-up and monitoring cadence. At minimum, reassess glycemia annually with A1C, fasting glucose, or OGTT, but for higher-risk patients or if A1C trends upward, monitor every 6 months, and if values are near diagnostic thresholds or results were repeated for verification, consider retesting in 3–6 months; when discordance persists, incorporate CGM metrics or fructosamine to guide care [^112Y2Ggc] [^112rErhy] [^114RqarK].

> Next, I should provide clear patient education and counseling. I need to explain that A1C 5.8% signifies prediabetes and increased risks for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, set individualized goals for weight, activity, and nutrition with a written action plan, review symptoms of hyperglycemia, and recommend enrollment in a CDC-recognized Diabetes Prevention Program when available [^115gZ4Kh] [^114dK8ee].

> I will now plan coordination of care and referrals to enhance success. Referral to a registered dietitian for medical nutrition therapy and to a diabetes educator for behavior change support is appropriate, and I should consider endocrinology consultation if A1C continues to rise, multiple metrics are abnormal, or diagnostic uncertainty remains after addressing potential A1C interferences [^114dK8ee] [^112Y2Ggc].

> Finally, I need to ensure reassessment triggers are explicit. If on follow-up A1C reaches 6.5% on a separate confirmatory test, I should diagnose diabetes and escalate therapy accordingly, whereas persistent intermediate values warrant intensifying lifestyle measures or adding metformin in appropriate high-risk phenotypes; I should also remember that limited overlap among A1C, IFG, and IGT definitions means risk can evolve along different glycemic axes, so vigilance for postprandial progression is essential [^114V3E6i] [^117Ef2SU].

> In summary, after verifying the assay and excluding factors that distort A1C, I will risk-stratify, consider OGTT or CGM to define postprandial dysglycemia, implement intensive lifestyle intervention with cardiometabolic risk control, reserve metformin for high-risk or progressive cases, and monitor at least annually with tighter intervals as risk increases, aligning this approach with ADA 2025 Standards and guidance for discordant glycemic markers [^1167MvKp] [^112Y2Ggc] [^114V3E6i].

For a patient with an A1C of 5.8% and normal fasting glucose, next steps include: **confirm prediabetes with a 2-hour OGTT** to detect isolated impaired glucose tolerance, as A1C and fasting glucose alone can miss postprandial dysglycemia [^113rTcpK] [^117Ef2SU]. If the OGTT is normal, **repeat A1C in 6–12 months**; if it shows IGT, initiate structured lifestyle intervention (5–10% weight loss, ≥ 150 min/week of activity) and monitor A1C annually [^112Y2Ggc]. Evaluate for **A1C assay interference** (anemia, hemoglobinopathies, CKD, liver disease) [^1167MvKp] and use glucose-based tests if suspected [^113RwGrs]. Pharmacotherapy is **not indicated** unless multiple risk factors are present or progression occurs.

---

## Confirmatory testing

Perform a **75-g OGTT** to detect isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), which A1C and fasting glucose may miss [^114V3E6i] [^113L7Xdj]. If the OGTT is normal, **repeat A1C** in 6–12 months to monitor progression [^112Y2Ggc].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

- **Weight loss**: Aim for 5–10% weight loss to reduce diabetes risk [^114BoucV].

- **Physical activity**: Encourage ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity activity [^113vAJuh].

- **Dietary changes**: Emphasize whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and reduced refined carbohydrates [^114dK8ee].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Reassess **A1C and fasting glucose annually** [^112Y2Ggc] [^114RqarK], and **address hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity** [^112QRAq9].

---

## Evaluation for assay interference

Assess for **A1C assay interference** — anemia, hemoglobinopathies, CKD, or liver disease that may affect accuracy [^1167MvKp]. If interference is suspected, **use glucose-based tests** [^113RwGrs] [^113Rmpb9].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

Pharmacotherapy is **not indicated** unless multiple risk factors are present or there is evidence of progression [^114s1n2M].

---

## Patient education

Provide **education** about prediabetes, lifestyle changes, and the need for regular monitoring [^115gZ4Kh].

### Hemoglobin A1c testing alone does not sufficiently identify patients with prediabetes [^113rTcpK]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Whether hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values are suitable for diagnosing diabetes has been debated. We sought to assess the prevalence of elevated HbA1c levels in a prediabetes patient population. Oral glucose tolerance tests and HbA1c levels were analyzed for patients entering a diabetes prevention program between January 1, 2007, and September 13, 2009.

We calculated the percentage of patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) who had HbA1c values in the 6.0% to 6.4% range or in the 5.7% to 6.4% range. The mean age of the 242 patients was 62 years; 64.0% were women, and 88.0% were white. Isolated IFG was detected in about 56.2% of patients and combined IFG and IGT in about 37.2%. Only 28.5% of patients had HbA1c values in the 6.0% to 6.4% range, whereas 65.3% had values in the 5.7% to 6.4% range.

Our data suggest that reliance on HbA1c testing alone to identify candidates for a diabetes prevention program would miss a substantial number of eligible patients.

### One-step or 2-step testing for gestational diabetes: Which is better [^116adgqe]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

In the United States, the common approach to detecting gestational diabetes mellitus is the 2-step protocol recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. A 50 g, 1-hour glucose challenge at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation is followed by a 100 g, 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test when a screening test threshold is exceeded. Notably, two or more elevated values diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus. The 2-step screening test is administered without regard to the time of the last meal, providing convenience by eliminating the requirement for fasting. However, depending upon the cutoff used and population risk factors, approximately 15% to 20% of screened women require the 100 g, 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test.

The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups recommends a protocol of no screening test but rather a diagnostic 75 g, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. One or more values above threshold diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus. The 1-step approach requires that women be fasting for the test but does not require a second visit and lasts 2 hours rather than 3. Primarily because of needing only a single elevated value, the 1-step approach identifies 18% to 20% of pregnant women as having gestational diabetes mellitus, 2 to 3 times the rate with the 2-step procedure, but lower than the United States prediabetes rate of 24% in reproductive-aged women. The resources needed for the increase in gestational diabetes mellitus are parallel to the resources needed for the increased prediabetes and diabetes in the nonpregnant population.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly concerning pregnant patients, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend screening for early abnormal glucose metabolism. This involves identifying dysglycemia using fasting glucose levels of 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L) or HbA1c levels of 5.9–6.4% (41–47 mmol/mol).

### Can 'personalized diagnostics' promote earlier intervention for dysglycaemia? Hypothesis ready for testing [^114Jt8NH]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The risk associated with progression to diabetes and cardiovascular complications increases along a continuum, rather than being threshold-dependent. How can we identify those with glucose levels in the upper reaches of normal who are most in need of preventive intervention? With present criteria, we are likely excluding many individuals who have heightened risk. We introduce the possibility of using a "personalized" glucose profile to encourage early intervention in subjects in whom glucose metabolism is deteriorating (on an individual level) but not yet abnormal based on population norms. We further suggest that "personalized profiles" of hemoglobin A1c and basal plasma insulin may also help encourage appropriately early intervention. The effectiveness, safety, and simplicity of first-line therapies make these more sensitive approaches very attractive.

### Screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes with proposed A1C-based diagnostic criteria [^113L7Xdj]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

An International Expert Committee (IEC) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) proposed diagnostic criteria for diabetes and pre-diabetes based on A1C levels. We hypothesized that screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes with A1C measurements would differ from using oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT).

- **Research design and methods**: We compared pre-diabetes, dysglycemia (diabetes or pre-diabetes), and diabetes identified by the proposed criteria (A1C ≥ 6.5% for diabetes and 6.0–6.4% [IEC] or 5.7–6.4% [ADA] for high risk/pre-diabetes) with standard OGTT diagnoses in three datasets. Non-Hispanic white or black adults without known diabetes who had A1C and 75-g OGTT measurements were included from the prospective Screening for Impaired Glucose Tolerance study (n = 1,581), and from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (n = 2014), and NHANES 2005–2006 (n = 1,111).

- **Results**: OGTTs revealed pre-diabetes in 35.8% and diabetes in 5.2% of combined study subjects. A1C provided receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve areas for diabetes of 0.79–0.83, but ROC curve areas were ≤ 0.70 for dysglycemia or pre-diabetes. The proposed criteria missed 70% of individuals with diabetes, 71–84% with dysglycemia, and 82–94% with pre-diabetes. Compared with the IEC criteria, the ADA criteria for pre-diabetes resulted in fewer false-negatives and more false-positive results. There were also racial differences, with false-positive results being more common in black subjects and false-negative results being more common in white subjects.

### A1c predicts type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance in a population at risk: The community diabetes prevention project [^113PeXqL]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2009). Low credibility.

In a population at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), we assessed early physical and metabolic markers that predict progression from normal to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and T2DM.

- **Methods**: A total of 388 individuals (22% male, age 46 ± 11 years) at risk for T2DM were randomized to Standard (n = 182) or Intervention (n = 206) care and evaluated at baseline and during five annual follow-up visits. Measurements included blood pressure, BMI, A1c, lipids, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, VO2max, fasting glucose, insulin, and C-peptide. The Standard group received results of annual lab tests and quarterly newsletters, while the Intervention group received quarterly newsletters, detailed discussions of lab results, routine self-directed activities, semi-annual group meetings, and monthly telephone calls for ongoing support.

- **Results**: Overall, 359 (93%) individuals returned for at least one follow-up visit, and 272 (70%) completed the final 5-year assessment. Return rates, changes in measures, and incidence of IGT/T2DM were similar between groups. Low cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) was the most prevalent baseline abnormality. A1c and BMI were significant predictors of IGT/T2DM after controlling for other factors. The risk of IGT/T2DM within 5 years was 17.16 (95% CL: 6.169, 47.736) times greater for those with a baseline A1c ≥ 5.8% compared to those with lower levels. A1c is routinely performed among patients with diabetes; however, these data and other evidence suggest that it is a significant predictor of IGT/T2DM within 5 years in a population at high risk for T2DM.

### Position statement executive summary: Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114wiHZW]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Glucose meters**:
	- There are insufficient published data to support a role for portable meters and skin-prick (finger-stick) blood samples in the diagnosis of diabetes or for population screening. These tools lack precision and exhibit substantial differences, which precludes their use in the diagnosis of diabetes and limits their usefulness in screening.
	- Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is recommended for all insulin-treated patients with diabetes.
	- In patients with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and oral agents, SMBG may help achieve better control, particularly when therapy is initiated or changed. However, data are insufficient to claim an associated improvement in health outcomes. The role of SMBG in patients with stable type 2 diabetes controlled by diet alone is not well established.
	- Patients should be instructed in the correct use of glucose meters, including quality control. Comparison between SMBG and laboratory glucose analysis should be performed at regular intervals to evaluate the performance of the meters in the patient's hands.
	- Multiple performance goals for portable glucose meters have been proposed, but these targets vary widely and are controversial. Manufacturers should work to improve the imprecision of meters, aiming to limit total error for 95% of samples to ≤ 15% at glucose concentrations ≥ 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and to < 0.8 mmol/L (15 mg/dL) at glucose concentrations < 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL).

### Impact of A1C screening criterion on the diagnosis of pre-diabetes among U.S. adults [^113sxiLT]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetes, a condition associated with high morbidity and mortality, has reached epidemic status among Americans. Approximately 24 million Americans currently have diabetes, with indirect and direct costs exceeding 174 billion dollars annually. The high burden and prognostic implications of diabetes have led to increasing attempts to prevent its development. Interventions for individuals and populations at high risk for diabetes or with pre-diabetes are a major focus for these prevention efforts.

Until recently, clinical practice guidelines defined pre-diabetes as either impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] of 100–125 mg/dl) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (glucose of 140–199 mg/dl on a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]). Using these definitions, approximately 57 million Americans have pre-diabetes. In clinical practice, FPG is a more commonly used test compared to an OGTT, because of its logistical advantages. However, IFG still requires individuals to fast for at least 8 hours before testing.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recently updated its screening recommendation for pre-diabetes to include A1C, a non-fasting test, as another diagnostic testing option. Specific to pre-diabetes, these recommendations state that an A1C from 5.7 to 6.4% identifies individuals at high risk for diabetes and that the label of pre-diabetes can be applied. The revised recommendations imply that the practical advantages of A1C over FPG and OGTT will make screening more widespread and help clinicians identify and intervene in this high-risk population.

### Elevated A1C in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^115395iu]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

- **Count in millions**: Figure 1 shows the number of individuals at different A1C cut points in the U.S. 2000 Census population aged ≥ 20 years without diabetes, with 95% confidence intervals.

- **Distributions of A1C levels**: Figure 2 presents the distributions of A1C among individuals with normal fasting glucose (fasting glucose < 100 mg/dL), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and undiagnosed diabetes. Among those with a fasting glucose below 6.0%, 45.6% had undiagnosed diabetes, 45.3% had IFG, and 9.1% had normal fasting glucose. In comparison, for individuals with an A1C ≥ 7.0%, 91.7% had undiagnosed diabetes, 6.6% had IFG, and only 1.7% had normal glucose levels.

	- For individuals with A1C > 6.1% and A1C ≥ 6.5%, the distribution of fasting glucose categories reflected intermediate results. Among those with A1C > 6%, 53.3% had undiagnosed diabetes, 38.6% had IFG, and 8.1% had normal fasting glucose. Among individuals with A1C ≥ 6.5%, 76.7% had undiagnosed diabetes, 19.6% had IFG, and 1.7% had normal fasting glucose. Further details can be found in supplementary Figure A, available in an online appendix.

### Target for glycemic control: Concentrating on glucose [^116tCwAC]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Integrating different periods of daytime is crucial in managing diabetes effectively. While many physicians continue to emphasize fasting glucose and A1C levels, observational studies suggest the importance of glucose testing at postprandial and postabsorptive time points.

Lessons from physiology indicate that humans spend about half of their lives in postprandial states. The postprandial state, regarding glucose, is defined as a four-hour period following meal ingestion. During this time, dietary carbohydrates are progressively hydrolyzed through sequential enzymatic actions. Although the insulin response quickly lowers the postprandial glucose excursion to baseline within less than two hours, the absorption period lasts approximately four hours, corresponding to the postprandial state.

The postabsorptive state consists of a six-hour period following the postprandial period. During this interval, glucose concentrations in nondiabetic individuals remain within a normal range through glycogenolysis, the breakdown of glycogen stored during the postprandial period. The "real" fasting state begins only after the postabsorptive period, approximately 10–12 hours after the last meal. In the fasting state, plasma glucose is maintained at near-normal levels by gluconeogenesis, with glucose derived from lactate, alanine, and glycerol.

In nondiabetic patients consuming three meals daily at relatively fixed hours, this understanding of the 24-hour period is fundamental.

### Screening for type 2 diabetes [^112GygHE]. Diabetes Care (2000). Low credibility.

Definitive studies of the effectiveness of screening for type 2 diabetes are currently not available. RCTs would be the best means to assess effectiveness, but several barriers prevent these studies from being conducted. Prospective observational studies may characterize some benefits of screening by creating screened and unscreened groups for comparison. The availability of better data systems and health services research techniques will facilitate such comparisons. Unfortunately, the interpretation of the results of such studies is extremely problematic.

Several screening tests have been evaluated. Risk assessment questionnaires have generally performed poorly as stand-alone tests, while screening with biochemical tests performs better. Venous and capillary glucose measurements may perform more favorably than urinary glucose or HbA(1c) measurements. Measuring postprandial glucose levels may have advantages over measuring fasting levels. However, the performance of all screening tests is dependent on the cutoff point selected, and unfortunately, there are no well-defined and validated cutoff points to define positive tests.

A two-stage screening test strategy may assist with a more efficient use of resources, although such approaches have not been rigorously tested. The optimal interval for screening is unknown. Even though periodic, targeted, and opportunistic screening within the existing health care system seems to offer the greatest yield and likelihood of appropriate follow-up and treatment, much of the reported experience with screening appears to be episodic.

### Considerations on blood glucose management in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116ecBXT]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years, the benefits of more intensive management in preventing or delaying the development and progression of diabetic complications have been well documented. What is not as well documented is how to motivate the person with diabetes to manage the condition, how to set, assess and quantify glucose goals, and the glucose variables that should be routinely measured.

This review discusses the importance of setting targets and communicating them in a way that the patient understands. When aiming for a glycaemia target, balance is required between:

- **Achieving reduction of complications**: While avoiding an increased degree of hypoglycaemia, it is crucial to balance what is achievable against the degree of benefit gained.

- **Tailoring target values**: Target values given in guidelines should be adapted by the clinician to consider the patient's susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, stage and type of complications, age and life expectancy, co-morbidity, social environment, understanding of the steps required, and level of commitment to the treatment.

Several suggestions are given regarding possible improvements and amendments to existing guidelines for diabetes management in treating to glucose goal. For example, attention should be drawn to the need to individualize goals and to consider education, long-term support, patient needs, and treatment outcomes when formulating diabetes management plans. The relative properties of the different glucose variables — fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), and glycated protein — are discussed in terms of their convenience.

### Who should return for an oral glucose tolerance test? A proposed clinical pathway based on retrospective analysis of 332 children [^113DKcEw]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the traditional diagnostic tool for type 2 diabetes (T2DM). However, fasting is required, and implementation in all overweight or obese subjects is not practical. This study aimed to formulate a clinical pathway to stratify subjects according to their risk of abnormal OGTT.

This retrospective study included patients with overweight or obesity who had undergone OGTT in a tertiary pediatric unit from 2012 to 2018. The optimal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) cutoff that predicts abnormal OGTT was evaluated. Other non-fasting parameters, in combination with this HbA1c cutoff, were also explored as predictors of abnormal OGTT.

Three hundred and thirty-two patients (boys: 54.2%, Chinese: 97.3%) were included for analysis. Of these, 272 (81.9%) patients had normal OGTT, while 60 (18.0%) patients had abnormal OGTT (prediabetes or T2DM). The optimal HbA1c predicting abnormal OGTT was 5.5% (AUC 0.71; sensitivity of 66.7% and specificity of 71%). When HbA1c ≥ 5.5% was combined with positive family history and abnormal alanine transaminase (ALT) level, the positive predictive value for abnormal OGTT increased from 33.6% to 61.6%.

HbA1c, family history of T2DM, and ALT level could be used to derive a clinical pathway to stratify children who have a high risk of abnormal OGTT.

### Contributions of glucose and hemoglobin A1c measurements in diabetes screening [^1178QS3D]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

Given the long-term consequences of untreated diabetes, patients benefit from timely diagnoses. Payer policies often recognize glucose but not hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for diabetes screening. This study evaluates the different information that glucose and HbA1c provide for diabetes screening.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of national clinical laboratory testing during 2020 when glucose and HbA1c were ordered for routine diabetes screening, excluding patients with known diabetes, out-of-range glucose, or metabolic syndrome.

- **Results**: Of 15.47 million glucose and HbA1c tests ordered simultaneously, 672,467 (4.35%) met screening inclusion criteria; 116,585 (17.3%) were excluded because of diabetes-related conditions or the specimen was non-fasting, leaving 555,882 result pairs. More than 1 in 4 patients 60 years of age or older with glucose within range had an elevated HbA1c level. HbA1c claims were denied more often for Medicare beneficiaries (38,918/65,273 [59.6%]) than for other health plans combined (23,234/291,764 [8.0%]).

- **Conclusions**: Although many health plans do not cover HbA1c testing for diabetes screening, more than 1 in 4 glucose screening patients 60 years of age or older with an in-range glucose result had an elevated HbA1c result. Guideline developers and health plans should explicitly recognize that glucose and HbA1c provide complementary information and together offer improved clinical utility for diabetes screening.

### Evaluation of reference metrics for continuous glucose monitoring in persons without diabetes and prediabetes [^1134KEgu]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines have been developed for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics in persons with diabetes. To understand what glucose profiles should be judged as normal in clinical practice and glucose-lowering trials, we examined the glucose profile of healthy individuals using CGM.

- **Methods**: Persons without diabetes or prediabetes were included after passing a normal oral glucose tolerance test: two-hour value < 8.9 mmol/L (160 mg/dL), fasting glucose < 6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL), and HbA1c < 6.0% (< 42 mmol/mol). CGM metrics were evaluated using the Dexcom G4 Platinum.

- **Results**: In total, 60 persons were included; the mean age was 43.0 years, 70.0% were women, mean HbA1c was 5.3% (34 mmol/mol), and mean body mass index was 25.7 kg/m². Median and mean percent times in hypoglycemia < 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) were 1.6% (IQR 0.6–3.2) and 3.2% (95% CI 2.0; 4.3), respectively. For glucose levels < 3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL), the corresponding estimates were 0.0% (IQR 0.0–0.4) and 0.5% (95% CI 0.2; 0.8). Median and mean time-in-range (3.9–10.0 mmol/L [70–180 mg/dL]) was 97.3% (IQR 95.4–98.7) and 95.4% (95% CI 94.0; 96.8), respectively. Median and mean standard deviations were 1.04 mmol/L (IQR 0.92–1.29) and 1.15 mmol/L (95% CI 1.05; 1.24), respectively. Measures of glycemic variability (standard deviation, coefficient of variation, mean amplitude of glycemic excursions) were significantly greater during daytime compared with nighttime, whereas others did not differ.

- **Conclusions**: People without prediabetes or diabetes show a non-negligible percentage time in hypoglycemia, with a median of 1.6% and a mean of 3.2%.

### Limited overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia as defined by A1C 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance [^117Ef2SU]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

We compared the prevalences and overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia (IH), defined by a hemoglobin A1C 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

- **Research design and methods**: Oral glucose tolerance test results and A1C measurements were evaluated as markers of IH in an unselected cohort of 486 nondiabetic adults from Finland.

- **Results**: The overall prevalence of IH was 34%. Prevalences of isolated A1C 5.7–6.4%, IGT, and IFG were 8.0%, 13.2%, and 4.5%, respectively. Overlap between these three markers was uncommon. Isolated A1C 5.7–6.4% was associated with a higher BMI compared with isolated IFG and IGT and with a more adverse lipid profile compared with isolated IFG.

- **Conclusions**: Prevalence of isolated IH was high, with limited overlap between the definitions. Differences in cardiovascular disease risk factors were observed among the groups. This study demonstrates that an A1C of 5.7–6.4% detects, in part, different individuals with IH compared with IFG and IGT.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2010 [^114BoucV]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

In 1997 and 2003, the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus recognized an intermediate group of individuals whose glucose levels, although not meeting criteria for diabetes, are nevertheless too high to be considered normal. This group was defined as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG levels of 100 mg/dl [5.6 mmol/l] to 125 mg/dl [6.9 mmol/l]) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (2-h OGTT values of 140 mg/dl [7.8 mmol/l] to 199 mg/dl [11.0 mmol/l]).

Individuals with IFG and/or IGT have been referred to as having pre-diabetes, indicating the relatively high risk for the future development of diabetes. IFG and IGT should not be viewed as clinical entities in their own right but rather as risk factors for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD). IFG and IGT are associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension. Structured lifestyle intervention, aimed at increasing physical activity and producing 5–10% loss of body weight, along with certain pharmacological agents, has been demonstrated to prevent or delay the development of diabetes in people with IGT.

It should be noted that the 2003 ADA Expert Committee report reduced the lower FPG cut point to define IFG from 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) to 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l), in part to make the prevalence of IFG more similar to that of IGT. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) and many other diabetes organizations did not adopt this change.

### International consensus on use of continuous glucose monitoring [^111mMJV5]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

Measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) has been the traditional method for assessing glycemic control. However, it does not reflect intra- and interday glycemic excursions that may lead to acute events, such as hypoglycemia or postprandial hyperglycemia, which have been linked to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), whether through real-time use (rtCGM) or intermittently viewed (iCGM), addresses many of the limitations inherent in HbA1c testing and self-monitoring of blood glucose.

Although both provide means to move beyond HbA1c measurement as the sole marker of glycemic control, standardized metrics for analyzing CGM data are lacking. Moreover, clear criteria for matching individuals with diabetes to the most appropriate glucose monitoring methodologies, as well as standardized advice about how best to use the new information they provide, have yet to be established. In February 2017, the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) Congress convened an international panel of physicians, researchers, and individuals with diabetes who are experts in CGM technologies to address these issues. This article summarizes the ATTD consensus recommendations and represents the understanding of how CGM results can affect outcomes.

### TruQAP [^1163Jtxu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Before initiating treatment with TruQAP, test fasting glucose levels (FPG or FBG) and HbA1C levels, and optimize fasting glucose.

After initiating treatment with TruQAP, - **Fasting glucose monitoring**: Monitor or self-monitor fasting glucose levels on Day 3 or 4 of the dosing week during weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8; then monthly while on treatment with TruQAP and as clinically indicated. Monitor HbA1C levels every 3 months during treatment with TruQAP and as clinically indicated. Patients with a history of well-controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus may require intensified anti-hyperglycemic treatment and close monitoring of fasting glucose levels.

- **Hyperglycemia management**: For patients who experience hyperglycemia during treatment with TruQAP, monitor fasting glucose at least twice weekly, on days on and off TruQAP, until fasting glucose decreases to baseline levels. During treatment with anti-diabetic medications, monitor fasting glucose at least once a week for 2 months, followed by once every 2 weeks, or as clinically indicated.

- **Risk management**: Consider consultation with a healthcare practitioner with expertise in the treatment of hyperglycemia and initiation of fasting glucose monitoring at home for patients who have risk factors for hyperglycemia or who experience hyperglycemia. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia and counsel patients on lifestyle changes.

- **Ketoacidosis management**: Withhold TruQAP immediately when ketoacidosis is suspected. If ketoacidosis is confirmed, permanently discontinue TruQAP.

Based on the severity of the hyperglycemia, withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue TruQAP.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2011 [^111zXqBN]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes is as follows:

- **A1C measurement**: A value of ≥ 6.5% is indicative of diabetes. The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP)-certified and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) assay.

- **Fasting plasma glucose (FPG)**: A level of ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) is indicative of diabetes. Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours.

- **2-hour plasma glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)**: A level of ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during the OGTT is indicative of diabetes. The test should be performed as described by the World Health Organization, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g of anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.

- **Random plasma glucose in symptomatic patients**: In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose level of ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) is indicative of diabetes.

In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, the diagnosis should be confirmed by repeat testing.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^113Rmpb9]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Use**: When glucose is used to establish the diagnosis of diabetes, it should be measured in venous plasma A (high). When glucose is used for screening of high-risk individuals, it should be measured in venous plasma B (moderate). Plasma glucose should be measured in an accredited laboratory when used for diagnosis of or screening for diabetes (Good Practice Point, GPP). Outcome studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of screening C (moderate).

- **Diagnosis/screening**: The diagnosis of diabetes is established by identifying the presence of hyperglycemia. For many years, the only method recommended for diagnosis was a direct demonstration of hyperglycemia by measuring increased glucose concentrations in the plasma. In 1979, a set of criteria based on the distribution of glucose concentrations in high-risk populations was established to standardize the diagnosis. These recommendations were endorsed by the WHO. In 1997, the diagnostic criteria were modified to better identify individuals at risk of retinopathy and nephropathy. The revised criteria comprised: 1) an FPG value ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL); 2) a 2-hour postload glucose concentration ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) during an OGTT; or 3) symptoms of diabetes and a casual (i.e. regardless of the time of the preceding meal) plasma glucose concentration ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). If any one of these three criteria is met, confirmation by repeat testing on a subsequent day is necessary to establish the diagnosis.

### Impact of active versus usual algorithmic titration of basal insulin and point-of-care versus laboratory measurement of HbA1c on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: the Glycemic Optimization with Algorithms and Labs at Point of Care (GOAL A1C) trial [^112tY5pG]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of active versus usual monitoring of algorithmic insulin titration and point-of-care (POC) versus laboratory HbA1c (A1C) measurement on glycemic control in primary care.

- **Research design and methods**: The Glycemic Optimization with Algorithms and Labs at Point of Care (GOAL A1C) study was a 24-week, randomized, parallel-group, four-arm, open-label study of 7,893 adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled by oral antidiabetic agents and requiring insulin. Patients were randomly assigned by investigators from 2,164 sites in the U.S. to insulin glargine with either: 1) usual (no unsolicited contact between visits) insulin titration using a simple algorithm with laboratory A1C testing, 2) usual titration with POC A1C testing, 3) active (weekly monitored) titration with laboratory A1C testing, or 4) active titration with POC A1C testing. Outcome measures included a change in A1C and fasting self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) levels, percentage of patients achieving A1C < 7.0%, and hypoglycemia frequency.

- **Results**: Significant A1C and SMBG reductions were observed in all arms (P < 0.0001). Compared with usual insulin titration, active titration achieved greater A1C reduction (1.5 vs. 1.3%; P < 0.0001), SMBG reduction (88 vs. 79 mg/dl; P < 0.0001), and proportion of patients achieving A1C < 7.0% (38 vs. 30%; P < 0.0001). Among patients receiving active titration, POC A1C testing was associated with an increase in the proportion achieving an A1C < 7.0% (41% for POC vs. 36% for laboratory; P < 0.0001). Hypoglycemia rates were also recorded, indicating…

### Should prediabetes be treated pharmacologically [^114s1n2M]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Low credibility.

Prediabetes is a dysglycemia with glycemic values between normal and those that define diabetes. Individuals with prediabetes are characterized by decreased insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance) and impaired insulin secretion that cannot meet the extra demands on the pancreatic beta cells imposed by insulin resistance. Prediabetes increases the risk for the subsequent development of diabetes. This risk begins with a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration of 4.6–4.8 mmol/L and increases in a curvilinear manner, with the chances of developing diabetes progressively rising the closer the dysglycemia is to the diagnostic criteria for diabetes.

The criteria for diagnosing prediabetes differ between the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the international community. Moreover, in contrast to the recommendation that the diagnosis of diabetes be confirmed, there is no such recommendation for the diagnosis of prediabetes. This is unfortunate because on a repeat oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) within 2–6 weeks, approximately half of individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) have a normal result. If the international impaired fasting glucose (IFG) criterion were used to diagnose prediabetes, 32% would be normal on repeat testing. OGTTs are rarely used in clinical practice (except in pregnancy), so the diagnosis of prediabetes rests on FPG and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) testing. Depending on the location and the test used for the diagnosis, there is a marked difference in whether an individual will be diagnosed with prediabetes.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2013 [^112rErhy]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Since there is preanalytical and analytical variability of all the tests, it is possible that when a test result above the diagnostic threshold is repeated, the second value may fall below the diagnostic cut point. This is least likely for A1C, somewhat more likely for FPG, and most likely for the 2-hour PG. Excluding laboratory error, such patients are likely to have test results near the margins of the diagnosis threshold. Health care professionals might opt to follow the patient closely and repeat the testing in 3–6 months.

- **Diagnostic criteria for diabetes**:
	- The criteria are summarized in Table 2.

- **Categories of increased risk for diabetes (prediabetes)**:
	- In 1997 and 2003, the Expert Committee on Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus recognized an intermediate group of individuals whose glucose levels, although not meeting criteria for diabetes, are nevertheless too high to be considered normal. These individuals were defined as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG levels of 100 mg/dL [5.6 mmol/L] to 125 mg/dL [6.9 mmol/L]) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (2-hour values in the OGTT of 140 mg/dL [7.8 mmol/L] to 199 mg/dL [11.0 mmol/L]). It should be noted that the World Health Organization (WHO) and several other diabetes organizations define the cutoff for IFG at 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L).

### Monitoring glycemic control: The importance of self-monitoring of blood glucose [^113DERQS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Several methods, each with differing utility and limitations, exist for monitoring glycemic control. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is considered the standard measure of long-term glycemic control, and HbA1c levels are strongly associated with complications of diabetes. However, HbA1c does not provide "real-time" information about individual hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic excursions. Urine glucose testing is noninvasive and inexpensive, but it is dependent on the patient's individual renal threshold and can only detect glucose concentrations above this threshold. As such, urine testing cannot be recommended for diabetes management that aims for near-normoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) complements HbA1c by providing real-time blood glucose data. It is an educational tool for both patients and their healthcare providers to understand the effects of diet, exercise, and medications on day-to-day glycemic control.

However, guidelines from various international diabetes organizations vary in their level of specificity regarding the frequency and timing of self-monitoring. SMBG should be implemented for all patients as part of an overall diabetes management plan that includes specific instruction on how, when, and why to test.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically with respect to monitoring glycemic status, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend encouraging the checking of blood glucose levels based on insulin therapy requirements. This includes measuring levels when fasting, before meals and snacks, after meals, at bedtime, in the middle of the night, before, during, and after exercise, when hypoglycemia is suspected, after treating low blood glucose levels until they are normoglycemic, when hyperglycemia is suspected, and before and while performing critical tasks such as driving.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114kWJK4]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The role of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes has been considered for several years. In the past, the lack of standardization has been a major barrier. With improved standardization through the NGSP and the IFCC, and new data demonstrating the association between HbA1c concentrations and the risk for retinopathy, the International Expert Committee recommended the use of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes. In making its recommendation, the committee also considered several technical advantages of HbA1c testing compared with glucose testing, such as its preanalytical stability and decreased biological variation.

Finally, the clinical convenience of the HbA1c assay, which requires no patient fasting or tolerance tests compared with glucose-based diagnosis, convinced the committee to recommend HbA1c testing for diagnosis. A value ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) was considered diagnostic based on the observed relationship with retinopathy. For diagnosis, a positive test result [≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)] should be confirmed with a repeat assay. The ADA indicates that although either an HbA1c assay or a glucose assay (FPG or OGTT) can be used as the confirmatory test, repeating the same test is preferred.

The frequency of HbA1c testing for diagnosis has not been established, but guidelines similar to those for glucose-based testing seem appropriate. Only NGSP-certified HbA1c methods should be used to diagnose (or screen for) diabetes. The ADA cautions that point-of-care devices for measuring HbA1c should not be used for diagnosis.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^114R3ZDQ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes continues unabated. Despite extensive efforts to educate providers, patients, and even the public at large about the advantages of early identification and treatment to prevent complications, a large number of patients remain undiagnosed. A serious barrier to enhanced detection of diabetes has been inadequate screening using tests that are somewhat inconvenient for patients and clinicians, and therefore often not optimally implemented. In this issue of *Diabetes Care*, a joint American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation, and European Association for the Study of Diabetes International Expert Committee examines diagnostic testing for diabetes, specifically the role of A1C, and makes significant new recommendations. While this report has not yet been endorsed as a guideline by any of the associations (or other organizations), it does represent a step in that direction and thus deserves attention.

Clearly, no clinical diagnostic test is perfect. However, to be clinically useful, a test must be accurate, specific, standardized (or easily standardizable), handy, and, ideally, inexpensive. While plasma glucose testing meets some of these criteria, its use has been hindered by the need to obtain a sample in the fasting state (many people attend their outpatient visits in the fed state) or under standard carbohydrate challenge conditions, e.g. the oral glucose tolerance test. There also continues to be a degree of uncertainty concerning the diagnostic performance of fasting glucose testing versus that of the oral glucose tolerance test.

### International Diabetes Federation guideline for management of postmeal glucose: A review of recommendations [^111UJ6ES]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

- **Postmeal glycaemic control targets and assessment**: A 2-hour postmeal goal of less than 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) is recommended, aligning with targets from other associations' guidelines. These guidelines define normal glucose tolerance (NGT) as post-challenge values of less than 7.8 mmol/l 2 hours after ingestion of a 75-g glucose load, mirroring postmeal values of healthy individuals. The 2-hour testing timeframe adheres to published guidelines and reflects the typical 2- to 3-hour return of postmeal hyperglycemia to basal levels in NGT individuals.

- **Glucose monitoring**: The guideline encourages frequent glucose monitoring to guide therapy and achieve postmeal glucose (PMG) targets. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is recommended, as it directly assesses PMG. Despite controversy regarding SMBG frequency, particularly in non-insulin requiring diabetes, professional diabetes organizations advocate its use. Generally, they recommend self-monitoring at least three times daily in insulin-treated individuals, and as per treatment regimen and glycaemic control level in non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Notably, structured SMBG use results in significant HbA1c reduction, even in non-insulin requiring diabetes; thus supporting SMBG's implementation as part of structured diabetes management.

**A1C**: Perform the A1C test at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals and who have stable glycemic control. Perform the A1C test quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals. The use of point-of-care testing for A1C provides the opportunity for more timely treatment changes.

In 2010, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) proposed that individuals with a fasting glucose level of 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) or a glucose level of 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L) 2 hours following a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, or hemoglobin A(1c) levels of 5.7%-6.4%, be classified as prediabetic, indicating increased risk for the emergence of diabetes mellitus. At the same time, the ADA formulated guidelines for the use of metformin for the treatment of prediabetes.

- **Objective**: To determine the prevalence of prediabetes in a cohort of psychiatrically ill adults receiving antipsychotics and to compare the clinical and metabolic features of prediabetic patients with those of patients with normal glucose tolerance and those with diabetes mellitus.

- **Method**: The 2010 ADA criteria were applied to a large, consecutive, single-site European cohort of 783 adult psychiatric inpatients (mean age: 37.6 years) without a history of diabetes who were receiving antipsychotics. All patients in this cross-sectional study underwent measurement of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, oral glucose tolerance test, and fasting insulin and lipids from November 2003 through July 2007.

- **Results**: 413 patients (52.8%) had normal glucose tolerance, 290 (37.0%) had prediabetes, and 80 (10.2%) had diabetes mellitus. The fasting glucose and/or hemoglobin A(1c) criteria were met by 89.7% of prediabetic patients. A statistically significant intergroup gradient from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes and from prediabetes to diabetes mellitus was observed for waist circumference and triglycerides.

### Itovebi [^114cVAUt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Before initiating treatment with ITOVEBI, test fasting glucose levels (FPG or FBG), HbA1C levels, and optimize fasting glucose.

After initiating treatment with ITOVEBI, or in patients who experience hyperglycemia after initiating treatment with ITOVEBI, monitor or self-monitor fasting glucose levels once every 3 days for the first week (Day 1 to 7), then once every week for the next 3 weeks (Day 8 to 28), then once every 2 weeks for the next 8 weeks, and once every 4 weeks thereafter, as clinically indicated. Monitor HbA1C every 3 months and as clinically indicated.

Manage hyperglycemia with anti-hyperglycemic medications as clinically indicated. During treatment with anti-hyperglycemic medication, continue monitoring fasting glucose levels. Patients with a history of well-controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus may require intensified anti-hyperglycemic treatment and close monitoring of fasting glucose levels.

Consider consultation with a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of hyperglycemia, and initiation of fasting glucose monitoring at home for patients who have risk factors for hyperglycemia or who experience hyperglycemia. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia and counsel patients on lifestyle changes.

Based on the severity of the hyperglycemia, ITOVEBI may require dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Stomatitis**: Severe stomatitis can occur in patients treated with ITOVEBI. Stomatitis occurred in 51% of patients treated with ITOVEBI in combination with palbociclib and fu.

### Mode of onset of type 2 diabetes from normal or impaired glucose tolerance [^1158oaHv]. Diabetes (2004). Low credibility.

Fasting plasma glucose concentrations (FPG) predict the development of type 2 diabetes. It remains unknown whether hyperglycemia evolves from normoglycemia gradually over time or as a step increase. We measured plasma glucose and insulin levels during oral glucose testing in 35- to 64-year-old men and nonpregnant women from a population-based survey (Mexico City Diabetes Study) at baseline (n = 2,279) and after 3.25 years (n = 1,740) and 7 years (n = 1,711) of follow-up.

In subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) on all three occasions (nonconverters; n = 911), FPG increased slightly (0.23 ± 0.79 mmol/l, mean ± SD; P < 0.0001) over 7 years. In contrast, conversion to diabetes among NGT subjects (n = 98) was marked by a large step-up in FPG regardless of the time of conversion (3.06 ± 2.57 and 2.94 ± 3.11 mmol/l, respectively, at 3.25 and 7 years; P < 0.0001 vs. nonconverters). Similarly, in subjects who converted to diabetes from impaired glucose tolerance (n = 75), FPG rose by 3.14 ± 3.83 and 3.12 ± 3.61 mmol/l (P < 0.0001 vs. nonconverters).

Three-quarters of converters experienced increments in FPG above the 90th percentile of the corresponding increments in nonconverters. Converters exhibited higher baseline BMI (30.4 ± 4.9 vs. 27.3 ± 4.0 kg/m²; P < 0.001) and fasting plasma insulin values (120 ± 78 vs. 84 ± 84 pmol/l; P < 0.02) than nonconverters. However, no consistent change in either parameter had occurred before conversion. In contrast, changes in 2-hour postglucose insulin levels between the time of conversion and the preceding measurement were significantly related (P < 0.0001).

### Limited overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia as defined by A1C 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance [^116Aj6wd]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) at a range of 5.7–6.4% was proposed as an indicator of increased risk for type 2 diabetes, in addition to the currently used criteria of intermediate hyperglycemia (IH), which include impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

Use of A1C in a nondiabetic range may detect a different prevalence of IH compared with IFG or IGT; however, the degree of overlap between these markers is not well reported. Recent studies from diabetic populations have yielded conflicting data regarding differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor profiles among those diagnosed by A1C ≥ 6.5% and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Studies comparing CVD risk factor profiles among individuals with IH diagnosed by A1C 5.7–6.4% and OGTT are lacking.

We hypothesized that these three different markers of IH, in part, detect different individuals and that individuals with A1C 5.7–6.4% would be characterized by a more unfavorable CVD risk profile than individuals diagnosed by OGTT. To this aim, we conducted a population-based observational study to compare (1) diagnosis of IH based on A1C 5.7–6.4% with OGTT and (2) differences in CVD risk factors among the three groups.

### Management of type 2 diabetes: Are we making progress [^112bvCUs]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) serves as a crucial marker in diabetes management. While significant advancements have been made in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, challenges remain in achieving optimal glycemic control for all patients. The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes necessitates ongoing research and innovation in therapeutic strategies.

### Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: Is it feasible [^113vAJuh]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The increasing global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) requires the implementation of preventive strategies tailored to the specific needs of individual regions. Risk factors for T2DM are among the main targets for improving health outcomes and curbing the development of diabetes; excessive weight and obesity are two of the most important risk factors that need to be addressed.

A growing body of evidence suggests that subjects with pre-diabetes who lose body weight and increase physical activity can delay or prevent the onset of T2DM, and in some cases, blood glucose levels may return to normal. Several studies have shown that moderate to intensive levels of exercise are effective in reducing both intra-abdominal and total adiposity among obese subjects, thereby improving the cardiovascular risk profile and reducing the risk of T2DM development.

These consistent observations have led to large-scale randomized controlled trials that use lifestyle intervention — including behavioral strategies for reinforcing prescribed changes in nutritional intake, physical activity, or both — with or without pharmacological treatment, in populations at high risk of developing T2DM. In this review, large-scale national trials that have focused on the prevention of T2DM are critically evaluated.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2009 [^112QRAq9]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

- **Testing for pre-diabetes and diabetes in asymptomatic patients**: Recommendations for testing to detect pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic individuals suggest that adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) and have one or more additional risk factors should be considered for testing. For those without these risk factors, testing should commence at age 45 years. If tests are normal, they should be repeated at least every three years. To test for pre-diabetes or diabetes, a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with a 75-g glucose load, or both, are appropriate. An OGTT may be considered for patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) to better assess diabetes risk. For those identified with pre-diabetes, it is advisable to identify and, if appropriate, treat other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.

- **Screening vs. diagnostic testing**: For many illnesses, there is a major distinction between screening and diagnostic testing. However, for diabetes, the same tests are used for both screening and diagnosis. Type 2 diabetes has a long asymptomatic phase with significant clinical risk markers. Identification of diabetes can occur across a spectrum of scenarios, from a low-risk individual who undergoes routine glucose testing, to a higher-risk individual tested due to high suspicion of diabetes, to the symptomatic patient. This discussion primarily focuses on testing for diabetes in asymptomatic individuals, and it should be noted that testing for diabetes will also identify individuals with pre-diabetes.

- **Testing for pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults**: Type 2 diabetes is frequently not diagnosed until after significant complications have developed. Therefore, proactive testing is crucial in detecting the disease early on.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^1154km5Y]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 1, and more specifically with respect to HbA1c and blood glucose, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend restricting point-of-care A1C testing for diabetes screening and diagnosis to devices approved for diagnosis by the U.S. FDA. This testing should be conducted at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratories that perform testing of moderate complexity or higher, executed by trained personnel.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^114D3CP7]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend monitoring patients with presymptomatic T1DM for disease progression. This should be done using HbA1c approximately every 6 months and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which includes fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose, annually. The frequency of monitoring should be modified based on an individual risk assessment that considers factors such as age, the number and type of autoantibodies present, and glycemic metrics.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: A consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: A consensus statement of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^114dK8ee]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Tier 1: well-validated core therapies represent the best-established, most effective, and cost-effective therapeutic strategy for achieving target glycemic goals. The tier one algorithm is the preferred route of therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes.

- **Step 1: Lifestyle intervention and metformin**: Based on the numerous demonstrated short- and long-term benefits that accrue when weight loss and increased levels of activity are achieved and maintained, as well as the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle interventions when they succeed, the consensus is that lifestyle interventions should be initiated as the first step in treating new-onset type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2). These interventions should be implemented by health care professionals with appropriate training — usually registered dietitians experienced in behavioral modification — and should be sensitive to ethnic and cultural differences among populations. Moreover, lifestyle interventions to improve glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels, and to promote weight loss or at least avoid weight gain, should remain an underlying theme throughout the management of type 2 diabetes, even after medications are used. For the 10–20% of patients with type 2 diabetes who are not obese or overweight, modification of dietary composition and activity levels may play a supporting role, but medications are still generally required early in the course of diabetes (see below).

The authors recognize that for most individuals with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle interventions fail to achieve or maintain the metabolic goals either.

### Impact of A1C screening criterion on the diagnosis of pre-diabetes among U.S. adults [^115iYHtN]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The revised 2010 ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes include three options for identifying patients at high risk for diabetes: FPG, A1C, and OGTT. Previously, IFG has been far preferred over IGT owing to its logistical advantages. Because A1C has significant practical advantages over IFG, it is likely to become the preferred test among primary care providers for diagnosing pre-diabetes. The clinical impact of this change is not yet known, but the analysis suggests that it will substantially alter the population identified as having pre-diabetes, with tens of millions of Americans who would have been considered to have pre-diabetes previously being classified as not having pre-diabetes. This subgroup of individuals includes a substantial number with fasting glucose levels of 110–125 mg/dl and a burden of cardiovascular risk factors similar to that of their counterparts with pre-diabetes by A1C and IFG. The impact of not identifying these individuals is unclear. Policymakers and clinicians will need to consider the tradeoffs between performing both FPG and A1C testing alone or in combination.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2013 [^116FCnUd]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) have been characterized as having prediabetes, indicating a relatively high risk for the future development of diabetes. IFG and IGT should not be viewed as clinical entities in their own right but rather as risk factors for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD). They are associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension.

As is the case with glucose measures, several prospective studies that used A1C to predict progression to diabetes demonstrated a strong, continuous association between A1C and subsequent diabetes. In a systematic review of 44,203 individuals from 16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years (range 2.8–12 years), those with an A1C between 5.5% and 6.0% had a substantially increased risk of diabetes, with 5-year incidences ranging from 9 to 25%. An A1C range of 6.0–6.5% was associated with a 5-year risk of developing diabetes between 25% to 50% and a relative risk (RR) 20 times higher compared with an A1C of 5.0%. In a community-based study of Black and White adults without diabetes, baseline A1C was a stronger predictor of subsequent diabetes and cardiovascular events than fasting glucose. Other analyses suggest that an A1C of 5.7% is associated with diabetes risk similar to that in the high-risk participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).

Hence, it is reasonable to consider an A1C range of 5.7–6.4% as identifying individuals with prediabetes.

### Limited overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia as defined by A1C 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance [^1118hANQ]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The comparison of the prevalences of intermediate hyperglycemia (IH) as diagnosed by A1C 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), showed that isolated forms of prediabetes are common at the population level. Differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors were observed between the groups defined by isolated A1C (i-A1C), isolated IFG (i-IFG), and isolated IGT (i-IGT). Individuals with A1C 5.7–6.4% and normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were characterized by higher body mass index (BMI), central obesity, and a more adverse lipid profile.

The comparability of A1C 5.7–6.4% with IFG and IGT as markers of IH, particularly regarding associated CVD risk factors, is not well known. Data from previous studies using A1C and OGTT for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes have been controversial regarding the cardiovascular risk profile. In the Telde Study, Spanish subjects diagnosed with A1C were characterized by higher BMI, waist circumference, and lower levels of HDL cholesterol compared with the OGTT group. In contrast, in the Danish Inter99 study population, with a high prevalence of male smokers, individuals with A1C-defined diabetes were leaner and had a higher prevalence of lipid abnormalities compared with the OGTT group. Our results align with those of the Telde Study, indicating that individuals classified with a prediabetic A1C of 5.7–6.4% were characterized by higher BMI, waist circumference, and triglycerides, and lower HDL cholesterol levels. Further studies in different populations are required to evaluate the finding that the different markers seem to identify, in part, different individuals.

The advantage of using A1C lies in its less day-to-day variability compared with OGTT. The 2-hour glucose levels have higher variability.

### Detection of abnormal glucose tolerance in Africans is improved by combining A1C with fasting glucose: the Africans in America study [^116wsxHr]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

The rising incidence of abnormal glucose tolerance in sub-Saharan Africa necessitates the effective diagnosis of this condition. Both hemoglobin A1c and its combination with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) are utilized to diagnose abnormal glucose tolerance. It is crucial to evaluate the diagnostic effectiveness of A1C in Africans with heterozygous variant hemoglobin, such as sickle cell trait or hemoglobin C trait. In the U.S.-based African cohort, we assessed the sensitivities associated with hemoglobin status for the following conditions: 1) FPG ≥ 5.6 mmol/L, 2) A1C ≥ 5.7% (39 mmol/mol), and 3) a combination of FPG and A1C (FPG ≥ 5.6 mmol/L and/or A1C ≥ 5.7% [39 mmol/mol]) to detect abnormal glucose tolerance.

An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted on 216 African immigrants (68% male, mean age 37 ± 10 years, age range 20–64 years). Abnormal glucose tolerance was defined as having a 2-hour glucose level ≥ 7.8 mmol/L.

Variant hemoglobin presence was identified in 21% (46 of 216) of the participants, while abnormal glucose tolerance was observed in 33% (72 of 216) of them. Upon assessing abnormal glucose tolerance from the OGTT (2-hour glucose ≥ 7.8 mmol/L), the sensitivities of FPG in the total, normal, and variant hemoglobin groups were 32%, 32%, and 33%, respectively. Sensitivities for A1C were 53%, 54%, and 47%. When FPG and A1C were combined, sensitivities increased to 64%, 63%, and 67%. These sensitivities did not significantly vary by hemoglobin status (all P > 0.6). Across the cohort, the sensitivity was higher for A1C compared to FPG and was higher for the combined tests than for each test individually (all P values ≤ 0.01).

In conclusion, no significant difference was found in the sensitivity of A1C based on variant hemoglobin status.

### Egrifta SV [^117GK4P8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus**: Egrifta SV treatment can result in glucose intolerance. During clinical trials, the percentages of patients with elevated HbA1c (≥ 6.5%) from baseline to Week 26 were 5% and 1% in the Egrifta and placebo groups, respectively. An increased risk of developing diabetes with Egrifta (HbA1c level ≥ 6.5%) relative to placebo was observed, with an intent-to-treat hazard odds ratio of 3.3 (CI 1.4, 9.6).

	- Evaluate glucose status prior to initiating Egrifta SV. Monitor all patients treated with Egrifta SV periodically to diagnose those who develop impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. If patients treated with Egrifta SV develop glucose intolerance or diabetes, consider discontinuing Egrifta SV in patients who do not show a clear efficacy response.

	- Egrifta SV increases IGF-1; monitor patients with diabetes who are receiving treatment with Egrifta SV at regular intervals for potential development or worsening of retinopathy.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 4% of patients treated with Egrifta in clinical trials. Reactions included pruritus, erythema, flushing, urticaria, and rash. In cases of suspected hypersensitivity reactions, advise patients to seek prompt medical attention and immediately discontinue treatment with Egrifta SV.

- **Injection site reactions**: Egrifta SV treatment may cause injection site reactions, including injection site erythema, pruritus, pain, irritation, and bruising. The incidence of injection site reactions was 25% in Egrifta-treated patients and 14% in placebo-treated patients.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^115zZayD]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 1, particularly concerning glycemic targets in pregnant patients, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend fasting, preprandial, and postprandial blood glucose monitoring to achieve optimal glucose levels. The glucose goals are set as follows: fasting blood glucose (FBG) < 95 mg/dL (< 5.3 mmol/L), and either 1-hour postprandial glucose < 140 mg/dL (< 7.8 mmol/L) or 2-hour postprandial glucose < 120 mg/dL (< 6.7 mmol/L).

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2010 [^115gZ4Kh]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Individuals with an A1C of 5.7–6.4% should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and counseled on effective strategies to lower their risks [see IV. PREVENTION/DELAY OF TYPE 2 DIABETES]. As with glucose measurements, the continuum of risk is curvilinear, so as A1C rises, the risk of diabetes increases disproportionately. Accordingly, interventions should be most intensive, and follow-up should be particularly vigilant for those with an A1C > 6.0%, who should be considered at very high risk. However, just as an individual with a fasting glucose of 98 mg/dl (5.4 mmol/l) may not be at negligible risk for diabetes, individuals with an A1C < 5.7% may still be at risk, depending on the level of A1C and the presence of other risk factors such as obesity and family history.

*Categories of increased risk for diabetes*:

- **A1C level 5.7–6.4%**: Increased risk for diabetes and CVD
- **A1C level > 6.0%**: Very high risk
- **A1C level < 5.7%**: Risk depends on other factors (e.g. obesity, family history)

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2009 [^114cysUG]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Testing for pre-diabetes and diabetes in asymptomatic patients should be considered in adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. In the absence of these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45 years. If tests are normal, repeat testing should be conducted at least at 3-year intervals. To test for pre-diabetes or diabetes, an FPG test, 2-hour OGTT (75-g glucose load), or both are appropriate. An OGTT may be considered in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) to better define the risk of diabetes. In those identified with pre-diabetes, it is important to identify and, if appropriate, treat other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2012 [^111HCFZq]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) have been referred to as having prediabetes, indicating the relatively high risk for the future development of diabetes. IFG and IGT should not be viewed as clinical entities in their own right but rather as risk factors for diabetes, as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD). IFG and IGT are associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension.

Several prospective studies that used A1C to predict the progression to diabetes demonstrated a strong, continuous association between A1C and subsequent diabetes. In a systematic review of 44,203 individuals from 16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years (range 2.8–12 years), those with an A1C between 5.5 and 6.0% had a substantially increased risk of diabetes, with 5-year incidences ranging from 9–25%. An A1C range of 6.0 to 6.5% had a 5-year risk of developing diabetes between 25 to 50% and a relative risk 20 times higher compared with an A1C of 5.0%. In a community-based study of Black and White adults without diabetes, baseline A1C was a stronger predictor of subsequent diabetes and cardiovascular events than fasting glucose. Other analyses suggest that an A1C of 5.7% is associated with a diabetes risk similar to that of the high-risk participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).

Hence, it is reasonable to consider an A1C range of 5.7 to 6.4% as identifying individuals with a high risk for future diabetes, a state that may be referred to as prediabetes.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2012 [^116Li4vD]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Recommended glycemic goals for many nonpregnant adults correlate with achieving an A1C of < 7%. The issue of pre- versus postprandial SMBG targets is complex. Elevated postchallenge (2-h OGTT) glucose values have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of FPG in some epidemiological studies. In diabetic subjects, measures of vascular pathology, such as endothelial dysfunction, are negatively affected by postprandial hyperglycemia. It is clear that postprandial hyperglycemia, like preprandial hyperglycemia, contributes to elevated A1C levels, with its relative contribution being higher at A1C levels closer to 7%.

However, outcome studies have shown that A1C is the primary predictor of complications. Landmark glycemic control trials such as the DCCT and UKPDS relied overwhelmingly on preprandial SMBG. Additionally, an RCT in patients with known CVD found no cardiovascular benefit of insulin regimens targeting postprandial glucose compared with those targeting preprandial glucose. For individuals with premeal glucose values within target but with A1C values above target, monitoring postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) 1–2 hours after the start of the meal and aiming for PPG values to be < 180 mg/dL may help lower A1C. This approach is a reasonable recommendation for postprandial testing and targets. Glycemic goals for children are provided in another section.

### Limited overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia as defined by A1C 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance [^111BjbF3]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

We compared the prevalences and overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia (IH), defined by hemoglobin A1C 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

- **Research design and methods**: Oral glucose tolerance test results and A1C measurements were evaluated as markers of IH in an unselected cohort of 486 nondiabetic adults from Finland.

- **Results**: The overall prevalence of IH was 34%. Prevalences of isolated A1C 5.7–6.4%, IGT, and IFG were 8.0%, 13.2%, and 4.5%, respectively. Overlap between these three markers was uncommon. Isolated A1C 5.7–6.4% was associated with a higher BMI compared with isolated IFG and IGT and with a more adverse lipid profile compared with isolated IFG.

- **Conclusions**: Prevalence of isolated IH was high, with limited overlap between the definitions. Differences in cardiovascular disease risk factors were observed among the groups. This study demonstrates that an A1C of 5.7–6.4% detects, in part, different individuals with IH compared with IFG and IGT.
