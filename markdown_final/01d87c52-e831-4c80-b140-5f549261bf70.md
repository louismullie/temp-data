## Question

Chlothiasis treatment without sign acute gallbladder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage cholelithiasis in the absence of signs of acute gallbladder inflammation, specifically addressing cases of asymptomatic or symptomatic biliary colic without acute cholecystitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the clinical scenario and confirm the absence of acute cholecystitis. Then, I should verify the natural history and complication risk to frame counseling. Next, I will review evidence for expectant management versus cholecystectomy, including randomized trials and cost-effectiveness. After that, I need to outline a practical management algorithm, including when to image for choledocholithiasis and how to handle special populations. Finally, I should double-check areas of controversy and ensure the recommendations align with contemporary guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification so I don't jump to conclusions: the phrase "without signs of acute gallbladder" most plausibly refers to either asymptomatic cholelithiasis or symptomatic biliary colic without systemic inflammatory features or imaging evidence of acute cholecystitis, which I should explicitly distinguish from acute calculous cholecystitis that warrants early surgery when feasible [^115MsxNQ].

> I need to check the natural history to anchor risk counseling. Most people with gallstones remain asymptomatic, with an annual risk of developing symptoms around 2–4% and a low annual risk of complications such as acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis on the order of 1–3% in symptomatic cohorts, which supports expectant management in truly asymptomatic patients [^113NB7Ht] [^112n3CtX].

> Hold on, let's not conflate symptomatic with complicated disease. I should confirm that the absence of fever, leukocytosis, CRP elevation, and supportive ultrasound findings argues against acute cholecystitis, and that biliary colic alone does not mandate urgent surgery, though it does increase the likelihood of future symptoms and complications compared with asymptomatic disease [^111Dzo9D] [^113NB7Ht].

> Next, I should review the evidence for expectant management versus surgery. Randomized data show that among patients with symptomatic uncomplicated gallstones, conservative management can be safe for at least 18 months, with about 70% avoiding surgery at 24 months in C-GALL, though a meaningful proportion ultimately cross over to cholecystectomy, and long-term Norwegian data suggest roughly half never need surgery over 14 years, albeit with a higher complication risk than immediate surgery in some analyses [^113NB7Ht] [^116LRZq7] [^114RF6Bn].

> Wait, let me verify the counterpoint. Surgery remains the definitive therapy and resolves biliary colic in most patients, but persistent non-biliary pain is common after cholecystectomy, and cost-effectiveness analyses generally favor surgery at the population level despite higher upfront costs, so shared decision-making is essential to align with patient preferences and risk tolerance [^1144c8H9] [^114RF6Bn].

> I should double-check the timing nuance. Although early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard for acute cholecystitis, that principle does not automatically apply to uncomplicated biliary colic without inflammation, where elective timing after stabilization and shared decision-making is appropriate, and delayed surgery after an interval is reasonable if chosen [^115MsxNQ] [^114n7kqX].

> Let me consider special populations before finalizing. In children and adolescents, management is heterogeneous and often more conservative, with delayed surgery common and outcomes comparable in observational cohorts, though emerging data suggest prolonged delays may increase readmissions and complications, so pediatric-specific pathways and early interdisciplinary discussion are prudent [^116GMBC8] [^116UPgZS].

> I will now examine the practical management algorithm for asymptomatic patients. Confirm lack of symptoms, counsel on the low annual risk of symptoms and complications, avoid prophylactic cholecystectomy in standard-risk patients, and arrange watchful waiting with education on warning signs such as fever, persistent pain, jaundice, or pancreatitis symptoms that would prompt reassessment and intervention [^113KdHCe] [^113NB7Ht].

> For symptomatic biliary colic without acute cholecystitis, I should confirm the diagnosis with ultrasound and basic labs, offer analgesia with NSAIDs as first-line when not contraindicated given their superior pain control versus placebo and possible reduction in short-term complications, and discuss elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the preferred definitive option versus a trial of conservative management with clear return precautions and follow-up [^1177RydH] [^117UtTyq] [^113NB7Ht].

> But wait, what if choledocholithiasis is suspected? I need to ensure I do not rely on liver tests alone and instead apply risk stratification for common bile duct stones, using clinical predictors and, when indicated, second-level imaging such as EUS or MRCP or intraoperative cholangiography based on local expertise, reserving preoperative ERCP for high-risk patients to minimize unnecessary invasive procedures [^117TB6w6] [^116yRz7a].

> I should confirm that if a patient declines surgery or is high risk, nonoperative management with observation and symptom control is acceptable, recognizing the higher long-term recurrence risk and the potential need for rescue interventions. This trade-off should be documented in shared decision-making discussions and revisited periodically [^114RF6Bn] [^112n3CtX].

> Hold on, I should verify areas of uncertainty. Persistent pain after cholecystectomy occurs in a substantial minority, likely reflecting non-biliary etiologies or patient selection issues, and restrictive strategies can reduce operations but may not improve pain outcomes, reinforcing the need for careful preoperative counseling and, in some cases, stepwise selection criteria to optimize benefit [^1144c8H9] [^1134RJ4A].

> In summary, I need to ensure the plan matches the clinical state: for asymptomatic cholelithiasis, expectant management with education is standard. For symptomatic biliary colic without acute cholecystitis, offer NSAID-based analgesia and a shared decision-making conversation about elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus a closely monitored conservative approach, with imaging for choledocholithiasis when risk factors are present and special consideration in pediatrics and high-risk patients [^113NB7Ht] [^1177RydH] [^116yRz7a] [^116GMBC8].

For cholelithiasis without signs of acute cholecystitis, **expectant management** is appropriate: no immediate surgery or antibiotics are needed unless symptoms or complications arise [^113NB7Ht]. Patients should be counseled on the **low annual risk of complications** (about 1–3%) and advised to seek care if they develop persistent pain, fever, jaundice, or nausea/vomiting [^113NB7Ht]. Lifestyle measures (weight control, low-fat diet, regular meals) may reduce symptoms, and NSAIDs are first-line for biliary colic [^1177RydH]. Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered if symptoms are frequent, severe, or impair quality of life, or if risk factors for complications are present (e.g. diabetes, large stones, prior pancreatitis) [^notfound]. Routine follow-up is not required; patients should have a low threshold to re-evaluate if symptoms change [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Patients with cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis typically present with **biliary colic** — intermittent right upper quadrant or epigastric pain lasting 1–5 hours, often after fatty meals — without systemic signs of infection or inflammation [^112n3CtX]. Diagnosis is confirmed by **ultrasound**, the first-line imaging modality for detecting gallstones and assessing gallbladder morphology [^111cihJ4].

---

## Management strategies

### Expectant management (watchful waiting)

Expectant management is appropriate for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients without signs of acute cholecystitis [^116LRZq7]. Key points include:

- **Annual risk of complications**: Approximately 1–3% per year, including acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis [^113NB7Ht].

- **Patient education**: Patients should be informed about symptoms of complications (persistent pain, fever, jaundice, nausea/vomiting) and advised to seek immediate medical attention if these occur [^notfound].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight control, low-fat diet, and regular meals may reduce symptom frequency and severity [^notfound].

---

### Medical management

Medical therapy is primarily aimed at symptom control and is **not curative**:

- **Pain control**: NSAIDs are first-line for biliary colic; opioids may be used if NSAIDs are contraindicated or ineffective [^1177RydH].

- **Oral dissolution therapy**: Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) may be considered for small, cholesterol-rich stones in patients who cannot undergo surgery, though efficacy is limited and recurrence is common after cessation [^112n3CtX].

---

### Surgical management

Surgical intervention is **not indicated in asymptomatic patients** but may be considered in symptomatic patients or those with risk factors for complications:

- **Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy**: Recommended for patients with frequent or severe symptoms, impaired quality of life, or risk factors such as diabetes, large gallstones (> 3 cm), or prior pancreatitis [^113RHftk].

- **Timing**: Elective cholecystectomy can be scheduled based on patient preference and clinical judgment, as there is no urgency in the absence of acute cholecystitis [^116LRZq7].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Routine follow-up is not required for asymptomatic patients managed expectantly. Patients should be advised to **seek medical attention if symptoms change** or complications arise [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education is essential to ensure adherence to expectant management and early recognition of complications. Counseling should cover:

- **Symptom recognition**: Educate patients on signs of acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis [^115Dg4WG].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Emphasize weight control, dietary changes, and regular meals [^notfound].

- **Follow-up**: Encourage patients to seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop [^notfound].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Management approach** | **Indications** | **Interventions** |
|-|-|-|
| Expectant management | Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients without acute cholecystitis | - Watchful waiting <br/> - Patient education <br/> - Lifestyle modifications |
| Medical management | Symptomatic patients (biliary colic) | - NSAIDs for pain <br/> - UDCA for small cholesterol stones |
| Surgical management | - Frequent or severe symptoms <br/> - Impaired quality of life <br/> - Risk factors for complications | Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy |

---

Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis is managed primarily with **expectant management**, symptom control, and patient education. Elective cholecystectomy is reserved for symptomatic patients or those with risk factors for complications.

Materials and methods

The incremental cost-effectiveness of the new strategy, restrictive care, compared with the usual care strategy was analyzed, complying a healthcare perspective for a time horizon of one year. A decision analytic model was used with effectiveness expressed as absence of abdominal pain and costs in Euros (indexed to 2014). Models were built and analyzed using the decision analysis program TreeAge Software, Inc Williamstown, MA, USA, 2014 version (Fig. 1). The study was approved by the medical ethics committee, and informed consent for this modeling study was not needed.

Fig. 1
Decision model

Cost-effectiveness model and model input

Cholecystectomy or watchful waiting was the treatment possibilities in both strategies. In the usual care strategy, the indication for cholecystectomy was left to the preference of the treating surgeon, thus without fixed selection criteria. In the restrictive care strategy, the indication for cholecystectomy was only made after meeting criteria as described above.

Table 1 shows the variables used as input and the specific data sources. A database of a prospective multicenter cohort study was used for the probability of getting a cholecystectomy. In this database, all patients with cholelithiasis referred for cholecystectomy that visited the departments of surgery of one tertiary referral center and two non-academic teaching hospitals between June 2012 and June 2014 were recorded. The same prospective database was used for the probability of meeting the proposed criteria and the relief of upper abdominal pain afterward. The relief of pain after cholecystectomy in usual care was based on a systematic review. Following a healthcare perspective, we only used direct medical costs for analysis. A previous study and existing guideline prices for the Netherlands were used to value an outpatient clinic visit, a cholecystectomy including an overnight stay, and surgical complications. Application of the criteria itself for cholecystectomy in the restrictive care strategy did not lead to additional costs in itself.

Table 1
Basic input variables and sources used in the decision model (shown in Fig. 1)

For every modeling, study assumptions need to be made, which were the following in this study: Watchful waiting included an extra outpatient clinic visit made within 1 year in accordance with our clinical practice to reevaluate the patient' symptoms. Additional diagnostic work-up is patient-dependent and only rarely applied and is therefore not included in this model.

### Acute cholecystitis: WSES position statement [^113R8ekX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The management of acute calculous cholecystitis still offers room for debate in terms of diagnosis, severity scores, treatment options and timing for surgery.

Material and Methods

A systematic review about the treatment of acute cholecystitis has been completed. The recommendations of recent guidelines have also been examined taking into account the results of the review.

Results

The evidence available in the literature supports the recommendation about laparoscopic cholecystectomy as treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis. Surgery should be performed as soon as possible after the diagnosis because early treatment reduces total hospital stay and does not increase complication or conversion rates. The antibiotics can play different roles and attention should be posed to the risk of emerging resistance. A surgical or percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder is advocated by some authors in the advanced forms of inflammation or patients with severe co-morbidities; however, the available evidence does not support it, and further studies are necessary to clarify its role.

### Effect of statin use on outcome of symptomatic cholelithiasis: a case-control study [^111QAvfP]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

A total of 1,140 consecutive patients with symptomatic gallstones were admitted to Kuopio University Hospital, Finland, from 2008–2010. The hospital serves an area of 243,000 inhabitants. A total of 272 of 1,140 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis underwent statin therapy. The age- and sex-matched controls (n = 272) were randomly selected from the cohort of patients without statin therapy. Patient data were obtained from the hospital records using the following discharge diagnoses (ICD 10): K80 (cholelithiasis), K81 (cholecystitis), K82 (other disease of gallbladder) or K83 (other diseases of biliary tract). The imaging study results (i.e. computed tomography, abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiography) were analyzed. Additional work-ups included a detailed clinical history with records of recent infectious diseases, abdominal traumas, surgery, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), as well as data concerning comorbidities and medicine use on arrival. The laboratory data included serum calcium, lipids, liver enzymes and C-reactive protein measurements. The duration of hospital stay, need for intensive care treatment and one-month hospital mortality (2008–2010) were recorded. Data concerning the treatment type (e.g. conservative, laparoscopic, open surgery, conversions, cholecystostomy, and choledochotomies), surgical durations, elective vs. emergency operations, complications, bleeding and number of re-operations were collected from the patients records.

Surgery was performed in both study groups using the same operative principles and by the same group of surgeons. There were no between-group differences in the preoperative or perioperative treatments or procedures. Emergency cholecystectomy was performed if ultrasonography or clinical examination and laboratory parameters revealed signs of cholecystitis in and if the patient was suitable for operation, according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification system. If possible, perioperative cholangiography was always performed in acute cholecystitis. Cholecystectomy was primarily performed laparoscopically. In patients with very old age and severe comorbidities, percutaneous cholecystostomy was performed. In patients with long histories of cholecystitis symptoms, the treatment was first conservative, and elective laparoscopy was performed later. According to the Finnish legislation, no ethical assessment or approval is mandatory for a register-based study. As this is a retrospective register study, informed consent from the patients was not needed.

### Aetiology, diagnosis and management for ischaemic cholecystitis: current perspectives [^115uAx9r]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the absence of gallstones or any other form of mechanical obstruction, hypoperfusion to the gallbladder can lead to inflammation, ischaemia and perforation. This constellation of findings has historically been simply referred to as 'acalculous cholecystitis'. However, this term makes no distinction between inflammation due to critical illness and poor perfusion, or what we will refer to as ischaemic cholecystitis, versus other non-obstructive aetiologies. Ischaemic cholecystitis presents diagnostic as well as treatment challenges that are unique to patients in the critical care setting. More importantly, the morbidity and mortality of this proposed subcategory of acute gallbladder inflammation is much higher compared with other forms of acute cholecystitis. In the present manuscript, we introduce the concept of ischaemic cholecystitis and the importance of differentiating this clinical diagnosis from other forms of acalculous cholecystitis. Additionally, we elaborate on the most recent diagnostic modalities and treatment options specific to this vulnerable patient population.

### Surgical treatment for asymptomatic cholelithiasis… [^113KdHCe]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Question When is surgery indicated in patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis. Evidence-Based Answer Surgery should not be offered to patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis. Cholecystectomy may be beneficial for patients who are at high risk of biliary cancer, infection, or other complications, including younger patients and those with choledocholithiasis, sickle cell disease, gallstones larger than 3 cm, or significant immunosuppression. 3 Patients developed symptoms at a rate of approximately 1% to 2% per year. Complications were rare except when preceded by biliary colic. Complications typically include acute cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, acute pancreatitis, and gallstone ileus. 1 Compared with emergent cholecystectomy, elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy has lower rates of complications and conversion to open cholecystectomy. Case series and cohort studies indicate that complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy — although rare — include potentially severe bleeding, abscess, bile leak, common bile duct injury, and bowel injury. 6, 7. Patients who are at high risk of biliary cancer and other operative or disease-related complications may be offered prophylactic cholecystectomy if the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks of observation. 1, 5, 9 Patients with asymptomatic choledocholithiasis have a much higher risk of severe complications and should be offered prophylactic cholecystectomy.

1 All patients should be counseled about the symptoms of biliary colic, because most severe gallstone-related complications are preceded by these symptoms. 1.

### Indications of cholecystectomy in gallstone disease [^1161nQJr]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent studies showed new insights in the indication and timing of cholecystectomy in gallstone disease. This review will provide an overview.

Recent Findings

Considerable variations in indication for gallbladder surgery have been noticed leading to a significant number of unnecessary cholecystectomies. As a consequence, up to 33% of patients with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease have persistent abdominal pain after cholecystectomy. On the other hand, studies showed that certain patients with acute cholecystitis, common bile duct stones and biliary pancreatitis benefit from same admission instead of delayed cholecystectomy.

Summary

A critical view on indications for cholecystectomy in patients with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease prevents unnecessary cholecystectomies. In patients with mild-to-moderate complicated symptomatic gallstone disease, same-admission cholecystectomy reduces the risk of recurrent complications.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^116pcFZ3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Additionally, Curro et al. proposed to conduct cholecystectomies even in cases of asymptomatic cholelithiasis in patients with sickle cell disease. In symptomatic patients, association with increased operative time, morbidity rate, and postoperative stay could be revealed. However, these results are based on an observational study within a restricted number of 30 patients with cholelithiasis and sickle cell disease. Tannuri et al. observed within their retrospective study with the large time period of 17 years a high percentage of 25% of patients, presenting directly with a complication due to cholelithiasis. Pelizzo et al. most recently identified new diagnostic scores in a small population study to improve surgical timing. They see however that the lack of certain clinical background data causes a selection bias and therefore limits the interpretation of results. We observed 55% of the pediatric patients within our retrospective study being operated on in a time period of day 5–42 after acute signs of inflammation. In the pediatric subgroup, only one patient with acute cholecystitis was treated with a cholecystectomy within 24 h. The inflammatory process within this time slot might unnecessarily complicate surgeries, elongate operation time and cause intra- and postoperative complications. Recommendations of the adult guideline are thus not implemented and their respective value in pediatric management should be carefully discussed.

Furthermore, with this given preference for expectant management, the value of UDCA in pediatrics has to be carefully evaluated. According to the S3-guidelines, therapy with UDCA is recommended in asymptomatic patients. However, in pediatric practice, a relevant number of patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis receives UDCA for litholysis. Our results confirm the broad range of application in pediatric management without sufficient success. In 2008, Della Corte et al. claimed the ineffectiveness of UDCA in treatment of cholelithiasis, even though a significant relief of symptoms could be reported. This reduction of symptoms is also confirmed by Baran et al. who reported a study of 74 children, mostly responding to UDCA treatment within the first six months. Larger population studies are required to evaluate the real value of UDCA in pediatric patients.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaRight upper quadrant pain [^115opEoo]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Although right upper quadrant pain is a very common clinical presentation, it can be nonspecific. However, acute cholecystitis is very often the diagnosis of exclusion. This review focuses on the recommended imaging evaluation in the most commonly encountered clinical scenarios presenting with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, including suspected biliary disease, suspected acute cholecystitis, and suspected acalculous cholecystitis. This document hopes to clarify the appropriate utilization of the many imaging procedures that are available and commonly employed in these clinical settings. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^117VRkes]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most common abdominal surgical procedure, accounting for over 750 000 operations in the USA and approximately 70 000 operations in the UK each year. A recent studyof National Health Service data showed that the total number of cholecystectomies annually increased by 72.2 per cent between 2000 and 2019 (from 39 022 to 67 204). Although the number of laparoscopic cholecystectomies has increased over recent decades, international guidelineshave provided no reason to broaden the indication for surgery. The 5 per cent increase in the prevalence of gallbladder stones, from 15 to 20 per cent, does not explain the exponential increase in cholecystectomy numbers.

In Europe, approximately one-fifth of the population has gallbladder stones. The majority of gallbladder stones consist primarily of cholesterol (over 90 per cent), whereas a minority are black (bilirubin) and brown (bacterial products) pigmented stones. Predisposing factors include obesity, female sex, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, but only one in five develops symptoms. Symptomatic patients mostly suffer from typical symptoms of biliary colic. Frequent episodes of biliary colic or complicated gallstone disease (such as choledocholithiasis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis) are accepted indications for cholecystectomy. However, in most patients, gallstones remain without symptoms and are not the primary cause of abdominal pain. Patients with abdominal pain and uncomplicated symptomatic cholecystolithiasis are confronted with two options: wait and see or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, there is lack of consensus regarding selection of those who do or do not benefit from surgery, as 10–40 per cent of patients have persistent abdominal pain after operation. This provides the clinical equipoise to suggest an alternative strategy for better selection of patients for cholecystectomy.

The present review aimed to provide an overview of different guidelines and criteria sets for uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis; to summarize outcomes after cholecystectomy; and to give personalized advice on treatment decisions in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^115h3Bzp]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Whereas cholelithiasis is one of the most widespread diseases in adult visceral surgery, only little is known about specific factors of cholelithiasis and its complications in children and adolescents. We therefore primarily conducted a retrospective analysis of our own patients' cohort, differentiating between pediatric and adult management. While an elevated BMI is estimated as one of the important risk factors in the development of adult cholelithiasis, other diagnoses such as metabolic disorders, parenteral nutrition, cystic fibrosis, hemolytic diseases and malignancies are strongly correlated with pediatric gallstones. We can confirm this through the findings of the retrospective analysis, as concomitant diseases are correlated with the pediatric surgery subgroup and obesity with the visceral surgery subgroup. Etiology and predisposing factors of cholelithiasis in pediatric patients are recommended to be discussed carefully. They may ultimately have an influence on interdisciplinary therapeutic decisions and management should be discussed within a pediatric guideline.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^116LRZq7]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

The results of the C-GALL trial add to existing evidence. Two small Norwegian randomised controlled trials with a total of 201 participants found that 55% of people randomised to observation did not require an operation during the 14 year follow-up period, and 12% of people randomised to cholecystectomy did not undergo the scheduled procedure. This contrasts with 70% randomised to conservative management not undergoing surgery at 24 months in the current trial and 30% in the surgery group not undergoing cholecystectomy.

The SECURE (restrictive strategy versus usual care for cholecystectomy in patients with gallstones and abdominal pain) trialwas a non-inferiority multicentre randomised controlled trial in the Netherlands to assess the effects of immediate cholecystectomy versus a restrictive strategy. Participants underwent cholecystectomy only when they fulfilled five prespecified surgery criteria at clinic visits. The authors reported that 7.7% fewer patients had cholecystectomies with the restrictive strategy, but 37% in both groups continued with abdominal pain. The investigators concluded that the current surgical management of patients with gallstone disease and abdominal symptoms is suboptimal, that a restrictive policy is not a solution, and that doctors need to be more careful in advising a surgical approach to patients with symptoms of gallstone disease. The findings of the C-GALL trial are consistent with the conclusions of the SECURE trial and provide stronger evidence from a broader range of patients, as the current trial enrolled participants with biliary colic or acute cholecystitis (SECURE only focused on biliary colic).

Policy implications

Current clinical guidelines recommend laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary pain or acute cholecystitis and radiological evidence of gallstones. Hence, laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the first line treatment for people with symptomatic gallstone disease and is one of the most common elective surgical procedures performed in the NHS. The C-GALL trial found that in adults presenting with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease to secondary care, conservative management may be effective and cost effective than surgery. The study found it is safe to manage patients conservatively for at least 18 months. The crossover between groups suggested that it remains key to identifying patients who require surgery. As healthcare professionals often underestimate surgical risks, and post-cholecystectomy syndrome may occur, a discussion about conservative management should form part of a patient's decision making and consent process.

### Efficacy and safety of B-mode ultrasound-guided percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage combined with laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis in elderly and high-risk patients [^1118E9qu]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cholecystitis (AC) is an inflammatory gallbladder disease caused by the obstruction and bacterial invasion of the cystic duct, and more than 90% of AC cases are associated with cholelithiasis or gallstones. The incidence of AC increases with age and shows dramatic gender differences, at 11.5% in men and 22.4% in women by age 60, and AC is the most common cause of acute abdominal surgeries in the elderly. Elderly AC patients have higher postoperative mortality and morbidity rates, increased complication rates, longer length of hospital stays and longer recovery times. In most AC patients, laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) can rapidly relieve the signs and symptoms of inflammation within 48–72 h. Nevertheless, in elderly AC patients with other life-threatening comorbidities, considered as the high-risk AC group, LC can lead to high morbidity of up to 41% and mortality of up to 4.5% during the acute phase. In case of severe or complex cholecystitis in elderly AC patients, LC treatment is associated with higher rates of conversion to open cholecystectomy, with increased postoperative complications and longer lengths of hospital stay. For example, in elderly and high-risk AC patients, the perioperative mortality rate is high at 19% for emergency cholecystectomy. Further, in several instances in elderly and high-risk patients, it is difficult to complete LC procedure because of severe pericholecystic inflammation.

### Hepato-pancreato-biliary emergencies for the acute care surgeon: etiology, diagnosis and treatment [^111bo4Q4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) emergencies include an ample range of conditions with overlapping clinical presentations and diverse therapeutic options. The most common etiologies are related to cholelithiasis (acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis) and non-traumatic injuries (common bile duct or duodenal). Although the true incidence of HPB emergencies is difficult to determine due to selection and reporting biases, a population-based report showed a decline in the global incidence of all severe complications of cholelithiasis, primarily based on a reduction in acute cholecystitis. Even though patients may present with overlapping symptoms, treatment options can be varied. The treatment of these conditions continues to evolve and patients may require endoscopic, surgical, and/or percutaneous techniques. Thus, it is essential that a multidisciplinary team of HPB surgeons, interventional gastroenterologists and radiologists are available on an as needed basis to the Acute Care Surgeon. This focused manuscript is a contemporary review of the literature surrounding HPB emergencies in the context of the acute care surgeon. The main aim of this review is to offer an update of the diagnosis and management of HPB issues in the acute care setting to improve the care of patients with potential HPB emergencies.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113NB7Ht]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Gallstone disease (cholelithiasis) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders worldwide, with clinical surveys suggesting prevalence rates of 6% to 25% and a tendency to increase with age. Gallstones are more common in women. A clinical ultrasound survey in the UK reported prevalence rates of 12% and 22% among men and women older than 60 years, respectively.

In the UK and North America, the number of surgical procedures for gallstone disease increased steadily between the 1950s and 1990s, reflecting the rise in prevalence and prompt identification of gallstone disease and the use of cholecystectomy as the treatment of choice. Rates of surgical procedures stabilised in these countries towards the end of the 20th century. In England, about 61 000 episodes cost the NHS > £200m in 2018/19.

The natural course of gallstones is benign; most people remain asymptomatic and show a relatively low progression to symptomatic disease. A systematic review published in 2007 reported the range for disease progression as 10% to 25% in studies that followed-up patients after initial diagnosis (≤ 15 years of follow-up). The annual risk of developing symptoms has been estimated at 2–4%.

Most people with symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease do not develop complications; reported annual rates of developing complications (eg, acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, acute cholangitis obstructive jaundice) have been as low as 1–3%. The Italian Group for the Epidemiology and Prevention of Cholelithiasis study reported an annual incidence for complications of 0.7% in patients with symptoms.

Mortality from gallstone disease is rare — typically less than 1% from gallstone related causes.

### Cost-effectiveness of a new strategy to identify uncomplicated gallstone disease patients that will benefit from a cholecystectomy [^114ENny6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study showed that the strategy of using strict selection criteria may be a cost-effective method to reduce the proportion of patients with pain after cholecystectomy. The strategy of applying one out of two criteria resulted in a 4% higher mean proportion of patients with absence of pain compared to current practice with similar costs. The majority (54%) of the simulations resulted in the restricted care being dominant, meaning less expensive and more effective. In those simulations, the restrictive care strategy was more effective but also more expensive, and there was a fair maximum to be paid per extra patient with relief of abdominal pain. Application of the more stringent two out of two criteria resulted in a 3% lower mean proportion of patients with absence of pain, but against lower costs.

In a previous study, we showed that duration of pain of 1 year or less has a slightly higher odds ratio for absence of pain after cholecystectomy as compared to episodic abdominal pain (2.22 vs. 2.13), although this difference is not significant. Altogether we would recommend to implement the strategy of applying one out of two criteria. Application of these criteria would offer surgeons less room for personal preferences which patient to offer a cholecystectomy and which patient to treat conservatively. This strategy would therefore provide a tool for better patient selection for each treatment arm. A recent cost-effectiveness study reported in this journal comparing cholecystectomy with observation for uncomplicated symptomatic cholecystolithiasis or acute cholecystitis reported that cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment for symptomatic gallstones. On average, surgery costs £1236 (€1448; $1631) more per patient than conservative management, but was more effective. However, the study also reported that 55% of the patients randomized to the observation group did not require surgery indicating that it may be a valid alternative to surgery. Application of fixed criteria for cholecystectomy may increase the cost-effectiveness of cholecystectomy and conservative treatment as shown in this study.

### Surgical and nonsurgical management of gallstones [^112n3CtX]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis, or gallstones, is one of the most common and costly of all the gastrointestinal diseases. The incidence of gallstones increases with age. At-risk populations include persons with diabetes mellitus, persons who are obese, women, rapid weight cyclers, and patients on hormone therapy or taking oral contraceptives. Most patients are asymptomatic; gallstones are discovered incidentally during ultrasonography or other imaging of the abdomen. Asymptomatic patients have a low annual rate of developing symptoms (about 2% per year). Once symptoms appear, the usual presentation of uncomplicated gallstones is biliary colic, caused by the intermittent obstruction of the cystic duct by a stone. The pain is characteristically steady, is usually moderate to severe in intensity, is located in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant of the abdomen, lasts one to five hours, and gradually subsides. If pain persists with the onset of fever or high white blood cell count, it should raise suspicion for complications such as acute cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis, and ascending cholangitis. Ultrasonography is the best initial imaging study for most patients, although additional imaging studies may be indicated. The management of acute biliary colic mainly involves pain control with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or narcotic pain relievers. Oral dissolution therapy is usually minimally successful and used only if the patient cannot undergo surgery. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the surgical choice for symptomatic and complicated gallstones, with a shorter hospital stay and shorter convalescence period than open cholecystectomy. Percutaneous cholecystostomy is an alternative for patients who are critically ill with gallbladder empyema and sepsis.

### Tokyo guidelines 2018: diagnostic criteria and severity grading of acute cholecystitis (with videos) [^111Dzo9D]. Journal of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis" for acute cholecystitis and gallstone disease.

The diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis serve as a clinical tool for the identification and classification of this condition. The primary purpose of these criteria is to guide clinicians in diagnosing acute cholecystitis, a common and potentially serious gallbladder inflammation, and to stratify patients based on the severity of their symptoms.

The diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis are composed of local signs of inflammation, systemic signs of inflammation, and imaging findings. Local signs of inflammation include Murphy's sign and right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness. Systemic signs of inflammation encompass fever, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated white blood cell count. Imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis are also considered.

The diagnosis of definite acute cholecystitis is established if imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis are present, along with either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and any one of the systemic signs of inflammation. Suspected acute cholecystitis is diagnosed if either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and any one of the systemic signs of inflammation are present, but the characteristic imaging findings are not. If these criteria are not met, the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is not established.

These diagnostic criteria provide a structured approach to the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, aiding in the early identification and appropriate management of patients with this condition.

The diagnostic system for acute cholecystitis evaluates three categories of clinical signs: local signs of inflammation, systemic signs of inflammation, and imaging findings. Each category has specific options that, when selected, contribute to determining the likelihood of acute cholecystitis.

Here's how inputs are processed:

- **Local signs of inflammation**:

- Murphy's sign
- Right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness

- **Systemic signs of inflammation**:

- Fever
- Elevated C-reactive protein
- Elevated white blood cell count

- **Imaging findings**:

- Imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis

The diagnosis hinges on whether certain combinations of these indicators are present. The computation works as follows:

1. **If imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis (F) are confirmed, along with any local sign of inflammation (Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass/pain/tenderness) and at least one systemic sign of inflammation (fever, elevated C-reactive protein, or elevated white blood cell count), the patient meets the criteria for definite acute cholecystitis.**

2. **If any local sign of inflammation is observed along with any systemic sign and the imaging findings, this reinforces the suspected acute cholecystitis diagnosis. However, since this computation is logically identical to the criteria for definite acute cholecystitis, the system confirms the diagnosis right away.**

3. **If the conditions for definite or suspected acute cholecystitis are not fully met with the provided inputs, the system concludes that the criteria for acute cholecystitis are not satisfied.**

The system functions by evaluating the logical presence of these signs and symptoms, ensuring the assessment is grounded in established medical criteria. This method allows healthcare providers to systematically determine the likelihood of acute cholecystitis, guiding further diagnostic and therapeutic actions.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^116GMBC8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence of cholelithiasis in children and adolescents appears to be increasing, even if the entity remains to be a rare disease within this population. Prevalence is ranking between 0.13 and 1.9%. Diagnostic and therapeutic management seems to be heterogeneous in clinical practice and appears to be based on small population studies. In contrast, different guidelines apply to adults in various countries (e.g. Europe, Japan, USA). In Germany, guidelines by the German Societies for Digestive and Metabolic Diseases and for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract regulate the management of cholelithiasis in adults. Separate treatment guidelines in the pediatric sector on the basis of evidence-based large-scale population studies are either lacking, outdated or represent expert opinions of distinct hospitals (e.g. Sweden, Brazil, India, USA, Egypt, Iran). This is significant with regard to the timing of surgery. The guidelines for adult management updated in 2018 are based on the largest randomized trial in adults so far, the multi-center "Acute cholecystitis: early versus delayed cholecystectomy" trial. Even though the results are being controversially discussed, they recommend an early cholecystectomy within the first 48 h of symptoms of acute cholecystitis and an elective cholecystectomy in symptomatic cases without signs of inflammation.

Aiming at assessing the management and especially the surgical timing of this rare but increasing pediatric disease, we chose a dual approach in this study. Firstly, a retrospective analysis of patients with cholecystectomy was performed within our institution, comparing diagnostics and therapy of children and adolescents in the pediatric surgery department with the management of young patients (aged < 25 years) in the visceral surgery department. Secondarily, diagnostic and therapeutic standards of this entity were evaluated in pediatric patients using an online survey via the German Society of Pediatric Surgery.

### Clinical presentation, imaging, and management of acute cholecystitis [^114jQc8c]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a life-threatening emergency that commonly occurs as a complication of gallstones. Severe right upper quadrant pain, abdominal guarding, fever, and a positive Murphy's sign with an elevated white blood cell count are the classical clinical manifestations of AC. Although ultrasonography is typically the initial diagnostic examination in patients with suspected AC, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are commonly performed to identify complications; cholescintigraphy is recommended in patients with equivocal findings on the other imaging modalities, as this technique has the highest diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of AC. Imaging studies are also helpful in the timely detection of complications associated with AC. Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the gold-standard treatment for AC, percutaneous gallbladder drainage with or without cholecystostomy tube placement is a safe, effective management technique for surgically high-risk patients with multiple medical conditions. This treatment can be used as either a bridging therapy, with elective cholecystectomy performed at a later time after improvement of the patient's condition, or as definitive treatment in surgically unfit patients. Radiologists play a pivotal role in the initial diagnosis and management of patients with AC.

### Comprehensive review of the management of patients with acute cholecystitis who are ineligible for surgery [^114LBbeH]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Review the current literature for available treatments for acute cholecystitis (AC) in non-surgical candidates and provide guidelines for the management of these patients.

Background

Cholecystectomy is the gold standard treatment modality for AC. A considerable number of patients who are not eligible for surgery are managed by percutaneous and endoscopic techniques. There is recent data regarding endoscopic ultrasound-guided gallbladder drainage (EUS-GBD) and emerging percutaneous approaches to address cholelithiasis and remove drains.

Methods

An expert panel of surgeons, gastroenterologists, and interventional radiologists reviewed the current literature and provided recommendations for AC management in non-surgical candidates. Recommendations were based on relevant evidence, with quality and strength assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.

Results

Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) is advised for patients ineligible for lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) or with reversible conditions, aiming to bridge to cholecystectomy. The optimal timing of cholecystectomy after PC remains unclear. In cases where surgery is not feasible, potential definitive treatments such as percutaneous cholecysto-lithotripsy/lithectomy and cholecystoduodenal stenting should be considered. For calculous AC, EUS-GBD with LAMS is recommended as a therapy for never-surgical candidates if they are eligible for monitored anesthesia care or general anesthesia and there is institutional expertise and minimal intervening ascites.

Conclusions

The management of AC in non-surgical candidates remains a challenge, with institutional protocols varying based on physician preferences and expertise. The proposed protocol integrates percutaneous and endoscopic approaches and emphasizes the need for multidisciplinary collaboration. Further research is required to evaluate these evolving management techniques, as the current literature is limited.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^111cihJ4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Acute calculous cholecystitis

Cholelithiasis is a common disorder all over the world. Its prevalence varies widely by region: in Western countries, the prevalence of gallstone disease reportedly ranges from approximately 7.9% in men to 16.6% in women; in Asia, it ranges from approximately 3 to 15%, is nearly non-existent (less than 5%) in Africa, and ranges from 4.21 to 11% in China.

Acute cholecystitis develops in 1–3% of patients with symptomatic gallstones.

In 2016, WSES guidelines for the management of acute calculous cholecystitis (AAC) were published.

The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is made on the basis of clinical features such as right upper quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis and is supported by findings from relevant imaging studies. Ultrasound is the investigation of choice in patients suspected of having acute cholecystitis. Ultrasound typically shows pericholecystic fluid (fluid around the gall bladder), distended gall bladder, oedematous gallbladder wall, and gall stones, and Murphy's sign can be elicited on ultrasound examination. Treatment is predominantly surgical, although the timing of surgery without evidence of gangrene or perforation has been under debate in recent years. Two approaches are available for the treatment of acute cholecystitis: the early option, generally within 7 days of onset of symptoms, offers a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) to provide immediate, definitive surgical treatment after establishing diagnosis and surgical fitness of the patient in the same hospital admission, while the delayed treatment option is performed in a second hospital admission after an interval of 6–12 weeks during which time the acute inflammation settles.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^113GfcMy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The estimated overall prevalence of gallstones is 10–15% in the general population, with some differences across countries. Between 20 and 40% of patients with gallstones will develop gallstone-related complications, with an incidence of 1–3% annually; acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC) is the first clinical presentation in 10–15% of the cases. Cholecystectomy is the most common therapeutic approach for ACC and is considered the standard of care for gallstone disease for the majority of patients. However, considering the heterogeneity of clinical scenarios, the variability in hospital facilities and in the availability of expertise, the management of patients with right upper quadrant abdominal pain may vary.

In 2016, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) published the first edition of their guidelines for ACC, which presented different diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms, compared with the Tokyo Guidelines (TG), known at that time as Tokyo Guidelines 2013 (TG13). In particular, the direct link between diagnostic criteria for ACC, severity classification and therapeutic indications described in the TG13 are limited by lack of quality evidence. The approach of the WSES guidelines was to simplify the initial management of patients presenting with suspected ACC. The literature review, the discussion of the relevant evidence and the statements made during the consensus conference (CC) held in Jerusalem in 2015 (Third WSES International Congress) supported surgery as the gold standard treatment for all patients with ACC, with two exceptions: patients who refuse surgery, and patients for whom surgery would be considered as 'very high risk', although no clear consensus was reached on this second issue. Moreover, the 2016 WSES Guidelines on ACC included discussions on unclear areas, such as diagnosis, evaluation of the surgical risk and appropriate management of associated common bile duct stones (CBDS).

### Restrictive strategy vs usual care for cholecystectomy in patients with abdominal pain and gallstones: 5-year follow-up of the SECURE randomized clinical trial [^1134RJ4A]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the predominant treatment for patients with abdominal pain and gallstones, resulting in approximately 700 000 operations in the United States each year. While complicated cholelithiasis (ie, cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, biliary pancreatitis) is an indication for cholecystectomy, there is lack of consensus about patients with uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis (cholecystolithiasis) for who will benefit from surgery. To investigate the appropriateness and the benefit from a stepwise selection for cholecystectomy in patients with uncomplicated cholelithiasis, the Scrutinizing (In)efficient Use of Cholecystectomy, A Randomized Trial Concerning Variation in Practice, (SECURE trial) was initiated.

The SECURE trial compared usual care vs a restrictive strategy with stepwise selection for laparoscopic cholecystectomy based on the Rome III criteria for biliary colic. Between 2014 and 2017, the trial included 1067 patients and showed that the primary outcome of pain reduction was suboptimal for both usual care and the restrictive strategy. The restrictive strategy was associated with a reduction in cholecystectomies by 7.7% compared with usual care, but noninferiority regarding patients without persistent pain was not demonstrated: 321 of 536 patients (59.9%) following usual care vs 298 of 529 (56.3%) after a restrictive strategy (noninferiority P = 0.32). Two other randomized trials compared pain in patients after cholecystectomy vs conservative treatment. A Norwegian single-center study (n = 137) investigated prevalence of symptomatic events and showed that a watchful waiting strategy was shown to be a feasible option in 31% of patients during 14 years of follow-up. A recent multicenter study in the UK randomizing 434 patients to receive conservative management or surgery showed that 25% of the participants in the conservative arm and 67% in the surgical arm had received surgery at the 18-month follow-up. While there was no difference observed in 36-item Short Form score (SF-36)–based bodily pain score, results were constrained by the high number of patients who declined to participate and the short-term follow-up.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^11247nbf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The establishment of evidence-based pediatric guidelines is required in order to reduce insecurities and to deliver scientific facts on the basis of multicenter and prospective studies. These should not only focus on a diagnostic algorithm, but especially on the indications for expectant management versus surgical therapy and further therapeutic options in acute and chronic disease. In an effort to achieve an improved standardized treatment and to emphasize the consensus between pediatricians and pediatric surgeons until results of evidence-based pediatric guidelines are available, we illustrated a flow chart based on our findings and to encourage common strategies (Fig. 3). We especially excluded different marginal subgroups of patients, e.g. symptomatic patients with no clear association between symptoms and cholelithiasis. These may be the subject of subsequent research projects.

Limitations of the study have to be discussed carefully. Aimed at gaining insight into real therapeutic management, we are presenting a foundation for further research and are not able to add results of a large prospective study on this topic. Accordingly, one limitation of our presented retrospective research lies in the relatively small study population over a large period of time, which limits the informative value of our study. However, it reflects the still low incidence. Although representing the diverse patient spectrum in patients with cholelithiasis, the case mix and the variety of complications additionally limit the possibility to draw strong conclusions because of even smaller case numbers within subgroup analyses. Nevertheless, statistically significant differences between the two study groups have been obtained for several parameters of clinical relevance. Certainly, a type II error cannot be excluded for non-significant test results because of the minor statistical power. Furthermore, challenges in the interpretation of data are caused by two aspects of the study design. First, analysis of complicated cases is of special interest and must be seen with caution, as they are analyzed separately and within the whole study group. We aimed at distinguishing between these subgroups to emphasize the need for different management and surgical timing. Second, the study's approach was chosen from the therapeutic endpoint of cholecystectomy, which influences the selection of patients (bias). This study design was chosen based on rising numbers of cholecystectomies, which were not attributable to a changed therapeutic regimen with earlier indication for surgery. Finally, our study does therefore not include any aspects on the effects of an expectant management in asymptomatic cases, which might certainly be a relevant subgroup of patients with cholelithiasis. The presented online survey additionally showed a restricted response rate, but is in the range of other published online surveys. It was designed not to report exact numbers, but to deliver an insight in the current management and to create awareness for the lack of a guideline. This first ever online survey on this topic might therefore hold a high risk of recollection bias, as we asked for individual characteristics in practices. However, even from this restricted point of view, we observed a heterogeneous picture in the pediatric management with a tendency of delayed timing of surgery. We propose to conduct further prospective multicenter studies and international consensus conferences to further explore single aspects on diagnostics and therapy.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^1144c8H9]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

There is a lack of consensus in selecting patients who do or do not benefit from surgery when patients present with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones are present. This review aimed to give an overview of results from recent trials and available literature to improve treatment decisions in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis.

Methods

First, an overview of different symptom criteria for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis is given, based on national and international guidelines. Second, treatment outcomes (absence of biliary colic, pain-free state, biliary and surgical complications) are summarized, with data from three clinical trials. Finally, personal advice for treatment decisions in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis is provided, based on recent trials, the available literature, and expert opinion.

Results

This review describes different guidelines and criteria sets for uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis, provides an overview of outcomes after cholecystectomy, and advises on treatment decisions in patients with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones. After cholecystectomy, biliary colic is resolved in 95 per cent of patients. However, non-specific abdominal pain persists in 40 per cent. Irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia significantly increase the risk of persistent pain. Age, previous abdominal surgery, baseline pain score on a visual analogue scale, pain characteristics, nausea, and heartburn are part of the SUCCESS criteria, and are associated with clinically relevant pain reduction after gallbladder removal.

Conclusion

The surgical community can now give more personalized advice on surgery to improve care for patients with abdominal pain and uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis.

### Review of the impact of antineoplastic therapies on the risk for cholelithiasis and acute cholecystitis [^113fEZRM]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Development of cholecystitis in patients with malignancies can potentially disrupt their treatment and alter prognosis. This review aims to identify antineoplastic interventions associated with increased risk of cholecystitis in cancer patients.

Methods

A comprehensive search strategy was developed to identify articles pertaining to risk factors and complications of cholecystitis in cancer patients. FDA-issued labels of novel antineoplastic drugs released after 2010 were hand-searched to identify more therapies associated with cholecystitis in nonpublished studies.

Results

Of an initial 2,932 articles, 124 were reviewed in the study. Postgastrectomy patients have a high (5–30%) incidence of gallstone disease, and 1–7% develop symptomatic disease. One randomized trial addressing the role of cholecystectomy concurrent with gastrectomy is currently underway. Among other risk groups, patients with neuroendocrine tumors treated with somatostatin analogs have a 15% risk of cholelithiasis, and most are symptomatic. Hepatic artery based therapies carry a risk of cholecystitis (0.02–24%), although the risk is reduced with selective catheterization. Myelosuppression related to chemotherapeutic agents (0.4%), bone marrow transplantation, and treatment with novel multikinase inhibitors are associated with high risk of cholecystitis.

Conclusions

There are several risk factors for gallbladder-related surgical emergencies in patients with advanced malignancies. Incidental cholecystectomy at index operation should be considered in patients planned for gastrectomy, and candidates for regional therapies to the liver or somatostatin analogs. While prophylactic cholecystectomy is currently recommended for patients with cholelithiasis receiving myeloablative therapy, this strategy may have value in patients treated with multikinase inhibitors, immunotherapy, and oncolytic viral therapy based on evolving evidence.

### Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis [^114FwEjD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult western population. Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic in a year. Cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones is mainly performed after the acute cholecystitis episode settles because of the fear of higher morbidity and conversion from laparoscopic cholecystectomy to open cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis.

Objectives

The aim was to compare the early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than seven days of onset of symptoms) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after index admission) with regards to benefits and harms.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation IndexExpanded until November 2005.

Selection Criteria

We considered for inclusion all randomised clinical trials comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis.

We collected the data on the characteristics of the trial, methodological quality of the trials, mortality, morbidity, conversion rate, operating time, and hospital stay from each trial. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using RevMan Analysis. For each outcome we calculated the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on intention-to-treat analysis.

Main Results

We included five trials with 451 patients randomised: 223 to the early group and 228 to the delayed group. Surgery was performed on 222 patients in the early group and on 216 patients in the delayed group. There was no mortality in any of the trials. Four of the five trials were of high methodological quality. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups for any of the outcomes including bile duct injury (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.70) and conversion to open cholecystectomy (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.34). Various other analyses including 'available case analysis', risk difference, statistical methods to overcome the 'zero-event trials' showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in any of the outcomes measured. A total of 40 patients (17.5%) from the delayed group had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to non-resolving or recurrent cholecystitis; 18 (45%) of these had to undergo conversion to open procedure. The total hospital stay was about three days shorter in the early group compared with the delayed group.

Authors' Conclusions

Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis seems safe and shortens the total hospital stay. The majority of the outcomes occurred rarely; hence, the confidence intervals are wide. Therefore, further randomised trials on the issue are needed.

Conclusion

The diagnostic evaluation and treatment of patients with gallbladder stones and abdominal pain are subject to change. The symptom criteria for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis differ across international guidelines. Although biliary colic is frequently resolved after cholecystectomy, non-biliary symptoms persist in up to 40 per cent of patients. This review guides surgeons on how to tailor diagnosis and treatment in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^116hVUqF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In contrast to adults, for whom guidelines on the cholelithiasis treatment exist, there is no consistent treatment of pediatric patients with cholelithiasis throughout national and international departments, most probably due to the lack of evidence-based studies.

Methods

We evaluated the German management of pediatric cholelithiasis in a dual approach. Firstly, a retrospective, inter-divisional study was established, comparing diagnostics and therapy of patients of the pediatric surgery department with the management of patients aged < 25 years of the visceral surgery department in our institution over the past ten years. Secondarily, a nation-wide online survey was implemented through the German Society of Pediatric Surgery.

Results

Management of pediatric patients with cholelithiasis was primarily performed by pediatricians in the retrospective analysis (p < 0.001). Pediatric complicated cholelithiasis was not managed acutely in the majority of cases with a median time between diagnosis and surgery of 22 days (range 4 days–8 months vs. 3 days in visceral surgery subgroup (range 0 days–10 months), p = 0.003). However, the outcome remained comparable. The hospital's own results triggered a nation-wide survey with a response rate of 38%. Primary pediatric medical management of patients was confirmed by 36 respondents (71%). In case of acute cholecystitis, 22% of participants perform a cholecystectomy within 24 h after diagnosis. Open questions revealed that complicated cholelithiasis is managed individually.

Conclusions

The management of pediatric cholelithiasis differs between various hospitals and between pediatricians and pediatric surgeons. Evidence-based large-scale population studies as well as a common guideline may represent very important tools for treating this increasing diagnosis.

### Management of gallstones [^113qrVME]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with gallstones can be managed expectantly. Generally, only persons with symptoms related to the presence of gallstones (e.g., steady, nonparoxysmal pain lasting four to six hours located in the upper abdomen) or complications (such as acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis) warrant surgical intervention. Biliary pain is alleviated by cholecystectomy in the majority of cases. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the most cost-effective management strategy in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. Medical management strategies are mostly palliative and are not widely supported. Patients with longer-lasting biliary pain, in combination with abdominal tenderness, fever, and/or leukocytosis, require an ultrasound evaluation to help establish a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Once a patient is diagnosed, having cholecystectomy early in the course of the disease can significantly reduce the hospital stay.

### Conservative treatment of acute cholecystitis: a systematic review and pooled analysis [^114fBk14]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In medical practice, the tendency to remove an inflamed gallbladder is deeply rooted. Cholecystectomy, however, is associated with relatively high complication rates, and therefore the decision whether or not to perform surgery should be well considered. For some patients, the surgical risk-benefit profile may favour conservative treatment. The objective of this study was to examine the short- and long-term outcome of conservative treatment of patients with acute calculous cholecystitis.

Methods

A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library databases was performed. Prospective studies reporting on the success rate of conservative treatment (i.e. non-invasive treatment) of acute cholecystitis during index admission were included, as well as prospective and retrospective studies reporting on the recurrence rate of gallstone-related disease during long-term follow-up (i.e. ≥ 12 months) after initial non-surgical management. Study selection was undertaken independently by two reviewers using predefined criteria. The risk of bias was assessed. The pooled success and mortality rate during index admission and the pooled recurrence rate of gallstone-related disease during long-term follow-up were calculated using a random-effects model.

Results

A total of 1841 patients were included in 10 randomized controlled trials and 14 non-randomized studies. Conservative treatment during index admission was successful in 87% of patients with acute calculous cholecystitis and in 96% of patients with mild disease. In the long term, 22% of the patients developed recurrent gallstone-related disease. Pooled analysis showed a success rate of 86% (95% CI 0.8–0.9), a mortality rate of 0.5% (95% CI 0.001–0.009) and a recurrence rate of 20% (95% CI 0.1–0.3).

Discussion

Conservative treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis during index admission seems feasible and safe, especially in patients with mild disease. During long-term follow-up, less than a quarter of the patients appear to develop recurrent gallstone-related disease, although this outcome is based on limited data.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^116UPgZS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

We are presenting this study with the specific aim of exploring especially the therapeutic management and the surgical timing in pediatric cases of cholelithiasis. Findings of the retrospective study indicate a preferred expectant management in pediatric patients with an increased time span with symptoms and longer timeframe between diagnosis and surgery. This may be largely determined by the high proportion of primary pediatric medical admissions. Overall percentage of complicated cases was not significantly higher in pediatric patients in comparison to patients of the visceral surgery subgroup. However, we see an increased risk for complications, especially for biliary pancreatitis, in these patients besides the unnecessarily extended duration of symptoms in pediatric patients. The preference for an expectant management in symptomatic or even acute and complicated cases was also reported within the online survey. Based on the results of the dual approach of our study, we can conclude that the management practice is heterogeneous and deviates fundamentally from the guidelines of adult medicine. Moreover, the survey's findings revealed a lack of standardization or homogeneous optimal surgical timing after end of conservative treatment. The ideal surgical timing has been widely discussed in adult medicine so far, which could be partially solved by the guideline for adults. Various publications appear to be in consensus on the association of delayed treatment with increased complication rates. However, certain limitations, such as restricted case numbers, the high risk of selection bias and inconsistent definitions of diagnoses, must be taken into account to properly classify the value of these publications. Sarrami et al. demonstrated in a retrospective analysis of 188 children and adolescents with cholelithiasis that the risk of subsequent hospital admission was increased by 5% for every 10 days with delayed treatment. They speculated that a delay in surgery might increase complication rates, while acknowledging their limitations of an inconsistent definition and therapeutic approach in patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis and the need for large, randomized trails.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^117X6UVS]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

C-GALL was a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel group, patient randomised, superiority trial to test if the strategy of standard, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is more effective and cost effective than conservative management. The trial protocol was published in 2021.

We recruited patients from 20 secondary care sites in the UK. Potential participants were adults aged > 18 years with confirmed, symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease (ie, biliary colic or acute cholecystitis) who were electively referred to secondary care and considered suitable for cholecystectomy. Clinical diagnosis of gallstone disease was confirmed by appropriate imaging. Patients who were unable to consent, medically unfit for surgery, pregnant, or had had previous open major upper abdominal surgery were not eligible for the trial. Also excluded were patients with gallstones in the common bile duct, evidence of previous choledocholithiasis, a history of acute pancreatitis, evidence of obstructive jaundice, evidence of empyema of the gallbladder with sepsis, suspicion of gallbladder cancer, perforated gallbladder (recent or old perforation detected on imaging), or haemolytic disease.

Randomisation and masking

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either laparoscopic cholecystectomy or conservative management using the remote, computer based randomisation application at the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials. The minimisation algorithm used recruitment site, sex (male, female), and age (< 35, 35–64, ≥ 65 years). A random element (20% chance) was incorporated into the minimisation algorithm. Participants, investigators, and the trial statistician were not masked to treatment allocation.

### 2017 WSES and SICG guidelines on acute calcolous cholecystitis in elderly population [^111Cxpvb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and introduction

Gallstone disease is very common afflicting 20 million people in the USA. In Europe, the Multicenter Italian Study on Cholelithiasis (MICOL) published in 2008 reported the examination of nearly 33,000 subjects aged 30 to 69 years in 18 cohorts of 10 Italian regions. The overall incidence of gallstone disease was 18.8% in women and 9.5% in men.

Biliary colic is the most common acute presentation of gallstone disease occurring from 1 to 4% annually. Untreated gallstones may lead to acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC) in 10% to 20% of people.

Other complications of gallstones include common bile duct stones and acute pancreatitis. In patients in whom cholecystectomy was not performed at the initial admission for ACC, the probabilities of gallstone-related complications are 14%, 19%, and 29% at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and at 1 year, respectively.

The MICOL study showed that age is a strong risk factor in both sexes. The prevalence of gallstones at 70 years of age was 15% and 24% and at 90 years of age was 24% and 35% for males and females respectively. Moreover, the prevalence increases to 80% in institutionalized people aged 90 years or above. According to the 2017 United Nations report, the population aged more than 60 years is predicted to increase in the near future: in Europe, this is predicted to increase from 25% currently to 35% in 2050; in Latin American and Caribbean countries and Asia from 12.5% currently to 25% in 2050; in North America from 22% currently to 28% in 2050; finally, the African population will also become older moving from 5 to 9% by year 2050.

### Systematic review of the clinical and cost effectiveness of cholecystectomy versus observation / conservative management for uncomplicated symptomatic gallstones or cholecystitis [^114RF6Bn]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gallstone disease is a common gastrointestinal disorder in industrialised countries. Although symptoms can be severe, some people can be symptom free for many years after the original attack. Surgery is the current treatment of choice, but evidence suggests that observation is also feasible and safe. We reviewed the evidence on cholecystectomy versus observation for uncomplicated symptomatic gallstones and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis.

Methods

We searched six electronic databases (last search April 2014). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non-randomised comparative studies where adults received either cholecystectomy or observation/conservative management for the first episode of symptomatic gallstone disease (biliary pain or cholecystitis) being considered for surgery in secondary care. Meta-analysis was used to combine results. A de novo Markov model was developed to assess the cost effectiveness of the interventions.

Results

Two RCTs (201 participants) were included. Eighty-eight percent of people randomised to surgery and 45% of people randomised to observation underwent cholecystectomy during the 14-year follow-up period. Participants randomised to observation were significantly more likely to experience gallstone-related complications (RR = 6.69, 95% CI = 1.57–28.51, p = 0.01), in particular acute cholecystitis (RR = 9.55, 95% CI = 1.25–73.27, p = 0.03), and less likely to undergo surgery (RR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.34–0.73, p = 0.0004) or experience surgery-related complications (RR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.16–0.81, p = 0.01) than those randomised to surgery. Fifty-five percent of people randomised to observation did not require surgery, and 12% of people randomised to cholecystectomy did not undergo surgery. On average, surgery costs £1,236 more per patient than conservative management, but was more effective.

Conclusions

Cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment for symptomatic gallstones. However, approximately half the observation group did not require surgery or suffer complications indicating that it may be a valid alternative to surgery. A multicentre trial is needed to establish the effects, safety and cost effectiveness of observation/conservative management relative to cholecystectomy.

### Incremental net benefit of cholecystectomy compared with alternative treatments in people with gallstones or cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cost-utility studies [^116ZBA5k]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Gallstones constitute one of the most common and expensive gastrointestinal disorders and cause significant epidemiological and economic burdens worldwide. Approximately 20% of people with gallstones experience symptoms requiring medical attention or surgery, while the remaining 80% remain asymptomatic for many years. Treatment options for cholecystitis include surgical (cholecystectomy-open and laparoscopic) or conservative management. The treatment of gallstone disease is expensive and often engenders substantial economic and social burdens if symptoms or complications occur. The healthcare system in the USA alone reported treatment costs as US$6.5 billion per year.

The optimal timing and the treatment choice for cholecystectomy in patients with acute cholecystitis have always been contentious. In earlier days, several weeks of hospital stay and an initial intense medical management were the norm before an open cholecystectomy (OC). Introducing early cholecystectomy (open or laparoscopic) reduced the overall treatment duration considerably. Performing early surgery for cholecystitis has the advantage of reducing hospital stay and circumvents the risk of emergency surgery in the wake of a non-resolved or recurrent issue.

### Acute cholecystitis [^11656bvQ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Of people admitted to hospital for biliary tract disease, 20% have acute cholecystitis. Up to the age of 50 years, acute calculous cholecystitis is three times more common in women than in men, and about 1.5 times more common in women than in men thereafter. About 95% of people with acute cholecystitis have gallstones. Optimal therapy for acute cholecystitis, based on timing and severity of presentation, remains controversial.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute cholecystitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: early cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy, observation alone, and open cholecystectomy.

5.3 Acute Gallbladder Disease

In SAXENDA clinical trials in adults, 2.2% of SAXENDA-treated patients reported adverse events of cholelithiasis versus 0.8% of placebo-treated patients. The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.8% in SAXENDA-treated patients versus 0.4% in placebo-treated patients. The majority of SAXENDA-treated patients with adverse events of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis required cholecystectomy. Substantial or rapid weight loss can increase the risk of cholelithiasis; however, the incidence of acute gallbladder disease was greater in SAXENDA-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients even after accounting for the degree of weight loss. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated.

5.4 Hypoglycemia

Adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia with use of SAXENDA, including severe hypoglycemia. In patients with type 2 diabetes, monitor blood glucose prior to starting SAXENDA and during SAXENDA treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

In the pediatric clinical trial, patients did not have type 2 diabetes but were provided with blood glucose meters. Clinically significant hypoglycemia, defined as blood glucose < 54 mg/dL, occurred in 1.6% of the SAXENDA- treated patients compared to 0.8% of placebo-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Inform all pediatric patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

### Cost-effectiveness of a new strategy to identify uncomplicated gallstone disease patients that will benefit from a cholecystectomy [^114xLqT4]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Effectiveness of an intervention is often reported in cost-effectiveness studies as quality-adjusted life years (QALY). However, abdominal pain is the most characteristic feature of uncomplicated symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and therefore the main aim of cholecystectomy in this patient group. In addition, absence of pain after cholecystectomy is the main predictor of a patient-reported successful outcome of the operation. The Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index, a patient-reported outcome measure computing quality of life, may not be sufficiently disease-specific. Abdominal pain, for example, is equally scored as flatulence in this questionnaire. Other patient-reported outcome measures computing quality of life are not different in weighing persistent abdominal pain. Furthermore, a quality of life score is less applicable in surgical practice compared to presence or absence of abdominal pain. We therefore selected absence of postoperative abdominal pain as effectiveness outcome.

This study must be considered within the context of some limitations. First, the criteria for selection for cholecystectomy remain non-specific, although they are more specific than current practice entirely based on the surgeons' preference. Second, the criteria of the new strategy were not externally validated, although this may have been challenging to perform due to strong treatment preferences of patients and surgeons. Third, we focused on uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis patients. Patients with complicated symptomatic cholelithiasis were not considered. Exclusion of complicated symptomatic cholelithiasis may not have had a large impact as the patient group with uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis only have an annual 1–3% risk on complications because of the stones. Furthermore, the observation group of a randomized controlled trial of patients with uncomplicated symptomatic cholecystolithiasis did not suffer complications during 14 years of follow-up. Fourth, we excluded patients having a bile duct injury as this specific complication of cholecystectomy has a low incidence of 0.04–1.5%. Fifth, we did not consider additional diagnostic work-up because of lack of data, variability, and patient-dependency. Finally, the new strategy was evaluated from a healthcare perspective for a time horizon of 1 year. If a societal perspective would be taken into account, the restrictive care strategy of having one out of two criteria satisfied would probably be even more cost-effective, because this strategy was more effective in terms of relief of abdominal pain and it prevented cholecystectomies, probably preventing sick leave. Especially, patients with ongoing abdominal pain after cholecystectomy would continue to seek medical help with additional diagnostic interventions.

### Choledocholithiasis… [^115Dg4WG]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Baiu I, Hawn MT. Choledocholithiasis. JAMA. 2018; 320:

1506. doi: 10.1001/jama.2018.11812 Choledocholithiasis occurs when a gallstone blocks the common bile duct and bile cannot flow past it, instead backing up into the liver. Patients often have right-sided abdominal pain and may have yellowing of the skin or eyes. Patients may also experience clay-colored stools and dark urine. If the stone is stuck in the common bile duct in such a way that the enzymes from the pancreas also cannot flow to the small intestine, it can lead to gallstone pancreatitis, which can cause right, middle, and left upper abdominal pain; nausea; and vomiting. If the gallbladder becomes inflamed, it can lead to acute cholecystitis. If there is an infection of the ducts through which the bile flows, it leads to cholangitis. Both of these can cause right-sided abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever.

The diagnosis is made by performing a patient history, physical examination, blood tests, and imaging of the abdomen. Treatment depends on the location of the blockage and what problems develop because of it. Choledocholithiasis requires a gastroenterologist to extract the stone. This is usually done with heavy sedation, not general anesthesia. A long tube with a camera is introduced through the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and into the small bowel. The point where the bile duct opens into the small bowel is then identified and the stone is pulled out. This procedure is called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Gallstone pancreatitis is usually treated with hydration through intravenous fluids and pain medication. Acute cholecystitis is treated with antibiotics and surgery. Cholangitis is treated with antibiotics and removal of the stone caught in the duct.

All of these conditions require surgical removal of the gallbladder to prevent future attacks. A blocked stone usually causes pain, nausea, and vomiting. Lack of pain in the presence of jaundice and abnormal liver tests should raise concern for other disease processes such as hepatitis or, less frequently, bile duct or pancreatic cancer.

### Aetiology, diagnosis and management for ischaemic cholecystitis: current perspectives [^114vZtkF]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cholecystitis broadly describes inflammation of the gallbladder tissue and cystic duct. Most frequently this inflammation occurs from an obstructive process involving the cystic duct; this could be secondary to cholelithiasis or external compression. Cholecystitis may also result when inflammation of the gallbladder occurs in the absence of gallstones or another form of external compression, and instead emanates from a systemic process. Specifically, we propose to refer to this non-obstructive cause of cholecystitis as 'ischaemic cholecystitis', with emphasis on the unique clinical setting, diagnosis, management and prognosis for this patient population.

Obstructive cholecystitis

Traditionally, the distinction between the various forms of cholecystitis is primarily based on diagnostic imaging identifying gallstones (or external compression in rare circumstances). However, the absence of gallstones on diagnostic imaging does not equate to a diagnosis of non-obstructive cholecystitis for all circumstances. The rate of false-negative sonographic findings when assessing for gallstones is approximately 1%–4%. For instance, small gallstones (< 4 mm) or gallstones in the presence of bile sludge or polyps were described in the setting of false-negative sonographic findings. Moreover, for select cases of gas-containing gallstones, the only evidence of their existence on diagnostic imaging is the visible pocket of air making diagnosis challenging. For our institutional practice, we have had approximately 2% of patients present with a classical clinical history consistent with acute obstructive cholecystitis and negative sonographic evidence of gallstones. Despite this initial clinical presentation, gallstones were identified in the operating room or on final pathological examination. Thus, to accurately define non-obstructive or acalculous cholecystitis, a pathological diagnosis excluding gallstones is optimal. Furthermore, clinical history consistent with biliary colic cannot be overlooked in the setting of negative diagnostic imaging.

Non-obstructive cholecystitis

Non-obstructive cholecystitis is an uncommon cause of cholecystitis and accounts for < 10% of all diagnoses of cholecystitis in adults. In contrast to the diagnosis of obstructive cholecystitis, which is commonly reliant on patient history and imaging findings, the diagnosis of non-obstructive cholecystitis is dependent on the clinical setting (table 1).

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^117Xzhks]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

In 2018, the Scientific Board of the 6thWorld Congress of the WSES endorsed its president to organize a CC on ACC in order to update the previous WSES Guidelines. The WSES president appointed four members as a scientific secretariat, four members as an organization committee and four members as a scientific committee, choosing them from the expert affiliates of the WSES. Relevant key questions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of ACC were developed and divided into seven sections, in order to analyse the topic and update the guidelines with the currently available evidence. Under the supervision of the scientific secretariat, a bibliographic search related to these questions was performed, using electronic search of PubMed and EMBASE databases in May 2019, with no date or language restrictions. An additional manual search of the literature was performed by members of the working groups involved in the analysis of the papers and the development of the guidelines. The topics and sections, the key questions and the related key words used to develop the update on ACC are available in Table 1.

Table 1
Sections/topics, key questions and key words

Before the CC, the statements and recommendations were reviewed by the representatives responsible for each of the sections, creating a draft version of the guidelines. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were reviewed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria (see). Specifically, the quality of evidence was graded as 'High', 'Moderate', 'Low' or 'Very low' and the strength of a recommendation was indicated as either 'Strong' or 'Weak'. Consensus had previously been defined as 70% or more of the votes being in agreement. During the 6th World Congress of the WSES held in Nijmegen, the Netherlands in May 2019, each question was discussed and voted upon by the audience (votes were either 'agree' or 'disagree'). The percentage of agreement was recorded immediately; in case of disagreement, the statement was modified following discussion. After the CC, the president and representatives reviewed the guidelines in response to the comments and the revised version of the statements was voted upon via an online questionnaire until consensus was reached. Throughout the period of the elaboration of the current guidelines, repeated literature searches were carried out in order to maximize the inclusion of relevant evidence (last literature search: May 2020).

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^115MsxNQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC) has a high incidence in the general population. The presence of several areas of uncertainty, along with the availability of new evidence, prompted the current update of the 2016 WSES (World Society of Emergency Surgery) Guidelines on ACC.

Materials and Methods

The WSES president appointed four members as a scientific secretariat, four members as an organization committee and four members as a scientific committee, choosing them from the expert affiliates of WSES. Relevant key questions were constructed, and the task force produced drafts of each section based on the best scientific evidence from PubMed and EMBASE Library; recommendations were developed in order to answer these key questions. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were reviewed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria (see https://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/). All the statements were presented, discussed and voted upon during the Consensus Conference at the 6th World Congress of the World Society of Emergency Surgery held in Nijmegen (NL) in May 2019. A revised version of the statements was voted upon via an online questionnaire until consensus was reached.

Results

The pivotal role of surgery is confirmed, including in high-risk patients. When compared with the WSES 2016 guidelines, the role of gallbladder drainage is reduced, despite the considerable technical improvements available. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) should be the standard of care whenever possible, even in subgroups of patients who are considered fragile, such as the elderly; those with cardiac disease, renal disease and cirrhosis; or those who are generally at high risk for surgery. Subtotal cholecystectomy is safe and represents a valuable option in cases of difficult gallbladder removal.

Conclusions, Knowledge Gaps and Research Recommendations

ELC has a central role in the management of patients with ACC. The value of surgical treatment for high-risk patients should lead to a distinction between high-risk patients and patients who are not suitable for surgery. Further evidence on the role of clinical judgement and the use of clinical scores as adjunctive tools to guide treatment of high-risk patients and patients who are not suitable for surgery is required. The development of local policies for safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended.

Watchful waiting versus surgical treatment

In 2002, the first randomized studywas performed that compared observation versus surgical intervention in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis. Sixty-eight patients were randomized to cholecystectomy and 69 to observation. During the 67 months of follow-up, 60 patients (88 per cent) and 35 patients (51 per cent) respectively eventually underwent cholecystectomy. No difference in admissions for pain attacks or gallstone-related complications, such as acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis or acute pancreatitis, was observed. Eight of 95 patients who underwent cholecystectomy developed a major complication. There were no differences between the groups in either quality-of-life or pain scores. In 2011, Schmidt and colleaguesreported 14-year follow-up data, which showed that almost no operations were performed beyond 5 years in either group. Biliary complications occurred in 3 of 69 patients (4 per cent) randomized to observation; 1 of 68 patients (1 per cent) randomized to surgery had biliary pancreatitis before operation (P = 0.298). The authors concluded that, when the symptoms are intolerable, cholecystectomy is advised in patients with uncomplicated, symptomatic, gallbladder stones. However, conservative treatment is also an option, with a minimal risk of development of cholecystitis, cholangitis or pancreatitis.

The C-GALL trialis randomizing patients with symptomatic gallstones between surgical or conservative treatment. The investigators have hypothesized that there will be no difference in quality of life between conservative management and surgery after follow-up of 18 months. The study protocol includes all patients with radiologically confirmed gallbladder stones regardless of the severity and frequency of symptoms. This trial will investigate the effectiveness of surgical versus conservative treatment.

In the restrictive arm of the SECURE trial, 171 patients did not undergo cholecystectomy. This group had characteristics (such as age, sex, and BMI) similar to those of the group that underwent cholecystectomy. However, these patients less frequently reported biliary colic, and had lower pain scores. As noted previously, biliary complications were similar between usual-care and restrictive strategies. The surgeon's dogma of gallbladder removal to prevent biliary complications does not stand for all patients as the risk of developing biliary pancreatitis is below 2 per cent. Factors associated with biliary complications in patients with gastrointestinal pain and gallbladder stones should be investigated further. The 5-year follow-up of the Dutch trials will elucidate the rate of biliary complications in patients being treated according to a wait-and-see strategy.

### Percutaneous cholecystostomy for high-risk surgical patients with acute calculous cholecystitis [^115wWhRe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The management of people at high risk of perioperative death due to their general condition (high-risk surgical patients) with acute calculous cholecystitis is controversial, with no clear guidelines. In particular, the role of percutaneous cholecystostomy in these patients has not been defined.

Objectives

To compare the benefits (temporary or permanent relief of symptoms) and harms (recurrence of symptoms, procedure-related morbidity) of percutaneous cholecystostomy in the management of high-risk individuals with symptomatic gallstones.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to December 2012 to identify the randomised clinical trials. We also handsearched the references lists of identified trials.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) addressing this issue.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors collected data independently. For each outcome, we calculated the P values using Fisher's exact test or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included two trials with 156 participants for this review. The comparisons included in these two trials were percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by early laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (1 trial; 70 participants) and percutaneous cholecystostomy versus conservative treatment (1 trial; 86 participants). Both trials had high risk of bias. Percutaneous cholecystostomy with early laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy: There was no significant difference in mortality between the two intervention groups (0/37 versus 1/33; Fisher's exact test: P value = 0.47). There was no significant difference in overall morbidity between the two intervention groups (1/31 versus 2/30; Fisher's exact test: P value = 0.61). This trial did not report on quality of life. There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants requiring conversion to open cholecystectomy between the two intervention groups (2/31 percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by early laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus 4/30 delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy; Fisher's exact test: P value = 0.43). The mean total hospital stay was significantly lower in the percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group compared with the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (1 trial; 61 participants; MD -9.90 days; 95% CI -12.31 to -7.49). The mean total costs were significantly lower in the percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group compared with the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (1 trial; 61 participants; MD -1123.00 USD; 95% CI -1336.60 to -909.40). Percutaneous cholecystostomy versus conservative treatment: Nine of the 44 participants underwent delayed cholecystectomy in the percutaneous cholecystostomy group. Seven of the 42 participants underwent delayed cholecystectomy in the conservative treatment group. There was no significant difference in mortality between the two intervention groups (6/44 versus 7/42; Fisher's exact test: P value = 0.77). There was no significant difference in overall morbidity between the two intervention groups (6/44 versus 3/42; Fisher's exact test: P value = 0.49). The number of participants who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy was not reported in this trial. Therefore, we were unable to calculate the proportion of participants who underwent conversion to open cholecystectomy. The other outcomes, total hospital stay, quality of life, and total costs, were not reported in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the current available evidence from randomised clinical trials, we are unable to determine the role of percutaneous cholecystostomy in the clinical management of high-risk surgical patients with acute cholecystitis. There is a need for adequately powered randomised clinical trials of low risk of bias on this issue.

### Core outcome set for symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease [^114e6DNR]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gallstone disease (cholelithiasis) is one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases worldwide, with a prevalence of approximately 10–15 per cent in adult populations, but more common in women and people aged over 40 years. For the majority (around 80 per cent), gallstones are asymptomatic, but 20 per cent of people experience pain and develop gallstone-related complications. These patients are currently offered symptom control and/or surgical intervention. A significant number of these patients (up to 40 per cent) remain symptomatic after intervention. Conducting large, well designed, RCTs comparing surgery with non-surgical comparators, which measure and report outcomes that matter to all stakeholders, is of importance in this setting.

A recent in-depth analysisof outcomes that had been reported or were considered relevant to symptomatic gallstone disease highlighted the significant variability between studies. In addition, outcome mapping also included empirical research that identified new, unreported in this context, outcomes of importance. This heterogeneity, and absence of outcomes deemed important to patients (and other stakeholders), brings into question the adequacy of existing evidence. Standardizing outcomes through the development and implementation of core outcome sets (COSs) offers a potential solution to this heterogeneity problem and ensures that the right outcomes are being measured and reported. COSs aim to define a minimum set of outcomes that should be considered essential for the evaluation and reporting of specific interventions or conditions.

This study aimed to develop a COS for uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease effectiveness trials, which recommends what outcomes should be measured and reported as a minimum, reflecting the interests of relevant stakeholders to facilitate decision-making.

### The need for new "patient-related" guidelines for the treatment of acute cholecystitis [^116FpnFm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The Tokyo guidelines offer a systematic overview and revision of the pathophysiological, clinic and diagnostic approach to the biliary infections. Based on this exhaustive overview these guidelines give also specific therapeutic indications about operative and conservative management.

The diagnosis is the starting point of the treatment of any kind of pathology and of acute cholecystitis as well. Prompt and timely diagnosis should allow early treatment and lower morbidity and mortality. The Tokyo guidelines proposed a staging system based upon the evaluation of local signs of inflammation (Murphy's sign and RUQ mass/pain/tenderness), systemic signs (fever, elevated CRP with values of 3 mg/dl or more and abnormal WBC count) and imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis. Similar diagnostic criteria are reported from other recent studies.

As far as diagnosis and treatment of acute cholecystitis is concerned, the peculiarity of the Tokyo guidelines is the division of the disease in mild, moderate and severe. No previous study examined the optimal treatment of acute cholecystitis on the basis of an organ-related severity score index. In the Tokyo consensus meeting the need for surgical treatment according to the grade of severity was suggested and discussed. Subsequent studies analyzed the impact of the Tokyo guidelines on the management of patients with acute cholecystitis, stressing the attention on their impact on surgical outcomes. Even if the expert panel of that consensus made an extraordinary scientific work, no benefits have been demonstrated by applying those guidelines, except a decrease of mean length of hospital stay.

### The need for new "patient-related" guidelines for the treatment of acute cholecystitis [^114hEGBB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Editorial

As universally known, acute cholecystitis is a frequent complication of cholelithiasis. It is a very common problem and general surgeons have to face it daily. The absolute heterogeneity of patients, co-morbidities and environment in which this disease presents, make the diagnosis, and the subsequent therapeutic procedures, very difficult to standardize. The full complement of the signs and symptoms historically described as the "Charcot's triad" or the "Reynolds' pentad" are infrequent and, as such, do not really assist the clinician with planning management strategies. Few different consensus conference and severity score grading systems have been published from expert panels in recent years with consequent comments and criticisms. Recently an International Consensus meeting held in Tokyo established evidence-based criteria for the diagnosis, severity assessment and treatment of acute cholecystitis (Tokyo guidelines). The Tokyo guidelines is a fine methodologically and scientifically correct study which defines the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the acute biliary infections. Although many different diagnostic and treatment methodologies have been developed in recent years, none of them have been assessed scientifically to become a standard method in the management of acute biliary infections and, more specifically, acute cholecystitis. The Tokyo extraordinary expert panel, by a meticulous review of English-language literature, demonstrated that a structured diagnostic and severity scoring system for acute biliary infections is not available, and consequently tried to overcome this scientific gap.

### Contemporary management of common bile duct stone: what you need to know [^117PaQzm]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Choledocholithiasis is a common presentation of symptomatic cholelithiasis encountered by the acute care surgeon. There is a wide spectrum of variation in management of this disease due to evolutions in laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques. Intricacies in management are related to the timing of diagnosis as well as locally available imaging modalities, surgical expertise, and ancillary advanced endoscopy and interventional radiological support. While individual patient demographics and institutional characteristics will determine management of choledocholithiasis, it is incumbent for the treating surgeon to be well versed in all manners of therapy currently available. The objective of this review is to provide an evidence-based summary of the contemporary management of choledocholithiasis.

### Adverse events associated with ERCP [^1163G2gS]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholecystitis — post-ERCP cholecystitis is an uncommon adverse event that should be recognized early and not be mistaken for acute cholangitis; patients may present with fever, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and a positive Murphy's sign, and diagnosis should be confirmed by imaging findings. Pathogenesis is believed to be related to gallbladder contamination by nonsterile contrast material in the context of gallbladder dyskinesia or outflow (cystic duct) obstruction. In one study, newly diagnosed cholecystitis requiring emergency cholecystectomy occurred in 11 patients (0.5%), up to 16 days after ERCP; gallbladder stones were present in 10 of 11 patients, no other predictors were identified, and therefore it is believed that the presence of cholelithiasis increases the risk of post-ERCP cholecystitis.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^111DsFM9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Classification of asymptomatic cholelithiasis, uncomplicated (symptomatic) and complicated cholelithiasis

Only patients with incidental findings of cholelithiasis without any symptoms at the time of diagnosis were classified as asymptomatic patients. For further analysis of timing of surgery, patients were grouped as follows: Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis, including diffuse abdominal pain and colics, nausea and vomiting without signs of inflammation or other complications were categorized as uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis. Complicated cholelithiasis was defined in cases of choledocholithiasis or biliary pancreatitis. We additionally included cases of acute cholecystitis (acute pain in the right upper quadrant, accompanied by systemic inflammatory signs such as fever, increased white blood cell count, increased C-reactive protein (CrP)) in the group of complicated cholelithiasis.

Ethical approval

Both parts of the study were approved by the local ethics committee (Ethikkommission der Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg) in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki (1964) and its later amendments (reference number 164_20 Bc). The local ethics committee did not demand informed consent due to retrospective analysis of anonymized data.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^116yRz7a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons combined the published validated clinical scores and proposed a risk stratification of CBDS in three different classes, defined as follows: low risk (< 10%), moderate risk (10 to 50%) and high risk (> 50%) of CBDS (see Table 2). This proposed classification has clear clinical implications: patients with a low risk of CBDS should be operated on without further investigation; patients with moderate risk should be evaluated with a second-level examination, either preoperatively with endoscopic US (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or intraoperatively with laparoscopic US (LUS) or IOC, in order to select patients who need stone removal; finally, according to local expertise, laparoscopic transcystic CBD exploration is a valuable option. Patients with high risk of CBDS should undergo preoperative diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP. See Fig. 1 for the flowchart of management of ACC.

Table 2
Risk factors and classification of risk for CBDS (modified from Maple et al. 2010)

What is the best tool to stratify the risk for CBDS in patients with ACC?

2.5 We suggest stratifying the risk of CBDS according to the proposed classification modified from the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeon Guidelines. #QoE: very low; SoR: weak#

ASGE guidelines remains a valuable tool for the diagnosis and the management of CBDS in patients with ACC. According to their classification, high-risk patients have a probability of having CBDS exceeding 50%, which in turn means that up to 49% of patients undergoing ERCP will not have evidence of CBDS and, given the potential complications of ERCP, this may not be considered acceptable. For this reason, we would recommend more cautious approach: only patients with evidence of CBDS at abdominal US should be considered at high risk of CBDS and should undergo diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP directly; patients with total serum bilirubin > 4 mg/dl or enlarged common bile duct diameter at US with concomitant bilirubin level 1.8 to 4 mg/dl should be considered as moderate risk and should undergo second level investigation such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) or IOC, in order to avoid the complications related to ERCP. See Table 2 for the modified risk stratification.

### Management of acute cholecystitis [^111wR4qs]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Various aspects of the management of acute calculous cholecystitis, including type and timing of surgery, role of antibiotics, and nonoperative management, remain controversial. This review focuses on recently published studies addressing the timing of cholecystectomy, use of cholecystostomy tubes, and role of antibiotics in this condition.

Recent Findings

In most cases, the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis can be initially confirmed with an abdominal ultrasound. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 24–72h of symptom onset) is better than delayed surgery (> 7 days) for most patients with grade I and II diseases. Percutaneous cholecystostomy and novel endoscopic gallbladder drainage interventions may be used as a temporizing measure or as definitive therapy in those who are too sick to undergo surgery. Studies are conflicting as to whether antibiotics are required for the treatment of uncomplicated cases.

Summary

Cholecystectomy remains the only definitive therapy for acute cholecystitis. Current guidelines recommend treatment on the basis of disease severity at presentation. Antibiotics and a variety of minimally invasive nonsurgical interventions, although not definitive, play an adjunctive role in the management of the disease.

### Cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy in patients with silent gallstones [^111mY8sM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Cholecystectomy is currently advised only for patients with symptomatic gallstones. However, about 4% of patients with asymptomatic gallstones develop symptoms including cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, pancreatitis, and gallbladder cancer.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of surgical removal of the gallbladder for patients with asymptomatic gallstones.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until 2006 for identifying the randomised trials using The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group search strategy.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) comparing cholecystectomy and no cholecystectomy were considered for the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

We were unable to identify any randomised clinical trials comparing cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy.

Main Results

We were unable to identify any randomised clinical trial comparing cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no randomised trials comparing cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy in patients with silent gallstones. Further evaluation of observational studies, which measure outcomes such as obstructive jaundice, gallstone-associated pancreatitis, and/or gall-bladder cancer for sufficient duration of follow-up is necessary before randomised trials are designed in order to evaluate whether cholecystectomy or no cholecystectomy is better for asymptomatic gallstones.

### Liraglutide [^115cpdCL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis:

In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, the incidence of cholelithiasis was 0.3% in both liraglutide injection- treated and placebo-treated patients. The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.2% in both liraglutide injection-treated and placebo-treated patients.

Laboratory Tests

Bilirubin:

In the five adult glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration, mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (elevations to no more than twice the upper limit of the reference range) occurred in 4.0% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 2.1% of placebo-treated patients and 3.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. This finding was not accompanied by abnormalities in other liver tests. The significance of this isolated finding is unknown.

Calcitonin:

Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program. At the end of the adult glycemic control trials, adjusted mean serum calcitonin concentrations were higher in liraglutide injection-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients but not compared to patients receiving active comparator. Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less.

Among adult patients with pretreatment calcitonin < 20 ng/L, calcitonin elevations to > 20 ng/L occurred in 0.7% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, and 0.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

Lipase and Amylase:

In one adult glycemic control trial in renal impairment patients, a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed for liraglutide injection-treated patients while placebo-treated patients had a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%.

The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with liraglutide injection is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Vital signs

Liraglutide injection did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed in adult patients treated with liraglutide injection compared to placebo.

### Incremental net benefit of cholecystectomy compared with alternative treatments in people with gallstones or cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cost-utility studies [^116AnaHG]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Scopus and Embase databases in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). This study is part of a more extensive economic evaluation study.

Data sources, screening and study selection

The search was performed from inception to 1 July 2020, in PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases. We followed the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome approach to construct the search terms. The desired population for the study included all the adult patients presenting with cholelithiasis or acute cholecystitis who were being considered for a cholecystectomy. Surgical removal of the gallbladder using early, open or LC was the intervention, and non-surgical methods like conservative management, wait-and-watch or endoscopic management covered the comparator strategy. The possible economic outcomes included were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), incremental net benefit (INB), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, life years saved and costs saved.

The detailed search terms and search strategies are reported in online supplemental material 1. The total number of studies identified from the database search was 8710, including 2977 from PubMed, 3696 from Scopus and 2037 from Embase. After removing the duplicates (n = 1414), 7296 studies were selected for an initial title and abstract screening.

Titles and abstracts of the studies listed from the electronic database search were screened independently by the authors (BSB, MN and AS) for potential inclusion using the Rayyan software. After screening, the authors (BSB, MN and AS) independently reviewed the full-text articles (n = 660). The final list of studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria was prepared by the authors' mutual consensus (BS, MN and AS).

All full economic evaluation studies with a study population of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis that compared the costs and consequences of intervention with a comparator in terms of QALYs, ICERs or INBs were included in the study. Studies other than cost–utility analysis (CUA), reviews, letters, editorials, abstracts, books, reports, grey literature and methodological articles were excluded from the study. We identified 28 studies for systematic review based on these inclusion–exclusion criteria, and the data were extracted from these papers using a data extraction form. The PRISMA flow chart of the screening process is appended as figure 1.

### Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with acute cholecystitis [^114BcThD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult western population. Between 1% and 4% of these adults become symptomatic in a year (the majority due to biliary colic but a significant proportion due to acute cholecystitis). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is mainly performed after the acute cholecystitis episode settles because of the fear of higher morbidity and of need for conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy. However, delaying surgery exposes the people to gallstone-related complications.

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review was to compare early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than seven days of clinical presentation with acute cholecystitis) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after index admission with acute cholecystitis) with regards to benefits and harms.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform until July 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in participants with acute cholecystitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We identified seven trials that met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, six trials provided data for the meta-analyses. A total of 488 participants with acute cholecystitis and fit to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) (244 people) and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) (244 people) in the six trials. Blinding was not performed in any of the trials and so all the trials were at high risk of bias. Other than blinding, three of the six trials were at low risk of bias in the other domains such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. The proportion of females ranged between 43.3% and 80% in the trials that provided this information. The average age of participants ranged between 40 years and 60 years. There was no mortality in any of the participants in five trials that reported mortality. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who developed bile duct injury in the two groups (ELC 1/219 (adjusted proportion 0.4%) versus DLC 2/219 (0.9%); Peto OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.05 to 4.72 (5 trials)). There was no significant difference between the two groups (ELC 14/219 (adjusted proportion 6.5%) versus DLC 11/219 (5.0%); RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.61 to 2.72 (5 trials)) in terms of other serious complications. None of the trials reported quality of life from the time of randomisation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of people who required conversion to open cholecystectomy (ELC 49/244 (adjusted proportion 19.7%) versus DLC 54/244 (22.1%); RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.25 (6 trials)). The total hospital stay was shorter in the early group than the delayed group by four days (MD -4.12 days; 95% CI -5.22 to -3.03 (4 trials; 373 people)). There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups (MD -1.22 minutes; 95% CI -3.07 to 0.64 (6 trials; 488 people)). Only one trial reported return to work. The people belonging to the ELC group returned to work earlier than the DLC group (MD -11.00 days; 95% CI -19.61 to -2.39 (1 trial; 36 people)). Four trials did not report any gallstone-related morbidity during the waiting period. One trial reported five gallstone-related morbidities (cholangitis: two; biliary colic not requiring urgent operation: one; acute cholecystitis not requiring urgent operation: two). There were no reports of pancreatitis during the waiting time. Gallstone-related morbidity was not reported in the remaining trials. Forty (18.3%) of the people belonging to the delayed group had either non-resolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms before their planned operation and had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in five trials. The proportion with conversion to open cholecystectomy was 45% (18/40) in this group of people.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no significant difference between early and late laparoscopic cholecystectomy on our primary outcomes. However, trials with high risk of bias indicate that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis seems safe and may shorten the total hospital stay. The majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely, and hence the confidence intervals are wide. It is unlikely that future randomised clinical trials will be powered to measure differences in bile duct injury and other serious complications since this might involve performing a trial of more than 50,000 people, but several smaller randomised trials may answer the questions through meta-analyses.

### Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs for biliary colic [^1177RydH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cholelithiasis refers to the presence of gallstones, which are concretions that form in the biliary tract, usually in the gallbladder. Cholelithiasis is one of the most common surgical problems worldwide and is particularly prevalent in most Western countries. Biliary colic is the term used for gallbladder pain experienced by a person with gallstones and without overt infection around the gallbladder. It is the most common manifestation of cholelithiasis, observed in over one-third of people with gallstones over the course of 10 or more years. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used to relieve biliary colic pain, but their role needs further elucidation. They may decrease the frequency of short-term complications, such as mild form of acute cholecystitis, jaundice, cholangitis, and acute pancreatitis, but they may also increase the occurrence of more severe and possibly life-threatening adverse events such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal function impairment, cardiovascular events, or milder events such as abdominal pain, drowsiness, headache, dizziness, or cutaneous manifestations.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of NSAIDs in people with biliary colic.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), and ClinicalTrials.gov until July 2016. We applied no language limitation.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials recruiting participants presenting with biliary colic and comparing NSAIDs versus no intervention, placebo, or other drugs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (MF and AC) independently identified trials for inclusion. We used risk ratios (RR) to express intervention effect estimates, and we analysed the data with both fixed-effect and random-effects model meta-analyses, depending on the amount of heterogeneity. We controlled random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis. We assessed the methodological quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Twelve randomised clinical trials (RCTs) met our predefined review protocol criteria for analysis. We found only one trial to be at low risk of bias, considering the remaining trials to be at high risk of bias. The risk of selection bias in nine studies was unclear due to poor reporting, leading to uncertainty in the pooled effect estimates. Five trials compared NSAIDs versus placebo, four trials compared NSAID versus opioids, and four trials compared NSAID versus spasmolytic drugs (one of the 12 trials was a three-arm study comparing NSAIDs versus both opioids and spasmolytic drugs). There were 828 randomised participants (minimum 30 and maximum 324 per trial), of whom 416 received NSAIDs and 412 received placebo, spasmolytic drugs, or opioids. Twenty-four per cent of the participants were males. The age of the participants in the trials ranged from 18 to 86 years. All people were admitted to emergency departments for acute biliary pain. There was no mortality. When compared with placebo, NSAIDs obtained a significantly lower proportion of participants without complete pain relief (RR 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.40; I² = 0%; 5 trials; moderate-quality evidence), which was confirmed by Trial Sequential Analysis, but not regarding participants with complications (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.15; I² = 26%; 3 trials; very low-quality evidence). NSAIDs showed more pain control than spasmolytic drugs (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71; I² = 0%; 4 trials; low-quality evidence), which was not confirmed by Trial Sequential Analysis, and a significantly lower proportion of participants with complications (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.57; I² = 0%; 2 trials; low-quality evidence), which was also not confirmed by Trial Sequential Analysis. We found no difference in the proportions of participants without complete pain relief when comparing NSAIDs versus opioids (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.07; I² = 52%), suggesting moderate heterogeneity among trials (4 trials; very low-quality evidence). Only one trial comparing NSAIDs versus opioids reported results on complications, finding no significant difference between treatments. None of the included trials reported severe adverse events. Seven out of the 12 trials assessed non-severe adverse events: in two out of the seven trials, adverse events were not observed, and minor events were reported in the remaining five trials. In addition, we found one ongoing RCT assessing the analgesic efficacy of intravenous ibuprofen in biliary colic.

Authors' Conclusions

NSAIDs have been assessed in relatively few trials including a limited number of participants for biliary colic, considering its common occurrence. We found only one trial to be at low risk of bias. There was no mortality. None of the included trials reported quality of life. The generalisability of the review is low as most of the RCTs included neither elderly people nor participants with comorbidities, who are more prone to complications as compared to others with biliary colic. The beneficial effect of NSAIDs compared with placebo on pain relief was confirmed when we applied Trial Sequential Analysis. The quality of evidence according to GRADE criteria was moderate for the comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo regarding the outcome lack of pain relief and low or very low for the other outcomes and comparisons. We found only one trial at low risk of bias, following the predefined 'Risk of bias' domains. We found the risk of selection bias to be unclear in nine studies due to poor reporting, leading to uncertainty in the pooled effect estimates.

### Comparing percutaneous treatment and cholecystectomy outcomes in acute cholecystitis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114hQU7U]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a common and significant condition marked by inflammation of the gallbladder, most often resulting from the obstruction of the cystic duct by gallstones. This blockage leads to bile stasis, gallbladder distension, and, ultimately, an inflammatory response that can escalate if untreated. The condition is a major contributor to acute abdominal pain presentations in emergency settings and frequently necessitates prompt medical attention, often culminating in surgical intervention. The disease not only poses a substantial burden on healthcare systems but also represents a critical condition that requires timely diagnosis and management to prevent severe complications, such as gallbladder gangrene, perforation, or systemic sepsis. The urgency of treatment is underscored by the fact that delayed intervention can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The estimated overall prevalence of gallstones is 10–15% in the general population, with some differences across countries. Between 20 and 40% of patients with gallstones will develop gallstone-related complications, with an incidence of 1–3% annually; acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC) is the first clinical presentation in 10–15% of the cases. Gallstones, a primary risk factor, are implicated in approximately 85% of cases. The prevalence of AC correlates strongly with advancing age, particularly among individuals over 60, where up to 30% may have cholelithiasis. This condition not only heightens the risk of cholecystitis but also underscores the importance of targeted prevention and management strategies in older populations.

Section 6. Alternative treatment for patients with ACC who are not suitable for surgery: observation and techniques for gallbladder drainage

When should Non-Operative Management be considered for patients with ACC?

6.1 We suggest considering NOM, i.e. best medical therapy with antibiotics and observation, for patients refusing surgery or those who are not suitable for surgery. #QoE: low; SoR: weak#

6.2 We suggest considering alternative treatment options for patients who fail NOM and who still refuse surgery or patients who are not suitable for surgery. #QoE: low; SoR: weak#

Schimdt et al. published an RCT comparing observation and surgery in cases of ACC, with a long median follow-up time of 14 years. In their analysis, about 30% of patients with mildly symptomatic acute cholecystitis who did not undergo cholecystectomy developed recurrent gallstone-related complications, as compared with 3% of patients who underwent cholecystectomy, but these differences were not significant for recurrent disease or complications. Overall, 60% of patients had undergone surgery, while 40% avoided surgery. There are significant limitations in the study, as recognized by the authors: firstly, a relevant percentage of eligible patients (41%) were excluded from randomization; secondly, the reasons for the exclusion were not stated in the paper; thirdly, the definitions of dropout and failure within the observation group were not clear. Brazzelli et al. published a systematic review of two RCTs comparing observation with surgery in patients with symptomatic gallstone disease (in the first study) and patients with ACC (in the second study). From a total of 201 patients, the results confirmed the high rate of gallstone-related complications within the observation group (RR 6.63, 95% CI 1.57–28.51, p = 0.01). The authors, although noting the substantial lack of good quality evidence, reported that a policy of surgery for all patients with ACC, when compared to a policy of observation followed by surgery for symptomatic patients, represents a costly but more effective choice. In conclusion, relevant uncertainty exists regarding the best management between surgery or observation in cases of ACC, especially in uncomplicated disease; observation and best medical therapy are likely to be safe, but this latter approach is characterised by a high incidence of recurrent disease.

Diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm

The assessment of the retrospective study's and the survey's findings prompted the development of a diagnostic and therapeutic proposal in accordance with the adult guidelines due to the lack of large-scale multi-center studies in pediatric patients. This algorithm is depicted in Fig. 3. It emphasizes the close and early interdisciplinary consensus of pediatricians and pediatric surgeons, as well as the clear differentiation between symptomatic and asymptomatic cholelithiasis and complicated cholelithiasis in cases of acute inflammation or choledocholithiasis. We propose to discuss cases with concomitant diseases early and interdisciplinary due to the continued lack of large-scale population studies for evidence-based guidelines. It certainly cannot provide answers to all therapeutic options (e.g. antibiotic therapy), as large-scale population studies are missing, and information has to be transferred from adult management.

### Hepato-pancreato-biliary emergencies for the acute care surgeon: etiology, diagnosis and treatment [^1173xxnf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The initial assessment of these patients includes 2 dominant objectives: confirming the diagnosis and establishing its severity. Despite a wide array of options (US, HIDA, CT, MR), the revised Tokyo consensus guidelines represent the best parameters for directing diagnosis and treatment. Based on diagnostic sensitivities of 90% to 95%, abdominal US remains the initial modality of choice. Because it can be performed by the ACS within the emergency department itself, it is also cost saving and rapid. Identification of gallbladder wall thickening (> 5 mm), an obstructing gallstone in the gallbladder neck, pericholecystic fluid, US Murphy's sign and/or dilation and thickening of the common bile duct (CBD) are important signs that contribute to defining the diagnosis. Unfortunately CT imaging is far less specific and frequent in confirming this diagnosis. After confirmation however, the disease should be classified according its severity (grade I = mild, II = moderate, III = severe). While grade II refers to the presence of systemic signs of inflammation, grade III cholecystitis includes dysfunction of at least one organ/system (Table 1).

Methods

Screening and study selection

We carried out this systematic review and meta-analysis in compliance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered the protocol at PROSPERO. We systematically searched the studies indexed in PubMed-Medline, Scopus and Embase. The search terms were constructed based on domains of population, intervention, comparator and outcome (PICO) as described below. The search terms were combined using Boolean operator 'OR' within the same domains, and Boolean operator 'AND' between domains of PICO as described in online supplemental tables 1–3. An initial search was performed on 16 June 2020 and an updated search was performed on 12 January 2021.

According to the inclusion criteria, search results were screened for eligibility. The population included individuals with gallstones (cholelithiasis/cholecystolithiasis) or CBD stones (choledocholithiasis) or acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis. The intervention included surgical removal of the gallbladder through open or laparoscopic methods, where surgery was performed on an emergency basis or within 7 days, treated as EC. The comparator is CM and DC. CM included both observation management (OM) (also known as wait and watch strategy) and Endoscopic management (EM). Under OM, this study considered patients with gallstones who were symptomatically managed using pain killer, antibiotics, diet and lifestyle changes. Under EM, this study considered patients who underwent endoscopic removal of CBD stones with gallbladder left in situ. In DC, we considered patients who were initially managed conservatively and later underwent cholecystectomy after 6 weeks. Outcomes included complications related to gallstone disease, perioperative, intraoperative and postoperative complications with cholecystectomy, length of hospital stays, operative time and the studies included were RCTs. Nonrandomised trials, observational studies, reviews and studies published in non-English languages for which a translation could not be obtained were excluded. Studies were also excluded for their selection of PICO, that is not of study's interest.

Titles and abstracts of studies listed from the electronic database search were meticulously screened independently by authors (BSB, MH, AS) using Rayyan-web application. After screening, authors independently reviewed and selected studies based on inclusion and exclusion criteria with authors' mutual consensus (figure 1).

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^111Xs3Vq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

An update of the literature searches was performed for the purpose of this guideline. Sixteen trials were identified in the update (including the trials originally included in the systematic review). The number of participants with acute cholecystitis was not reported in one of the trials. In the remaining 15 trials, 1240 participants were included in 14 trials comparing ELC versus DLC and 618 participants were included in one trial comparing ELC versus intermediate laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ILC). The country; recruitment period; number of participants; the duration of symptoms; the timing of ELC, DLC and ILC; and the surgical experience are reported in Table 3. Overall, it appears that ELC was performed within 10 days of onset of symptoms in most trials.

Main reasons for unclear or high risk of bias

High risk of bias: at least one of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, missing outcome bias or selective outcome reporting bias was classified as high risk of bias

Unclear risk of bias: at least one of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, missing outcome bias or selective outcome reporting bias was classified as unclear risk of bias without any of the domains being classified as high risk of bias

a All studies were at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. The risk of bias classification stated here is for the remaining domains

b This was the only study in which intermediate laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed; delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in the remaining studies

There were no significant differences in mortality or conversion to open cholecystectomy between the three groups. The proportion of patients with serious adverse events was significantly higher in ILC compared to ELC in the only trial included in the comparison between ILC and DLC. The number of serious adverse events was significantly less with ELC compared to DLC in the only trial comparing ELC with DLC that reported this information. The total length of hospital stay (including all the admissions for treatment) was about 4 days shorter with ELC compared to DLC, and about 5 days shorter with ELC compared to ILC. The return to work was about 9 days sooner following ELC compared to DLC.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of gallstone disease treatment outcomes in early cholecystectomy versus conservative management / delayed cholecystectomy [^116iSQbg]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Results

We retrieved a total of 6494 studies through our initial and updated search, out of which 40 studies were included for systematic review, as shown in the PRISMA flow diagram (figure 1). We had excluded one study from the meta-analysis since no information on complications was reported. Therefore, 39 studies with 4483 patients with gallstone disease (intervention — EC, n = 2265 and comparator (CM/DC), n = 2218) were included in meta-analysis. Characteristics of included studies are provided in online supplemental table 4.

Patient's mean age was 53.47 years and 54.41 years in intervention and comparators, respectively. Sample sizes in individual studies ranged from 15 to 314 patients. In total, 6, 3 and 31 studies that compared EC versus OM, EC versus EMand EC versus DC, respectively, were analysed. Among the 32 studies, which reported gender proportions, 26 studies (81.25%) had a higher proportion of female participants. Only 9 out of 40 included studies for systematic review were multicentric RCTs, and the rest were conducted in single centres. The baseline gallstone complications reported were acute cholecystitis, CBD stones, gallstone pancreatitis and uncomplicated gallstones in 20, 12, 7 and 1 study, respectively. Out of the 40 studies included in systematic review, open cholecystectomy was reported among 9 studies and cholecystectomy was performed laparoscopically among the rest. Duration of symptoms was reported only in seven studies, in which duration varied from 35.1 to 96 hours. In all the included EC versus DC studies, EC was performed within 7 days of randomisation and DC was performed after 6 weeks of randomisation.

Risk of bias assessment

Out of 40 studies included in systematic review, 31 (77.5%) studies adequately followed the randomisation process. None of the included studies reported that patients and caregivers were blinded for the intervention under study, which might be due to the involvement of surgical intervention. Nine (22.5%) studies had shown deviations from the intended intervention. There were seven (17.5%) studies under the missing outcome data domain, one study (2.5%) in each domain for measurement of outcome data and selection of the reported results were assessed as high risk of bias. The overall risk of bias was estimated as low in 22 (55.0%), some concerns in 6 (15.0%) and high in 12 (30.0%) studies (online supplemental figure 1).

### The need for new "patient-related" guidelines for the treatment of acute cholecystitis [^113SRaWs]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Heterogeneity of patients affected by acute cholecystitis, and their co-morbidities make very difficult to standardize the therapy for this very common condition. The staging system suggested in the recent "Tokyo guidelines", did not show a relevant impact on the management of patients and on the outcome of the disease. The relation among local pathological picture, patient clinical status and treatment algorithm, has to be better studied.

### Aetiology, diagnosis and management for ischaemic cholecystitis: current perspectives [^113KDzT8]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Gallbladder inflammation is a common pathology encountered by general surgeons and gastroenterologists; most commonly this occurs secondary to the presence of stones, however many other aetiologies have been described. Cholecystitis in the setting of critical illness in a patient with systemic signs of insufficient end-organ perfusion and no evidence of gallbladder stones is the most consequential and presents unique challenges to clinicians. For these reasons, we believe ischaemic cholecystitis is a more accurate term to describe this pathophysiology, convey clinical severity and adequately distinguish this entity from other forms of non-obstructive cholecystitis. Creating this distinction is an important step towards being able to guide clinical and surgical management. While many of the initial steps in management, including resuscitation and antibiotic treatment, remain the same for all forms of cholecystitis, knowing the underlying aetiology in combination with the patient's clinical status direct the choice of intervention to address the acutely inflamed gallbladder — surgery, percutaneous drainage or endoscopic drainage. We hope that by introducing this new framework of thinking about gallbladder disease in the critically ill, clinicians will be able to recognise predisposing factors, take definitive steps towards diagnosis and ultimately provide the best treatment for this challenging clinical presentation.
