## Question

I'm floating objects in my eye what do I do about this

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do about "floating objects" in the eye, which sounds like floaters, and how to decide when to seek urgent care versus routine follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what floaters usually represent and how urgent they are. Then, I should verify red flags that mandate emergent evaluation. Next, I will consider risk factors and how they change urgency. After that, I need to outline immediate actions and what not to do. Finally, I will review diagnostic steps, treatment options if floaters persist, and follow-up and prevention strategies, making sure I anchor each step to guidelines and evidence-based data.

> Let me first confirm what "floating objects" most commonly mean clinically. Floaters are usually shadows cast by vitreous opacities or condensations, most often due to posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) in adults, which is typically age-related and may be accompanied by flashes of light from vitreoretinal traction; importantly, a substantial fraction of patients with acute PVD harbor a retinal tear, so new-onset floaters deserve a dilated retinal exam to exclude sight-threatening pathology [^117MgUEE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — new floaters can signal retinal tear or detachment, so I need to check for danger signs that require same-day urgent care. I should confirm whether there are flashes of light, a sudden shower of new floaters, a curtain or shadow in the peripheral visual field, or any loss of vision; these features increase the likelihood of retinal tear or detachment and warrant emergent ophthalmic evaluation, ideally within 24 hours, because surgical repair is time-sensitive to preserve vision [^1165VDWM] [^117MgUEE] [^111NsXZf].

> Wait, let me verify how risk factors modify pretest probability. High myopia, recent ocular trauma or surgery, lattice degeneration, and age over about 45–50 years increase the risk of retinal breaks with PVD. In fact, ED triage data show that acute symptoms in patients ≥ 45 years are more likely to require ophthalmology consultation, and the BElfast Retinal Tear and Detachment Score helps flag higher-risk presentations using simple clinical features like blurred vision, a visual field shadow, vitreous hemorrhage, and tobacco dust on exam [^115bt2fr] [^111eEi7F].

> I should double-check the baseline risk to calibrate urgency. In patients with acute-onset floaters and/or flashes, the prevalence of retinal tear is about 14%, and even after an initial diagnosis of uncomplicated PVD, the risk of a new tear within 6 weeks is roughly 3–4%; vitreous hemorrhage on slit lamp strongly raises the odds of a tear, while absence of vitreous pigment lowers it, but neither finding alone rules in or out the need for a dilated exam [^117MgUEE].

> Next, I should review what to do right now. If any red flags are present, I need to ensure the patient seeks urgent ophthalmic care within 24 hours. In remote settings, this equates to emergent evacuation because there is no effective field treatment for retinal detachment and delays worsen outcomes. If there are no red flags but symptoms are new within weeks, arrange a dilated eye exam within 24–48 hours when feasible, as many ED triage protocols safely defer non–high-risk patients to prompt outpatient ophthalmology with high follow-through and low miss rates for detachment [^1165VDWM] [^114D5tGc] [^114t5zsg].

> But wait, what if the symptoms are chronic and stable? If floaters have been unchanged for months and there are no new flashes, field loss, or vision decline, routine nonurgent ophthalmology follow-up is reasonable. PVD symptoms often diminish over time, and reassurance with education about warning signs is appropriate, though patients should still be advised to report any substantial change in symptoms promptly [^116PcqRn] [^111Er1TG].

> I need to ensure I cover what not to do. Do not rub the eye vigorously, do not attempt self-treatment with over-the-counter drops, and do not delay evaluation if new red flags emerge. Also, avoid high-impact activities or heavy lifting until after a retinal exam if symptoms are new or worsening, as a precaution while the diagnosis is being clarified [^notfound].

> Let me consider the diagnostic workup to confirm the plan. A comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation should include visual acuity, pupils, slit lamp biomicroscopy, and a dilated indirect fundus examination of the peripheral retina to look for tears, holes, lattice, vitreous hemorrhage, or detachment; OCT can help assess macular status and vitreoretinal interface, and B-scan ultrasound is useful if the fundus view is limited, with studies showing OCT in urgent care settings improves diagnostic accuracy and triage decisions [^1161AXCe] [^114XvSMn].

> Hold on, I should verify management pathways once the exam is done. If a retinal tear is found, laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy is typically recommended to prevent progression to detachment, especially for symptomatic horseshoe tears; if a retinal detachment is present, urgent surgical repair is indicated. If no tear or detachment is seen and the diagnosis is uncomplicated PVD, counsel on symptoms, advise activity as tolerated, and arrange follow-up within about 4–6 weeks to reassess, with strict return precautions for new flashes, more floaters, field loss, or vision decline [^116Uvxxj] [^114tAYhH] [^111Er1TG].

> If floaters persist and are functionally disabling after several months, I should review treatment options. Pars plana vitrectomy can reliably remove symptomatic vitreous opacities and restore continuously clear vision in carefully selected patients, with contemporary small-gauge techniques achieving high satisfaction and low complication rates when performed by experienced surgeons; laser vitreolysis remains an option in select cases but has less robust evidence and is generally less effective than vitrectomy for substantial opacities [^116PcqRn] [^113KeyJH] [^111coTdU].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "no treatment is needed for floaters" — that would be misleading. I should clarify: most new-onset floaters require at least urgent diagnostic evaluation to exclude retinal pathology, even if no treatment is ultimately needed; only chronic, stable, visually insignificant floaters without red flags are appropriate for observation alone, and patients should be educated to recognize evolving symptoms that would change management [^1161AXCe] [^111Er1TG].

> I will now examine prevention and follow-up principles. Patients with high myopia, lattice degeneration, or prior retinal detachment in one eye should have periodic dilated exams and be educated about PVD and detachment symptoms; after any retinal procedure or refractive surgery, patients remain at risk and should maintain vigilance for new flashes or floaters, with clear return precautions and individualized follow-up intervals based on risk profile [^1127C8gj] [^117KktDL].

> Let me reconsider the initial triage message to ensure it is actionable. New floaters, especially with flashes, a curtain or shadow, or vision loss, equal an eye emergency — seek urgent ophthalmic care within 24 hours. Without red flags but with recent onset, arrange a dilated exam within 24–48 hours when possible. Chronic, stable floaters can be observed with routine follow-up and strict return precautions for any change in symptoms [^1165VDWM] [^114D5tGc] [^114tAYhH].

Floaters are usually harmless, but **sudden new floaters**, especially with flashes or a curtain-like shadow, can signal retinal detachment and need **urgent care** [^117MgUEE] [^1165VDWM]. Most floaters are due to posterior vitreous detachment and can be monitored; persistent, bothersome floaters may be treated with vitrectomy or laser vitreolysis [^116PcqRn] [^1169kz4c]. No home remedies are effective, and you should avoid eye rubbing or strenuous activity until evaluated. Schedule a **dilated eye exam within 24–48 hours** for new floaters or flashes, and seek immediate care for vision loss or a curtain-like shadow [^114D5tGc] [^111NsXZf].

---

## Causes of eye floaters

Floaters are most often caused by **age-related vitreous changes**, but other causes include:

- **Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD)**: Common with aging; usually benign but can cause retinal tears [^117MgUEE].
- **Retinal tears or detachment**: Medical emergencies requiring urgent treatment [^1165VDWM].
- **Vitreous hemorrhage**: Bleeding into the vitreous from diabetes, hypertension, or trauma [^notfound].
- **Inflammation (uveitis)**: Can cause floaters with redness, pain, and photophobia [^113sFohu].
- **Myopia**: Higher risk of PVD and retinal tears [^111eEi7F].

---

## When to seek immediate medical attention

Certain symptoms with floaters require **urgent care**:

- **Sudden onset of new floaters**: Especially with flashes or a curtain-like shadow [^117MgUEE].
- **Rapid increase in floaters**: Sudden shower of new floaters [^117MgUEE].
- **Loss of peripheral vision**: Curtain-like shadow or veil [^1165VDWM].
- **Flashes of light**: Suggests retinal traction or tear [^115jzq5A].
- **Vision loss**: Sudden or gradual [^112dN2ra].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **comprehensive eye exam** is essential to determine the cause and guide management:

- **Visual acuity test**: Assess vision clarity [^1161AXCe].
- **Slit-lamp examination**: Anterior segment assessment [^1161AXCe].
- **Dilated fundus examination**: Essential to detect retinal tears, detachment, or hemorrhage [^113mHXEp].
- **OCT (optical coherence tomography)**: Detailed retinal imaging [^117CgNvj].
- **Ultrasound**: If the retina is not visible due to hemorrhage or opacity [^notfound].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment depends on the **underlying cause**:

| **Condition** | **Treatment** |
|-|-|
| Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) | Observation and reassurance; symptoms often improve over time [^116PcqRn] |
| Retinal tear or detachment | Urgent laser photocoagulation or surgical repair (vitrectomy or scleral buckle) [^116Uvxxj] |
| Vitreous hemorrhage | Observation or vitrectomy if severe or persistent [^notfound] |
| Inflammation (uveitis) | Corticosteroids and treatment of underlying cause [^notfound] |
| Persistent, bothersome floaters | - Vitrectomy (surgical removal of vitreous) <br/> - Or laser vitreolysis (laser fragmentation of floaters) [^1169kz4c] |

---

## Home remedies and lifestyle modifications

There are **no effective home remedies** for floaters. However, the following may help reduce discomfort:

- **Eye movements**: Gentle eye movements may help floaters drift out of the visual field.
- **Adequate lighting**: Brighter lighting can reduce the visibility of floaters.
- **Avoid eye rubbing**: Prevents irritation and potential injury.
- **Regular eye exams**: Monitor for changes or complications [^114tAYhH].

---

## Potential complications of untreated floaters

Untreated floaters can signal serious conditions with **significant complications**:

- **Retinal detachment**: Permanent vision loss if untreated [^113v4o3q].
- **Vitreous hemorrhage**: Persistent bleeding and vision loss [^notfound].
- **Inflammation**: Chronic uveitis and vision impairment [^113sFohu].
- **Persistent visual disturbance**: Reduced quality of life and daily function [^116wxjJX].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies focus on **risk reduction**:

- **Regular eye exams**: Early detection of retinal issues [^117DNM9r].
- **Control systemic conditions**: Manage diabetes and hypertension [^115vZGp5].
- **Protective eyewear**: During sports or hazardous activities [^115nBHdW].
- **Healthy lifestyle**: Balanced diet, hydration, and smoking cessation [^117DNM9r].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis varies by **cause**. PVD has a good prognosis — symptoms often improve and complications are rare — whereas retinal detachment has an excellent prognosis with early treatment but delayed care risks permanent vision loss. Vitreous hemorrhage generally resolves with observation, though surgery is sometimes needed, and uveitis has a favorable prognosis with prompt treatment; delayed care risks chronic vision problems [^116PcqRn] [^1113cD7j] [^113v4o3q] [^113sFohu].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patients should be educated about:

- **Symptoms of retinal detachment**: Flashes, curtain-like shadow, sudden vision loss [^1165VDWM].
- **Importance of regular eye exams**: Early detection and monitoring [^1127C8gj].
- **Treatment options**: Risks and benefits of vitrectomy or laser vitreolysis [^113W92oq].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Diet, hydration, and smoking cessation [^117DNM9r].

---

Floaters are common and usually benign, but **new or changing floaters**, especially with flashes or vision loss, need **urgent care** to rule out retinal detachment or other serious disease. Most cases are managed with observation, while persistent or bothersome floaters can be treated with vitrectomy or laser vitreolysis. No home remedies are effective, and regular eye exams are key to early detection and prevention.

### Eye emergencies [^113v4o3q]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Central retinal artery occlusions, chemical injuries, mechanical globe injuries, and retinal detachments are eye emergencies that can result in permanent vision loss if not treated urgently. Family physicians should be able to recognize the signs and symptoms of each condition and be able to perform a basic eye examination. Patients with a central retinal artery occlusion require urgent referral for stroke evaluation and should receive therapy to lower intraocular pressure and vasodilating agents to minimize retinal ischemia. Chemical injuries require immediate irrigation of the eye to neutralize the pH of the ocular surface. A globe laceration or rupture is common in patients with a recent history of trauma from a blunt or penetrating object. Physicians should administer prophylactic oral antibiotics after a globe injury to prevent endophthalmitis. The eye should be covered with a metal shield until evaluation by an ophthalmologist. Patients with symptomatic floaters and flashing lights should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a dilated funduscopic examination to evaluate for a retinal tear or detachment.

Posterior vitreous detachment counseling — all patients with a PVD should be instructed to notify their ophthalmologist as soon as possible if they have a substantial change in symptoms, such as an increase in floaters or flashing lights, loss of visual field, or decrease in visual acuity. If patients are familiar with the symptoms of retinal tears or detachment, they may be more likely to report promptly, thus improving the chances of successful treatment and subsequent visual outcome, and patients who undergo refractive surgery to reduce myopia should be informed that they remain at risk of RRD despite reduction of their refractive error.

### Evaluation and management of suspected retinal detachment [^1113cD7j]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Retinal detachment often is a preventable cause of vision loss. There are three types of retinal detachments: exudative, tractional, and rhegmatogenous. The most common type is rhegmatogenous, which results from retinal breaks caused by vitreoretinal traction. Risk factors for retinal detachment include advancing age, previous cataract surgery, myopia, and trauma. Patients typically will present with symptoms such as light flashes, floaters, peripheral visual field loss, and blurred vision. Early intervention facilitates prevention of retinal detachment after formation of retinal breaks and improves visual outcomes of retinal detachment surgery. Patients with acute onset of flashes or floaters should be referred to an ophthalmologist.

Conclusion

In summary, only a patient's symptoms documenting substantial interference with daily visual activities and clinically correlated with vitreous opacities are sufficient, indispensable, and treatment actionable. Moreover, VOV treatment of such patients reliably restores continuously clear vision and is highly cost effective.

Measurements serve a useful research purpose in this disease. But no number in any grading system will ever guide individual treatment of symptomatic vitreous opacities better than a patient's own words.

### Posterior vitreous detachment-prevalence of and risk factors for retinal tears [^115jzq5A]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with PVD often present symptoms in the form of floating clouds and/or lightning in the visual field, that is, floaters and flashes. These floaters are the result of light passing differently through folds created in the shriveling vitreous, aggregated collagen fibers, cells or condensations in the vitreous. This symptomatology may appear months or years after an uncomplicated PVD. The spots of light or lightning are considered to be caused by the traction on the retina that adhered hard to vitreous conducts. Several studies have shown that the risk of damage of the retina with the above mentioned symptomatology varies greatly, between 8.2% and 47.6%.–If no retinal tears or hemorrhages are found at the primary examination of a patient with PVD, further examinations/follow-ups are considered unnecessary, except in the case of new symptoms or worsening of the symptoms. In the event of a retinal rupture, vitreous fluid can enter the retina through the tear, leading to separation of the neuroretina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium resulting in RD in 33%–46% of the cases. If the separated neuroretina and its photoreceptors are left without surgical intervention, the photoreceptors will inevitably undergo apoptosis.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate what clinical symptoms (floaters, flashes, visual decrease) may predict complications such as RD, tear and/or hemorrhage after a PVD, both with respect to short term and after a follow-up of several years. Another aim was to determine how the duration of symptoms prior to first consulting an ophthalmologist correlates with the risk of these complications. Better knowledge of these clinical characteristics will lead to optimized management of PVD patients.

### Pilocarpine hydrochloride (pilocarpine hydrochloride ophthalmic) [^1174CxYy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Blurred Vision: Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery if vision is not clear (e.g., blurred vision). Exercise caution in night driving and other hazardous activities in poor illumination. (5.1)

Risk of Retinal Detachment: Rare cases of retinal detachment and retinal tear have been reported with miotics, including pilocarpine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution. Individuals with pre-existing retinal disease are at increased risk. Therefore, examination of the retina is advised in all patients prior to initiation of therapy. Patients should be advised to seek immediate medical care with sudden onset of flashing lights, floaters or vision loss. (5.2)

Iritis: Caution is advised in patients with iritis. (5.3)

5.1
Blurred Vision

Miotics, including pilocarpine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, may cause accommodative spasm. Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery if vision is not clear (e.g., blurred vision).

In addition, patients may experience temporary dim or dark vision with miotics, including pilocarpine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in night driving and other hazardous activities in poor illumination.

5.2 Risk of Retinal Detachment

Rare cases of retinal detachment and retinal tear have been reported with miotics, including pilocarpine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution.

Individuals with pre-existing retinal disease are at increased risk. Therefore, examination of the retina is advised in all patients prior to the initiation of therapy.

Patients should be advised to seek immediate medical care with sudden onset of flashing lights, floaters or vision loss.

5.3 Iritis

Pilocarpine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution is not recommended to be used when iritis is present because adhesions (synechiae) may form between the iris and the lens.

5.4 Use with Contact Lenses

Contact lens wearers should be advised to remove their lenses prior to the instillation of pilocarpine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution and to wait 10 minutes after dosing before reinserting their contact lenses.

5.5 Potential for Eye Injury or
Contamination

To prevent eye injury or contamination, care should be taken to avoid touching the dispensing bottle to the eye or to any other surface.

### Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^116PcqRn]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) symptoms and floater management — PVD symptoms usually diminish over time and reassurance should be provided, but pars plana vitrectomy is an option if symptomatic floaters remain bothersome after several months. Laser surgeries and pharmacotherapies currently lack sufficient evidence to support their use, whereas pars plana vitrectomy has been used for floater removal with documented post-operative improvement in contrast sensitivity. Comparative reports indicate pars plana vitrectomy showed greater patient satisfaction than Nd:YAG laser vitreolysis, although another study found Nd:YAG vitreolysis improved symptoms versus sham laser surgery.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^112h83UF]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration — ranibizumab implant follow-up and safety are outlined. Patients should be instructed to promptly report symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, including eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or decreased vision, increased sensitivity to light, or an increased number of floaters. Patients should return for examination approximately 4 weeks after treatment initially; subsequent follow-up and treatment depends on the clinical findings and judgment of the treating ophthalmologist. Monocular near vision (reading/Amsler grid) should be monitored. Patients with an implant placed surgically and filled during surgery should follow postoperative instructions. The implant can be refilled every 6 months with rescue ranibizumab 2 mg given per clinical judgment between implant refills.

### The burden of flashes and floaters in traditional general emergency services and utilization of ophthalmology on-call consultation: a cross-sectional study [^115bt2fr]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To characterize the healthcare utilization and clinical characteristics of patients presenting with flashes and/or floaters (F/F) in general emergency service (GES) settings.

Methods

All adults presenting to GESs (emergency departments (EDs) and urgent care centers (UCCs)) with symptoms of F/F in Hamilton, Ontario between Jan. 1 – Dec. 31, 2018 were reviewed. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients presenting to GESs with F/F for which ophthalmology emergency services (OESs) were consulted. Secondary outcomes included features predictive of OES consultation by logistic regression and cost of GES utilization.

Results

Of 6590 primary eye-related visits to GESs, 10.4% (687) involved symptoms of F/F. Mean age of patients with F/F was 57 ± 15 years, and 61% were female. Consultation rate to OESs for F/F presentations was 89% (608/687). Logistic regression identified symptoms ≤ 2 weeks (OR 8.0; 95% CI 2.3–28), ≥ 45 years age (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.4–4.3), UCC setting (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.6–4.6), headache (OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.12–0.41), and neurologic symptoms (OR 0.1; 95% CI 0.19–0.49) as variables predictive of OES consultation. Mean time from triage to discharge in GESs for F/F patients was 2.43 ± 2.36 h. Mean cost per visit was $139.11 ± $113.93 Canadian dollars. Patients for which OES were consulted waited a total of 1345 h in GESs and accounted for $81,879.70 in costs.

Conclusion

Patients presenting with F/F in GESs consume considerable resources in healthcare expenditure and time spent in GESs and most receive OES consultation. Identifying these patients at triage may allow for increased efficiency for the healthcare system and patients.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^113Zve7v]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Laser posterior capsulotomy — complications, retinal detachment (RD) risk, and intraocular pressure (IOP) management — includes uncommon adverse events such as increased IOP, cystoid macular edema (CME), corneal abrasion, iritis, vitritis, damage to the intraocular lens (IOL), persistent floaters, dislocation of the IOL, macular hole, and indolent endophthalmitis. Axial myopia and other factors increase RD risk, and reported incidence ranges from 0% to 0.4% at 1 to 8 years after capsulotomy, with no RDs in eyes with axial length less than 24.0 mm in one series; a billing-records study found a 0.29% risk of tear and 0.87% risk of RD in the first 5 months after capsulotomy. Because retinal breaks or detachments can occur weeks to possibly years after capsulotomy, routine dilated fundus examination is unlikely to detect pathology requiring treatment in asymptomatic patients, and educating high-risk patients about symptoms may facilitate early diagnosis. For IOP control, routine prophylaxis with ocular hypotensive agents at the time of capsulotomy is not consistently supported when risk factors are absent, but in the presence of risk factors such as pre-existing glaucoma, agents to lower IOP have demonstrated efficacy at blunting IOP elevation; the surgeon should monitor IOP in the early postoperative period, and treatment with topical corticosteroid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), ocular hypotensive, or cycloplegic agents is dependent on patient risk factors and surgeon preference.

Ranibizumab intravitreal injection 0.5 mg — treatment recommendations and follow-up: Patients should be instructed to promptly report symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, including eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or decreased vision, increased sensitivity to light, or an increased number of floaters. Patients should return for examination approximately 4 weeks after treatment initially; subsequent follow-up and treatment depends on clinical findings and judgment of the treating ophthalmologist. Monocular near vision (reading/Amsler grid) should be monitored.

### Ophthalmology inquiries on reddit: what should physicians know? [^114yvAm6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Patients are seeking answers to personal medical questions on social media. Reddit, a popular social media site, has been overlooked as a source of data in the field of ophthalmology. We analyzed posts in the subreddit, r/Ophthalmology, to better understand the most common ophthalmic conditions patients are discussing online and how often those making posts are being advised to seek professional medical care.

Patients and Methods

This cross-sectional study analyzed posts and comments from March 18, 2018 to November 9, 2020. All posts and comments on r/Ophthalmology are public and were accessed using the Python Reddit API Wrapper. This text was analyzed for unique references to common ophthalmic conditions and for mentions and recommendations to different types of medical care.

Results

Nine hundred and nineteen posts were collected from the above timeframe. An auto-moderator makes a comment on every post to discourage patients from asking personal medical questions. Despite this, over two-thirds of posts discussed medical treatment for eye conditions in either a post, comment, or both. Almost half of all posts mention "ophthalmology", but only 9% go as far as to recommend ophthalmic care. One-third of posts have no reference to medical care. Within posts, flashes and floaters were the most common condition mentioned, making up 15% of unique mentions, followed by glaucoma (7.4%) and retinal detachments (6.7%). Within comments, cataracts were most commonly discussed, making up 12% of unique mentions, followed by glaucoma (8.9%).

Conclusion

These findings show that patients are seeking information about their eye health on the r/Ophthalmology subreddit and that Reddit users are engaging with these types of posts, instead of recommending professional care in most cases. It is important for ophthalmologists to recognize the most common conditions patients are asking about online and learn how they can do a better job of educating their patients in the office.

### Objective assessment of symptomatic vitreous floaters using optical coherence tomography: a case report [^1143s7K8]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vitrectomy for symptomatic vitreous floaters carries significant risks. Justification of surgery is difficult, particularly in healthy eyes with normal visual acuity and without a posterior vitreous detachment. This is the first reported case of optical coherence tomography being utilized to objectively assess the impact of a vitreous opacity on the macula.

Case Presentation

A 37-year-old Caucasian female complained of the sudden onset of a ring-like floater in the central visual field of her left eye. Visual acuity was 20/20, there was no intraocular inflammation and the posterior vitreous was not detached. Complete blood count with differential, serology screen (including cysticercosis and echinococcus), chest x-ray and abdominal ultrasound found no evidence of systemic infective or cystic disease. A color photograph and B-scan ultrasound confirmed a 4.31 mm free-floating semi-translucent vitreous cyst with a hyperechogenic, pigmented surface and faint internal strands suspended in the mid-vitreous cavity, in the visual axis. The cyst moved with ocular movements, but only within the vitreous lacuna it resided in. Humphrey and Goldmann visual fields were normal. However, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated shadowing on either side of the fovea, consistent with the ring-like scotoma described by the patient. Removing the retinal layers from the 3D-reconstructed macular cube OCT revealed a circular shadow on the macula. The patient elected for conservative management and at 3-month follow-up her symptoms had almost fully resolved as the cyst migrated to the inferior vitreous cavity, no longer casting a shadow on the macula.

Conclusion

To our knowledge, this is the first description of using OCT as an objective, qualitative assessment of symptoms caused by large vitreous opacities and may provide a simple yet useful adjunctive tool in evaluating the risk-benefit ratio of vitrectomy in patients with large symptomatic vitreous floaters.

### How do I recognise and manage visual snow syndrome? [^1166DAnH]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In visual snow syndrome (VSS) patients report seeing uncountable, dynamic, tiny dots flickering continuously across the entire visual field of both eyes. They describe this as being like the black-and-white static or the 'snow' on a poorly tuned analogue television. While VSS could be thought of as a hallucination because there is no real-world correlate of the perception, it may be more accurate to consider it to be an illusion created by disordered visual processing. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of other visual phenomena that these patients often describe; persistence of afterimages, trail phenomena, sensitivity to bright light or night blindness and an increased awareness of normal entoptic phenomena (visual perceptions whose source is within the eye itself, for e.g. floaters). The pathophysiology of visual snow is still under investigation.

A diagnostic framework for VSS has been published which aims to capture the range of symptoms patients describe with this condition (Table 1). The diagnosis of VSS can be made when a patient presents with subjective black-and-white visual static with at least one associated symptom of palinopsia (abnormal persistence or recurrence of an image in time), photopsia (flashes of light), nyctalopia (difficulty seeing in dim light or night-time) and entoptic phenomena. The diagnosis excludes those that have a history more consistent with migraine aura or the symptoms have occurred secondary to illicit drug use.

Proposed criteria for visual snow syndrome.

VSS is becoming increasingly self-diagnosed by our patients thanks to online search tools, and they will attend clinics to confirm this diagnosis. Previously this phenomenon was often dismissed by doctors as being psychological leading to increased patient anxiety. However, we now need to be careful that we are not making what would seem to be an easy diagnosis of VSS, when actually we are missing an underlying ophthalmic or neurological condition. This is an outline of how VSS is managed in my clinic, though others may prefer a different approach.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise patients and/or their caregivers of the following risks:

Endophthalmitis and other eye infections

Serious infection can occur inside of the eye and may lead to blindness. In such cases, there is an urgent need for management without delay. Advise patients to call their healthcare provider if they experience new floaters, eye pain, or any change in vision.

Permanent decline in visual acuity

Permanent decline in visual acuity may occur following subretinal injection of LUXTURNA. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience any change in vision.

Retinal abnormalities

Treatment with LUXTURNA may cause some defects in the retina such as a small tear or a hole in the area or vicinity of the injection. Treatment may cause thinning of the central retina, loss of retinal cells and the choroid (layer of blood vessels that line the back of the eye), or bleeding in the retina. Advise patients to follow up with their healthcare provider on a regular basis and report any symptoms such as decreased vision, blurred vision, flashes of light, or floaters in their vision without delay.

Increased intraocular pressure

Treatment with LUXTURNA may cause transient or persistent increase in intraocular pressure. If untreated, such increases in intraocular pressure may cause blindness. Advise patients to follow-up with their healthcare provider to detect and treat any increase in intraocular pressure.

Expansion of intraocular air bubbles

Advise patients to avoid air travel, travel to high elevations, or scuba diving until the air bubble formed following administration of LUXTURNA has completely dissipated from the eye. A change in altitude while the air bubble is still present may cause irreversible damage.

Cataract

Advise patients that following treatment with LUXTURNA, they may develop a new cataract, or any existing cataract may get worse.

Shedding of LUXTURNA

Transient and low level shedding of LUXTURNA may occur in patient tears. Advise patients and/or their caregivers on proper handling of waste material generated from dressing, tears, and nasal secretion, which may include storage of waste material in sealed bags prior to disposal. These handling precautions should be followed for up to 7 days following LUXTURNA administration.

### Clinical safety of a minor eye conditions scheme in england delivered by community optometrists [^115pz3v1]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2018). Medium credibility.

Clinical safety

A random sample of 44 clinical records of patients examined in MECS optometric practices were initially assessed by all four members of the research team, and good agreement on the practitioners' patient management of each case was established using multiple kappa values. A randomly selected sample of 220 MECS clinical records (stratified by practitioner), comprising approximately 10% of all records of patients seen through MECS during the study period, was then reviewed and independently graded by four members of the research team. Since agreement among the members of the research team had been established, the records were randomly assigned to four equal-sized groups, and each group of records was reviewed by one grader. Records were made available via, and a recording sheet for each grader was made available on. The College of Optometrists Clinical Management Guidelinesand the PEARS guidelines on flashes and floaters, produced by Optometry Wales and the Wales Optometry Postgraduate Education Centre (WOPEC), were used by the graders as reference material, which allowed them to assess the quality of the MECS optometrists' clinical management for each patient record reviewed. The above guidelines had been made available to the participating community optometrists during their training.

The researchers reviewed each record independently and graded MECS optometrists' clinical care for each patient as either 'appropriate' or 'inappropriate'. A grading of appropriate care was given when the optometrist's assessment and management of the patient was completely or substantially in accordance with the reference guidelines or when management, although deficient in some aspects of care proposed in the guidelines, was regarded as carrying no risk to patient safety. Patient care was graded as inappropriate where the optometrist had assessed and/or managed the patient in a way that was inappropriate based on the reference guidelines and/or was regarded as unsafe. In cases where patient care was deemed 'inappropriate', the reviewing optometrist gave the rationale for their decision by choosing one or more of the following options: prescription error, inappropriate non-referral, inappropriate referral, inappropriate referral urgency, inappropriate discharge and/or other. All 'inappropriate' ratings were reviewed by all members of the research team through a consensus meeting.

Referrals to the HES were assessed by ophthalmologists working in the affiliated hospitals. The diagnoses by HES clinicians were made available to the research team and were cross-referenced with MECS optometrists' diagnoses. HES ophthalmologists also provided feedback on referral appropriateness and referral urgency appropriateness.

### Vitreous opacity vitrectomy (VOV): safest possible removal of "Floaters" [^117Mp9hL]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment Risks

Endophthalmitis is an important but rare complication (0.08%) of vitrectomy. The endophthalmitis risk in VOV is likely even lower as it involves especially small wounds and short duration surgery with few instrument reentry events. Moreover, VOV includes every possible infection preventive measure.

The major risk of vitrectomy has historically been retinal detachment, currently reported to be 2.5%. In this regard, the first goal of VOV is to remove vitreous gel without tearing the retina (possibly leading to retinal detachment). The defining characteristic of VOV is its aggregate emphasis on safety throughout each step of vitrectomy, resulting in its potential to actually reduce the lifetime risk of retinal detachment in DVS eyes.

The iatrogenic retinal tear rate during vitrectomy has decreased from as high as 37% in the 1970ʹs, to 2–7% today. Using the technological innovations of small gauge, cannulated entry, and the ultra-high-speed suction/cutters recently developed by outstanding corporate partners in the vitreoretinal surgery industry, my experience is that the iatrogenic tear rate can now be further reduced to less than 1%, using VOV techniques.

A second goal of VOV is to find and treat existent lesions so as to achieve a net reduction of retinal detachment risk in post vitrectomy eyes. Thus, a paradigm shift may now be possible using VOV techniques, from regarding elective vitrectomy as an additional risk factor for retinal detachment to regarding it as a risk-reduction procedure, as an ancillary benefit to that for which the procedure was chosen.

We explain to DVS patients that while there are no risk-free procedures, the risk of significant loss of vision from VOV performed as described above is less than 1% in our experience (DVS patients in a study by Wagle were willing to accept a 7% risk of blindness to be relieved of floater symptoms). Thus, the risk of removing symptomatic vitreous opacities in DVS with VOV now approaches the operative risk of cataract extraction for lens opacity, because properly performed VOV is continually focused on pursuing tractionless vitrectomy with respect to the retina, seeking to make iatrogenic retinal tear a "never" event in this form of elective vitrectomy.

### Management of vitreous floaters: an international survey the European vitreoRetinal society floaters study report [^113KeyJH]. Eye (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pars plana vitrectomy for symptomatic floaters.

Subjects/Methods

Forty-eight vitreoretinal surgeons from 16 countries provided information on 581 eyes who underwent vitrectomy for floaters in this retrospective survey study conducted by European VitreoRetinal Society. Percentage symptomatic improvement, incidence of retinal tears/detachment and post-vitrectomy cataract surgery, and the factors associated with satisfaction and complications were investigated.

Results

Ninety-two percent were satisfied with the results, with 86.3% reporting complete resolution of daily-life symptoms. Overall satisfaction was lower in patients with smaller vitreous opacities at presentation (OR:0.4). Iatrogenic retinal breaks occurred in 29 eyes (5%). Core vitrectomy and cut rates of 1500–4000 or > 4000cuts/min were associated with lower risk of retinal breaks than complete vitrectomy (OR:0.05) and cut rates < 1500cuts/min (OR: 0.03, 0.12, respectively). Fourteen eyes (2.4%) developed retinal detachment at a median of 3 months; and 84 (48.6%) developed cataract at a median of 16 months post-vitrectomy.

Conclusions

Pars plana vitrectomy resulted in high patient satisfaction with relatively low rate of severe complications in a large group of patients. The procedure may be safer when core vitrectomy and cut rates > 1500cuts/min are favoured. Proper patient selection and informed consent are the most important aspects of surgery.

### Impact of automated OCT in a high-volume eye urgent care setting [^114XvSMn]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Background/Aims

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become standard of care in the diagnosis and management of a myriad of retinal and optic nerve pathology. Access to diagnostic equipment and skilled imaging personnel in the after-hours setting is often limited. We examined the utility and diagnostic indications for automated OCT in a high-volume after-hours clinic within an eye institute.

Methods

OCT images obtained over a period of 15 months were reviewed in the context of electronic patient records. Residents and fellows were surveyed regarding their experience with the OCT and its value in emergency patient management.

Results

202 patients and 359 eyes were examined. Complaints prompting imaging included flashes/floaters, metamorphopsia, decreased vision and scotomas. Diagnoses included vascular occlusion, retinal detachment, macular hole, cystoid macular oedema and central serous retinopathy. Of the 25 residents and fellows surveyed, most agreed that the OCT that facilitated delivery of optimal urgent management. OCT also aided in the triage of patients to specialty clinics.

Conclusion

Expanded access to automated OCT in the urgent care setting shows promise for improving the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, which can be critical for optimising patient outcomes. OCT also provides clear, immediate documentation of pathology for substantiating medical decision-making.

### Long-term outcomes on quality of life following sutureless vitrectomy for symptomatic vitreous floaters [^111CitYQ]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose: To assess quality of life over long-term follow-up in patients who received sutureless pars plana vitrectomy for symptomatic vitreous floaters, with short-term safety reexamined. Methods: A single-center, consecutive case series with retrospective analysis of clinical and surgical records preceding and following sutureless pars plana vitrectomy was conducted from May 2022 to December 2022. Descriptive statistics compared data preceding surgery to last clinic visit. A 10-item quality-of-life questionnaire was then distributed to patients 4 to 7 years following surgery, after institutional review board-approved consent was obtained via telephone. Results: A total of 142 eyes (117 patients) underwent sutureless 25- or 27-gauge pars plana vitrectomy for symptomatic vitreous floaters. Overall mean (± SD) best-available Snellen visual acuity was 20/30 (0.2 ± 0.2 logMAR) preoperatively, which improved to 20/25 (0.1 ± 0.2 logMAR) postoperatively (P < .01). Early postoperative complications occurred in 7 (4.9%) of 142 eyes, of which 4 had transient cystoid macular edema, and 3 had a vitreous hemorrhage (1 of which had an additional surgery). Survey responses were collected on 71.1% of eyes, with 91.1% of patients rating the procedure a "complete or significant success", and the same percentage recommending family members undergo the procedure. Floaters impacted quality of life moderately or severely before vitrectomy in 94.1% of patients. Recurrence of any floaters occurred in 31.7% of eyes, with 26.7% experiencing only mild symptoms, 3% having no symptoms at the time of survey, and 2% having significant floaters. No specific preoperative characteristics were found to be predictive of a dissatisfied patient or a significant recurrence of vitreous floaters. Conclusions: Long-term patient-reported outcomes of sutureless pars plana vitrectomy for symptomatic floaters demonstrated improvements in patient quality of life and visual outcomes, with a low rate of complications. Sutureless vitrectomy should be considered for symptomatic patients who report their subjective severity of daily symptoms as "moderate" or "severe" floaters.

### Entrectinib (Rozlytrek) [^1166JFs3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.6	QT Interval Prolongation

Among the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across the clinical trials, 3.1% of patients with at least one post-baseline ECG assessment experienced QTcF interval prolongation of > 60 ms after starting ROZLYTREK and 0.6% had a QTcF interval > 500 ms [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Monitor patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc interval prolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, severe or uncontrolled heart failure and those taking other medicinal products associated with QT prolongation. Assess QT interval and electrolytes prior to initiation of ROZLYTREK and periodically during treatment, adjusting frequency based upon risk factors such as congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or concomitant medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Based on the severity of QTc interval prolongation, withhold ROZLYTREK and then resume at same or reduced dose, or permanently discontinue [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

5.7	Vision Disorders

Among the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, vision changes occurred in 21% of patients, including Grade 1 (17%), Grade 2 (2.8%) and Grade 3 (0.8%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Vision disorders occurring in ≥ 1% included blurred vision (9%), photophobia (5%), diplopia (3.1%), visual impairment (2%), photopsia (1.1%), cataract (1.1%), and vitreous floaters (1.1%).

For patients with new visual changes or changes that interfere with activities of daily living, withhold ROZLYTREK until improvement or stabilization and conduct an ophthalmological evaluation as clinically appropriate. Upon improvement or stabilization, resume ROZLYTREK at same or reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

### Floater stories: assessing the potential benefits of vitrectomy [^116ztQqR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic vitreous opacities (SVO, "floaters") in the mobile, aging vitreous that substantially interfere with daily visual activities (DVA) constitute degenerative vitreous syndrome (DVS). DVS is best distinguished from common "nuisance" floaters by use of "floater stories" written by presenting patients describing their symptoms. Here I discuss why vitreous opacity vitrectomy, though curative, has been adopted only belatedly and is still controversial, and I describe my long-term experience with its use for this disease.

### Vitrectomy for primary symptomatic vitreous opacities: an evidence-based review [^112PuCSZ]. Eye (2016). Low credibility.

Floaters are a common ocular condition which form as a consequence of aging changes in the vitreous. Although in most patients the symptoms are minimal, they can cause significant impairment in vision-related quality of life in a small population of patients. Recently there has been an increase in awareness of the visual disability caused by floaters, and the evidence-base for treatment of this condition using small-gauge vitrectomy has increased. In this review, we define the term 'floaters' as symptomatic vitreous opacities (SVO). We suggest a classification dependent on the presence or absence of posterior vitreous detachment and discuss their pathogenesis and natural history. We review their impact on patients' quality of life related to visual function. We review the psychological factors that may have a role in some patients who appear to be affected by SVO to the extent that they pursue all options including surgery with all its attendant risks. We summarise the available evidence-base of treatment options available for SVO with special emphasis on the safety and efficacy of vitrectomy for this condition.

### Acute visual loss as the presenting complaint of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^114c1r41]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The complaint of new floaters in the visual field is a common one in the practice of Family Medicine. Whereas these can represent serious problems such as a detached retina, it can also be representative of normal aging of the vitreous humor. In a young patient with this complaint, we were surprised to find that this occurred because of a branch retinal artery occlusion that led to the diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasias, also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. It was an uncommon presentation of an uncommon disease. Knowing more about this disease could help family practitioners diagnose it earlier and be able to screen family members appropriately.

### Clinical outcomes following implementation of a formalized "Flashes and floaters" emergency department triage protocol [^114D5tGc]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To report outcomes of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with new-onset visual flashes and/or floaters following implementation of a formalized triage protocol allowing eligible patients to be discharged for prompt outpatient ophthalmic examination.

Design

Retrospective consecutive case series.

Methods

Patient characteristics, protocol eligibility, and clinical outcomes were recorded for adult patients triaged within a formal "flashes and floaters" protocol at a single academic ED.

Results

A total of 457 patients presented for 471 unique ED encounters with a chief complaint of visual flashes and/or floaters between October 2014 and May 2018. In all, 61% of patient encounters (287/471) met protocol criteria for prompt outpatient ophthalmic examination, of whom 94% (269/287) were examined within 48 hours. Final diagnoses of protocol-eligible patients were posterior vitreous detachment only (73%, 197/269), retinal break(s) (10%, 26/269), migraine (5%, 14/269), and no cause or new cause found (10%, 27/269). No protocol-eligible patients had retinal detachment or diagnoses requiring emergent diagnostic or therapeutic care (0%, 95% CI = 0%-1.1%). Final diagnoses following 175 encounters not meeting criteria for deferred examination included posterior vitreous detachment only (25%, 43/175), retinal break(s) (19%, 33/175), macula-involving retinal detachment (13%, 22/175), macula-sparing retinal detachment (11%, 19/175), retinal arterial occlusion (2%, 3/175), and stroke (0.6%, 1/175). The Cohen kappa for agreement on protocol eligibility between the ED physician and ophthalmologist was 0.85.

Conclusions

A formalized ED "flashes and floaters" triage protocol may help identify patients for whom prompt outpatient ophthalmic examination may be more safely considered.

Conclusion

AIR remains a poorly understood and likely under-recognised complication of advanced cutaneous melanoma which may be triggered or exacerbated by immunotherapy. Given the diversity of presentations, AIR must be on the differential diagnosis for cancer patients who develop visual symptoms of floaters, photopsia, visual field deficit and/or decreased visual acuity after initiating immunotherapy. Collaboration between the patient's ophthalmologist and medical oncologist is crucial for individualised management and monitoring of AIR associated with immunotherapy.

### Vitreous opacity vitrectomy (VOV): safest possible removal of "Floaters" [^115SkqbL]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Plain Language Summary

Lens opacities developing in the aging eye are called cataracts. Cataracts are commonly removed with minimal risk and excellent results, replaced with a clear, artificial lens. Behind the lens, the "vitreous" gel also develops opacities that seem to "float" (floaters), appearing as false objects in the field of vision as the gel becomes more mobile with advancing age.

While floaters are usually only an occasional nuisance, some eyes develop many symptomatic vitreous opacities that substantially interfere with reading, driving, safely using stairs, and other daily visual activities (see). We call this "Degenerative Vitreous Syndrome", or DVS.

In this article, we describe how to diagnose DVS; and how to remove DVS vitreous opacities with the least possible surgical risk, similar to that of cataract extraction. We call this operation "Vitreous Opacity Vitrectomy", or VOV. It immediately restores continuously clear vision for DVS sufferers, as the eye quickly and permanently replaces the removed DVS gel with clear aqueous fluid.

### The burden of flashes and floaters in traditional general emergency services and utilization of ophthalmology on-call consultation: a cross-sectional study [^112h9bfH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Several proposals have been made to address the burden of emergency eye care including primary prevention of eye injuries, empowering general emergency physicians through medical education, equipment, and training, educating patients and local health care providers, and optimization of patient triage and so-called "front-end" operations, the last of which is most relevant to this study. Front-end processes are defined as the patient care processes that occur from the time of a patient's initial arrival to a GES to the time a health care provider formally assumes responsibility, notably including the triage process. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of front-end operation targeted care pathways to improve the care of otolaryngologic and head and neck emergency patients, emergency presentations for cystitis, and common gynecologic emergencies. In all studies, the identification of appropriate patients at triage for specifically designed care pathways resulted in a reduction in wait times and burden on health care providers without compromising safety.

### Nd: YAG laser vitreolysis versus pars plana vitrectomy for vitreous floaters [^1169kz4c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The vitreous is the clear jelly of the eye and contains fine strands of proteins. Throughout life the composition of this vitreous changes, which causes the protein strands in it to bundle together and scatter light before it reaches the retina. Individuals perceive the shadows cast by these protein bundles as 'floaters'. Some people are so bothered by floaters that treatment is required to control their symptoms. Two major interventions for floaters include Nd:YAG laser vitreolysis and vitrectomy. Nd:YAG laser vitreolysis involves using laser energy to fragment the vitreous opacities via a non-invasive approach. Vitrectomy involves the surgical replacement of the patient's vitreous (including the symptomatic vitreous floaters) with an inert and translucent balanced salt solution, through small openings in the pars plana.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness and safety of Nd:YAG laser vitreolysis to pars plana vitrectomy for symptomatic vitreous floaters.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 12), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 17 January 2017), Embase Ovid (1947 to 17 January 2017), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database) (1982 to 17 January 2017), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch); searched 17 January 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov); searched 17 January 2017 and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en); searched 17 January 2017. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We also searched conference proceedings to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared Nd:YAG laser vitreolysis to pars plana vitrectomy for treatment of symptomatic floaters.

Data Collection and Analysis

We planned to use methods recommended by Cochrane. The primary outcome we planned to measure was change in vision-related quality of life from baseline to 12 months, as determined by a vision-related quality of life questionnaire. The secondary outcomes we planned to measure were best corrected logMAR or Snellen visual acuity at 12 months for the treated eye(s) and costs. Adverse outcomes we planned to record were the occurrence of sight-threatening complications by 12 months (asymptomatic retinal tears, symptomatic retinal tears, retinal detachment, cataract formation, and endophthalmitis).

Main Results

No studies met the inclusion criteria of this review.

Authors' Conclusions

There are currently no RCTs that compare Nd:YAG laser vitreolysis with pars plana vitrectomy for the treatment of symptomatic floaters. Properly designed RCTs are needed to evaluate the treatment outcomes from the interventions described. We recommend future studies randomise participants to either a Nd:YAG laser vitreolysis group or a vitrectomy group, with participants in each group assigned to either receive treatment or a sham intervention. Future studies should follow participants at six months and 12 months after the intervention. Also they should use best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using an Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart read at 4 metres, vision-related quality of life (VRQOL), and adverse outcomes as the outcome measures of the trial.

Results

A total of 919 posts with 5345 non-automoderator comments were posted between March 18, 2018 and November 9, 2020. While posts that ask patient-specific questions were said to have been removed by the automoderator, almost half (403/919) of the posts available on the subreddit were found to be referencing patient questions. Furthermore, two-thirds (612/919) of the posts involved conversation surrounding medical care either within the post, subsequent comments, or both. Of the 5345 comments analyzed, 1196 were found to reference any type of medical care.

Amongst the 919 posts analyzed from r/Ophthalmology, the majority either mention (49%) or recommend (9.5%) ophthalmic care (Figure 2, Table 1). 7.7% of the posts mention other medical care and a negligible amount (0.4%) go as far as to recommend other medical care. Amongst the 5345 comments, the vast majority (78%) made no reference to medical care (Figure 3, Table 1). Of the 1196 comments that referenced any type of care, 66% mentioned ophthalmic care and 11% recommended ophthalmic care (Figure 3). Other forms of medical care were mentioned in 22% of comments and recommended in 1% of comments.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Blurred Vision: Advise patients to not drive or operate machinery if vision is not clear (e.g., blurred vision). Exercise caution in night driving and other hazardous occupations in poor illumination. (5.1)

Risk of Retinal Detachment: Rare cases of retinal detachment have been reported with miotics. Examination of the retina is advised in all patients prior to initiation of therapy. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care with sudden onset of flashes of lights, floaters, or vision loss. (5.2)

Iritis: Caution is advised in patients with iritis. (5.3)

5.1 Blurred Vision

Miotics, including QLOSI, may cause accommodative spasm. Advise patients to not drive or operate machinery if vision is not clear (e.g., blurred vision).

In addition, patients may experience temporary dim or dark vision with miotics, including QLOSI. Advise patients to exercise caution in night driving and other hazardous activities in poor illumination.

5.2 Risk of Retinal Detachment

Rare cases of retinal detachment have been reported with miotics when used in susceptible individuals and those with pre-existing retinal disease. Examination of the retina is advised in all patients prior to the initiation of therapy. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care with sudden onset of flashes of lights, floaters, or vision loss.

5.3 Iritis

QLOSI is not recommended to be used when iritis is present because adhesions (synechiae) may form between the iris and the lens.

5.4 Contact Lens Wear

Contact lens wearers should be advised to remove their lenses prior to the instillation of QLOSI and to wait 10 minutes after dosing before reinserting their contact lenses.

5.5 Potential for Eye Injury or Contamination

To prevent eye injury or contamination, avoid touching the tip of the single-patient-use vial to the eye or to any other surface.

Intravitreal injections — post-injection risks and patient instructions note that "the overall risk of complications is low in the hands of experienced ophthalmologists", yet "known post-injection risks of intravitreal injections can be vision-threatening and require prompt diagnosis, treatment, and possibly surgical intervention". Serious but rare complications listed include "acute-onset endophthalmitis", "intraocular inflammation or pseudo-endophthalmitis", "cataract development/progression", "retinal detachment", "hemorrhage", and "sustained elevated IOP", with "additional infrequent complications" such as "hypotony, angle closure, retinal vein occlusions, retinal pigment epithelial tears, iritis/uveitis, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, corneal epitheliopathy or abrasion, maculopathy, retinal vasculitis, and allergic or anaphylactic reactions". For counseling, "patients must be instructed to promptly report any symptoms of pain, worsening redness, reduced vision, increased sensitivity to light, or increased floaters, which may indicate endophthalmitis". A Cochrane review summarized on the page "found a rate of endophthalmitis of less than 1%" for anti-VEGF injections for neovascular AMD through January 2018.

### The burden of flashes and floaters in traditional general emergency services and utilization of ophthalmology on-call consultation: a cross-sectional study [^111vTE4n]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

The negative consequences of overcrowding in GESs are considerable and abound in the literature. Eye-related emergency visits contribute to this patient volume and research is needed around the health systems that currently exist to optimize patient care.

The epidemiology of eye-related complaints in GESs has been characterized in a variety of health care settings, representing 1.5–18% of all GES visits[,–], and has been increasing in volume over time. In the United States, this represents approximately 2 million visits per year with an annual cost of 2 billion dollars. Despite the incidence of eye-related visits to GES, several studies have highlighted the lack of comfort general emergency physicians have in managing eye-related issues. Ophthalmology, along with orthopedics, represents one of the most frequently consulted services by GESs.

Our current results demonstrate a consultation rate of 89%, for the population of adult patients presenting with F/F in GESs, appreciably higher than the 39.6% across all eye-related complaints in the ED reported by Wang et al. at a tertiary care, university based medical center in the US, and the 20–40% overall consultation rate for all-comers to the ED. However, these studies did not examine the nature of the presenting complaint, which would be the primary driver of consultation, as our study has.

The healthcare utilization of these patients ultimately referred to OESs is not insignificant. Roughly extrapolating based on population size, this would represent approximately 2 million dollars per year in hospital costs and over 31,845 h (1326 days) of patient waiting in GES setting within the province of Ontario per year.

### The burden of flashes and floaters in traditional general emergency services and utilization of ophthalmology on-call consultation: a cross-sectional study [^113mHXEp]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A common consult to ophthalmology emergency services (OESs) is the acute onset of flashes of light and new floaters (F/F) in an adult. Patients with this complaint require a dilated fundus examination to rule out the presence of retinal tears or detachment. Often these patients present to general emergency services (GESs) as a point of first contact with the healthcare system before being referred to OESs where a thorough posterior segment examination can be conducted.

Within North America, there is a trend towards increased utilization of GESs including emergency departments (EDs) and urgent care centers (UCCs). Eye-related complaints represent a substantial subset of visits in GESs, accounting for approximately 2 million visits to the ED in the United States every year. These visits contribute to the overcrowding and overburdening of GESs which have been associated with poorer clinical outcomes. In addition, several studies have demonstrated the increased cost of care delivered in a GES setting compared to an ambulatory clinic setting for the same complaint. There is considerable motivation to identify inefficiencies with the delivery of emergency eye care through current GESs where patients are and will continue to present. This point has been accentuated with the recent global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as hospitals have been faced with the need to create bed space, minimize transmissibility, and patient and physician exposure, all while continuing to provide appropriate care. One area that has been identified as a target for quality improvement in GESs is the optimization of triage and consult services. GESs constitute approximately 50% of the utilization of OESs in Ontario and represent a key first point of contact in the delivery of emergency eye care for many patients. Through the process of triage, the opportunity exists to both efficiently and safely identifying patients that might benefit from an expediate or alternative pathway of care.

The population of patients presenting with F/F in GESs has not been previously studied and may be particularly amenable to optimization of their care pathway upon first contact with the healthcare system.

The purpose of this study was to describe the healthcare utilization of patients presenting with F/F to GESs in a publicly funded health care system and secondarily characterize their demographic and clinical features, and identify features related to consultation of OESs. Our hypothesis was that a substantial portion of these patients would require further consultation from OESs and identification of these patients at their GES triage encounter would represent a potential target for optimizing delivery of care.

### The burden of flashes and floaters in traditional general emergency services and utilization of ophthalmology on-call consultation: a cross-sectional study [^116LC366]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Due to a multitude of factors, a high proportion of patients presenting with flashes and/or floaters in general emergency service settings require consultation by ophthalmology emergency services. In the current framework of care, these patients can contribute to emergency service volume, consume healthcare resources, and spend significant time waiting before their contact with an eye care provider. Ultimately, we hope this health systems research will help inform future practice patterns when it comes to the triage of eye-related complaints by contributing to the knowledge needed to guide prospective studies on innovative care pathways appropriate for local health systems.

### Managing toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: consensus recommendations from the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) toxicity management working group [^113wrstk]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Ophthalmologic adverse events

Clinical presentation and epidemiology

Ocular irAEs, predominantly uveitis (anterior more commonly than posterior or panuveitis) are reported in < 1% of patients taking ICIs. There have also been reports of orbital inflammation, episcleritis, blepharitis, optic nerve swelling, peripheral ulcerative keratitis and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada picture with localized serous retinal detachment. Patients prescribed ICIs should be advised to alert the clinician to new onset of blurred vision, floaters, flashing lights, changes in color vision, eye redness, photophobia or light sensitivity, visual distortion and visual field changes, scotomas, tender eyes or pain on eye movement, eyelid swelling or proptosis or double vision. Patient counseling is crucial to ensure that early signs and symptoms are recognized in a timely manner.

Diagnostic evaluation

Although prompt ophthalmologic referral is important in ALL cases of visual complaints, certain tests can be performed by the oncologist in the office. These include examination for visual acuity, which can be done using an eye chart on a smart phone with the patient wearing reading glasses for near vision or glasses for distant vision, as necessary; color vision; red reflex; pupils (equal, round, reactive), including testing for an afferent pupillary defect, which can indicate optic nerve or extensive retinal disease; and penlight inspection of the anterior part of the eye. Direct ophthalmoscopy to examine the optic nerve and retina is unlikely to be useful for diagnosis of retinal or optic nerve issues when performed by a non-ophthalmology-trained physician. Ocular irAEs may be asymmetric so it is important to examine each eye separately. Ocular irAEs are frequently accompanied by irAEs in other systems, especially colitis, so broader systems inquiry is helpful.

### Utility values associated with vitreous floaters [^116wxjJX]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To ascertain the health-related quality of life associated with symptomatic degenerative vitreous floaters.

Design

Cross-sectional questionnaire survey.

Methods

In this institution-based study, 311 outpatients aged 21 years and older who presented with symptoms of floaters were enrolled. Data from 266 patients (85.5%) who completed the questionnaire were analyzed. Utility values were assessed using a standardized utility value questionnaire. The time trade-off (TTO) and standard gamble (SG) for death and blindness techniques were used to calculate the utility values. Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate analyses were performed using Stata Release 6.0.

Results

The mean age of the study population was 52.9 ± 12.02 years (range, 21–97). The mean utility values were 0.89, 0.89, and 0.93 for TTO, SG (death), and SG (blindness), respectively. Patients aged ≤ 55 years reported significantly lower SG (blindness) utility values when compared with patients above 55 years of age (age ≤ 55 = 0.92, age > 55 = 0.94, P = 0.007). Utility measurements did not demonstrate significant relationship with any of the other socio-demographic variables examined in this study. The utility values did not demonstrate any significant relationship with other ocular characteristics such as duration of symptoms, presence of a posterior vitreous detachment, and presence or severity of myopia.

Conclusions

Symptomatic degenerative vitreous floaters have a negative impact on health-related quality of life. Younger symptomatic patients are more likely to take a risk of blindness to get rid of the floaters than older patients.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Discuss the following with the patient.

Advise patients that ENCELTO implantation may be associated with infectious endophthalmitis (eye infection), retinal tear and detachment (retina separates from the eye wall resulting in vision loss), vitreous hemorrhage (bleeding within the central cavity of the eye), implant extrusion, suture-related complications, cataract formation (clouding of the lens of the eye), severe vision loss, and delayed dark adaptation (ability of the eye to adjust from bright lighting conditions to dark lighting conditions) [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

Instruct patients to seek immediate care from an ophthalmologist if they experience any signs or symptoms that could be associated with these events which may include the following:

An increase in floaters, the appearance of "spider webs", flashing lights, sensitivity to light, or loss of vision or visual field;
Increasing eye pain, progressive redness in the white of the eye, a sudden sensation that something is in their eye (i.e., foreign body sensation) or eye discharge.

Advise patients that they may temporarily experience the following after ENCELTO implantation:

Mild sensation of something in the eye (i.e., foreign body sensation)
Eye redness, irritation, pain or discomfort, or dryness
Blurred vision or floaters

### Inpatient consultations for ophthalmology – 2025 [^112K1cjA]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

Inpatient ophthalmology consultation — common indications and triage guidance are outlined as follows: Frequent consultation requests include screening eye examinations for ocular involvement in the setting of candidemia, evaluations for papilledema in suspected cases of elevated intracranial pressure, and trauma or orbital fractures, and other common reasons include vision changes, eye pain, red eye, and flashes and floaters. Ophthalmology consultants should have a low threshold for evaluating patients with active ocular signs and symptoms, which can represent an ophthalmic manifestation of underlying systemic or neurologic disease. Evidence-based protocols can assist with careful and effective triage of screening examinations, some of which may benefit from teleconsultation or reasonably deferred outpatient evaluation. Consulting ophthalmologists should apply clinical judgment in each case to determine the level of acuity of the consultation and the best evaluation and treatment plan for each patient, and professionalism and thoughtful communication with other hospital services are paramount for collaborative multidisciplinary management of potentially complex medical conditions that can be vision- or life-threatening. Medical personnel should not hesitate to seek an ophthalmologist's evaluation and guidance when in-hospital consultation is appropriate for their patients.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^116qdhC1]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Cataract in the Adult Eye — postoperative endophthalmitis: Two pharmacologic interventions have been shown to reduce the rate of postoperative endophthalmitis conclusively in clinical trials; they include treating the eyelids and conjunctival cul de sac with povidone iodine immediately before surgery and injecting cefuroxime into the anterior chamber at the conclusion of surgery. Moxifloxacin injection is currently popular in the United States even though it lacks randomized, prospective clinical trial evidence. Patients who develop endophthalmitis may present with decreased vision, pain, redness, new floaters, and eyelid edema, and the onset of symptoms was historically considered to occur during the first postoperative week, but newer studies report delayed onset of up to several weeks. Patients should be encouraged to call their surgeon if they experience pain or worsening vision. If endophthalmitis is suspected, referral to a retina specialist is appropriate; if a retina specialist is unavailable within 24 hours, the anterior or posterior segment should be tapped by any experienced ophthalmologist, followed by intravitreal injection of antibiotics. The Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study (EVS) recommended an intravitreal tap plus injection of antibiotics in patients with vision of hand motion or better, whereas patients with vision of light perception or worse are more successfully treated by pars plana vitrectomy and antibiotics. Endophthalmitis must be differentiated from TASS and TPSS, and several articles found no conclusive evidence for an association between clear corneal incision and endophthalmitis.

### Pemigatinib (Pemazyre) [^111JACXt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Ocular
Toxicity

Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment (RPED)

PEMAZYRE can cause RPED, which may cause symptoms such as blurred vision, visual floaters, or photopsia. Clinical trials of PEMAZYRE did not conduct routine monitoring including optical coherence tomography (OCT) to detect asymptomatic RPED; therefore, the incidence of asymptomatic RPED with PEMAZYRE is unknown.

Among 635 patients who received a starting dose of PEMAZYRE 13.5 mg across clinical trials, RPED occurred in 11% of patients, including Grade 3–4 RPED in 1.3%. The median time to first onset of RPED was 56 days. RPED led to dose interruption of PEMAZYRE in 3.1% of patients, and dose reduction and permanent discontinuation in 1.3% and in 0.2% of patients, respectively. RPED resolved or improved to Grade 1 levels in 76% of patients who required dosage modification of PEMAZYRE for RPED.

Perform a comprehensive ophthalmological examination including OCT prior to initiation of PEMAZYRE and every 2 months for the first 6 months and every 3 months thereafter during treatment. For onset of visual symptoms, refer patients for ophthalmologic evaluation urgently, with follow-up every 3 weeks until resolution or discontinuation of PEMAZYRE.

Modify the dose or permanently discontinue PEMAZYRE as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Dry Eye

Among 635 patients who received a starting dose of PEMAZYRE 13.5 mg across clinical trials, dry eye occurred in 31% of patients, including Grade 3–4 in 1.6% of patients. Treat patients with ocular demulcents as needed.

### Objective assessment of symptomatic vitreous floaters using optical coherence tomography: a case report [^112ToqLQ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

While many cases of vitreous cysts have been described, the color photograph presented here provides an outstanding illustration. Using multimodal imaging, we were able to reassure the patient that her visual symptom was secondary to the cyst. Two publications describe the structure of vitreous cysts using OCT. OCT has recently been utilized to quantify vitreous signal intensity in patients with uveitis. However to our knowledge, this is the first description of using OCT to illustrate the shadowing effect on the retina by a vitreous cyst, or indeed any large vitreous opacity. This technique enables an objective, qualitative assessment of the symptoms caused by large vitreous opacities and may provide a simple yet useful adjunctive tool in evaluating the risk-benefit ratio of vitrectomy in patients with large symptomatic vitreous floaters.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis — ophthalmology referral and monitoring in people with HIV are specified as follows: Development of floaters or changes in visual acuity should prompt an urgent referral to ophthalmology (AIII). The panel recommends a baseline ophthalmologic examination for people with HIV and CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3, with counseling about the potential symptoms of CMV retinitis (CIII). In the premodern antiretroviral therapy (ART) era, follow-up ophthalmologic examinations were performed every 3 to 4 months for persons with CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3, and the same follow-up schedule is appropriate if CD4 counts fall below 50 cells/mm3 for any reason, including treatment failure (CIII). Individuals with CMV retinitis and ART failure are more likely to be asymptomatic than were individuals in the premodern ART era.

### Google deepMind's gemini AI versus chatGPT: a comparative analysis in ophthalmology [^116Y9zjn]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Next, we asked Gemini about how often an individual should have an eye exam. Gemini AI suggested four age-based recommendations for eye exams, noting that individual needs may vary due to factors like eyeglass use, existing eye conditions, or family medical history. Similarly, ChatGPT had categories of 'Children and teenagers', 'Adults', and 'Older adults'. Both Gemini AI and ChatGPT highlighted the importance of consulting with an eye specialist.

Next we prompted both of AI chatbots about a patient reporting "flashes of lights" in one eye, and if they should attend the emergency department. Both Bard and ChatGPT correctly recommended to attend the emergency department, particularly if this vision change occurred suddenly. Both chatbots also appropriately stated that this symptom could be a sign of a retinal tear or detachment, requiring urgent evaluation. These AI-generated outputs were both specific, and appropriate.

Finally, we prompted both AI chatbots about what a patient should do if they started seeing floaters or black dots (see Fig. 2). There are several causes of floaters ranging from relatively benign (e.g. age-related) to more serious causes (e.g. retinal detachment). Bard accurately reported a few potential reasons and suggested a formal consultation with an eye care specialist if sudden blindness developed or if the patient started experiencing changes in floater size or light flashes, which correctly addresses potential risk Bard also provided practical tips to reduce discomfort due to floaters. ChatGPT's response was similar to Bard and also correctly explained causes of floaters and when to seek urgent medical assistance. ChatGPT, unlike Bard, also provided information on floaters treatment. In addition, ChatGPT advised seeing an eye doctor if there were several floaters, light flashes or a seeing a curtain over the vision field (Fig. 3).

### Ophthalmology inquiries on reddit: what should physicians know? [^111ZgBt5]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

When considering what patients are discussing within posts, the increased frequency of flashes and floaters appearing in conversation suggests that patients are turning to this platform to ask others what they should do when experiencing these symptoms. While one of the most common reasons for acute onset flashes and floaters is a posterior vitreous detachment, patients should be aware that they need to be appropriately evaluated in order to rule out a possible retinal detachment. Patient education strategies aimed to decrease delayed presentation of certain ophthalmic concerns may be useful tactics for ophthalmologists to use in office. One particular acronym, FLASH, can help patients remember the following symptoms for vision-threatening eye emergencies: flashes and floaters, loss of vision, aching pain, second image, help. This education can also help address the other commonly brought up topics in posts, glaucoma and headaches. Patients experiencing acute angle closure glaucoma may often presents with headaches and blurry vision, both of which are encompassed by the acronym. This can help patients with these concerns know to seek immediate medical attention as opposed to turning to the advice of those on the internet. It is important to note that patients are not exclusively bringing up acute medical concerns in posts. Posts are also made by those seeking more information about chronic conditions they may have such as glaucoma, astigmatism, dry eye, and uveitis. These results can help guide further patient education both on social media and in the office.

### Comparing the current knowledge&understanding of vitreo-retinal conditions&associated practice: optometrists versus year one specialty ophthalmic trainees in the UK [^112X2PZQ]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

In the first of its kind, community-based optometrist encompassing all experience levels and Ophthalmic Specialty Trainees coming to the end of their first year of training were invited to participate in a survey which compromised of 15 question items pertaining to knowledge and understanding of Vitreo-Retinal conditions and associated practice. The themes of the questions included were: detecting signs, spot diagnoses, current practice methods including referrals and follow up.

Significant differences were noted across all the themes assessed i.e. one question portrayed a fundal image of a retinal tear causing a retinal detachment. This was correctly diagnosed by 100% of the OST1 group compared to only 84.2% of optometry cohort. A staggering 56.1% of optometrists stated that they were 'not confident at all' identifying Shafer's sign, which was not the case in the OST1 group (100% were 'confident'). Skills to identity and differentiate chronic conditions such as chronic detachments, retinoschisis and macular holes were poor in both groups, more so in the optometry group. Other notable findings included: a) 20% of the optometry cohort do not dilate every patient presenting with flashing lights and floaters, b) only 14% of the optometry cohort use Tropicamide 1% and Phenylephrine 2.5% to dilate patients and c) in a symptomatic patient (flashing and floaters), with no detectable clinical signs, 12.3% of optometrists refer such patients to the hospital eye service (see Fig. 1). Interestingly, the majority of optometrists in our cohort, 73.7%, reported that they had 10 or more years of clinical experience.

Showing the responses given to the question 'A patient presents to you with flashing lights and floaters.

On Examination (O/E) there is no tobacco dust, no breaks are seen, and no detachment is detected. The patient is very symptomatic. What would your next step be in the management of this patient?'

A free text box response was also included at the end of the survey (for optometry responders, Fig. 2). A range of concerns were reported including detecting signs (tears and Shafer's sign), inadequacy of dilatation achieved, differentiating between diagnoses and onwards referral and urgency.

### Floater stories: assessing the potential benefits of vitrectomy [^112Z5Pi2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Who Needs Vitrectomy?

I have performed vitrectomy for symptomatic floaters since 1990, almost always in patients over 50 years of age, and more commonly in recent years, due to the availability of technologically advanced 27-gauge vitrectomy. My experience is that unrecruited patients with primary complaints attributable to chronic floaters rarely have "unrealistic expectations". They remember continuously clear vision, and they are simply seeking to regain it.

I learned this by "deep listening" to patient's "floater stories" (of symptoms) before the era of sophisticated imaging and the ubiquitous use of questionnaires attempting to measure "quality of life" effects. To a sufficiently attentive and receptive physician their suffering was authentic and undeniable, yet these patients were then often regarded as obsessive or neurotic.

But much more often they were normal people who had been rejected for treatment elsewhere, likely because between floaters they still measured "20/20" on standard visual acuity testing. They had commonly been told, "You don't have a problem", or "The floaters will go away", or "You'll get used to them", or "Nothing can be done", or "There's an operation but it's too risky". And they were desperate not to live the remainder of their lives dodging continual visual obscurations caused by vitreous opacities, daylight to dark.

Once vitreous examination confirmed opacities correlating with a patient's substantial symptoms, I simultaneously explained and drew the vitrectomy operation and described its risks (Figure 2). I then asked patients to "go home and write your floater story before we come to a final decision". In so doing they confronted their visual disability more directly than ever before.

Figure 2
Drawing of the VOV operation created by Robert Morris, MD.

Each floater story served a patient education and documentation purpose and helped me analyze the potential benefit before offering treatment. And patients were better able to answer the question, "Am I willing to accept the (percentage) risk of possible vision loss to regain continuously clear vision", as we made a final decision together, to either treat or observe. I still use floater stories today to help identify appropriate patients for treatment (see) and it is rare for a patient so selected to be dissatisfied with a treatment outcome.

### The burden of flashes and floaters in traditional general emergency services and utilization of ophthalmology on-call consultation: a cross-sectional study [^116FmChH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

While no study has specifically investigated triage directed expediated care pathways for eye-related complaints in GESs, Singman et al. studied a related approach in implementing a center wide program allowing for same-day appointments in the ophthalmology outpatient clinic. Implementation of same-day appointments did not reduce the number of ED visits for ophthalmic complaints suggesting that the population utilizing same-day appointments is different than those presenting to the ED, or perhaps a masking of the effect of the diversion of ophthalmic complaints from the ED due to rising presentations to the ED in the post-intervention period for other reasons. Nevertheless, the study demonstrated significantly reduced costs associated with same-day appointments in the outpatient setting as well as significantly reduced transit time for the patients.

One challenge of symptom-oriented research and applying triage guided operations in GESs is the recognition of the lack of specificity of many symptoms, such as fatigue or weakness, to an isolated organ system or medical specialty. Symptoms of F/F are relatively specific to the ocular system and occasionally the neurologic system, and can often further be refined to the posterior segment of the eye with additional information from history available at time of triage. Another possible concern is the increased workload directed to the downstream service, in this case OESs. Presumably this would not be the case as the majority of these patients with F/F would eventually have OES consulted for them and the use of these pathways would simply identify these patients earlier, in fact leading to a decreased overall medical workload. A frequently voiced concern of bypassing evaluation in the ED/UCC is that of significant pathology being missed. However, a review of ED-based strategies to divert patients to their primary care provider or a designated primary care clinic found diversion strategies to be no less safe or more harmful than standard ED care. An important distinction is that these studies investigated diversion as opposed to facilitation from the ED. The consultation rate of 89% in our population of F/F patients reflects only a rudimentary criteria examining purely symptoms of F/F. Conceivably, any attempt at selecting patients for an expediated care pathway would adopt a more nuanced approach. For example, setting further criteria based on only 3 additional factors identified by our multivariable regression results and examining the population of patients that were ≥ 45, had acute symptoms, and lacked headache and neurologic symptoms, reveals that 94% (468/499) of patients had OESs consulted. Using other additional features such as basic vital signs other systemic symptoms could help further select outpatients that should proceed through GESs rather than an expediated care pathway. These statistically notable factors reflect the clinical framework physicians would use in determining whether to consult OESs. Patients with symptoms of headache and neurologic may be more likely to have non-ocular diagnoses such as migraine or stroke. Posterior vitreous detachment is a process related to aging and those < 45 are less likely to require an examination of sequelae of posterior vitreous detachment with OESs. Presentation to UCC is a unique feature to the local health system where the university eye clinic is physically in the same building as the SJHH UCC. Patients with previous ocular history that would have been managed at the eye clinic would be more likely to present to the associated UCC and emergency physicians may be more inclined to consult for a patient because of the physical proximity. In general, patients with F/F may regard their condition as less acute than requiring presenting to the ED and favor presenting to the UCCs.

### Acute-onset floaters and flashes: is this patient at risk for retinal detachment? [^117MgUEE]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Acute onset of monocular floaters and/or flashes represents a common presentation to primary care physicians, and the most likely diagnosis is posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). A significant proportion of patients with acute PVD develop an associated retinal tear that can lead to retinal detachment and permanent vision loss if left untreated.

Objective

To quantify the association between relevant clinical variables and risk of retinal tear in patients presenting with acute-onset floaters and/or flashes and PVD.

Data Sources

Structured MEDLINE (January 1950-September 2009) and EMBASE (January 1980-September 2009) searches and a hand search of references and citations of retrieved articles yielded 17 relevant studies.

Study Selection

Studies of high-level methods that related elements of the history or physical examination in patients presenting with floaters and/or flashes and PVD to the likelihood of retinal tear.

Results

For patients with acute onset of floaters and/or flashes who are self-referred or referred to an ophthalmologist, the prevalence of retinal tear is 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12%-16%). Subjective visual reduction is the most important symptom associated with retinal tear (likelihood ratio [LR], 5.0; 95% CI, 3.1–8.1). Vitreous hemorrhage on slitlamp biomicroscopy is the best-studied finding with the narrowest positive LR for retinal tear (summary LR, 10; 95% CI, 5.1–20). Absence of vitreous pigment during this examination is the best-studied finding with the narrowest negative LR (summary LR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.12–0.43). Patients initially diagnosed as having uncomplicated PVD have a 3.4% chance of a retinal tear within 6 weeks. The risk increases with new onset of at least 10 floaters (summary LR, 8.1–36) or subjective visual reduction (summary LR, 2.3–17) during this period.

Conclusions

Primary care physicians should evaluate patients with acute-onset floaters and/or flashes due to suspected PVD, or patients with known PVD and a change in symptoms, for high-risk features of retinal tear and detachment. Physicians should always assess these patients' visual acuity. Patients at increased risk should be triaged for urgent ophthalmologic assessment.

### Objective assessment of symptomatic vitreous floaters using optical coherence tomography: a case report [^113W92oq]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with symptomatic vitreous floaters are often highly motivated for surgery. Neodymium YAG laser vitreolysis has been used to treat vitreous floaters, but is less efficacious than vitrectomy which completely resolves symptoms in 93% of eyes. However, vitrectomy carries vision-threatening risks including retinal breaks and detachment, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, choroidal haemorrhage, macular pucker, and cataract progression. Justifying floaterectomy without an objective assessment of patients' symptoms can be difficult, particularly in healthy eyes with normal visual acuity and without a posterior vitreous detachment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive imaging technique that has revolutionized the practice of ophthalmology since its introduction in 1991. OCT has evolved to enable detailed imaging of many intraocular structures, however this case report describes the first use of OCT as a means of objectively and qualitatively assessing the visual impact of vitreous opacities. We utilized a large vitreous cyst to illustrate the technique.

### Floater stories: assessing the potential benefits of vitrectomy [^115HcCEh]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Symptomatic vitreous opacities (SVO, "floaters") in the mobile, aging vitreous that substantially interfere with daily visual activities (DVA) constitute degenerative vitreous syndrome (DVS). DVS is best distinguished from common "nuisance" floaters by use of "floater stories" written by presenting patients describing their symptoms. Here I discuss why vitreous opacity vitrectomy, though curative, has been adopted only belatedly and is still controversial, and I describe my long-term experience with its use for this disease.

### Common eye emergencies [^1161AXCe]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Ocular emergencies such as retinal detachments, mechanical globe injuries, and chemical injuries can cause permanent vision loss if they are not recognized and treated promptly. Family physicians should be familiar with the signs and symptoms associated with each condition, and be able to perform a basic eye examination to assess the situation. The assessment includes measurement of visual acuity, pupillary examination, visual field testing, slit lamp or penlight examination of the anterior segment of the eye, and direct funduscopic examination. Patients with symptomatic floaters and flashing lights require a dilated fundoscopic examination and prompt referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of a retinal tear or detachment. A globe laceration or rupture should be suspected in patients with a recent history of trauma from a blunt or penetrating object. Prophylactic oral antibiotics can be administered after a globe injury to prevent endophthalmitis, and the eye should be covered with a metal shield until evaluation by an ophthalmologist. Chemical injuries require immediate irrigation of the eye to neutralize the pH of the ocular surface.

### Practice patterns and responsiveness to simulated common ocular complaints among US ophthalmology centers during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1135r8Ri]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically changed how comprehensive ophthalmology practices care for patients.

Objective

To report practice patterns for common ocular complaints during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic among comprehensive ophthalmology practices in the US.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this cross-sectional study, 40 private practices and 20 university centers were randomly selected from 4 regions across the US. Data were collected on April 29 and 30, 2020.

Interventions

Investigators placed telephone calls to each ophthalmology practice office. Responses to 3 clinical scenarios-refraction request, cataract evaluation, and symptoms of a posterior vitreous detachment-were compared regionally and between private and university centers.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary measure was time to next appointment for each of the 3 scenarios. Secondary measures included use of telemedicine and advertisement of COVID-19 precautions.

Results

Of the 40 private practices, 2 (5%) were closed, 24 (60%) were only seeing urgent patients, and 14 (35%) remained open to all patients. Of the 20 university centers, 2 (10%) were closed, 17 (85%) were only seeing urgent patients, and 1 (5%) remained open to all patients. There were no differences for any telemedicine metric. University centers were more likely than private practices to mention preparations to limit the spread of COVID-19 (17 of 20 [85%] vs 14 of 40 [35%]; mean difference, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.26–0.65; P < .001). Private practices had a faster next available appointment for cataract evaluations than university centers, with a mean (SD) time to visit of 22.1 (27.0) days vs 75.5 (46.1) days (mean difference, 53.4; 95% CI, 23.1–83.7; P < .001). Private practices were also more likely than university centers to be available to see patients with flashes and floaters (30 of 40 [75%] vs 8 of 20 [40%]; mean difference, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22–0.79; p = 0.01).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study of investigator telephone calls to ophthalmology practice offices, there were uniform recommendations for the 3 routine ophthalmic complaints. Private practices had shorter times to next available appointment for cataract extraction and were more likely to evaluate posterior vitreous detachment symptoms. As there has not been a study examining these practice patterns before the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevance of these findings on public health is yet to be determined.

### Differences in SARS-CoV-2 recommendations from major ophthalmology societies worldwide [^115BuGqf]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Urgent versus non-urgent care

Table 2 highlights examples of urgent and non-urgent procedures provided by each society.

Table 2
Summary of recommendations on urgent care for ophthalmologists during the COVID-19 pandemic per international ophthalmology society

For instance, RCOphth displays UK-based resources, like the Moorfields Eye Hospital National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, and emits its own guidelines on urgent and non-urgent care. It also states that all routine ophthalmic surgeries and face-to-face outpatient must be delayed, except if patients are at elevated risk of harm. Ophthalmology accident and emergency departments must remain open with appropriate support to ensure adequate patient triage and consultations.

AAO listed 53 suggestions of 'urgent' surgical procedures associated with indications. For example, ophthalmologists should perform brachytherapy for intraocular malignancy.COS, AIOS and JOS display this comprehensive list on their website but also published their own guidelines.

AIOS provided a list of twenty ophthalmic emergencies, which are very similar to AAO's. In addition to those emergencies, it provides a list of 11 complaints in order to rule out emergencies (ie, chemical/thermal/mechanical eye injury, acute red eye, photophobia and sudden halos/floaters/discharge/eyelid drooping).

While referring its members to AAO's resources, JOS has its own list examples regarding urgent treatment, notably retinal detachment, ocular trauma and retinoblastoma. The list has then been updated to include more examples of urgent care (ie, paediatric glaucoma, orbital fracture and bulging cataracts). Unlike the other societies that consider common adult cataract surgery as an elective treatment, JOS mentions that delaying cataract surgeries depend on each patient's circumstances.

### Floater stories: assessing the potential benefits of vitrectomy [^111cYwwT]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lens opacities of aging (cataracts) are commonly removed and replaced with a clear lens implant. Opacities in the vitreous gel behind the lens ("floaters") are usually minimal and upon examination are typically considered insignificant.

Symptomatic vitreous opacities (SVO, herein synonymous with "floaters") in the mobile, aging vitreous that substantially interfere with daily visual activities are relatively rare and are only recently receiving widespread attention. Here I discuss why vitrectomy - the only procedure that predictably cures extensive vitreous opacities (Figure 1) - has been adopted only belatedly and is still controversial. And I describe my long-term experience with its use for this disease.

Figure 1
(A) [Before] Image of Vitreous Opacity Vitrectomy (VOV) removing extensive vitreous opacities. (B) [After] Image of a clear visual axis following VOV.

Why did nearly three decades elapse between the advent of pars plana vitrectomy and the first publication, in the year 2000, of its use to remove (chronic) floaters?,

Why were only seven "floater vitrectomy" articles published during the next eight years, while during the same period over seven hundred articles were published on similarly elective vitrectomy for macular pucker?

And eight years after the American Society of Retina Specialists chose our floater vitrectomy video for the 2007 Buckler award (the first time an ophthalmic society acknowledged floater vitrectomy as reasonable), why did 75% of surveyed retina specialists still respond that they were unlikely to perform floater vitrectomy?

In order of frequency, these physicians' answers were 1) the risks of vitrectomy, 2) unrealistic patient expectations, and 3) fear of ridicule by colleagues. Moreover, the authors of this 2015 report described floater vitrectomy as "immensely controversial".

### The BElfast retinal tear and detachment score (BERT score) [^111eEi7F]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To establish a scoring system to triage patients presenting with symptoms of flashes and floaters to allow safe differentiation between those with retinal tears and detachments, versus uncomplicated posterior vitreous detachments (PVDs).

Methods

Prospective and retrospective audits of 153 patients presenting to eye casualty and vitreoretinal clinics to ascertain the clinical features most likely to be associated with retinal pathology, rather than simple PVD. We then developed a scoring system, which was applied to 160 patients in a further prospective audit.

Results

The significant risk factors, symptoms and signs were identified then given a number related to their importance: male sex 1, myopia 1, blurred vision 2, shadow 2, vitreous haemorrhage 3, tobacco dust 4. The scores were summed and a total score > 3 was more likely to be a complicated PVD. Sensitivity of the scoring system was 90% (confidence interval (CI) 68.3–98.8%), specificity 80% (CI 73.2–86.9%), positive predictive value 40% (CI 25.7–55.7%), and negative predictive value 98.26% (CI 93.9–99.8%).

Conclusions

The BElfast Retinal Tear and detachment Score is an easy to apply scoring system, which has a high sensitivity and negative predictive value i.e. nearly all retinal tears or detachments are detected by the scoring system.

### Interventions for asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration for preventing retinal detachment [^116Uvxxj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration are visible lesions that are risk factors for later retinal detachment. Retinal detachments occur when fluid in the vitreous cavity passes through tears or holes in the retina and separates the retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium. Creation of an adhesion surrounding retinal breaks and lattice degeneration, with laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy, has been recommended as an effective means of preventing retinal detachment. This therapy is of value in the management of retinal tears associated with the symptoms of flashes and floaters and persistent vitreous traction upon the retina, because such symptomatic retinal breaks are associated with a high rate of progression to retinal detachment. Retinal tears and holes unassociated with acute symptoms and lattice degeneration are significantly less likely to be the sites of retinal breaks that are responsible for later retinal detachment. Nevertheless, treatment of these problems is frequently recommended, in spite of the fact that the effectiveness of this therapy is unproven.

Objectives

The purpose of this review is to evaluate the effects of interventions for asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register - CENTRAL (which includes the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group specialized register), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Textbooks regarding retinal detachment and the reference lists of relevant reports were reviewed in an effort to find additional study reports. Experts in the field were contacted for details of other published and unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

This review was designed to include randomised controlled trials in which one treatment for asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration was compared to another treatment or to no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer assessed the search results and collected relevant studies. Since no studies met the inclusion criteria, no studies were assessed for methodological quality. No data were extracted and no meta-analysis could be performed.

Main Results

No trials were found that met the inclusion criteria for this review.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No conclusions could be reached about the effects of surgical interventions to prevent retinal detachment in eyes with asymptomatic retinal breaks and/or lattice degeneration. Some current recommendations for treatment, based upon a consensus of expert opinion, are contradicted by the best available evidence.

### Endophthalmitis following pars plana vitrectomy for vitreous floaters [^115btUoM]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Symptomatic floaters are common. In a recent study with an average participant age of 30 years, 76% reported symptomatic floaters and 33% reported noticeable impairment in vision from floaters. Among patients aged 70–79 years, 35% have evidence of a complete posterior vitreous detachment on echography and this number approaches 50% among patients aged 80 years and older. Vitreous floaters account for approximately 7% of new patient referrals to retina specialists.

Floaters can cause considerable distress in certain patients. A utility analysis reported that patients were willing to trade away an average of 1.1 out of every 10 years of their remaining life to rid themselves of floaters, and were willing to take an 11% risk of death and a 7% risk of blindness to do so. Floaters can cause a reduction in contrast sensitivity and a demonstrable "floater scotoma" can be identified using spectral domain optical coherence tomography in some patients. Fortunately, most patients will accept observation as the symptoms are often temporary, opacities may gravitate out of the visual axis, and central opacities may move more anteriorly and out of focus. However, some patients may request definitive intervention despite surgical risks.

### The burden of flashes and floaters in traditional general emergency services and utilization of ophthalmology on-call consultation: a cross-sectional study [^11619Cz7]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Inclusion criteria for the study was any adult over the age of 18 presenting with a primary eye-complaint to a GES in the city of Hamilton in 2018, with triage symptoms containing F/F of any laterality. Exclusion criteria included any encounters where the patient left without being seen after triage, encounters where patients presented for the express purpose of imaging or medication administration as an extension of another encounter, follow-up visits arranged by emergency physicians, and inappropriately coded encounters that were not primarily eye-related.

Extracted fields included age, gender, site of presentation, date of admission, date of discharge, time of arrival, time of triage, time of discharge, Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale score (CTAS), CEDIS triage code, coded symptoms at triage, consultation to ophthalmology emergency services, recent (≤ 6 weeks) invasive ophthalmic intervention (surgery, injection, or laser procedure), acuity (acute ≤ 2 weeks, sub-acute > 2 and < 4 weeks, chronic ≥ 4 weeks), directed to GES by healthcare provider, and case costs for each encounter. Data collection was performed using standardized tables. Case costing data was provided by respective health care systems case costing departments and is presented in Canadian dollars ($) at 2018 values. Case costs were totals for each patient encounter including all staffing, material, medication, and investigation costs. Billing for the encounter by the emergency physician, which is to the province directly, was not included in this value.

The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients for which OESs were consulted. Consultation to OES was defined as a direct communication to the ophthalmology on-call service ("paging") for a patient to be seen within 24 h. GES encounters where the patient was directed to follow-up with their own ophthalmologist or optometrist, a non-urgent referral to an ophthalmologist was made, or where the patient was directed to obtain a referral to ophthalmology from another healthcare provider were not considered consultation of OESs. Additional outcome measures included factors related to consultation of OESs as determined by multivariable logistic regression.

### The burden of flashes and floaters in traditional general emergency services and utilization of ophthalmology on-call consultation: a cross-sectional study [^116pnNSH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Consultation rate to OES was calculated as the number of encounters of F/F referred to ophthalmology on-call divided by the total number of F/F encounters that presented to GESs. One-step method multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine variables predictive of consultation of OESs. Variables that were included in the model were determined based on clinical plausibility and symptoms previously identified to be associated with the presence of retinal tear/detachment including, age ≥ 45, ED vs. UCC site, acuity (chronic/sub-acute/acute), recent invasive ophthalmic intervention defined as laser, peri/intra-ocular injection, or surgery, directed to GES by healthcare provider, presence of subjectively decreased vision as a symptom, presence of visual field defect as a symptom, presence of neurologic symptoms, and presence of headache as a symptom. Odds ratio with the corresponding confidence intervals (CI) and p-values are reported. Statistical significance was considered for p values < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).

Ethics approval

Institutional review board approval was obtained from the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board. The research adhered to the tenants of the Declaration of Helsinki.

### On-call examinations for acute onset of flashes, floaters, or curtain by junior ophthalmology residents: outcomes, safety, and resource use [^111cU9EK]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether an on-call system serviced by junior residents can safely triage patients with symptoms concerning for posterior vitreous detachment, retinal tear, and retinal detachment.

Design

Quality improvement study structured as a prospective cohort study.

Participants

All symptomatic patients seen in 2017 by an on-call junior resident were followed up (257 patients). Those with follow-up within 6 months of initial presentation (228 patients, 246 unique encounters) were included.

Methods

We prospectively tracked all symptomatic patients seen on-call by a junior resident in 2017 at a major academic medical center.

Main Outcome Measures

Incidence and predictors of true retinal tears or detachments, false-positive tears or detachments, false-negative tears or detachments, and resource use.

Results

Of 246 symptomatic encounters, 83 (33.7%) had a perceived retinal tear or detachment. Residents used B-scan ultrasonography in a high number of encounters (41.0%). Ten (4.1%) false-positive tears or detachments were identified, with the presence of intraretinal hemmorhage predicting a false-positive examination (adjusted odds ratio, 3.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–13.5). Thirteen (5.3%) false-negative tears and no false-negative detachments were identified. Eleven (84.6%) false-negative tears underwent follow-up within days based on high-risk characteristics, and no false-negative tears progressed to detachment at follow-up. Measures of resource use included an in-person confirmation of examination findings by the senior resident or fellow in 59 encounters (24.0%) and shorter follow-up times to a retina rather than a nonretina clinic for 52 of 151 patients who showed no pathologic features on initial examination.

Conclusions

Junior residents can safely provide on-call triage of patients with symptoms concerning for a posterior vitreous detachment, retinal tear, or retinal detachment. The system requires moderate resource use, including occasional confirmatory examinations by a second physician and shorter follow-up times to retina clinic for high-risk patients.

Among other possible causes, eye floaters can be caused by macular degeneration, retinal hemorrhage, posterior uveitis, retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy, intraocular foreign body, ocular lymphoma, vitreous hemorrhage, posterior vitreous detachment, pars planitis, retinal tear, hypertensive retinopathy, retinal vein thrombosis, migraine with aura and retinitis. In addition, eye floaters can be caused by medications such as bromfenac, patisiran, aflibercept, entrectinib, pegcetacoplan, ranibizumab, tedizolid, gentamicin, avutometinib/defactinib, ganciclovir, revakinagene taroretcel, brimonidine and avacincaptad pegol.

Follow-up evaluation guidance states that the guidelines in Table 3 are recommendations for the timing of re-evaluation in the absence of additional symptoms. Patients with new symptoms or a change in symptoms may require more frequent evaluation, while patients with no positive findings at the initial examination should be seen at the intervals recommended in the Comprehensive Adult Medical Eye Evaluation PPP. All patients with risk factors should be advised to contact their ophthalmologist promptly if new symptoms such as flashes, floaters, peripheral visual field loss, or decreased visual acuity develop.

Brolucizumab intravitreal injection 6 mg — treatment recommendations and follow-up: Patients should be instructed to promptly report symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, including eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or decreased vision, increased sensitivity to light, or an increased number of floaters. Patients should return for examination approximately 4 weeks after treatment initially; subsequent follow-up and treatment depends on clinical findings and judgment of the treating ophthalmologist. The recommended dose is every 4 weeks (monthly) for the first 3 doses, followed by 6 mg every 8 to 12 weeks, but subsequent treatment depends on the clinical findings and judgment of the treating ophthalmologist. Monocular near vision (reading/Amsler grid) should be monitored.

Faricimab — treatment recommendations and follow-up: Patients should be instructed to promptly report symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, including eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or decreased vision, increased sensitivity to light, or an increased number of floaters. Patients should return for examination approximately 4 weeks after treatment initially; subsequent follow-up and treatment depends on clinical findings and judgment of the treating ophthalmologist. The recommended dose is every 4 weeks (monthly) for the first 4 doses, followed by administration every 4 to 16 weeks, but subsequent treatment depends on the clinical findings and judgment of the treating ophthalmologist. Monocular near vision (reading/Amsler grid) should be monitored.

Idiopathic epiretinal membrane (ERM) and vitreomacular traction (VMT) — patient education and follow-up include comparing OCT images in the abnormal versus normal eye to aid patient understanding; encouraging patients to periodically test their central vision monocularly to detect changes such as increasing metamorphopsia and/or development of a small central scotoma; informing patients to notify their ophthalmologist promptly if they have symptoms such as an increase of floaters, loss of visual field, metamorphopsia, or a decrease in visual acuity; and referring patients with functionally limiting postoperative visual impairment for vision rehabilitation and social services.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^115vZGp5]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Patient education and counseling — patients with diabetes should be encouraged to report ocular symptoms and to understand the need for timely follow-up and rehabilitation resources. The vast majority of persons with diabetes will develop diabetic retinopathy at some point, and individuals need to be aware that retinopathy may exist even when vision is good and asymptomatic. Patients should be encouraged to report all ocular symptoms (e.g., blurred vision, flashes, floaters), and doctors of optometry should help their patients understand that timely follow-up examinations and management are critical to reduce the risk of vision loss from diabetic retinopathy. Individuals should also be informed about their higher risk for other nonretinal ocular complications (such as cataracts and glaucoma) and about available optometric vision rehabilitation care. A patient-centered communication style that uses active listening, elicits patient preferences and beliefs, and assesses potential literacy barriers to care can be used to optimize patient health outcomes.
