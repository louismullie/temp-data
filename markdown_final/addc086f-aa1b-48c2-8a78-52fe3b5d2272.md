## Question

Which antibiotic is appropriate for suspected pneumonia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotic is appropriate for suspected community-acquired pneumonia across outpatient and inpatient settings, integrating severity, comorbidities, special populations, stewardship, and duration considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the pneumonia diagnosis and gauging severity and site of care. Then, I should verify comorbid conditions and risk factors for resistant pathogens. Next, I will review category-specific empiric regimens for outpatients and inpatients, including severe CAP. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like viral coinfection and aspiration, as well as pediatric cases. Finally, I should confirm duration, IV-to-PO switch criteria, de-escalation, and stewardship guardrails before summarizing the algorithmic approach.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions based on symptoms alone; pneumonia requires compatible clinical features plus radiographic evidence of an infiltrate, and I should double-check severity using validated criteria to determine outpatient versus inpatient management and ICU needs, since that will drive empiric choices and outcomes [^116N8vas] [^115TUqhk] [^111ukg7W].

> Hold on, I should verify site-of-care categories because regimen selection hinges on them: outpatient healthy adults without comorbidities, outpatient adults with comorbidities, inpatient non-severe CAP on the ward, and inpatient severe CAP meeting IDSA/ATS major or multiple minor criteria and often requiring ICU-level care; misclassification here can lead to undertreatment or overtreatment [^116LD2BE] [^115TUqhk].

> For outpatients without comorbidities, let me think this through carefully: macrolide monotherapy is reasonable only where local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is under 25%, and otherwise doxycycline is an appropriate alternative; I should double-check local antibiograms before committing to a macrolide, and I need to ensure stewardship by avoiding broader agents when narrower options suffice [^115Q2y7p] [^115ZzQTE].

> For outpatients with comorbidities, I should confirm that guideline-concordant options include a beta-lactam such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime plus a macrolide, or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone when combination therapy is impractical; if macrolides are contraindicated, a third-generation cephalosporin combined with doxycycline is a reasonable alternative, but I need to weigh adverse events and resistance risks with fluoroquinolones [^114NQhP1] [^111GDt9s].

> Next, I should review inpatient non-severe CAP regimens; combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone are both acceptable, and if macrolides and fluoroquinolones are both contraindicated, beta-lactam plus doxycycline is an evidence-based alternative; I should verify dosing and adjust for renal function and local resistance patterns [^116LD2BE] [^1113jsxi].

> I will now examine severe CAP therapy, and I need to ensure I do not miss the preferred combination; a beta-lactam plus a macrolide is favored over a beta-lactam plus a fluoroquinolone because of outcome benefits, supported by both ATS/IDSA and European guidance, although I should acknowledge that some comparative evidence is low certainty and nuanced; if macrolides are contraindicated, beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone is acceptable, but I should reconsider that choice if QT risk or local resistance profiles are problematic [^11724DLT] [^113FgFQ7] [^113FgFQ7].

> Wait, let me verify risk factors for MRSA and Pseudomonas because missing them alters empiric therapy substantially; prior respiratory isolation of these organisms, recent hospitalization and parenteral antibiotics, and severe structural lung disease should prompt adding anti-MRSA coverage and an antipseudomonal beta-lactam up front, with plans to de-escalate once cultures return; however, I need to avoid reflexively broadening therapy without risk factors to maintain stewardship [^116LD2BE] [^116NEoCU].

> But wait, what if the patient tests positive for influenza or another respiratory virus; I should confirm that if clinical and radiographic CAP are present, initial standard antibacterial therapy is still recommended with a plan to reassess and potentially discontinue antibiotics by 72 hours if bacterial infection is reasonably excluded and the patient is clinically stable; for adult outpatients without comorbidities and clear viral pneumonia, emerging guidance suggests avoiding empiric antibiotics, so I must align with local protocols and re-evaluate frequently to prevent unnecessary antibiotic use [^115dbbUh] [^116xUUHf] [^112S2QnK].

> Let me consider aspiration pneumonia thoughtfully and not over-treat; routine anaerobic coverage is not required unless there is clinical or radiographic concern for lung abscess or empyema, in which case adding reliable anaerobic coverage is appropriate; I should double-check imaging and clinical trajectory before expanding anaerobic therapy [^111TRU1E] [^111Vs8ak].

> I should confirm pediatric distinctions; for previously healthy, appropriately immunized children older than 3 months with suspected bacterial CAP managed as outpatients, high-dose amoxicillin is first line, whereas young infants 0–59 days with suspected severe bacterial pneumonia require hospitalization and parenteral therapy such as ampicillin plus gentamicin or cloxacillin plus gentamicin for at least 7 days, with pathogen-directed adjustments as data emerge [^115h6tNF] [^112ortQg] [^1156FfQ6].

> Next, I should review duration, IV-to-PO switch, and biomarker use; antibiotics should continue until clinical stability is achieved and for at least 5 days in adults, with 2025 guidance allowing 3–5 days in select non-severe inpatients who are stable and a minimum of 5 days in severe CAP, and I need to verify criteria for early IV-to-PO transition including hemodynamic stability, improving symptoms, ability to ingest, and a functioning GI tract; initial procalcitonin should not determine starting antibiotics in radiographically confirmed CAP, but PCT kinetics can support early discontinuation in ambiguous cases to reduce exposure [^115BfusZ] [^113DyKsv] [^111e2FjV] [^111CSoYK] [^115YVDN7] [^11585mQF] [^114qL2BK].

> Hold on, I should verify stewardship and implementation details; choose the narrowest effective agent consistent with guidelines, avoid unnecessary atypical coverage and fluoroquinolones when safer options suffice, start timely appropriate therapy without rigid time targets, de-escalate based on cultures and clinical response, and align with local antibiograms; guideline-concordant selection correlates with improved outcomes and statewide initiatives demonstrate that shorter, appropriate durations reduce harm without compromising efficacy [^115ZzQTE] [^114SsUpg] [^115Cm7Gd] [^111rJW34].

> In summary, I need to ensure the regimen matches the clinical context: in outpatients without comorbidities use a macrolide only if local resistance permits or choose doxycycline; in outpatients with comorbidities use a beta-lactam plus macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone, with beta-lactam plus doxycycline as an alternative when macrolides are not feasible; in inpatient non-severe CAP use beta-lactam plus macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone, reserving beta-lactam plus doxycycline if macrolides and fluoroquinolones are contraindicated; in severe CAP prefer beta-lactam plus macrolide, adding MRSA or antipseudomonal coverage only when risk factors are present, and then de-escalate as data clarify the pathogen and course [^115Q2y7p] [^114NQhP1] [^116LD2BE] [^1113jsxi] [^11724DLT] [^113FgFQ7].

---

Empiric antibiotic selection for suspected pneumonia depends on **setting and comorbidities** and **local resistance** [^111qE7Fs]. Outpatients without comorbidities should receive **amoxicillin or doxycycline** [^111GDt9s]; with comorbidities, use **amoxicillin/clavulanate plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone** [^114NQhP1]. Inpatients with non-severe CAP should get a β-lactam plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone [^116LD2BE]; severe CAP requires a β-lactam plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone, with MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage if risk factors exist [^11724DLT] [^116LD2BE]. Start **antibiotics within 4–8 hours** of presentation [^116oDx2e], tailor to local resistance [^114SsUpg], and adjust based on cultures and clinical response [^112h3oUt].

---

## Outpatient antibiotic recommendations

### Outpatients without comorbidities

Outpatients without comorbidities should receive **amoxicillin 1 g PO TID** [^111GDt9s] or **doxycycline 100 mg PO BID** as first-line therapy. A **macrolide** (azithromycin 500 mg PO day 1, then 250 mg daily) is an alternative only when local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is **< 25%** [^115Q2y7p].

---

### Outpatients with comorbidities

Outpatients with comorbidities should receive **combination therapy** [^114NQhP1] — either **amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID** or **cefuroxime 500 mg PO BID** — plus a **macrolide** (azithromycin 500 mg PO day 1, then 250 mg daily) [^111GDt9s]. Alternatively, monotherapy with a **respiratory fluoroquinolone** [^114NQhP1] (levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily) is acceptable [^111GDt9s].

---

## Inpatient antibiotic recommendations

### Non-severe CAP (no ICU admission)

For non-severe CAP [^116LD2BE], use a **β-lactam** (ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV daily or ampicillin/sulbactam 1.5–3 g IV q6h) plus a **macrolide** (azithromycin 500 mg IV/PO daily). Alternatively, monotherapy with a **respiratory fluoroquinolone** [^116oDx2e] (levofloxacin 750 mg IV/PO daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV/PO daily) may be used [^116LD2BE].

---

### Severe CAP (ICU admission or severe criteria met)

In severe CAP [^11724DLT], use a **β-lactam** (ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV daily or cefotaxime 1–2 g IV q8h) plus a **macrolide** (azithromycin 500 mg IV/PO daily) [^113FgFQ7]. Alternatively, use a **β-lactam** plus a **respiratory fluoroquinolone** (levofloxacin 750 mg IV/PO daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV/PO daily) [^11724DLT].

---

## Special considerations

### MRSA or Pseudomonas risk factors

With MRSA risk factors, **add vancomycin or linezolid** [^116LD2BE]; with Pseudomonas risk factors, use **piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, or meropenem plus levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin**.

---

### Aspiration pneumonia

Add **anaerobic coverage** [^111Vs8ak] with metronidazole or clindamycin if lung abscess or empyema is suspected [^111TRU1E].

---

## Timing and adjustment of antibiotic therapy

Start **antibiotics within 4–8 hours** of presentation to reduce mortality [^116oDx2e] [^112fpin1]. Modify therapy based on **culture results, clinical response, and local resistance patterns** [^114SsUpg] [^112h3oUt].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

Treat for a **minimum of 5 days** [^115BfusZ], ensuring clinical stability for 48–72 hours before discontinuation. For severe CAP, extend therapy to **7–10 days**, especially if MRSA or Pseudomonas is present.

---

Empiric antibiotic selection for suspected pneumonia should be guided by **patient setting, comorbidities, and local resistance patterns** [^116LD2BE]. Early initiation and timely adjustment based on clinical response and microbiological data are essential for optimal outcomes [^115Cm7Gd].

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment [^112h3oUt]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Re-evaluation of the initial diagnosis of pneumonia is crucial. Assuming local guidelines are followed, inappropriate antibiotic therapy is seldom the cause of clinical failure in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, it is more common in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as these are associated with a higher risk of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, particularly in settings with high baseline MDR rates. The ATS/IDSA guidelines addressing both CAP and HAP/VAP have identified risk factors for MDR organisms (see Fig. 2).

Communication between the microbiology lab, pharmacists, and clinicians is important to promptly identify patients with inappropriate antibiotic treatment. In addition to choosing empiric antibiotic therapy, it is crucial to re-evaluate its adequacy. Drug dose should be reassessed because critically ill patients experience marked pharmacokinetic changes in both the volume of distribution and drug clearance rates compared to less sick patients. Also, antibiotic administration, namely intermittent dosing versus continuous perfusion in time-dependent drugs, and antibiotic lung penetration should be checked. A thorough history of the present illness can raise the possibility of uncommon bacterial and fungal causes of severe pneumonia that may not respond to some empiric antibiotic regimens.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there is greater recognition of viral causes of severe pneumonia not responsive to empiric pneumonia therapy, including influenza (with or without bacterial co-infection), RSV, and finally HSV and CMV reactivation, which have uncertain clinical impact.

Septic complications could also be the result of concomitant issues.

Concerning medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, specifically in terms of empiric antibiotic therapy in an inpatient setting for non-severe CAP, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend the following:

- **Combination therapy with a β-lactam**: Options include ampicillin/sulbactam (1.5–3 g every 6 hours), cefotaxime (1–2 g every 8 hours), ceftriaxone (1–2 g daily), or ceftaroline (600 mg every 12 hours).

- **A macrolide**: Azithromycin (500 mg daily) or clarithromycin (500 mg BID).

- **Monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone**: Levofloxacin (750 mg daily) or moxifloxacin (400 mg daily).

These recommendations are for adult inpatients with non-severe CAP who have no risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa.

### Antibiotic therapy for adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: A systematic review [^116oDx2e]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of medical management for community-acquired pneumonia. This review aims to assess the associations between three key aspects of antibiotic therapy — optimal time to antibiotic initiation, initial antibiotic selection, and criteria for the transition from intravenous to oral therapy — and short-term mortality in adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.

Bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Collaboration, were searched for studies published between January 1, 1995, and November 5, 2015, involving adults hospitalized with radiographically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia.

Twenty studies, consisting of seventeen observational studies and three randomized trials, met the eligibility criteria. Among the eight observational studies identified, the four largest (with study populations ranging from 2,878 to 1,170,022) found that initiating antibiotics within 4 to 8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with relative mortality reductions of 5% to 43%. In contrast, the four smaller studies (with study populations of 451 to 2,076) found no associations between the timing of antibiotic initiation and mortality.

One cluster randomized trial (n = 1,737) demonstrated noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy (n = 506) compared to β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy (n = 566), with an absolute adjusted difference of 2.5% [90% CI, -0.6% to 5.2%] in 90-day mortality favoring β-lactam monotherapy. A second randomized trial (n = 580) did not demonstrate the noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy compared to β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy, with an absolute difference of 7.6%.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, specifically related to empiric antibiotic therapy in the outpatient setting for patients with comorbidities, the 2019 ATS/IDSA guidelines recommend the administration of combination therapy. This therapy includes a β-lactam (such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg PO on the first day and 250 mg PO daily thereafter, clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg PO once daily). Alternatively, monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg PO daily) is recommended for outpatients with CAP with comorbidities. These comorbidities include chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, malignancy, or asplenia.

### Comparison of initial empirical antibiotic regimens in severe community-acquired pneumonia: A network meta-analysis [^112SDUK2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) is the most life-threatening form of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and often necessitates intensive care unit (ICU) admission due to invasive mechanical ventilation or septic shock requiring vasopressors. The overall mortality rate for SCAP exceeds 20% and it is a leading cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Studies indicate that early administration of antibiotics can reduce hospital mortality and ICU admission rates, so an appropriate initial antibiotic regimen is important for patients with SCAP.

The most frequently identified pathogens causing SCAP are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacteria, viruses, and atypical pathogens. Understanding these pathogens is critical, as it informs the selection of appropriate initial empirical antibiotic regimens, which are essential for reducing mortality and ICU admissions in SCAP patients.

- **Guideline recommendations**: The Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Thoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) and the latest European community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines recommend β-lactam antibiotics plus macrolides for patients with SCAP. The combination of β-lactam antibiotics and respiratory fluoroquinolones, however, remains controversial and lacks definitive evidence to support its superiority.

- **Recent studies**: Recent retrospective cohort studies have suggested that β-lactam antibiotics plus macrolides, fluoroquinolones monotherapy, and β-lactam antibiotics plus doxycycline may yield similar outcomes.

### Nonresponses and treatment failures with conventional empiric regimens in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^111YxkTE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Although most patients with suspected CAP respond to empiric therapy, a small number of patients do not respond in the expected fashion. Age and underlying comorbid conditions have a strong influence on the course of illness. Less common causes of treatment failures include overwhelming infection, antimicrobial resistance, and misdiagnosis. It is a common practice for empiric antimicrobial treatment of CAP to be initiated without microbiologic studies. Clinicians should carefully observe these patients for unusual or slow responses and should be ready to pursue a more extensive search for the cause of treatment failure.

### Community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization: Rational decision making and interpretation of guidelines [^1143zzhv]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This review focuses on the evidence base for guideline recommendations on the diagnosis, the optimal choice, timing, and duration of empirical antibiotic therapy, and the use of microbiological tests for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). These issues are frequently referenced in guidelines. Furthermore, possibilities for future research in these topics will be discussed.

Many national and international guideline recommendations, even on critical elements of CAP management, are based on low-to-moderate quality evidence.

The diagnosis and management of CAP have hardly changed for decades. The recommendation to cover atypical pathogens in all hospitalized CAP patients is based on observational studies only and is challenged by two recent trials. In the following years, improved diagnostic testing — radiologically by low-dose computed tomography or ultrasound, and microbiologically by point-of-care multiplex PCR — has the potential to greatly influence the choice and initiation of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized CAP patients. Rapid microbiological testing will hopefully improve antibiotic de-escalation or early pathogen-directed therapy, both potent ways of reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Guideline recommendations on the timing and duration of antibiotic therapy are based on limited evidence, but these aspects will be hard to improve.

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^117D5zA2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia, based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the guideline recommendations.

- **Recent findings**: Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

- **Summary**: The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations, as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines, both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: There is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^114NCFtS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: There is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

To the editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable.

### The management of community-acquired pneumonia in infants and children older than 3 months of age: Clinical practice guidelines by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114Piv6X]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

Regarding the specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, particularly with respect to pediatric patients and their discharge from the hospital, the IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines recommend that discharge of improving patients should not be precluded. This applies to those receiving appropriate oral or IV antimicrobial therapy and meeting discharge criteria, even in cases where positive blood culture identification or susceptibility results are pending. It is important to consider discharging patients if close follow-up is assured.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia in general medical wards: Outcomes and impact of initial antibiotic selection [^114t41w2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Most international guidelines recommend that empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) be based on the site of care. Some patients with severe CAP are managed in general wards due to limited intensive care unit (ICU) beds or because of unrecognized pneumonia severity. Appropriate initial antibiotic treatment for severe CAP outside the ICU has not yet been established. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and impact of initial antibiotic selection on the outcomes of patients with severe CAP who were admitted and managed in general wards.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational study included consecutive patients hospitalized for presumed CAP in general wards over a one-year period. Severe CAP was identified using the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Initial antibiotic treatment in the first 24 hours was collected. The primary outcome was the rate of unfavorable outcomes, including treatment failure and in-hospital death. The secondary outcome was the number of hospital-free days, assessed 30 days after enrollment in the study.

- **Results**: Ninety-four patients were hospitalized with CAP, of which 50 (53.2%) were compatible with severe CAP. An etiologic diagnosis was found in 43 (45.8%) patients. The most common pathogens identified in patients with severe CAP were Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.9%). Patients with severe CAP had significantly more positive blood cultures than patients with non-severe CAP.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1113jsxi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, and more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy in an inpatient setting for non-severe CAP, ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend considering combination therapy. This therapy involves a β-lactam (such as ampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ceftaroline, or ceftriaxone) and doxycycline 100 mg BID as an alternative option for adult patients with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown.

Treatment of CAP has evolved due to changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. Additionally, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: What is relevant and what is not [^116LA8Eg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in North America. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria, and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for community-acquired pneumonia management.

- **Recent findings**: All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, and other atypical organisms. Clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* and Gram-negative pathogens.

- **Summary**: The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of community-acquired pneumonia prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the article titled "Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia: An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America". We congratulate the authors on their comprehensive review of the evidence. Although we understand that they are limited in their ability to establish recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system process, we believe it would be helpful for the practicing clinician to understand how to interpret the guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship (AS) lens. Below, we discuss three AS-guided recommendations that should be considered when interpreting the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines.

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia [^111TaSjW]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that is potentially life-threatening, especially in older adults and patients with comorbid conditions. Despite substantial progress in therapeutic options, CAP remains a primary cause of death from infectious disease in the United States. The mainstay of treatment for most patients is appropriate antimicrobial therapy. This article reviews the principles for initial antimicrobial therapy, highlights some differences in approaches to antimicrobial drug selection in selected guidelines, and includes new recommendations for empiric and pathogen-directed therapy of CAP.

### Empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^117SmUh4]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

To compare specific antibiotic regimens, and monotherapy vs. combination therapy, for the empirical treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a meta-analysis was conducted.

- **Data source**: Medline, Embase, Cochrane register of controlled trials, study authors, and review articles.
- **Study selection**: Randomized controlled trials evaluating empirical parenteral antibiotic regimens for adult patients with clinically suspected VAP were included.
- **Data selection**: Two independent review groups searched the literature, extracted data, and assessed trial quality. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, while secondary outcomes included treatment failure. Relative risks were pooled using a random effects model.

Forty-one trials were identified, randomizing 7,015 patients and comparing 29 unique regimens. The methodological quality was low, as evidenced by low rates of complete follow-up (43.9%), use of a double-blinded interventional strategy (14.6%), and randomization concealment (48.6%). Overall mortality was 20.3%, and treatment failure occurred in 37.4% of patients who could be evaluated microbiologically. No mortality differences were observed between any of the regimens compared. Only one of three pooled comparisons showed a significant difference for treatment failure: the combination of ceftazidime/aminoglycoside was inferior to meropenem (two trials, relative risk 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.53–0.93). Rates of mortality and treatment failure for monotherapy compared with combination therapy were similar (11 trials, relative risk for mortality of monotherapy 0.94).

### Guideline-concordant antibiotic therapy for the hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and 1-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in older adult patients surviving to discharge [^115Cm7Gd]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Selection of empiric antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that is concordant with clinical practice guidelines has been associated with improved short-term outcomes of this infection, but whether it is also associated with longer-term outcomes is unknown.

- **Research question**: Is guideline-concordance of the initial antibiotic treatment given to older adult patients hospitalized with CAP associated with the 1-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk of those patients who survive hospitalization for this infection?

- **Study design and methods**: A total of 1,909 older (> 65 years of age) patients were identified who survived hospitalization for CAP at The Ottawa Hospital (Ontario, Canada) between 2004 and 2015. By linking patients' information to hospital and provincial data sets, this study analyzed whether the selection of the initial antibiotic therapy for their CAP was concordant with clinical practice guidelines, and whether guideline-concordance was associated with 1-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality following their index CAP hospitalization. Adjustments were made for the patients' overall 1-year expected death risk; CAP severity; and history of previous pneumonia admissions, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or cerebrovascular disease.

- **Results**: Selection of guideline-concordant antibiotic therapy was associated with a trend towards lower all-cause mortality at 1 year post-CAP (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.65–1.04; p = 0.099). Furthermore, the use of guideline-concordant antibiotic therapy was associated with a decreased cardiovascular mortality risk among older adults surviving to discharge.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^111qgUpP]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and resource expenditure. When followed, guidelines for CAP management have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes; however, several issues remain unresolved. This review summarizes recent advances in this field and identifies priority needs for future research.

- **Recent findings**: Recently identified clinical and biochemical tools promise to improve the assessment of CAP severity; however, defining the most accurate and feasible rule(s) for clinical practice is necessary. Some empirical antimicrobial regimens are still being debated, such as the need for atypical pathogen coverage in home-treated and non-severe hospitalized patients and the inclusion of respiratory fluoroquinolones among first-choice molecules. New drugs such as tigecycline and cethromycin appear promising. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate is highly effective, even for treating CAP caused by multi-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other aspects recently clarified include the inappropriateness of rigid time-to-first-antibiotic-dose rules, the advantages of shorter antibiotic treatments for non-severe patients, and the need for special clinical attention for acute myocardial infarction among patients with severe CAP or clinical failure.

- **Summary**: Recent developments have significantly contributed to refining the management of CAP patients. However, several hot topics remain undefined and urgently require ad-hoc research to optimize outcomes and costs.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: A consensus statement regarding initial strategies [^117F8r49]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines have improved the treatment and outcomes of patients with CAP, primarily through the standardization of initial empirical therapy. However, society-published guidelines exclude immunocompromised patients.

- **Research question**: There is no consensus regarding the initial treatment of immunocompromised patients with suspected CAP.

- **Study design and methods**: This consensus document was created by a multidisciplinary panel of 45 physicians with experience in the treatment of CAP in immunocompromised patients. The Delphi survey methodology was used to reach a consensus.

- **Results**: The panel focused on 21 questions addressing initial management strategies. They achieved consensus in defining the population, site of care, likely pathogens, microbiologic workup, general principles of empirical therapy, and empirical therapy for specific pathogens.

- **Interpretation**: This document offers general suggestions for the initial treatment of the immunocompromised patient who arrives at the hospital with pneumonia.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^116xUUHf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The guidelines recommend antibiotics for both inpatients and outpatients with clinical and radiographic evidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who test positive for influenza, with a consideration to stop antibiotics within 72 hours if no bacterial pathogen is found and the patient achieves early clinical stability. This recommendation is likely to lead to increases in unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for patients with influenza.

In the outpatient setting, sputum cultures and chest X-rays are not routinely obtained; hence, providers may not know when to stop antibiotics. Additionally, the rate of bacterial complications of influenza is low (∼ < 2.5%). Antibiotics may not be necessary for most outpatients with influenza or those who are hospitalized but are not severely ill.

Guidelines regarding the use of antibiotics must balance treatment recommendations with antibiotic stewardship (AS) considerations and specifically note when regimens are supported by clinical trials but may be suboptimal because of side effects or costs. Many providers regard the guidelines as strict recommendations rather than as a starting point for clinical decision-making. Thus, discussions about areas in which the available evidence is inconclusive should include the viewpoint of antibiotic stewards at the patient and population levels.

We strongly encourage active engagement from AS on future guidelines to facilitate discussions about judicious prescribing of antibiotics and to inform practical interpretation and implementation of those guidelines.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia in general medical wards: Outcomes and impact of initial antibiotic selection [^113pECdX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of hospitalization and death worldwide. Severe CAP comprises patients who have a severe disease, with poor outcomes requiring a higher level of care. Several criteria have been proposed to define severe CAP, with most reports defining it simply as CAP that necessitates intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

Initial treatment of CAP is usually empirical because the microbial etiology cannot be predicted based on clinical presentation. Most international guidelines recommend empirical therapy based on the location of care, with specific recommendations for those managed as outpatients, inpatients, and in ICUs. Adherence to initial antibiotic selection guidelines has been reported to be associated with improved survival and reduced duration of mechanical ventilation for patients with severe CAP in the ICU.

ICU admission policies and the availability of ICU beds vary widely across the world. The shortage of ICU beds is a daily problem in many hospitals, especially in under-resourced countries. Moreover, there is a category of severe CAP classified by the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) minor criteria that may be under-recognized due to patients initially presenting with subtle findings. As many as 45% of patients with CAP who ultimately required ICU admission were initially admitted to a non-ICU setting, resulting in a substantial number of patients with severe CAP being managed mainly in general wards due to limited resources.

### Managing community-acquired pneumonia: a European perspective [^112DfDgG]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disease and a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It places an enormous burden on medical and economic resources, particularly if hospitalization is required. Initial antibacterial therapy for CAP is usually empirical, as culture and antibacterial sensitivity test results are rarely available at initial diagnosis. Any agent selected for empirical therapy should have good activity against the pathogens commonly associated with CAP, a favorable tolerability profile, and be administered in a simple dosage regimen for good compliance.

Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common causative pathogen, although the incidence of this organism varies widely. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin have become increasingly prevalent over the past 30 years and are now a serious problem worldwide. Additionally, an increase in the prevalence of pneumococci resistant to macrolides has been observed in Europe over recent years.

- **Atypical pathogens**: Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae are among the most common atypical pathogens isolated from patients with CAP. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis are less commonly identified as causative organisms.

The emergence and spread of resistance to commonly used antibiotics have challenged the management of CAP. Multiple sets of CAP guidelines have been published to address the continued changes in this complex disease.

### Procalcitonin guidance of antibiotic therapy in community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized trial [^11585mQF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia, guidelines recommend antibiotic treatment for 7 to 21 days. Procalcitonin is elevated in bacterial infections, and its dynamics have prognostic implications. This study aims to assess procalcitonin guidance for the initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy in community-acquired pneumonia.

In a randomized intervention trial, 302 consecutive patients with suspected community-acquired pneumonia were included. Data were assessed at baseline, after 4, 6, and 8 days, and after 6 weeks. The control group (n = 151) received antibiotics according to usual practice. In the procalcitonin group (n = 151), antibiotic treatment was based on serum procalcitonin concentrations as follows: strongly discouraged, less than 0.1 microg/L; discouraged, less than 0.25 microg/L; encouraged, greater than 0.25 microg/L; strongly encouraged, greater than 0.5 microg/L. The primary endpoint was antibiotic use, and secondary endpoints were measures of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic outcomes.

At baseline, both groups were similar regarding clinical, laboratory, and microbiology characteristics, and Pneumonia Severity Index. Procalcitonin guidance reduced total antibiotic exposure (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.55; p < 0.001), antibiotic prescriptions on admission (85% vs. 99%; p < 0.001), and antibiotic treatment duration (median, 5 vs. 12 days; p < 0.001) compared with patients treated according to guidelines. After adjustment for Pneumonia Severity Index, the hazard ratio of antibiotic discontinuation was higher.

### Procalcitonin is useful for evaluating patients with ambiguous presentation and for early discontinuation of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia [^114qL2BK]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

To the Editor:

The updated American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) conclude that procalcitonin (PCT) is not recommended to determine the need for initial antibacterial therapy in patients with clinically suspected and radiographically confirmed CAP. It seems rational that in a patient with a high pretest probability for pneumonia, any biomarker (including PCT) that is not 100% accurate should not have a strong influence on treatment decisions.

The advantage of using PCT for the management of patients with CAP, however, has been demonstrated for patients in whom a CAP diagnosis is unclear (e.g. patients with no infiltrate on chest X-ray) and for monitoring patients with CAP to decide whether to stop treatment early. Most trials that evaluated PCT for the management of CAP did not rely on the initial PCT level and instead focused on the kinetics of this blood marker to indicate that antibiotic treatment should be stopped early. The initial PCT level was found to be helpful in patients with a bronchitis-like illness and possible CAP but an ambiguous clinical presentation.

A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data that focused specifically on patients with respiratory infection and CAP who had participated in randomized trials showed that PCT is highly effective in reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment. Specifically, the analysis included 6,708 patients from 26 eligible trials in 12 countries and found a 2.4-day reduction in antibiotic exposure.

### Managing CAP patients at risk of clinical failure [^115LsUQR]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a curable disease. Both the European and American clinical practice guidelines provide algorithms on how to manage patients with CAP. However, as populations worldwide age and bacteria become multidrug-resistant, it is necessary to address the major factors that put patients at risk of poor outcomes. These may include age, comorbidities, the settings where pneumonia was acquired or treated, the need for hospitalization or ICU admission, the likely causative pathogen (bacteria or virus) in a certain region, and their local susceptibility pattern.

One complicating factor is the lack of a definite causative pathogen in approximately 50% of patients, making it difficult to choose the most appropriate antibiotic treatment. When risk factors are present simultaneously in patients, fewer treatment options can be challenging for physicians. For example, the presence of comorbidities (renal, cardiac, hepatic) may exclude certain antibiotics due to potential adverse events. Assessing the severity of the disease and monitoring biomarkers can help physicians estimate patient prognosis once diagnosis is confirmed and treatment has been initiated.

This review article addresses the most important risk factors for poor outcomes in CAP patients.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^111qE7Fs]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia causes significant mortality, morbidity, and high costs worldwide. The empirical selection of antibiotic treatment is the cornerstone of managing patients with pneumonia. To reduce the misuse of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, and side effects, an empirical, effective, and individualized antibiotic treatment is essential. Follow-up after the initiation of antibiotic treatment is also crucial. Management should include early shifts to oral antibiotics, stewardship according to microbiological results, and short-duration antibiotic treatments that consider clinical stability criteria. New approaches for fast clinical (lung ultrasound) and microbiological (molecular biology) diagnoses are promising.

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with early and late mortality and increased rates of cardiovascular events. Studies are needed that focus on the long-term management of pneumonia.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy in the outpatient setting for patients without comorbidities, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend administering a macrolide. Options include azithromycin, with a dosage of 500 mg PO on the first day followed by 250 mg daily thereafter; clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID; or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg PO daily, especially in areas where pneumococcal resistance to macrolides is less than 25%.

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^116DFxue]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge, despite the availability of treatment guidelines. Key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, particularly in the outpatient setting. The North American approach employs initial antimicrobial therapy that provides coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae plus atypical pathogens. In contrast, European guidelines emphasize pneumococcal coverage, with less focus on atypical pathogen coverage.

Ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy in North America. However, in Europe, these patients would probably receive a beta-lactam agent. Major issues contributing to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these approaches offers clinical superiority.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in an ambulatory setting [^113aEzsS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and advances in critical care. Frequently, the diagnosis is confounded by coexisting cardiac or pulmonary conditions. Recognition of patients at risk for complications from pneumonia is critical when making the decision of how and where to treat. This review summarizes the diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia with oral antibiotics in an outpatient setting. Specific pathogens and clinical presentations in certain at-risk populations are highlighted. Also presented are validated algorithms for evaluating and identifying patients who may be at risk for serious complications of pneumonia and require treatment in an inpatient setting.

### Validation of the infectious disease society of America/American thoracic society 2007 guidelines for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^111FBSzd]. Critical Care Medicine (2009).

The study aimed to validate the Infectious Disease Society of America/American Thoracic Society 2007 (IDSA/ATS 2007) criteria for predicting severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) and to evaluate a health-services definition for SCAP.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: LDS Hospital, an academic tertiary care facility in the western United States.

- **Patients**: Consecutive patients with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, codes, and chest radiographs consistent with community-acquired pneumonia from 1996 to 2006 seen at LDS Hospital.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: The electronic medical record was utilized to examine intensive care unit admission, intensive therapies received, predictors of severity, and 30-day mortality. Logistic regression models of mortality and disease severity were developed. The IDSA/ATS 2007 criteria as well as three other pneumonia severity scores were calculated. SCAP was defined as the receipt of intensive therapy in the intensive care unit. Among 2413 episodes of pneumonia, 1540 were admitted to the hospital and 379 to the intensive care unit. Overall, 30-day mortality was 3.7%, increasing to 16% among intensive care patients. The IDSA/ATS 2007 minor criteria predicted SCAP with an area under the curve of 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.85–0.90), which improved to 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.88–0.92) with weighting. Competing models had an area under the curve of 0.76 to 0.83. Using four rather than three minor criteria improved the positive predictive value from 54% to 81%.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia in general medical wards: Outcomes and impact of initial antibiotic selection [^112DLpKn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Most international guidelines recommend that empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) should be based on the site of care. Some patients with severe CAP are managed in general wards due to limited intensive care unit (ICU) bed availability or unrecognized pneumonia severity. Appropriate initial antibiotic treatment for severe CAP outside the ICU has not yet been established. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and impact of initial antibiotic selection on the outcomes of patients with severe CAP who were admitted and managed in general wards.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational study included consecutive patients hospitalized for presumed CAP in general wards over a 1-year period. Severe CAP was identified using the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Initial antibiotic treatment in the first 24 hours was collected. The primary outcome was the rate of unfavorable outcome (a composite outcome of treatment failure and in-hospital death). The secondary outcome was the number of hospital-free days assessed 30 days after enrollment into the study.

- **Results**: There were 94 patients hospitalized with CAP, of which 50 (53.2%) patients were compatible with severe CAP. An etiologic diagnosis was found in 43 (45.8%) patients. The most common pathogens identified in patients with severe CAP were Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.9%). Patients with severe CAP had significantly more positive blood cultures than patients with non-severe CAP.

### Comparison of initial empirical antibiotic regimens in severe community-acquired pneumonia: A network meta-analysis [^114pR1bB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to combine both direct and indirect evidence to compare initial antibiotic options for patients with SCAP. Our analysis provides important insights to guide clinical decision-making regarding antibiotic choice for these patients.

From our analysis, we derived several key findings. β-lactam plus macrolide emerged as the best choice for patients with SCAP, in alignment with international guidelines. Fluoroquinolone monotherapy can be considered a reasonable alternative when β-lactam plus macrolide is not appropriate. However, β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone should be avoided.

Early antibiotic therapy has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with SCAP. Although atypical microorganisms are responsible for 8–20% of SCAP cases, their role in the disease process is significant. Therefore, empiric antibiotic treatment targeting atypical pathogens is associated with a reduction in clinical failure rates among hospitalized adults with CAP.

In addition to their antibacterial effects, macrolides possess broad anti-inflammatory properties. When combined with β-lactams, macrolides improve early clinical responses, reduce inflammation, enhance gas exchange, alleviate sepsis and organ failure, and lower mortality risk. Consistent with the result of a previous study, we recommend β-lactam plus macrolide as the preferred empirical antibiotic therapy for hospitalized patients with SCAP.

### Empiric treatment in hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia. Impact on mortality, length of stay and re-admission [^114GLxZQ]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate adherence to guidelines when choosing an empirical treatment and its impact upon the prognosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

- **Methods**: A prospective multicentre study was conducted with 425 CAP patients hospitalized on the ward. Initial empirical treatment was classified as either adhering or not adhering to Spanish guidelines. Adherent treatment was defined as an initial antimicrobial regimen consisting of beta-lactams plus macrolides, beta-lactam monotherapy, and quinolones. Non-adherent treatments included macrolide monotherapy and other regimens. Initial severity was graded according to the pneumonia severity index (PSI). The end point variables were mortality, length of stay (LOS), and re-admission at 30 days.

- **Results**: Overall 30-day mortality was 8.2%, the mean LOS was 8 ± 5 days, and the global re-admission rate was 7.6%. Adherence to guidelines was 76.5%, and in most cases, the empirical treatment consisted of a combination of beta-lactam and macrolide (57.4%). Logistic regression analysis showed that other regimens were associated with higher mortality (OR = 3 [1.2–7.3]), after adjusting for PSI and admitting hospital. Beta-lactam monotherapy was an independent risk factor for re-admission. LOS was independently associated with the admitting hospital and not with antibiotics.

- **Conclusions**: A high adherence to CAP treatment guidelines was found, though with considerable variability in the empirical antibiotic treatments among hospitals. Non-adherent other regimens were associated with greater mortality. Beta-lactam monotherapy was associated with increased re-admission.

### A statewide collaborative quality initiative to improve antibiotic duration and outcomes in patients hospitalized with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia [^111rJW34]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Optimal antibiotic use is vital for effectively treating infections and protecting patients from antibiotic-associated adverse events, Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), and multidrug-resistant organisms. Pneumonia is the most common indication for inpatient antibiotic therapy and a major contributor to antibiotic overuse. Despite guidelines recommending a shorter antibiotic course, the majority of hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) receive an excessive duration of therapy.

Several studies have demonstrated that antibiotic stewardship interventions can decrease excessive-duration antibiotic therapy for CAP, but data from large multihospital collaboratives are lacking. In 2017, the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium (HMS), a statewide collaborative quality initiative (CQI), began collecting data, sharing best practices, and benchmarking performance related to antibiotic duration for uncomplicated CAP. The resulting antibiotic use and patient outcomes from the first three years are described here.

### Multiplex real-time PCR in non-invasive respiratory samples to reduce antibiotic use in community-acquired pneumonia: a randomised trial [^111nfvn8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

- **Antibiotic therapy, follow-up, and outcomes assessment**: Initial empirical antibiotic therapy was administered in the emergency department in accordance with the guidelines of participating hospitals, which recommend the administration of a β-lactam agent with or without a macrolide or fluoroquinolone. Initial empirical combination antimicrobial therapy was recommended for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and/or those without any positive microbiological test. Levofloxacin monotherapy was indicated for Legionella pneumonia and for selected patients, such as those with a β-lactam allergy. Carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, and cefepime were considered broad-spectrum antibiotics. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics were generally considered appropriate when penicillin or ceftriaxone was used. All decisions regarding empirical and definitive antibiotic therapy, de-escalation, switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy, and duration of treatment were made by the attending clinicians. The investigators were not involved in any decisions regarding antibiotic treatment.

	- All participants were seen daily during their hospital stay by their attending physicians and by at least one of the study investigators. The investigators recorded all outcome measures. Days of therapy (DOTs) were calculated as the days elapsed from the initial dose of antimicrobial until the last dose of antimicrobial therapy for the CAP episode. The DOT for a given patient on multiple antibiotics was the sum of the DOT for each antibiotic that the patient received. All antibiotics administered to patients for an episode of CAP and its related complications were accounted for in this calculation.

### Infectious diseases society of America/American thoracic society consensus guidelines on the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^115TUqhk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "2007 IDSA/ATS criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia" is a tool designed to identify and stratify patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia manifestations. This tool aids in decision-making for hospitalization and intensive care unit admission, thereby optimizing patient management and resource allocation.

The criteria consist of two categories: minor and major.

- **Minor criteria**: Respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute, arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio less than 250, multilobar infiltrates, confusion or disorientation, uremia (blood urea nitrogen greater than 20 mg/dL), leukopenia (white blood cell count less than 4,000/mL due to infection alone), thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 100,000/mL), hypothermia (core temperature less than 36.8 degrees C), and hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation.

- **Major criteria**: Septic shock requiring vasopressors and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.

The severity of community-acquired pneumonia is determined by the cumulative score of these criteria. A patient is considered to have severe community-acquired pneumonia if the score is 3 or more. If the score is less than 3, the criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia are not met. This scoring system allows for standardized assessment.

### Community-acquired pneumonia guideline recommendations-impact of a consensus-based process versus systematic reviews [^112t2huR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Community-acquired Pneumonia (CAP) guidelines were developed using systematic reviews to inform every recommendation, as suggested by the Institute of Medicine Standards for Trustworthy Guidelines. Recent studies suggest that an expert consensus-based approach, called the Convergence of Opinion on Recommendations and Evidence (CORE) process, can produce recommendations that are concordant with recommendations informed by systematic reviews.

- **Purpose**: The goal of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the CORE process had it been used to develop the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines.

- **Methods**: Experts in CAP who were not on the guideline panel and had no knowledge of the guideline's systematic reviews or recommendations were recruited to participate in the CORE process, addressing the same questions asked by the guideline panel. Recommendations derived from the CORE process were compared to the guideline recommendations. Concordance of the course of action, strength of recommendation, and quality of evidence were determined.

- **Results**: Using a threshold of 70% of experts selecting the same course of action to make a recommendation, the CORE process yielded a recommendation for 20 of 31 (65%) questions. Among the 20 CORE-derived recommendations, 19 (95%) were concordant with the guideline recommendations (kappa agreement 0.88, 95% CI .64–1.00). There was less agreement among the strength of recommendations (58%) and quality of evidence (42%).

- **Conclusions**: If the CORE process had been used.

### Empiric treatment of ambulatory community-acquired pneumonia: Always include treatment for atypical agents [^112c37dG]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

There are no data from proper studies to answer whether it is necessary to include antibiotics that are active against atypical pneumonia agents as part of the empiric therapy of CAP. Until such data are available, clinical judgment and severity of the pneumonic illness are the best guides to empiric antimicrobial therapy.

### Influence of deviation from guidelines on the outcome of community-acquired pneumonia [^111bRUcu]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Consensus guidelines for the empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) have been published. We investigated the following factors:

- **Degree of adherence**: Adherence to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR) guidelines was assessed.
- **Influence of adherence**: We examined the impact of adhering to these guidelines on mortality and the length of hospitalization.

- **Design**: This was a prospective, observational study.

- **Setting**: The study took place at a tertiary-care teaching hospital.

- **Patients**: A total of 295 patients with CAP were consecutively admitted to the hospital and treated empirically.

- **Interventions**: Patients were stratified according to the prognostic rule of Fine. The antibiotic regimen prescribed within the first 24 hours was evaluated to determine adherence to treatment guidelines.

- **Results**: Adherence to SEPAR and ATS guidelines was 66% and 88%, respectively. No significant differences were found in mortality or duration of hospitalization between adherent and nonadherent regimens. However, mortality in severe CAP (Fine risk class V) was significantly higher in patients with nonadherent treatments (SEPAR: relative risk [RR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 5.6; ATS: RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.8). In a multivariate analysis, adherence to ATS guidelines was independently associated with decreased mortality (RR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.9) after adjusting for the Fine score.

In conclusion, adherence was higher to ATS guidelines than to SEPAR guidelines. Severe CAP had a significantly higher mortality when the guidelines (both ATS and SEPAR) were not adhered to.

### Empiric antibiotic therapy for moderate-to-severe community-acquired pneumonia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114MjWSZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). High credibility.

The optimal empiric antibiotic regimen for moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is uncertain.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of antibiotics for empiric therapy of moderate to severe CAP using a network meta-analysis (NMA).

- **Data sources**: Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to July 03, 2024.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCT).

- **Participants**: Adults with moderate to severe CAP.

- **Interventions**: Any empiric antibiotic regimen versus another, placebo, or no treatment.

- **Assessment of risk of bias**: Paired reviewers independently assessed risk of bias using a modified Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials.

- **Methods of data synthesis**: We conducted frequentist random-effects NMAs addressing patient-important outcomes and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

The study found that 143 RCTs involving 29,157 participants were eligible. Effects are compared with respiratory fluoroquinolones alone. Penicillins alone (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.67; RD 33 more per 1000, 95% CI 9 fewer to 88 more), 2nd generation cephalosporins alone (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.02; RD 45 more per 1000, 95% CI 15 fewer to 135 more), and 3rd generation cephalosporins alone (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.77; RD 42 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 102 more) or combined with a macrolide (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.84; RD 45 more per 1000, 95% CI 3 fewer to 111 more) may be inferior in reducing treatment failure, although all evidence is of low certainty.

### Testing strategies in the initial management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^11331Ns8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The initial management of patients suspected of having community-acquired pneumonia is challenging due to the broad range of clinical presentations, the potentially life-threatening nature of the illness, and the associated high costs of care. Initial testing strategies should accurately establish a diagnosis and prognosis to determine the optimal treatment strategy. Diagnosis is crucial in deciding the need for antibiotic therapy, while prognosis is important for determining the site of care.

This paper reviews the test characteristics of the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, both individually and in combination, in diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia and predicting the short-term risk of death from the infection. Additionally, we consider the implications of these test characteristics from the perspective of decision thresholds. The history and physical examination cannot provide a high level of certainty in diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia. However, the absence of vital sign abnormalities substantially reduces the probability of infection.

Chest radiography is considered the gold standard for pneumonia diagnosis. However, its sensitivity and specificity are unknown, and we have limited data on the costs of false-positive and false-negative results. In the absence of empirical evidence, the decision to order a chest radiograph must rely on expert opinion to optimize the balance between harms and benefits. Once community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed, a combination of history and physical examination should be employed.
