Migraine management

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage migraine, organized into a structured expert narrative. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing baseline severity. Then, I should verify acute treatment choices and timing. Next, I will assess when and how to initiate preventive therapy. After that, I need to consider non-pharmacologic strategies and special populations. Finally, I should review monitoring, escalation, and referral thresholds, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and baseline severity, because misdiagnosis and under-treatment are common and undermine outcomes; I should apply ICHD-3 criteria to distinguish migraine with and without aura, screen for red flags, and quantify disability using MIDAS or HIT-6 to stratify care and track response over time [^114SYWMW] [^116wc8gq] [^1168bfSC].

> Wait, let me verify the principle for acute treatment selection; I initially thought in terms of a rigid stepwise algorithm, but I should correct that to a stratified approach that matches therapy to attack severity and disability, reserving simple analgesics for mild attacks and migraine-specific agents for moderate-to-severe attacks or significant functional impairment, which yields better outcomes than step care in more disabled patients [^1168bfSC] [^117T5RwN].

> For mild attacks, I need to ensure first-line options are accessible and safe; NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or naproxen are appropriate, and fixed-dose combinations like aspirin-acetaminophen-caffeine can be considered, with attention to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks and the principle of early treatment at mild pain to improve efficacy and reduce recurrence [^1178PHGs] [^1151rfK2] [^116AKjca].

> For moderate-to-severe attacks, I should confirm that triptans remain first-line migraine-specific therapy in appropriate adults; sumatriptan and other triptans are supported by high-quality evidence for 2-hour pain freedom and sustained pain freedom, and if one triptan fails, a trial of a different triptan is reasonable given inter-patient variability in response [^113xNmhU] [^115b1mTy] [^1153BGL4].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives when triptans are contraindicated or not tolerated; gepants such as ubrogepant or rimegepant are appropriate options with favorable cardiovascular safety profiles, and ditans like lasmiditan are non-vasoconstrictive alternatives, though I need to counsel on driving restrictions due to sedation and acknowledge that VA/DoD guidance remains neutral pending more comparative data [^115ePbFX] [^1117DFpv] [^1162bYQx].

> I need to check timing and route considerations; treating early in the attack, ideally when pain is still mild, improves outcomes, and non-oral routes such as subcutaneous sumatriptan, nasal sprays, or suppositories should be considered when nausea or vomiting limits oral absorption or when rapid onset is needed [^116AKjca] [^116Uedce].

> Next, I should review prevention thresholds; historically I considered prevention at four or more monthly migraine days, but wait, let me reconsider in light of evolving guidance that supports earlier initiation even at two to four monthly days when disability is high or risk of progression is present, with shared decision-making about benefits, harms, costs, and patient preferences [^111Yptzk] [^11688k3a].

> I will now examine first-line preventive pharmacotherapy; CGRP monoclonal antibodies are now endorsed as first-line options given their efficacy and tolerability, while traditional oral preventives such as topiramate, beta-blockers, and amitriptyline remain reasonable alternatives based on comorbidities, contraindications, and patient preference, and I should confirm that sodium valproate is absolutely contraindicated in women of childbearing potential [^117AURMY] [^113WrtPk] [^117CTrpA].

> Let me think about onabotulinumtoxinA; I should confirm it is indicated for chronic migraine, typically defined as 15 or more headache days per month with at least eight days having migraine features, and consider it when oral or injectable preventives are inadequate or not tolerated, integrating it with acute optimization and behavioral strategies [^114PUycX] [^116dzD1W].

> I should double-check the role of non-pharmacologic prevention; behavioral therapies such as CBT, biofeedback, and relaxation training have evidence for reducing attack frequency and can be combined with pharmacotherapy, and acupuncture can be considered as an adjunct, while lifestyle interventions targeting sleep, stress, diet, and physical activity should be individualized and supported by diaries and behavior-change tools [^113miFb9] [^112DAhNW] [^115UAnn4].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or adolescent; I need to ensure pediatric-specific guidance is followed, using NSAIDs as first-line acute therapy and triptans such as rizatriptan or sumatriptan as appropriate, with non-oral routes favored when nausea is prominent, and I should integrate education and behavioral strategies while acknowledging that evidence for pharmacologic prevention in pediatrics is limited and decisions should be individualized [^115iszwA] [^115hun9k].

> For pregnancy and lactation, I should confirm that nonpharmacologic strategies are preferred, acetaminophen is generally acceptable for acute treatment, and triptans may be considered case-by-case after discussing risks and benefits; for prevention, magnesium or riboflavin can be considered, and CGRP monoclonal antibodies are generally avoided pending more pregnancy safety data [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I address medication overuse headache; education on limits for acute medication use, typically no more than two days per week on average, is essential, and if MOH is present, I should treat it proactively with withdrawal and initiation or optimization of prevention rather than withholding preventive therapy, aligning with quality measures that caution against overemphasis on overuse without enabling access to prevention [^116srf3U].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up; I will reassess at 2 to 3 months after initiating or changing therapy and then every 6 to 12 months, tracking monthly migraine days, acute medication days, disability, and patient-reported outcomes, and if response is suboptimal, I should verify adherence, dosing, and diagnosis before escalating or switching therapies [^111H5aVq].

> Hold on, I should verify escalation strategies; if a preventive fails, switching to a different class or mechanism is reasonable, and combination prevention may be appropriate in refractory cases, while for acute treatment, switching among triptans or to gepants or ditans can be effective, and in chronic or refractory presentations, onabotulinumtoxinA or CGRP monoclonal antibodies should be considered [^114PUycX].

> I will now examine when to refer; specialist referral is indicated for diagnostic uncertainty, refractoriness to multiple standard therapies, complicated presentations such as hemiplegic or brainstem aura, significant comorbidities, or when advanced interventions like neuromodulation are being considered, keeping in mind that most patients can be managed in primary care with the right tools and support [^111H5aVq].

> Let me synthesize the care pathway succinctly; confirm migraine using standardized criteria and quantify disability, treat acute attacks early with stratified therapy from NSAIDs to triptans or gepants as severity dictates, initiate prevention when frequency or disability warrant it with shared decision-making, integrate behavioral and lifestyle interventions, monitor systematically every few months, and escalate or refer when goals are not met, aligning with contemporary consensus and guideline-based care [^113WrtPk] [^111Ua5CV].

---

Migraine management centers on **accurate diagnosis** [^115SG2oJ] and **individualized care** [^113dVVbB], using a **stepped approach** [^11293cW1] that balances acute and preventive strategies [^111Ua5CV]. Acute treatment should start early [^116AKjca] with NSAIDs for mild attacks [^1178PHGs] and triptans for moderate-to-severe attacks [^113xNmhU]; gepants or ditans are alternatives when triptans are ineffective or contraindicated [^115ePbFX]. Preventive therapy is indicated for **frequent or disabling attacks** [^113WrtPk], with beta-blockers, topiramate, or CGRP monoclonal antibodies as first-line options [^117AURMY]. Non-pharmacologic care — including lifestyle changes, behavioral therapies, and neuromodulation — should be integrated [^1147vLct] [^115UAnn4]. Regular follow-up tracks response, adherence, and medication overuse [^111H5aVq] [^116srf3U]; referral is warranted for refractory or atypical cases [^111H5aVq].

---

## Diagnosis and clinical assessment

Accurate diagnosis is essential and should follow **ICHD-3 criteria** [^notfound], distinguishing migraine with and without aura and excluding secondary causes [^115SG2oJ]. A **comprehensive assessment** should document attack frequency, severity, duration, triggers, and associated symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia) [^116wc8gq]. Disability can be quantified with MIDAS or HIT-6 to guide treatment intensity [^116wc8gq].

---

## Acute treatment strategies

Acute therapy aims for **rapid pain relief**, restoration of function, and minimal recurrence [^116Z6Vja]. Early treatment at mild pain improves outcomes [^116AKjca].

| **Severity** | **First-line therapy** | **Second-line therapy** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild | NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) [^1178PHGs] | Acetaminophen [^114NWJ8R] | Use antiemetics if nausea [^116wc8gq] |
| Moderate-severe | Triptans (sumatriptan, rizatriptan) [^113xNmhU] | Gepants (ubrogepant, rimegepant) or ditans (lasmiditan) [^115ePbFX] [^1117DFpv] | Avoid opioids/butalbital [^1137CPkd] |
| Refractory | Combination therapy (triptan + NSAID) [^112dd8qV] | Gepants or ditans [^115ePbFX] | Consider non-oral routes if nausea [^115iszwA] |

---

Triptans are **first-line** for moderate-to-severe attacks [^113xNmhU]; if one fails, try another [^1153BGL4]. Gepants or ditans suit patients with cardiovascular risk or triptan intolerance [^115ePbFX]. Avoid opioids and butalbital except in rare, refractory cases [^1137CPkd].

---

## Preventive treatment strategies

Preventive therapy is indicated for **frequent attacks (≥ 4/month)**, significant disability, or inadequate response to acute therapy [^111Yptzk] [^116wc8gq].

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Indications** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Beta-blockers | Propranolol, metoprolol | Frequent episodic migraine | Contraindicated in asthma, bradycardia |
| Anticonvulsants | Topiramate, valproate | Frequent episodic/chronic migraine | Valproate contraindicated in pregnancy [^113WrtPk] |
| CGRP mAbs | Erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab | Episodic/chronic migraine, refractory cases | Well tolerated, minimal adverse effects [^112LpM1z] |
| Botulinum toxin | OnabotulinumtoxinA | Chronic migraine (≥ 15 days/month) | Effective, well tolerated [^notfound] |

---

Selection should reflect comorbidities, contraindications, and patient preferences; **CGRP monoclonal antibodies** are effective and well tolerated, especially in refractory cases [^112LpM1z] [^117Ht1as].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacologic care reduces frequency and improves adherence [^115tpYdJ] [^114KzJdX]:

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Regular sleep, hydration, diet, exercise, and trigger avoidance [^115UAnn4] [^116oF4sE].
- **Behavioral therapies**: CBT, biofeedback, relaxation training [^113miFb9] [^115tpYdJ].
- **Neuromodulation**: Non-invasive devices (eG, sTMS, external trigeminal stimulator) for select patients [^111Ua5CV] [^114PUycX].

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Acetaminophen first-line; avoid valproate, triptans generally avoided [^113WrtPk].
- **Pediatrics**: NSAIDs first-line; triptans considered if NSAIDs fail [^notfound].
- **Elderly**: Use caution with triptans; consider NSAIDs or acetaminophen [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up should assess **response, adherence, and medication overuse** [^111H5aVq]. Adjust therapy based on efficacy, tolerability, and patient preference [^111H5aVq]. Educate patients on trigger management, early treatment, and when to seek care [^113dVVbB].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Referral is appropriate for diagnostic uncertainty, **refractory migraine**, atypical features, or significant comorbidities [^111H5aVq]. Specialists provide access to advanced therapies and multidisciplinary care [^111H5aVq].

---

Migraine management requires a **stepped, individualized approach** that integrates acute and preventive pharmacotherapy with non-pharmacologic care, supported by regular follow-up and timely referral to optimize outcomes and quality of life [^111Ua5CV].

### Migraine: integrated approaches to clinical management and emerging treatments [^111Ua5CV]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Migraine is a highly disabling neurological disorder that directly affects more than 1 billion individuals worldwide. Available treatment options differ between countries and include acute, preventive, and non-pharmacological therapies. Because of major progress in the understanding of migraine pathogenesis, novel mechanism-based medications have emerged and expanded the armamentarium of treatments. We provide a comprehensive overview of the current standard of care that will enable informed clinical management. First, we discuss the efficacy, tolerability, and safety profile of various pharmacological therapies for acute and preventive treatment of migraine. Second, we review the current knowledge on non-pharmacological therapies, such as neuromodulation and biobehavioural approaches, which can be used for a multidisciplinary approach to clinical management. Third, we emphasise that any effective treatment strategy starts with building a therapeutic plan tailored to individual clinical characteristics, preferences, and needs. Finally, we explore the outlook of emerging mechanism-based treatments that could address unmet challenges in clinical management of migraine.

Conclusions

Migraine is a ubiquitous neurological disorder that adds substantially to the global burden of disease. Despite the existence of comprehensive diagnostic criteria and a multitude of therapeutic options, diagnosis and clinical management of migraine remain suboptimal worldwide. This Consensus Statement was developed by experts from Europe to provide generally applicable recommendations for the diagnosis and management of migraine and to promote best clinical practices. The recommendations are based on published evidence and expert opinion, and will be updated when new information and treatments emerge.

### What do patients want from acute migraine treatment? [^1165nRCC]. Cephalalgia (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical observations have shown that migraine is a progressive disorder, both within an acute attack, and within the disease itself. Rates of diagnosis for migraine have increased in the last decade, but more than half of migraineurs remain undiagnosed. Patient expectations of migraine therapies have also increased (patients require rapid and sustained pain relief with a treatment that has good tolerability), and can differ greatly from those of physicians. Management decisions should be made with these expectations in mind, to enhance patient outcomes and compliance with treatment. Improved understanding of acute migraine attack pathophysiology has led to the strategy of early treatment to modify both the progression of the current attack and, potentially, the progression of the disease itself in the individual. The triptans are effective acute migraine therapies. Each agent has its own distinct profile of efficacy and tolerability, enabling individualization of treatment.

### Migraine treatment: current acute medications and their potential mechanisms of action [^116Z6Vja]. Neurotherapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common and disabling primary headache disorder with a significant socioeconomic burden. The management of migraine is multifaceted and is generally dichotomized into acute and preventive strategies, with several treatment modalities. The aims of acute pharmacological treatment are to rapidly restore function with minimal recurrence, with the avoidance of side effects. The choice of pharmacological treatment is individualized, and is based on the consideration of the characteristics of the migraine attack, the patient's concomitant medical problems, and treatment preferences. Notwithstanding, a good understanding of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the various drug options is essential to guide therapy. The current approach and concepts relevant to the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine will be explored in this review.

### Non-pharmacological approaches for migraine [^1147vLct]. Neurotherapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Migraine is one of the most common and debilitating neurological disorders. However, the efficacy of pharmacological therapies may have unsatisfactory efficacy and can be poorly tolerated. There is a strong need in clinical practice for alternative approaches for both acute and preventive treatment. Occasionally, this need might arise in the context of low-frequency migraneurs who are not keen to use medication or fear the potential side effects. At the opposite end of the spectrum, clinicians might be faced with patients who have proven refractory to numerous medications. These patients may benefit from invasive treatment strategies. In recent years, promising strategies for migraine therapy have emerged alongside a progressively better understanding of the complex pathophysiology underlying this disease. This review discusses the most recent and evidence-based advances in non-pharmacological therapeutic approaches for migraine, offering alternatives to drug treatment for both the commonly encountered episodic cases as well as the more complex migraine phenotypes, which are capable of challenging even the headache specialist.

Individualized therapy

Multiple effective acute and preventive therapies are available for migraine. When selecting from these therapies, the objective is that each patient receives the therapy that provides the best personal outcome. Unfortunately, no a priori basis for selection currently exists, at least for acute therapy. Optimal individualized therapy is therefore currently best achieved with a stepped care approach, set out in detail in Step 4.

Recommendations

Provide every patient with a full explanation of migraine as a disease and of the principles of its management.
Consider predisposing and trigger factors, but keep in mind that true trigger factors are often self-evident.
Adhere to the principles of stepped care to achieve optimal individualized therapy (see Step 4).

### An update on migraine: current understanding and future directions [^114bQ3z8]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is the most common neurological cause of disability in the world. Notwithstanding, clinicians and researchers have seen little progress in the therapeutic options available to treat this condition in the last two decades. Recent advances in our understanding of migraine pathophysiology have allowed the development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments that offer the advantage of targeting mechanisms known to be active in the disorder leading to better management of patients.

The current review follows this bench to bedside approach, with an outline of relevant mechanisms in migraine biology, followed by an up-to-date summary of the most important therapies used in migraine at the present stage.

### Migraine prevention [^113SyCZq]. Practical Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Preventive medications reduce migraine frequency and severity, and improve migraine-specific quality of life. Recent evidence also suggests that these same medications enhance the patient's response to acute migraine therapies, and may also reduce the likelihood of developing chronic daily headache. However, many patients who should receive or be offered preventive treatment are not. Most patients can be successfully managed when patient and physician expectations are realistic and aligned, the selection of preventive medications is individualised, and the initiation and titration strategy is appropriate and carefully followed. Rational combinations of preventive medications may also be useful. This review provides an evidence and experience-based approach to the preventive treatment of migraine.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^114KzJdX]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Migraine is a disabling primary headache disorder that directly affects more than one billion people worldwide. Despite its widespread prevalence, migraine remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. To support clinical decision-making, we convened a European panel of experts to develop a ten-step approach to the diagnosis and management of migraine. Each step was established by expert consensus and supported by a review of current literature, and the Consensus Statement is endorsed by the European Headache Federation and the European Academy of Neurology. In this Consensus Statement, we introduce typical clinical features, diagnostic criteria and differential diagnoses of migraine. We then emphasize the value of patient centricity and patient education to ensure treatment adherence and satisfaction with care provision. Further, we outline best practices for acute and preventive treatment of migraine in various patient populations, including adults, children and adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and older people. In addition, we provide recommendations for evaluating treatment response and managing treatment failure. Lastly, we discuss the management of complications and comorbidities as well as the importance of planning long-term follow-up.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of migraine [^113ifG9D]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

We here present evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of migraine. These guidelines, created by the Italian Society for the Study of Headache and the International Headache Society, aim to offer clear, actionable recommendations to healthcare professionals. They incorporate evidence-based recommendations from randomized controlled trials and expert-based opinions. The guidelines follow the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach for assessing the quality of evidence. The guideline development involved a systematic review of literature across multiple databases, adherence to Cochrane review methods, and a structured framework for data extraction and interpretation. Although the guidelines provide a robust foundation for migraine treatment, they also highlight gaps in current research, such as the paucity of head-to-head drug comparisons and the need for long-term outcome studies. These guidelines serve as a resource to standardize migraine treatment and promote high-quality care across different healthcare settings.

### Treatment approaches to maximizing therapeutic response in migraine [^111VS4zm]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Migraine is a chronic condition that presents with episodic disabling attacks, which can respond unpredictably to therapies. Studies support early treatment intervention strategies as part of the routine clinical care of migraine patients. Identifying illness severity and stratifying treatment accordingly (as in other diseases such as asthma, diabetes, or hypertension) improves patient outcome. Assessing the presence of any coexisting conditions, such as depression or anxiety, is another essential part of managing migraine.

### International headache society global practice recommendations for the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine [^112jW8mk]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In an effort to improve migraine management around the world, the International Headache Society (IHS) has here developed a list of practical recommendations for the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine. The recommendations are categorized into optimal and essential, in order to provide treatment options for all possible settings, including those with limited access to migraine medications.

Methods

An IHS steering committee developed a list of clinical questions based on practical issues in the management of migraine. A selected group of international senior and junior headache experts developed the recommendations, following expert consensus and the review of available national and international headache guidelines and guidance documents. Following the initial search, a bibliography of twenty-one national and international guidelines was created and reviewed by the working group.

Results

A total of seventeen questions addressing different aspects of acute migraine treatment have been outlined. For each of them we provide an optimal recommendation, to be used whenever possible, and an essential recommendation to be used when the optimal level cannot be attained.

Conclusion

Adoption of these international recommendations will improve the quality of acute migraine treatment around the world, even where pharmacological options remain limited.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^111H5aVq]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

When treatment fails

A conclusion that treatment has failed should be made with caution and must always be preceded by a thorough review of the underlying reasons. In some cases, apparent failures might be remediable, such as when failure is due to poor adherence or suboptimal dosing. Whereas some patients benefit from higher doses, others might benefit from lower doses that have fewer adverse effects and therefore improve adherence. Alternatives when first-line medications fail are outlined above (see Step 4 and Step 5). If all treatments fail, the diagnosis should be questioned and specialist referral is indicated.

When specialist referral is needed

Approximately 90% of people who seek professional care for migraine should be treated in primary care. Referral to specialist care should be reserved for the minority of patients whose condition is diagnostically challenging, difficult to treat or complicated by comorbidities. Specialist care provides access to greater expertise maintained by experience and to multidisciplinary care. However, specialist capacity is limited and the cost is much higher.

Recommendations

Evaluate treatment responses shortly after initiation (after 2–3 months) or a change of treatment and regularly thereafter (every 6–12 months).
Evaluate the effectiveness of treatment by assessing attack frequency, attack severity and migraine-related disability.
When outcomes are suboptimal, review the diagnosis, treatment strategy, dosing and adherence.
If all treatment fails, question the diagnosis and consider specialist referral.

### Risk factors for migraine disease progression: a narrative review for a patient-centered approach [^115GaoZe]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is a debilitating chronic neurologic disorder associated with substantial personal, economic, and societal burdens and reductions in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Among adults, the prevalence of migraine is approximately 14%, peaking in midlife, with a substantial female preponderance. Roughly one-third of people with migraine experience ≥ 4 monthly headache days (MHDs) and about 7% have ≥ 15 MHDs. The traditional goals of preventive headache treatments are to reduce attack frequency and severity, while acute therapy is intended to relieve pain and restore function when attacks occur; recent papers have highlighted the potential of preventing disease progression.

The clinical course of migraine is heterogeneous, with frequency, severity, symptom profiles, and associated disability varying over time among individuals. However, some individuals will experience sustained worsening (i.e. progression) of their disease state. Clinicians who treat migraine should understand the phenomenon of migraine disease progression, as well as the potentially modifiable risk factors, and protective actions that influence the course of disease. Given the size of the migraine population and the large percentage of patients seeking medical attention in the primary care setting, primary care providers and other clinician specialists, such as neurologists, must be equipped to manage migraine. Results from OVERCOME (ObserVational survey of the Epidemiology, tReatment, and Care Of MigrainE), conducted in individuals with migraine in the United States, indicated that the over the course of their lifetimes, most people with migraine who seek medical care do so in primary care (70.3%) while only 15.6% see neurologists or headache specialists. When assessing a patient's risk profile for migraine progression, it is important to include the patient as a partner in developing a management approach. Clinicians should identify factors that are modifiable and most likely to improve the patient's quality of life. Treatment success should be defined as a series of milestones, each of which becomes a foundation for the next step towards optimal treatment.

Based on evidence reviewed herein, we believe that preventing progression should be added to the list of therapeutic goals, not just for specialists, but in the primary care settings where most people with migraine receive their medical care. The objective of this review is to provide clinicians with the tools to understand migraine disease progression, to identify its risk factors, and to suggest potential mitigation strategies to prevent progression that are supported by research and expert opinion.

Migraines are common, incapacitating, and often stress inducing for pediatric patients and parents alike. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, more than 1 million Americans seek emergency care every year due to migraines, with increasing frequency among adolescents. The disease can vary in severity and character, often mimicking life-threatening conditions, requiring prompt nuanced recognition by emergency personnel and implementation of an effective treatment strategy. Development of emergency department guidelines for the management of pediatric migraines should be based on up-to-date evidence supporting safe, appropriate therapies for children.

### Update on migraine management [^113nZmUQ]. Menopause (2022). Medium credibility.

Migraine is a highly prevalent disorder in women associated with significant disability. Yet it remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of migraine, including the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide, has led to the development of new targeted migraine therapies. It is important for all healthcare professionals caring for women to be familiar with the diagnostic criteria for migraine and for them to follow a stepwise approach to management of acute and chronic migraine that comprises biobehavioral and pharmacologic management, particularly the more recently approved therapies.

### Migraine: from pathophysiology to treatment [^117NZkem]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The last 2 decades have been an incredibly exciting period for clinicians and researchers interested in migraine, as they have seen a rapid increase in studies that have led to a greater knowledge and understanding of the neurobiology of the disorder. From suffering with a condition that was often overlooked and under-managed, migraineurs are now being offered novel treatments that are more and more tailored to their needs, and that are fundamentally re-shaping our approach to the disease.

More research and progress is needed and is expected in the coming years, and hopefully this will continue to raise awareness around a complex phenomenon affecting millions of people all over the world.

### An update on migraine: current understanding and future directions [^114EgLcD]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The recent recognition of migraine as a debilitating neurological condition is an important advance in directing more resources to the development of new treatments and their deployment to patients. The last two decades have seen a number of important studies in the area of primary headaches leading to an extremely exciting era for researchers interested in this disorder. New treatments are rapidly becoming available for patients and a better understanding of its pathophysiological mechanisms is allowing a greater awareness of the complexity of a brain disease which has often been overlooked and under-managed.

### The role of headache-related disability in migraine management: implications for headache treatment guidelines [^1168bfSC]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Recently published US Headache Consortium Guidelines recommend a process of diagnosis, patient education, and individualized treatment for the management of migraine. Clinicians are advised to base their treatment choice on attack frequency and duration, degree of disability, non-headache symptoms, patient preference, and prior history of treatment response, using a stratified approach to care. In stratified care, initial treatment is individualized based on an assessment of the patients' medical needs. One approach to stratification uses the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) Questionnaire to stratify patients into groups with different treatment needs based on the degree of headache-related disability. Stratified care was developed as an alternative to step-care approaches, which begin patients on nonspecific medication with gradual escalation until they obtain effective relief. Results from the Disability in Strategies for Care (DISC) study indicate that stratified care provides superior outcomes compared to step-care and that the approach is cost-effective, supporting the US Headache Consortium

Guidelines

Stratified care may become the approach of choice for managing migraine in clinical practice. This approach increases the chances of providing appropriate therapy at the patient's initial consultation, sparing the patient a series of failed therapeutic efforts. The MIDAS Questionnaire provides a practical tool for helping to implement the recommendations of the US Headache Consortium

### Migraine [^115SG2oJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Migraine affects about 1 billion people worldwide, and up to 15% of adults in the United States have migraine attacks in any given year. Migraine is associated with substantial adverse socioeconomic and personal effects. It is the second leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide for all ages and the leading cause in women aged 15 to 49 years. Diagnostic uncertainty increases the likelihood of unnecessary investigations and suboptimal management. This article advises clinicians about diagnosing migraine, ruling out secondary headache disorders, developing acute and preventive treatment plans, and deciding when to refer the patient to a specialist.

### Paediatric migraine: evidence-based management and future directions [^115hun9k]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Migraine is prevalent in children and adolescents and constitutes an important cause of disability in this population. Early, effective treatment of paediatric migraine is likely to result in improved outcomes. Findings from the past few years suggest that a biopsychosocial approach that uses interdisciplinary multimodal care is most effective for treatment of migraine in the paediatric population. Key elements of this management include effective and timely acute pharmacological interventions (such as NSAIDs and/or triptans), education of patients regarding self-management techniques, and psychological interventions such as biofeedback, relaxation and cognitive-behavioural therapy. The efficacy of current pharmacological or nutraceutical interventions for migraine prevention in children and adolescents is unclear, although reported placebo response patterns suggest that the effect of pill-taking behaviour is positive. As such, clinicians can consider adding a preventive intervention that involves a daily pill-taking behaviour to evidence-based non-pharmacological first-line preventive interventions (such as cognitive-behavioural therapy). More rigorous research is needed to delineate the role of pharmacological and nutraceutical interventions, the mechanisms of the clinically relevant placebo response, and interventions that enhance this response for migraine prevention in this population. Given the prevalence of migraine, cost-effective and efficacious strategies are needed for the large-scale delivery of interdisciplinary multimodal paediatric migraine care.

### Management of chronic migraine [^114PUycX]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Chronic migraine is a neurologic disorder associated with considerable disability, lost productivity, and a profound economic burden worldwide. The past five years have seen a dramatic expansion in new treatments for this often challenging condition, among them calcitonin gene related peptide antagonists and neuromodulatory devices. This review outlines the epidemiology of and diagnostic criteria and risk factors for chronic migraine. It discusses evidence based drug and non-drug treatments, their advantages and disadvantages, and the principles of patient centered care for adults with chronic migraine, with attention to differential diagnosis and comorbidities, clinical reasoning, initiation and monitoring, cost, and availability. It discusses the international guidelines on drug treatment for chronic migraine and evaluates non-drug treatments including behavioral and complementary therapies and lifestyle modifications. Finally, it discusses the management of chronic migraine in special populations, including pediatrics, pregnancy, and older people, and considers future questions and emerging research in the field.

### Early treatment in migraine – A call to shift prevention from attacks to disease progression: a position statement from the international headache society [^111Yptzk]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

Migraine is one of the most disabling diseases worldwide, especially when it transforms into chronic migraine, which is often associated with medication overuse and can become resistant or even refractory to treatments. Molecular, neuroimaging and neurophysiological changes have been described in chronic migraine, some of which might not be fully reversible with preventive treatment. For these reasons, we should aim to prevent this transition, and initiate preventive treatment before disease becomes refractory and burden increases. Preventive migraine treatments are often delayed because of access to care, stigma leading to undertreatment and patients' reluctance as a result of fear of side effects and, in some cases, fear of being labeled as chronically ill. With the availability of effective and well-tolerated preventive treatments, we must shift our mindset and take advantage of new opportunities to initiate preventive treatment earlier. In this International Headache Society position statement, we propose a migraine preventive strategy under the idea of shifting from reactive treatment once disability is established (prevention of attacks), to proactive, individualized prevention initiated early with safe, effective and tolerable therapies (prevention of disease progression). This approach is based on 1) promoting the early initiation of effective and tolerable preventive therapies, starting from two to four monthly migraine days in line with the majority of current guidelines and recommendations and 2) fostering longitudinal studies to gather more evidence on the potential benefit of early prevention, with the final goal of improving patient outcomes, promoting excellent migraine care, enhancing individual and social well-being, and, ultimately, preventing migraine progression and preserving brain health.

### Risk factors for migraine disease progression: a narrative review for a patient-centered approach [^111Ld5EC]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In individuals with migraine, attacks may increase in frequency, severity, or both. Preventing migraine progression has emerged as a treatment goal in headache subspecialty practice, but there may be less awareness in general neurology or primary care settings where most people with migraine who seek treatment consult. Herein, we review the definition of and risk factors for migraine progression and consider strategies that could reduce its risk.

Methods

A group of headache expert healthcare professionals, clinicians, and researchers reviewed published evidence documenting factors associated with increased or decreased rates of migraine progression and established expert opinions for disease management recommendations. Strength of evidence was rated as good, moderate, or based solely on expert opinion, using modified criteria for causation developed by AB Hill.

Results

Migraine progression is commonly operationally defined as the transition from ≤ 15 to ≥ 15 monthly headache days among people with migraine; however, this does not necessarily constitute a fundamental change in migraine biology and other definitions should be considered. Established and theoretical key risk factors for migraine progression were categorized into five domains: migraine disease characteristics, treatment-related factors, comorbidities, lifestyle/exogenous factors, and demographic factors. Within these domains, good evidence supports the following risk factors: poorly optimized acute headache treatment, cutaneous allodynia, acute medication overuse, selected psychiatric symptoms, extra-cephalic chronic pain conditions, metabolism-related comorbidities, sleep disturbances, respiratory conditions, former/current high caffeine intake, physical inactivity, financial constraints, tobacco use, and personal triggers as risk factors. Protective actions that may mitigate migraine progression are sparsely investigated in published literature; our discussion of these factors is primarily based on expert opinion.

Conclusions

Recognizing risk factors for migraine progression will allow healthcare providers to suggest protective actions against migraine progression (Supplementary Fig. 1). Intervention studies are needed to weight the risk factors and test the clinical benefit of hypothesized mitigation strategies that emerge from epidemiological evidence.

### Efficacy of acupuncture-related therapy for migraine: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115h9a1k]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on the literature search, there are a number of systematic evaluation articles that have analyzed and compared the efficacy and safety of acupuncture therapy for the prevention or treatment of migraine accordingly. But integrated assessment of different acupuncture therapies for multiple migraine types and evaluation of the efficacy of specific acupuncture therapies is still absent. This article will provide a comprehensive and systematic summary.

With the increasing understanding of migraine and the accumulation of experience in non-pharmacological management, non-pharmacological treatment strategies, mainly acupuncture, have gradually become mainstream in the management of migraine. Therefore, by summarizing the randomized controlled trials of different acupuncture therapies for the prevention and treatment of different types of migraine, we can provide more objective and intuitive ideas and experiences on the treatment of migraine, and thus improve the clinical efficacy. Therefore, in order to provide comprehensive and objective information, and the basis for the development of reliable clinical strategies for migraine patients, we posed the following research questions:

1.the research trends of acupuncture therapy in the prevention and treatment of migraine, as well as the greater concern is which type of migraine;

2.in terms of treatment options, which were the acupuncture therapies used for the prevention and treatment of different types of migraine, and the choice of acupuncture points;

3.effectiveness and safety of different acupuncture treatments compared to conventional therapeutic drugs in the treatment and prevention of migraine.

Acute migraine management in children and adolescents — many children and adolescents do not respond to treatment at home with NSAIDs and triptans and seek pain relief at an emergency department or infusion center. Trials of refractory headache treatment in children and adolescents have been conducted but therapeutic approaches in these circumstances vary. Studies are also needed of alternate delivery routes for acute treatments such as transdermal patches because oral medications are poorly absorbed in children and adolescents with nausea and vomiting. Regardless of the strategy chosen for acute migraine therapy, treatment plans should be individually tailored to the patient and family and include education about migraine prevention strategies.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^113WrtPk]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is a highly disabling primary headache disorder with a 1-year prevalence of ~15% in the general population. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, migraine is the second most prevalent neurological disorder worldwide and is responsible for more disability than all other neurological disorders combined.

Migraine manifests clinically as recurrent attacks of headache with a range of accompanying symptoms. In approximately one third of individuals with migraine, headache is sometimes or always preceded or accompanied by transient neurological disturbances, referred to as migraine aura. Furthermore, a minority of those affected develop chronic migraine, in which attacks become highly frequent. The pathogenesis of migraine is widely believed to involve peripheral and central activation of the trigeminovascular system, and cortical spreading depression is thought to be the underlying neurophysiological substrate of migraine aura. However, much remains unknown about specific pathogenic processes and few mechanism-based treatment options currently exist.

Treatments for migraine include acute and preventive medications and a range of non-pharmacological therapies. Despite these treatment options and the comprehensive diagnostic criteria, clinical care remains suboptimal — misdiagnosis and under-treatment of migraine are substantial public health challenges. Population-based data from Europe indicate that preventive medication for migraine is used by only 2–14% of eligible individuals, an alarming finding that calls for global action. A comprehensive approach is needed to facilitate accurate diagnosis and evidence-based management.

In this Consensus Statement, we provide a ten-step approach to the diagnosis and management of migraine (Fig. 1). Development of this approach was initiated by the Danish Headache Society, and the Consensus Statement is endorsed by the European Headache Federation (EHF) and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN). The aim of the approach is to support care and clinical decision-making by primary care practitioners, neurologists and headache specialists alike.

### Current practice and future directions in the prevention and acute management of migraine [^1136rLZy]. The Lancet: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Migraine is a common and disabling brain disorder with a strong inherited component. Because patients with migraine have severe and disabling attacks usually of headache with other symptoms of sensory disturbance (eg, light and sound sensitivity), medical treatment is often required. Patients can be managed by use of acute attack therapies (eg, simple analgesics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or specific agents with vasoconstrictor properties (ie, triptans or ergot derivatives). Future non-vasoconstrictor approaches include calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists. Preventive therapy is probably indicated in about a third of patients with migraine, and a broad range of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical options exist. Medication overuse is an important concern in migraine therapeutics and needs to be identified and managed. In most patients, migraine can be improved with careful attention to the details of therapy, and in those for whom it cannot, neuromodulation approaches, such as occipital nerve stimulation, are currently being actively studied and offer much promise.

Clinical context for preventive therapy selection underscores individualized care and study limitations: "Treatment regimens, therefore, need to be designed case by case, which may include complex or even nontraditional approaches". "A shortcoming of migraine prevention clinical studies is the relatively brief treatment duration (often only 12–16 weeks)". "Long-term assessment of the efficacy and safety of migraine preventive treatments is needed". Additional considerations include that "It seems reasonable that a clinician be mindful of comorbid and coexistent conditions in patients with migraine, to maximize potential treatment efficacy and minimize AE risk", and "Because migraine is frequent in women of childbearing age, the potential for adverse fetal effects related to migraine prevention strategies is particularly concerning".

### Lifestyle factors and migraine [^115UAnn4]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Migraine, a common and disabling neurological disorder, is among the top reasons for outpatient visits to general neurologists. In addition to pharmacotherapy, lifestyle interventions are a mainstay of treatment. High-quality daily diary studies and intervention studies indicate intraindividual variations in the associations between lifestyle factors (such as stress, sleep, diet, and physical activity) and migraine attack occurrence. Behaviour change interventions can directly address overlapping lifestyle factors; combination approaches could capitalise on multiple mechanisms. These findings provide useful directions for integration of lifestyle management into routine clinical care and for future research.

### The pathophysiology of migraine: implications for clinical management [^113JZgcS]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

The understanding of migraine pathophysiology is advancing rapidly. Improved characterisation and diagnosis of its clinical features have led to the view of migraine as a complex, variable disorder of nervous system function rather than simply a vascular headache. Recent studies have provided important new insights into its genetic causes, anatomical and physiological features, and pharmacological mechanisms. The identification of new migraine-associated genes, the visualisation of brain regions that are activated at the earliest stages of a migraine attack, a greater appreciation of the potential role of the cervical nerves, and the recognition of the crucial role for neuropeptides are among the advances that have led to novel targets for migraine therapy. Future management of migraine will have the capacity to tailor treatments based on the distinct mechanisms of migraine that affect individual patients.

Recommendations for future research and clinical consideration emphasize gaps in high-quality evidence: "Although many preventive therapies reviewed herein are rated as Level C or U on the basis of the quality of evidence available, for some treatments extensive clinical experience supports a possible role in migraine prevention". Until stronger data are available, "practitioners are cautioned not to discount these agents because Class I prospective clinical studies are lacking", and "A case-by-case evaluation of these agents as treatment options is prudent". "Future directions should include validating these initial clinical observations in scientifically sound RCTs".

### What efficacy measures are clinically relevant and should be used in cochrane reviews of acute migraine trials? An alternative viewpoint [^113y9WQS]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

I briefly review the purposes of efficacy measures, which go far beyond supporting new drug development. I use vignettes to illustrate the importance of functional recovery during the migraine attack, and argue that headache relief provides this. Sustained headache relief (SHR) is therefore a very worthwhile outcome when the alternative is a day of debilitating pain. As a measure, SHR may not be ideal for new drug development but it is informative to individuals, health care providers and politicians, and serves cost-effectiveness analysis better than any other. Cochrane are absolutely right to use it in systematic reviews along with the IHS-recommended measures.

### Current options for the prevention and treatment of migraine [^116oF4sE]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a common condition affecting approximately 18% of women and 6% of men in the United States. The goals of managing migraine are 2-fold: to prevent attacks from occurring and to effectively and rapidly end them when they do occur.

Objective

This article reviews the acute and prophylactic treatment of migraine.

Methods

Information for inclusion in this review was identified through a search of MEDLINE from 1995 to the present. Search terms included migraine, acute treatment, prophylactic treatment, preventive treatment, and individual drug names.

Results

Preventive measures for migraine include lifestyle changes (eg, avoiding migraine triggers and maintaining regular sleep, eating, and work habits) and drug therapy. Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticonvulsants are among the more common drug classes used for migraine prophylaxis, but preventive therapy must be individualized, taking into account efficacy, potential adverse effects, co-existing medical conditions, and drug costs. Many medications are available for the acute treatment of migraine, including over-the-counter analgesics and prescription drugs. Of the latter, the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B/1D)-receptor agonists, or triptans, are the most recently introduced class. Each of the 4 available triptans (sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, and rizatriptan) is effective in ending a migraine attack, but comparative trials have shown differences between individual drugs in the time to pain relief and the percentage of patients who obtain pain relief.

Conclusions

Medications to prevent or reduce the frequency of migraine tend to be less specific and effective than medications for the acute treatment of migraine. As a class, triptans are generally well tolerated and may be considered drugs of choice for the acute treatment of moderate to severe migraine.

### Risk factors for migraine disease progression: a narrative review for a patient-centered approach [^114RNz74]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Protective actions for comorbidity risk factors

Comorbidity management is an important component of a migraine management strategy and should be guided by a collaborative patient‒clinician decision-making paradigm. Referral to a specialist and multidisciplinary providers may be appropriate depending upon comorbidities and patient variables. While there are several comorbidities associated with migraine progression, there is limited direct evidence to suggest that treating comorbidities will decrease progression. Nevertheless, increased attention to the management of the most significant known comorbidities associated with migraine progression (e.g. depression, anxiety, chronic pain, history of head or neck injury, metabolism-related comorbidities, sleep disturbances, allergic rhinitis, asthma, female sex, hormones) represent a reasonable approach to mitigating the risk of progression and should not be overlooked.

Education on the risks of medication overuse should be offered routinely to all patients with migraine but should be based on individual circumstances. Motivational interviewing and reinforcement of positive behaviors can affect behavioral changes and promote positive relationships. Such initiatives are designed to stimulate patients' desire to change and give them the confidence to do so, but they can be challenging to implement, as this requires an entirely different perspective on the nature of the clinician's role.

Protective actions for lifestyle/exogenous risk factors

Although evidence demonstrates that lifestyle and exogenous factors are related to increasing MHDs, there is little research on potential interventions. These are the areas where expert opinion offers supportive insight. While the protective actions below are described from a migraine standpoint, lifestyle and exogenous factors should be attended to regardless of their possible relation to migraine disease and its progression.

Stress in many forms influences migraine, including stress from adverse childhood events, stressful life events, ongoing financial constraints, and previous assault. Individuals with stress could benefit from approaches such as stress management, CBT, biofeedback, relaxation training, exercise, social support, or fostering resilience to reduce the frequency of migraine based on their individual needs. Several of these approaches (CBT, biofeedback, relaxation training) already have evidence supporting their use for migraine management, but not specifically within the context of stress.

### Initiating and optimizing acute therapy for migraine: the role of patient-centered stratified care [^117T5RwN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Migraine is a chronic, intermittently disabling condition that affects physical, mental, and social aspects of health-related quality of life. Because patients seeking assistance with migraine most often present to primary care providers, these healthcare professionals play critical roles in the diagnosis and treatment process. A comprehensive migraine management plan involves a partnership between the patient and healthcare professional where treatment goals and strategies are established. Elements of such a plan should include preventive strategies to reduce the frequency and effects of future attacks as well as the use of acute treatments to address the immediate need for relief during an attack. Approaches to prevention include education, lifestyle modification, and, often, appropriate medication. Many medications have been used for acute treatment. Nonspecific agents include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), single or combination analgesics (sometimes including antiemetics or caffeine), and narcotics. Migraine-specific medications include ergot alkaloids and triptans (5-hydroxytryptamine(1B/1D) agonists). Various professional organizations have created guidelines to help providers in choosing appropriate management interventions. Clinical approaches to the patient with migraine include step care, whereby all patients begin on a simple or nonspecific treatment, stepping up to the next level of therapy if treatment is unsuccessful; or stratified care, whereby first-line therapy is tailored to the severity of the patient's pattern of headache. Studies have demonstrated that for more disabled headache patients, the stratified-care approach results in more robust headache response with less disability and greater cost-effectiveness than step care. Patient satisfaction studies demonstrate that the use of migraine-specific abortive medications (triptans) is associated with a higher satisfaction rate than over-the-counter preparations, NSAIDs, and analgesic combinations. Patients who initially reported satisfaction with the latter medications also reported a preference for triptan therapy. Healthcare professionals can assist patients, not only by choosing the most appropriate medication but also by assessing whether the level of benefit the patient is currently receiving could be improved.

Outcomes

We selected outcomes recommended by the International Headache Society. The primary outcomes were the proportion of participants who were pain-free at two hours post-dose and the proportion of participants with sustained pain freedom from two to 24 hours post-dose, both without the use of rescue drugs.

Secondary outcomes included the proportion of participants with pain relief at two hours post-dose, the proportion with pain relapse within two to 48 hours post-dose, and the proportion using rescue drugs after two hours and up to 24 hours. We also investigated safety and tolerability, assessing the proportion of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event and the proportion with at least one of 19 specific clinically relevant adverse events predefined in the protocol (see supplementary appendix 1).

### Chronic migraine – classification, characteristics and treatment [^116dzD1W]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

According to the revised 2nd Edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, primary headaches can be categorized as chronic or episodic; chronic migraine is defined as headaches in the absence of medication overuse, occurring on ≥ 15 days per month for ≥ 3 months, of which headaches on ≥ 8 days must fulfill the criteria for migraine without aura. Prevalence and incidence data for chronic migraine are still uncertain, owing to the heterogeneous definitions used to identify the condition in population-based studies over the past two decades. Chronic migraine is severely disabling and difficult to manage, as affected patients experience substantially more-frequent headaches, comorbid pain and affective disorders, and fewer pain-free intervals, than do those with episodic migraine. Data on the treatment of chronic migraine are scarce because most migraine-prevention trials excluded patients who had headaches for ≥ 15 days per month. Despite this lack of reliable data, a wealth of expert opinion and a few evidence-based treatment options are available for managing chronic migraine. Trial data are available for topiramate and botulinum toxin type A, and expert opinion suggests that conventional preventive therapy for episodic migraine may also be useful. This Review discusses the evolution of our understanding of chronic migraine, including its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical characteristics and treatment options.

### The premonitory phase of migraine and migraine management [^113rb21R]. Cephalalgia (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to determine, through a literature review, whether treatment during the premonitory phase of migraine is a potentially useful migraine management strategy.

Methods

A general literature review was done with regard to the nature of migraine premonitory symptoms, their frequency, their reliability in predicting migraine attacks, and the effectiveness of medication treatment when given during the premonitory phase.

Results

Many different symptoms have been reported as premonitory symptoms that occur before migraine attacks. Up to 87% of patients with migraine may experience premonitory symptoms, although some studies have provided estimates as low as 33%. In selected patients, premonitory symptoms may be relatively reliable predictors of a migraine attack to follow. Both naratriptan (open-label study) and domperidone (double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study) have been reported to be effective when given during the premonitory phase.

Conclusions

More research is needed, but there is some evidence that medication treatment during the premonitory phase has the potential to be helpful in selected patients with migraine.

### Current approaches to the diagnosis and management of paediatric migraine [^113Av279]. The Lancet: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Headache is a common complaint in childhood with up to 75% of children reporting a notable headache by the age of 15 years. Paediatric migraine is the most frequent recurrent headache, occurring in up to 28% of older teenagers. Migraine can have a substantial effect on the life of the child, as well as their family, leading to lost school days and withdrawal from social interactions. Early recognition can lead to successful treatment, improved outcome, and reduced disability. The treatment strategy needs to be multipronged and can include acute therapy (which can vary depending on the severity of the headache), preventive therapy (when the headaches are frequent or causing substantial disability), and biobehavioural therapy (to assist with coping with recurrent headaches). Additional factors can contribute to exacerbations of headaches, including comorbid disorders and pubertal changes, which might lead to the development of menstrual migraine. When all these factors are effectively managed, there should be an improvement in long-term outcome and prevention of disease progression.

### Concomitant anti-CGRP and immunomodulatory treatments in patients with migraine: towards integrated management strategies [^11189T9m]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study provides one of the first systematic evaluations of the concurrent use of CGRP-mAbs and immunological treatments, offering a foundation for future clinical guidelines in patients with neurological and autoimmune conditions. The results show that the combination of CGRP-mAbs therapies with immunological treatments appears effective and safe, offering a promising option for patients with resistant and refractory CM and autoimmune comorbidities. However, the observed trend toward corticosteroid use in active cases calls for cautious, individualized approaches to minimize potential long-term risks. Monoclonal antibody therapies remain a cornerstone of treatment, providing disease stabilization without a significant increase in adverse outcomes. This study also underscores the importance of individualized approaches in managing migraine patients with autoimmune diseases. The overall safety and efficacy of CGRP-mAbs therapies support their continued use in these populations. Future research should focus on identifying biomarkers of response to CGRP-mAbs therapies in autoimmune populations and exploring the mechanisms underlying the interaction between CGRP inhibition and immunomodulatory treatments. Larger cohorts and longer follow-ups are needed to confirm these findings and refine treatment strategies for this complex patient population.

### Setting higher standards for migraine prevention: a position statement of the international headache society [^115AcTQ9]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

Migraine is one of the most prevalent and disabling neurological diseases, significantly affecting quality of life and productivity, as well as contributing to substantial societal costs. Recent innovations, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway inhibitors and onabotulinumtoxinA, have transformed migraine prevention by offering high efficacy and excellent tolerability, thus improving adherence. Clinical trials and real-world studies show that significant reductions in migraine frequency and, in some cases, complete migraine freedom is achievable. In this Position Statement, we advocate for raising the standards of migraine prevention by setting ambitious treatment goals aimed at optimal outcomes, such as migraine freedom or very low number of days with migraine or moderate/severe headache. We emphasize the importance of addressing residual migraine burden, highlighting that achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in monthly migraine days, although often considered a successful response, may not fully restore quality of life. Relying solely on percentage-based improvements can obscure the persisting impact of residual burden. This Position Statement does not want to change the standards for clinical trials but aims primarily at real-world clinical practice and proposes a shift from percentage-based measures of success to absolute goals while on treatment. We outline a framework that categorizes outcomes into four tiers: migraine freedom (no days with migraine or moderate-to-severe headache), optimal control (less than four days with migraine or moderate-to-severe headache), modest control (four to six days with migraine or moderate-to-severe headache) and insufficient control (more than days with migraine or moderate-to-severe headache). Focusing on residual burden while on treatment aims to further improve patient quality of life and drive innovation in preventive therapies and non-pharmacological approaches. By advocating for higher standards, this Position Statement, is not aimed primarily to drive reimbursement policies for migraine preventive treatments, but seeks to inspire clinicians, researchers and policymakers to prioritize ambitious goals in migraine prevention, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and reducing the broader societal and economic impact of this debilitating condition.

### Treatment recommendations for migraine [^116Uedce]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

The pharmacological treatment of migraine can be acute or preventive. Acute treatment attempts to stop the progression of an attack or relieve pain and functional impairment once an attack has begun, whereas preventive therapy is given to reduce attack frequency and severity. Additional benefits of preventive therapy include improving responsiveness to acute attack treatment, and reducing disability. Treatment protocols should also include education and reassurance, avoidance of triggers, nonpharmacological treatments, and physical and/or complementary medicine when appropriate. The treatment plan should be reassessed at regular intervals. Acute attack medication can be specific or nonspecific, and needs to be tailored to the individual patient. Backup and rescue medication should be available in case the initial treatment fails. The route of drug administration depends on attack severity, how rapidly the attack escalates, the patient's preference, the presence or absence of severe nausea or vomiting, and the need for rapid relief. Preventive migraine treatments include beta-blockers, antidepressants, calcium channel antagonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonists, anticonvulsants, and NSAIDs. Preventive treatments are selected on the basis of the drugs' side-effect profiles and the patient's coexistent and comorbid conditions.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^116AKjca]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.2.9. Timing of administration

Recommendations:

1.2.9.1. The timing of acute treatment should be defined in the trial protocol.

1.2.9.2. Usually, participants are instructed to treat when migraine headache pain is of at least moderate intensity, but alternatives include treating as soon as possible after headache onset, treating when pain intensity is mild, and treating when pain intensity is severe.

1.2.9.3. The timing of acute treatment must be consistent with the objectives of the trial.

1.2.9.4. Subjects should record the time and pain intensity at the time of treatment in the trial diary.

Comments:

The head pain of migraine frequently begins with mild intensity, progressively increases with variable speed to a peak, and is followed by resolution; headache pain can also fluctuate spontaneously during a migraine attack. These characteristics can pose challenges regarding the timing of treatment (e.g. early or when the attack is fully developed) and the evaluation of trial results. For example, healthcare providers typically recommend treating early in the course of a migraine attack, while pain intensity is mild, because it can enhance efficacy. At the beginning of an attack, however, migraine without aura can be difficult to distinguish from non-migraine headaches. Thus, subjects in migraine clinical trials who are instructed to treat as soon as possible (i.e. at the first sign of migraine) may mistakenly treat other headache types. The potential for confusion is mitigated when attacks are allowed to fully develop. Having subjects wait until pain intensity is moderate or severe before treating increases the specificity of migraine diagnoses. Yet because this strategy conflicts with common clinical advice about early treatment, it is essential that participants in clinical trials receive clear instruction about when to use acute treatment. In later stages of development, depending on the specific objectives of the program, trials evaluating early intervention and treatment when headache pain intensity is severe (e.g. for early morning migraine) are encouraged when investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of new treatments.

### Patients' decision-making for migraine and chronic daily headache management. A qualitative study [^1128vgcC]. Cephalalgia (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to gain insight into the patients' decision-making for migraine and chronic daily headache management. Patients were recruited by theoretical sampling in Surrey (UK). Semi-structured and tape-recorded interviews (n = 13) were conducted, transcribed verbatim, coded and analysed according to the grounded theory methodology. Thirteen patients (8 migraine and 5 chronic daily headache) described their management. All patients employed multiple behaviours to manage their headaches. From the patients' descriptions emerged their decision-making. Based on experience, perceptions and new information, the decision-making process involved four stages: headache severity, evaluation, decision making and behaviours. Although the participants were passive with regards to certain management strategies, overall they were actively involved in treating and preventing their headaches. Furthermore, they were active decision-makers in choosing appropriate management. Migraine and chronic daily headache patients are actively involved in managing their headaches. They are key decision-makers and should not be overlooked as a resource for effective management.

### Risk factors for migraine disease progression: a narrative review for a patient-centered approach [^116mHKoh]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential protective actions to attempt to prevent progression

The identification of modifiable predictors of migraine progression is an important first step towards developing targeted interventions that protect against progression. While associations between modifiable risk factors and disease progression suggest the possibility of intervention to prevent progression, this has yet to be rigorously confirmed conclusively in clinical trials for most risk factors.

Protective actions for the five domains of risk factors include acute and preventive treatment optimization (including pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies), comorbidity management when possible, and lifestyle management (Table 1). The recommendations provided here are based on various levels of published evidence and expert opinion. For some interventions, there is published literature supporting the recommendations; for others, actions are less substantiated by the literature but are guided by best clinical practice based on expert opinion.

When assessing a patient's risk profile for migraine progression, it is important to include the patient as a partner in developing a management approach. Clinicians should consider the evidence supporting that the intervention may modify progression risk coupled with the patient's willingness, motivation, and expressed interest or agreement in participating. Thus, a patient-centered approach that emphasizes both physical and psychological well-being can improve treatment adherence, outcomes, and patient satisfaction. Multidisciplinary support including non-pharmacologic therapies for those with more frequent migraine should be offered to support lifestyle and comorbidity management when appropriate as well as for the behavioral management of migraine.

Protective actions for migraine disease and treatment-related risk factors

There are several protective actions that can be applied to many risk factors associated with migraine burden and treatment, which are likely to reduce the risk of migraine disease progression. Acute treatment optimization, addressing acute medication overuse, and considering pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic preventive therapies when appropriate should be prioritized, as suboptimal acute treatment is a strong risk factor for migraine disease progression as detailed earlier. However, a longitudinal relationship has not yet been demonstrated conclusively between improvements in optimization and reduction in risk of new-onset CM in a clinical trial.

Optimizing acute and preventive treatment using both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic options can address risk factors — including high numbers of MHDs (≥ 5 for moderate risk and ≥ 10 MHDs for high risk of progression) — alleviate or prevent allodynia, prevent persistent/ frequent nausea by appropriately treating migraine, and more effectively prevent or treat severe migraine symptoms.

### Behavioral therapy in migraine: expanding the therapeutic arsenal [^115Ma4CX]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Several studies have analyzed the potential benefit of different behavioral techniques in migraine treatment or prophylaxis. Contingent negative variation is a method for examining cortical information by processing the application of event‐related potentials. See Table 2 for further information.

TABLE 2
Note about CNV in migraine.

Therefore, lifestyle modifications and migraine trigger identification should be discussed with migraine patients. Currently, limited published data support the finding that lifestyle modifications and avoidance of triggers are effective in reducing migraine burden. It is usually recommended to be added to the pharmacological treatment due to the small risk for the patient. However, some authors conclude that incorporating MF training into usual treatment improves short‐term efficacy. There is an unmet need to implement widely for migraine care available feasible nonpharmacological approaches.

The aim of this article is to review the knowledge obtained from 2011 to 2020 on BT in the treatment, attack management, and prevention of migraine. As we know, promoting lifestyle changes and managing migraine symptoms with a better understanding of these therapies could possibly help us to discover new therapeutic paths or even future treatment targets. In this sense, the present review will address the different types of BT, together with the key factors to take into consideration to identify the most suitable patients for this approach. With the aim of identifying the most suitable patients, we will analyze three main factors: patient profile, burden of migraine, and comorbidities.

### The role of general practitioners in migraine management [^116cBihY]. Cephalalgia (2008). Low credibility.

General practitioners (GPs) play a pivotal role in managing migraine and ensuring that patients have a positive first experience when seeking treatment. A large proportion of migraineurs do not consult a GP, preferring to rely on over-the-counter remedies to reduce pain and disability. For those who do consult, receiving a satisfactory outcome at their first consultation is important for ensuring subsequent effective management of their migraine. If patient expectations are not met at their first visit (prescribed treatment is ineffective or GP does not empathize with their suffering), patients may not return for further consultation. There remains a need to improve migraine diagnosis and treatment, and GPs require continuing medical education and neurologist support to ensure that they are providing the best migraine treatments and outcomes. More widespread use of diagnostic tools, standardized management guidelines and individualized treatment regimens will help GPs successfully manage both migraine symptoms and patient expectations.

### Effect of preventive (beta blocker) treatment, behavioural migraine management, or their combination on outcomes of optimised acute treatment in frequent migraine: randomised controlled trial [^115tpYdJ]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is common, affecting approximately 14% of women and 6% of men worldwide; around a third (31%) of these people report frequent migraines defined as three or more attacks a month. Migraine causes severe impairment or bed rest in more than half (57%) of affected people, markedly impairs quality of life both during and between attacks, increases absenteeism and reduces productivity at work, and is associated with increased healthcare costs. Frequent migraine is also a risk factor for progression from episodic migraine to chronic migraine (at least 15 headache days a month), which commonly presents as debilitating daily or near daily headaches. Recent findings suggest that frequent migraines are associated with structural changes in the brain. The personal, family, and societal impact of frequent migraines, plus the high risk of disease progression and possible neurodegenerative changes in the brain, have led to calls for more aggressive management of frequent migraine in primary care.

Although frequent migraine is most often treated in primary care, management seems to be problematic. This may reflect the fact that the management of frequent migraine can be challenging in primary care, needing drugs for acute treatment and for prevention, as well as changes in patients' behaviour.

The average reduction in migraines of 40–50% seen in trials of preventive drug treatment is clinically meaningful but only moderate in magnitude. Limitations of the evidence base for preventive drugs include the predominance of short term (six months or less) trials, dropout rates that approach 50% of randomised participants at the primary end point, and the lack of trials comparing different preventive treatments. Behavioural migraine management uses relaxation, thermal biofeedback, stress management, and other behavioural interventions to teach skills for regulating physiological, mental, and behavioural responses to prevent, abort, and cope with migraines. The average reduction in migraines of 40–50% seen in trials of behavioural migraine management closely parallels results obtained in trials of preventive drugs. Limitations of the evidence base for behavioural treatments include the predominance of small trials, the few placebo controlled trials, and the lack of trials that compare behavioural interventions with preventive drugs.

Conclusions

Migraine is a common, chronic neurovascular disorder of the brain with cranial autonomic findings. It is characterized by recurrent, severe attacks of headaches often associated with other symptoms and much disability, as well as personal, familial and societal impact. Currently, there only are a limited number of preventive treatments for migraine worldwide, and they often are ineffective and cause AEs leading to low retention rates. Better therapies are badly needed. CGRP-mAbs to the ligand and receptor display at least, if not greater, comparable efficacy to the currently available oral therapies, with better safety data and perhaps adherence in phase 2 trials. Neurostimulation also appears promising, despite the limited evidence. Both monoclonal antibodies and neurostimulation appear to offer effective, novel management for migraine prevention and acute care of chronic cluster headache. We look forward to further results of these above therapies.

Key points

The past decade has brought groundbreaking advances in the treatment of migraine and other headache disorders.
Novel therapies for migraine target the CGRP pathway, 5‐HT receptor subsets, and/or neuromodulation that interrupt the neurophysiologic mechanisms of the migraine attack.
Newer therapies in migraine have resulted from further understanding of migraine pathophysiology and may prove to be useful in the future treatment of Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS) due to the potential overlap in the pathophysiology of the two diseases.

Pharmacological and interventional strategies of migraine prevention

Migraine prevention is an important component of therapy aimed at reducing the attack frequency and severity. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of action of current preventives are not well understood. A potential mechanism is the inhibition of cortical spreading depression but, as noted above, the efficacy against cortical spreading depression does not necessarily predict the efficacy in treating migraine without aura. Substances that have proven beneficial in migraine, with and without aura, broadly comprise compounds from the following classes: beta-blockers (for example, propranolol), antidepressants (for example, amitriptyline), anticonvulsants (for example, valproate, topiramate), calcium channel blockers (for example, flunarizine) and serotonin antagonists (for example, methysergide). According to the pathophysiological concepts discussed above, these drugs most probably target the activity of modulatory circuits as well as the neuronal activity in afferent sensory pathways such as the trigeminal system. Although many patients can be effectively managed using the available substances, side effects and contraindications because of co-morbidities can complicate treatment. A particular problem is the prediction of which patients will respond to which substance as treatment is often largely conducted by trial and error, which is frustrating for the patients and treating physicians alike. In order to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms of the action of the available substances, phenotype-driven treatment approaches as well as pharmacogenomic considerations, might help to overcome such issues. Moreover, newer treatment strategies, such as the use of Botulinum toxin in migraine prevention, are currently undergoing clinical trials (Table 1). Interventional neuromodulational approaches are also promising, including the stimulation of the occipital nerve, where functional imaging studies show that the central processing of pain signals in migraine in the thalamus may be modified by such therapies. Studies, such as ONSTIM and PRISM, are now complete with their implications being analysed (PRISM NCT00286078 and). This exciting and developing area might be especially helpful in the treatment of medically refractory patients.

### Calcitonin gene-related peptide-targeted therapy in migraine: current role and future perspectives [^117Ht1as]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Almost 40 years ago, the discovery of the vasoactive neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its role in migraine pathophysiology ushered in a new era in migraine treatment. Since 2018, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the CGRP pathway are available for migraine prevention. The approval of these drugs marks a pioneering development, as they are the first pharmacological agents specifically tailored for migraine prevention. Introduction of these agents contrasts the historical reliance on traditional preventive medications initially formulated for other indications and later repurposed for migraine therapy. Although the emergence of evidence on the efficacy and safety of CGRP-targeted mAbs has raised the bar for treatment success in migraine, their efficacy in other headache entities, such as cluster headache, is low to moderate. Small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists called gepants have also been proven to be effective both as acute and preventive migraine treatments. Furthermore, these agents have bridged the traditional categories of acute and preventive treatment strategies. Short-term prevention and treatment during the prodromal phase of migraine represent emerging strategies enabling clinicians to develop treatment approaches designed to meet changing patient needs; however, these strategies still require more formal evidence. Although solid data have been gathered, further research concerning the efficacy and long-term safety of drugs targeting the CGRP pathway and robust pharmacoeconomic evaluations are needed. Finally, randomised withdrawal and switching studies would facilitate the formulation of evidence-based guidance for the discontinuation of and switching between drugs targeting the CGRP pathway.

### Quality improvement in neurology: headache quality measurement set [^116srf3U]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Headache quality measurement set — conclusions and scope: These quality measures provide assessment tools for the appropriate care of patients with headache disorders, including migraine and cluster headache, and were designed to be flexible and patient-centered. Aside from including an assessment of migraine attack frequency, the set does not include standardized disability assessments due to the lack of a uniform, feasible approach for standardized implementation in clinical practice, while still allowing measurement of contemporary practice including evidence-based treatments such as novel pharmaceuticals, neuromodulation, and behavioral therapies. The work group retired a number of measures from the 2015 set, and others have been reorganized into more consolidated or paired measures. The group noted that disproportionate emphasis on acute medication overuse in previous measures could inadvertently lead to perverse incentives; acute medication overuse is a controversial topic, its persistence may be related to underutilization of pharmacological and nonpharmacological preventive therapies, and many preventive therapies have evidence for effectiveness even when overuse is present, although primary analyses are limited. Measures for cervicogenic headache were not included because a clear consensus on study, assessment, and treatment is lacking. Ongoing and future studies, including selection of specific acute and preventive therapies in adult and pediatric populations and appropriate management strategies for acute medication overuse in people with migraine, will influence revisions, and these measures will require revision in future years as treatment advances continue to develop rapidly.

### Acupuncture versus standard medical care in the prophylactic treatment of migraine: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112f6Fwt]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

The synthesis of available evidence suggests that acupuncture can be added to the therapeutic toolkit for patients with migraine. However, it should be emphasized that acupuncture should not be proposed as a replacement for other pharmacological preventive therapies, which are considered effective and often decisive for patients. Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety profile of acupuncture should still be highlighted, and it can be offered as an adjunctive therapy for patients or as an alternative treatment when conventional therapies cannot be used.

This systematic review and meta‐analysis, as compared to others, includes only studies comparing acupuncture and drugs in the prophylactic management of migraine, without considering the role of acupuncture as an acute treatment for migraine. Given the extreme heterogeneity of the studies in this field, with outcomes that are highly variable and difficult to compare, separating the treatment of the acute phase from the preventive phase is essential to provide clarity. Furthermore, we used a search string that included all pharmacological therapies currently used for prevention and authorized by the guidelines, including CGRP‐targeting pharmacological therapies, which have not been considered as comparators so far. Findings suggest that the effects of acupuncture and its tolerability are sustained over time, indicating that it can be used long‐term by patients for both episodic and chronic forms.

### Calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists for the prevention of migraine: highlights from pivotal studies and the clinical relevance of this new drug class [^112LpM1z]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: To review the new drug class of calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists (monoclonal antibodies) and their clinical relevance in migraine prophylaxis. Data Sources: A literature search was performed in PubMed (January 2009 to November 2019) using the terms migraine, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab for clinical trials and studies. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Reports from human studies in English were evaluated for clinical evidence supporting pharmacology, efficacy, and adverse events. Initial pharmacokinetic and preclinical studies were excluded. Data Synthesis: In chronic and episodic migraine, prophylaxis with injections of monoclonal antibodies antagonizing CGRP reduced monthly migraine days with minimal clinically significant adverse events. In addition, there is evidence supporting efficacy in refractory migraine despite optimal prophylaxis. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This is the first target-specific migraine prophylaxis treatment to show efficacy with minimal adverse effects. A higher drug cost is a barrier but is balanced by improved quality of life. Current therapies have limited efficacy and tolerability because of poor side effect profiles. CGRP antagonists represent a shift to more precise migraine treatments. Conclusions: Monoclonal antibodies inhibiting CGRP are effective in migraine prophylaxis with minimal adverse effects. Targeting CGRP is a novel clinical strategy in managing migraine.

### Behavioral therapy in migraine: expanding the therapeutic arsenal [^111feyp4]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

The US Headache Consortium developed evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of migraine and found grade A evidence in support of behavior therapy (BT). Understanding the mechanisms of BT may improve the management of migraine and reduce its burden.

Methods

We performed a narrative review to define the current evidence of BT and determine its usefulness in migraine management.

Results

The information was obtained from 116 publications, with 56 of them retrieved through direct searches in PubMed (2011–2020) and the remainder selected by the authors to complete the content. BT might reduce migraine impact by decreasing the sympathetic nervous system's response to stress and increasing pain tolerance. Acting in headache-related surroundings can be improved, together with headache duration and self-efficacy. Applications such as mobile health and electronic health applications can help to carry out healthier lifestyle patterns. Regarding medication overuse, BT seems to be a good choice, with similar results to pharmacological prophylaxis. Advantages of using BT are the lack of adverse effects and the unrestricted use in children, where BT is postulated to be even more effective than the standardized pharmacopeia.

Conclusions

BT is an interesting tool that can be used as an add-on therapy in migraine. Through BT, the autonomy and empowerment of migraine patients is enhanced. BT may not cure migraine, but it could help to reduce pain severity perception, disability, and migraine impact, adding an emotive and cognitive approach to the perceptive role of pharmacopeia. Thus, a better approach in migraine, implementing specific therapeutic management, can improve migraine control.

### A pilot study of cognitive behavioural therapy and relaxation for migraine headache: a randomised controlled trial [^117PDuVp]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Migraine headache is the third most prevalent condition and seventh highest among specific causes of disability, globally. In the UK, 18% of women and 8% of men suffer from migraine. Personal, social and work life can be severely affected, with quality of life, both during and between attacks, substantially reduced. Service and social costs are also high, and increase with symptom severity.

Current standard treatment for migraine headache is medication. However, high levels of psychological comorbidity has led to migraine becoming more commonly viewed as a biopsychosocial condition, influenced by cognitive, emotional and environmental factors, as well as biological. Of the 4% of people who consult their family doctor for headache, 28% have clinically significant levels of anxiety or depression. Headache is the most common reason for referral to neurology, with those referred showing higher levels of anxiety about their headache symptoms and consulting more frequently than patients managed in primary care. Lifestyle factors, such as stress and sleep quality, can contribute significantly to onset and course of headaches, and management of these factors, including identification of environmental triggers, is increasingly important in the treatment of migraine. Viewing headache in a biopsychosocial framework introduces the possible utilisation of psychological treatment options, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), relaxation and biofeedback. These treatments allow patients to develop preventative and acute management strategies, such as trigger identification, modification of maladaptive inter-related thoughts, feelings and behaviours surrounding headache, as well as physiological auto-regulation strategies. Reviews of randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of behavioural treatments found a 32% reduction in headache frequency compared to 5% in controls. Furthermore, Holroyd et al. found that combining a behavioural treatment programme with prophylactic drug treatment was more effective in reducing migraine frequency than either of the two treatments presented on their own. Relaxation and CBT treatments when delivered separately have been found to show similar effectiveness in treating headache, and minimal contact sessions, combined with written material and audiotapes, can achieve outcomes as good as more intensive and expensive treatments.

### Update on the management of migraine headaches… [^116wc8gq]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

The severity of attacks and the related symptoms vary widely among patients. The importance of individualizing therapy to the specific needs of each patient is emphasized in a recent review by Silberstein. Accurately diagnosing the condition, educating patients, and identifying comorbidities are essential steps in the management of migraine. Headache diaries can validate the pattern of attacks and help the physician develop treatment goals. Headache severity and disability scales, such as the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale or the Headache Impact Test, can be used to quantify headache morbidity and stratify patients for treatment. Screening patients with migraine for conditions of increased prevalence facilitates patient care and helps the physician select antimigraine treatment with specific characteristics to ameliorate comorbid conditions.

Specific treatment of migraine is available to manage acute attacks and reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Many patients benefit from a combination of acute and prophylactic therapy. Nonspecific treatments include analgesics and antiemetics to combat the most troublesome symptoms for patients with mild to moderate migraine. Evidence supports the use of aspirin and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with or without caffeine, to relieve symptoms of acute migraine. Nonoral administration may be useful because of vomiting and delayed gastric absorption during migraine attacks. In general, prophylactic therapy should begin at a low dose and increase slowly until therapeutic effect or side effects are significant. An appropriate trial of prophylaxis requires several months at the full therapeutic dosage. Patients often benefit from a combination of medication and non-pharmacologic interventions in migraine prophylaxis. Antidepressants are useful in patients with depression and certain anxiety disorders in addition to migraine, but only amitriptyline has evidence for prophylaxis of migraine. Patients taking effective dosages should be cautioned about dry mouth, weight gain, sedation, and other potential side effects. Less common prophylactic agents for migraine are riboflavin in dosages of at least 400 mg per day, butterbur, coenzyme Q10, and feverfew. Injections of botulinum toxin also have been reported to reduce migraine over a 90-day period. The most effective migraine prophylactic, methysergide, causes endocardial or retroperitoneal fibrosis in rare cases. Because of these and other complications, a four-week drug-free interval is recommended after six months of treatment.
