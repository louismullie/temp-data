## Question

How long can you keep an NG tube in for feeding purposes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long an NG tube can remain in place for feeding and what factors influence that duration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes an NG tube and the typical indications for its use. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about expected duration thresholds for nasoenteric versus percutaneous access. Next, I will review condition-specific contexts where NG feeding is used and how long it tends to continue. After that, I should examine practical, patient-specific modifiers that can extend or shorten NG use. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically grounded recommendation and safety checks that align with best practice.

> Let me first confirm the basics. An NG tube is a short-term enteral access device placed transnasally into the stomach for delivering nutrition, and it is intended for temporary use rather than as a permanent feeding solution, with gastric placement confirmed before initiating feeds [^112EGv9d] [^112ERS2F].

> Now, I need to check the core duration thresholds. Multiple society guidelines converge on a 4–6 week window as the appropriate upper limit for nasoenteric tubes (NG or NJ), beyond which a percutaneous device (PEG or PEJ) is generally indicated to mitigate cumulative risks and device-related morbidity, with ACG, ASPEN, and AGA all supporting this short-term designation and the need to transition thereafter [^114StY1x] [^116H8LMQ] [^116ev9YN] [^1115a5Ga].

> Hold on, let me verify why the 4–6 week cutoff matters clinically. Prolonged NG use increases risks such as nares erosion, sinusitis, esophageal ulceration or stricture, aspiration events, and tube dislodgement, and the balance of benefit versus risk shifts toward percutaneous access after this period. Also, NG tubes are more prone to dislodgement and delivery failures than PEG, which is one reason longer-term plans favor percutaneous routes when feasible [^114StY1x] [^114F4Pt4].

> Next, I should review condition-specific durations to see if real-world use aligns with guidelines. In severe acute pancreatitis, nasogastric enteral feeding is acceptable and safe when enteral nutrition is indicated, but many patients transition to percutaneous access if prolonged support is needed, consistent with the 4+ week threshold concept and supported by contemporary pancreatitis guidance allowing NG or NJ routes with attention to tolerance and aspiration risk [^116SmxmR] [^114H6wsC] [^1118bM6y].

> Let me consider acute ischemic stroke as another anchor condition. Guidelines advise initiating NG feeding in the early phase when dysphagia is present and oral intake is not expected to recover within about 7 days, and if the swallowing impairment persists beyond 2–3 weeks, percutaneous gastrostomy is generally preferred. This reinforces a time-limited trial of NG feeding before transitioning to a durable access device [^112UweT1] [^1122RixT].

> I will now examine head and neck cancer during chemoradiation, where practice often uses a reactive NG strategy. Observational and randomized data show median NG durations around 40–56 days in reactive strategies, with many patients completing therapy without long-term dependence. While this exceeds the lower bound of 4 weeks, it remains within the commonly cited 4–6 week "short-term" window, and clinicians still weigh PEG if prolonged feeding is anticipated or recurrent NG issues occur [^117NUVSH] [^114ifZcU].

> But wait, what about pediatric or neonatal contexts. For preterm infants, NG or orogastric tubes are used for weeks during initial enteral feeding, with the tube weaned as oral feeding competence develops. No rigid time limit is codified, but the principle remains that NG is transitional and removed once oral intake is sufficient, reflecting the broader concept that NG use should be as brief as clinically acceptable [^111BCdsd] [^1129Vriv].

> Let me think about patient-specific modifiers that can extend or shorten NG duration. Poor gastric tolerance may push clinicians toward postpyloric feeding or percutaneous jejunal access rather than persisting with NG, and aspiration risk, recurrent dislodgement, or significant nares discomfort can justify earlier transition; conversely, when a patient is expected to resume oral intake imminently, extending NG a bit beyond 4 weeks may be reasonable, provided risks are monitored and mitigated [^112ERS2F] [^112yHzsT].

> I should double-check device and care considerations that affect safe duration. Accurate placement confirmation, securement strategies, and vigilance for displacement are essential; in higher-risk patients or those needing frequent replacement, a nasal bridle can reduce dislodgement and prolong effective use without increasing harm, which may indirectly allow safe continuation closer to the 6-week boundary when clinically necessary [^116QNZXx] [^113nzYs7].

> Synthesizing this, the clinically sound answer is that an NG tube is appropriate for approximately 4–6 weeks as a short-term solution, with a strong default to transition to a percutaneous gastrostomy or jejunostomy if feeding is anticipated beyond that horizon. Many patients in real-world cohorts complete 4–8 weeks of NG feeding in select contexts, but extending beyond 6 weeks should be the exception, justified by imminent oral recovery or temporary logistical barriers to PEG placement, and accompanied by close monitoring for complications and a low threshold to convert [^116ev9YN] [^116H8LMQ] [^114StY1x] [^117NUVSH] [^114ifZcU].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical steps are explicit. Reassess the need and route weekly as the clinical course evolves, secure the tube to minimize dislodgement, confirm position whenever there is concern, and if duration is likely to exceed 4–6 weeks, proactively plan percutaneous access to avoid cumulative NG-related morbidity. These steps align with consensus safe practices and stroke and pancreatitis pathways emphasizing timely NG initiation and timely transition when needs persist [^111uxcDc] [^116QNZXx] [^112UweT1] [^116SmxmR].

---

For feeding purposes, NG tubes are generally left in place for **4–6 weeks** [^116ev9YN] as a short-term solution, with percutaneous gastrostomy considered if feeding is expected beyond this period [^116H8LMQ] [^1115a5Ga]. If prolonged use is anticipated, **switch to a gastrostomy** to reduce complications such as nasal erosion, sinusitis, and aspiration risk [^114StY1x]. Routine replacement is not required unless there is blockage, dislodgement, or infection; monitor for complications and confirm placement before use [^112ERS2F] [^116UBiHN].

## Indications for NG tube feeding

NG tube feeding is indicated for **short-term nutritional support** in patients who cannot meet their nutritional needs orally. Common indications include:

- **Dysphagia**: Due to neurological conditions (e.g. stroke, Parkinson's disease) or mechanical obstruction [^1122RixT].

- **Critical illness**: Patients in intensive care units who require enteral nutrition [^112yHzsT].

- **Postoperative care**: Temporary feeding support after head and neck surgeries or other procedures affecting oral intake.

- **Malnutrition**: Patients with acute or chronic malnutrition who cannot consume adequate oral intake [^117WLGeg].

---

## Recommended duration of NG tube feeding

The recommended duration of NG tube feeding varies based on the patient's clinical condition, nutritional needs, and tolerance. General guidelines include:

- **Short-term use**: NG tubes are typically used for short-term feeding, generally up to 4–6 weeks [^116ev9YN] [^116H8LMQ].

- **Long-term use**: If enteral feeding is anticipated for longer than 4–6 weeks, a percutaneous enteral access device (e.g. gastrostomy tube) is generally recommended [^114StY1x] [^1115a5Ga].

- **Individualized assessment**: The decision to continue or discontinue NG feeding should be reassessed regularly based on the patient's clinical status, nutritional goals, and tolerance [^111uxcDc].

---

## Risks and complications of prolonged NG tube feeding

Prolonged NG tube feeding is associated with several **risks and complications**, including:

- **Nasal irritation and erosion**: Prolonged use can cause nasal mucosal irritation, ulceration, and erosion [^114StY1x].

- **Sinusitis**: Chronic nasal irritation may lead to sinus infections [^114StY1x].

- **Aspiration pneumonia**: Risk of aspiration increases with prolonged use, particularly in patients with impaired swallowing or reflux [^114StY1x].

- **Tube blockage and dislodgement**: Frequent blockage or accidental dislodgement may necessitate replacement [^116up18R].

- **Gastroesophageal reflux**: Prolonged NG feeding may exacerbate reflux symptoms [^114yBgtN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Several clinical guidelines provide recommendations on the **duration and management** of NG tube feeding:

- **American College of Gastroenterology (ACG)**: Recommends NG or orogastric tubes for initial short-term enteral access, with transition to percutaneous enteral access if feeding is anticipated beyond 4–6 weeks [^114StY1x] [^112ERS2F].

- **American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN)**: Emphasizes selecting enteral access devices based on anticipated duration of feeding, recommending short-term nasoenteric tubes for up to 4–6 weeks and long-term devices for longer durations [^116ev9YN] [^116H8LMQ].

- **American Gastroenterological Association (AGA)**: Suggests nasogastric or nasoenteral routes for short-term feeding, with percutaneous access considered for longer-term needs [^1115a5Ga].

---

## Factors influencing duration of NG tube feeding

The duration of NG tube feeding is influenced by several **patient-specific factors**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on duration** |
|-|-|
| Clinical condition | Severity of underlying illness, presence of dysphagia, and nutritional status significantly impact duration [^112UweT1] [^112ERS2F]. |
| Patient tolerance | Tolerance to NG feeding, occurrence of complications, and patient comfort influence continued use [^114F4Pt4]. |
| Nutritional goals | Achievement of nutritional targets and patient recovery influence the decision to discontinue NG feeding [^112EGv9d] [^1129Vriv]. |
| Alternative feeding methods | Availability and suitability of alternative feeding methods (e.g. gastrostomy) influence the duration of NG feeding [^1115a5Ga]. |

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Regular monitoring and reassessment are essential to ensure safe and effective NG tube feeding. Key aspects include:

- **Tube placement confirmation**: Regularly confirm tube placement using pH testing or radiographic imaging, especially after repositioning or if there is suspicion of displacement [^112ERS2F] [^116UBiHN].

- **Nutritional monitoring**: Regularly assess nutritional status, tolerance, and complications [^111uxcDc].

- **Patient comfort and complications**: Monitor for nasal irritation, sinusitis, aspiration, and other complications [^114StY1x].

---

## Transition to alternative feeding methods

When NG tube feeding is anticipated to exceed 4–6 weeks, or if complications arise, **transition to alternative feeding methods** is recommended:

- **Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)**: Commonly used for long-term enteral feeding, providing a more stable and comfortable access route [^1115a5Ga].

- **Jejunostomy tubes**: Considered in patients with gastric outlet obstruction, severe reflux, or high aspiration risk [^1118bM6y].

- **Oral feeding**: Gradual transition to oral feeding is recommended once the patient can safely swallow and meet nutritional needs orally [^117PcKiV].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Short-term use**: NG tubes are appropriate for short-term feeding, typically up to 4–6 weeks [^116ev9YN].

- **Long-term use**: If feeding is anticipated beyond 4–6 weeks, transition to percutaneous enteral access (e.g. gastrostomy) is recommended [^114StY1x].

- **Regular reassessment**: Continuously reassess patient condition, tolerance, and nutritional goals to guide duration and transition decisions [^111uxcDc].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor for complications and confirm tube placement to ensure safe feeding [^112ERS2F].

---

NG tube feeding is intended for **short-term nutritional support**, typically up to 4–6 weeks. Prolonged use increases the risk of complications, so transition to alternative feeding methods should be considered if longer-term support is anticipated.

### Rivaroxaban [^1151RfCo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Discontinuation for Surgery and Other Interventions

If anticoagulation must be discontinued to reduce the risk of bleeding with surgical or other procedures, rivaroxaban tablets should be stopped at least 24 hours before the procedure to reduce the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In deciding whether a procedure should be delayed until 24 hours after the last dose of rivaroxaban tablets, the increased risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention. Rivaroxaban tablets should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established, noting that the time to onset of therapeutic effect is short [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If oral medication cannot be taken during or after surgical intervention, consider administering a parenteral anticoagulant.

2.5 Missed Dose

Adults

For patients receiving 2.5 mg twice daily: if a dose is missed, the patient should take a single 2.5 mg rivaroxaban tablet dose as recommended at the next scheduled time.

On the following day, the patient should continue with their regular regimen.

2.6 Administration Options

For adult patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, rivaroxaban tablets may be crushed and mixed with applesauce immediately prior to use and administered orally. Administration with food is not required for the 2.5 mg tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Administration of Rivaroxaban Tablets via Nasogastric (NG) Tube or Gastric Feeding Tube: After confirming gastric placement of the tube, rivaroxaban tablets may be crushed and suspended in 50 mL of water and administered via an NG tube or gastric feeding tube. Since rivaroxaban absorption is dependent on the site of drug release, avoid administration of rivaroxaban tablets distal to the stomach which can result in reduced absorption and thereby, reduced drug exposure. Enteral feeding is not required following administration of the 2.5 mg tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Crushed rivaroxaban tablets are stable in water and in applesauce for up to 4 hours. An in vitro compatibility study indicated that there is no adsorption of rivaroxaban from a water suspension of a crushed rivaroxaban tablets to PVC or silicone nasogastric (NG) tubing.

### Nasogastric feeding tubes from a neonatal department yield high concentrations of potentially pathogenic bacteria-even 1 D after insertion [^111tPjuM]. Pediatric Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm infants are vulnerable to pathogens and at risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or sepsis. Nasogastric feeding tubes (NG-tubes) might contaminate feeds given through them due to biofilm formation. We wanted to determine if there is a rationale in replacing NG-tubes more often to reduce contamination.

Methods

We conducted an observational study of used NG-tubes from a tertiary neonatal department. After removal, we flushed a 1-ml saline solution through the tube, determined the density of bacteria by culture, and related it to the duration of use and any probiotic administration through the tube.

Results

Out of the 94 NG-tubes, 89% yielded more than 1,000 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml bacteria, and 55% yielded the potentially pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae and/or Staphylococcus aureus. The mean concentration in the yield was 5.3 (SD: 2.1, maximum 9.4) log10CFU/ml. Neither the presence of contamination nor the density was associated with the time the NG-tube had been in use. Probiotic administration did not protect against contamination.

Conclusion

NG-tubes yielded high densities of bacteria even within the first day of use. Further studies are needed to determine if changing the NG-tubes between meals or once a day will make a positive impact on tube contamination and clinical parameters.

Long-term enteral access — gastrostomy preference and NG vs PEG outcomes: The use of gastrostomy tubes (balloon and nonballoon tubes) has become routine practice worldwide and is currently the method of choice for medium-term and long-term enteral feeding. In studies of adult patients with persistent dysphagia due to neurological disease randomly assigned to feedings via NG or PEG tube placement, patients with PEG tubes gained more weight and missed fewer feedings, and NG-fed patients received significantly less because of tube difficulties; in one study that allowed crossover for repeated NG tube difficulties, only 1 of 19 patients had an NG tube in place for 4 weeks.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic enteral access: commentary [^1115a5Ga]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Endoscopic enteral access — route selection by anticipated duration states that in nonintubated patients the nasal route is preferred for short-term (< 4 weeks) enteral access, whereas percutaneous tube placement is typically reserved for those expected to require enteral access for 4 or more weeks; despite lower dislodgement and greater adequacy and duration of feeding with percutaneous devices compared with NG tubes, the added risk supports choosing nasoenteral (NG or NJ) tubes for short-term use.

### Gastric cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1133HHjb]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Gastric cancer — principles of radiation therapy supportive therapy includes: Treatment interruptions or dose reductions for manageable acute toxicities should be avoided, and careful patient monitoring and aggressive supportive care are preferable to treatment interruptions. During a radiation treatment course, patients should be seen for a status check at least once a week with notation of vital signs, weight, and blood counts. Antiemetics should be given on a prophylactic basis, and antacid and antidiarrheal medications may be prescribed when needed. If estimated caloric intake is < 1500 kcal/day, oral and/or enteral nutrition should be considered; when indicated, feeding J-tubes or nasogastric feeding tubes may be placed to ensure adequate caloric intake, and during surgery, a J-tube may be placed for postoperative nutritional support. Adequate enteral and/or IV hydration is necessary during chemoradiation and recovery. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes: summary and recommendations [^114WNU1x]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Enteral nutrition timing after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement — Given the lack of significant difference in outcomes between the early and delayed feeding groups, the panel made a recommendation for early (within 4 hours) versus intentionally delayed tube feed initiation after PEG tube placement and rated the evidence as moderate quality. Early tube feeding after PEG tube placement may not be clinically appropriate in certain situations, including severe ileus, obstruction, or bowel ischemia, and in most cases medications may be given immediately through the PEG tube after placement unless there are contraindications to enteral medications. Based on the available evidence, the panel agreed that routine gastric residual measurement is not indicated.

### How often should percutaneous gastrostomy feeding tubes be replaced? A single-institute retrospective study [^117DzK6E]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The limitations of this study included its retrospective design and its sole reliance on medical records; hence, we cannot rule out selection and encoding biases. We also cannot generalise our findings regarding the four different types of PG-related tube groups because the procedures were not assigned randomly. In particular, the PGP and PGB groups had different indications and roles; namely, initial insertion versus replacement. Moreover, we could not assess feeding patterns and caregiver management-related factors, which are important when predicting tube longevity. Additionally, accidental dislodgement, self-removal by patients or spontaneous balloon ruptures/collapses were included in the definition of dislocation, although those incidences can be reduced by using preventive measures such as cautious manoeuvring, patient restraint, and regular balloon check-up. If we excluded incidents of self-removal and family-requested removal, the exchange intervals we calculated would likely be even longer. Another limitation is that we could not compare the several available tube materials except for silicone and certain commercial products, as other types were not available. To validate our data, further randomised studies, which control for patient conditions, caregiver management, standard tube care protocols, and different tubes materials, would be warranted. Despite these limitations, our data were derived from a relatively larger number of cases compared with previous PG-tube patency-related studies published to date.

In conclusion, ours was a unique study that investigated specific parameters such as exchange intervals of silicone tubes, different diameter sizes, and challenges of using nasogastric tubes for gastrojejunal feeding via PG. We found that PGP tubes showed the longest median duration and the highest cost, whereas PGB tubes were cheaper but had shorter durations. Additionally, PGB tubes with larger diameters had longer durations than did those with smaller sizes. Furthermore, PGJL tubes had longer median dwelling times than PGJM tubes among subjects who had a high risk of aspiration; therefore, the Levin tube (which is a commonly used nasogastric tube) can be considered for use as a gastrojejunal feeding tube via PG. Our data ought to provide clinicians with information to support cost-benefit analysis when selecting the optimal type of tube in different clinical situations for purposes of long-term enteral tube feeding.

### Gastrostomy tube use in children with cancer [^111FnKYy]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Children with cancer are at risk of malnutrition, which can impair critical childhood processes of growth and development and contribute to poor health outcomes. Enteral nutrition can effectively ameliorate malnutrition or weight loss in children with cancer; however, published nutrition support algorithms contain minimal specific information on gastrostomy tube use, and current literature is limited. Decisions about gastrostomy tube insertion in children with cancer can be challenging. Consideration of gastrostomy tube insertion is only appropriate in children with long-term dependence on enteral nutrition, particularly when nasogastric tube insertion is predicted or proven to be problematic. Specific indications for patient selection are unclear, and referring clinicians may be unaware of important absolute and relative contraindications. Complications are predominantly minor in nature; however, reported rates are high. Morbidity must be weighed carefully against the need and anticipated duration of enteral nutrition support, and further research in this area is needed.

### ACG clinical guideline: nutrition therapy in the adult hospitalized patient [^114yBgtN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — gastric versus post-pyloric feeding and aspiration risk: Conversion to a post-pyloric feeding tube should be carried out only when gastric feeding has been shown to be poorly tolerated or the patient is at high risk for aspiration (strong recommendation, moderate-to-high level of evidence). Simultaneous aspiration/decompression may be accomplished using a dual lumen aspirated nasoenteric tube, a combined percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy/jejunostomy (GJ) tube, or both gastrostomy and jejunostomy tubes (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). The incidence of reflux, regurgitation, and aspiration all decrease significantly as infusion is diverted from the stomach to the proximal jejunum, and a meta-analysis of 12 RCTs showed a reduction in ventilator-associated pneumonia with small bowel compared with gastric feeding while duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, and mortality did not change. Although gastrointestinal dysfunction occurs in 30–70% of ICU patients, most will tolerate gastric feeding, and small bowel placement may delay initiation because it requires greater expertise.

### Improving safety and timeliness around nasogastric tube feeding on an acute stroke unit [^117B3Vuy]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Limitations

Nutritional initiation time is not the same as NGT insertion time in those without NGT aspirate, who will then have to wait for a radiological confirmation of the tube positioning prior to commencing the NG feed. This part of the process has been mapped and is being reviewed as another improvement journey by our team. The project was undertaken in a single acute stroke unit and currently being scaled up and spread to other acute stroke units outside our organisation to study its potential to improve care on a larger scale. The NGT decision tool we have used would be worth dissemination and has been attached in the online supplemental paper.

### Improving safety and timeliness around nasogastric tube feeding on an acute stroke unit [^111YYyKZ]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Results

The project was able to meet all its aims. We achieved a consistent improvement in time taken from decision-making to NGT insertion from a baseline average of 5.2 hours to 1.7 hours by February 2024, and the new process was more stable with upper control limit reduction from 14.1 hours to 6.7 hours (figure 2). The usage of the NGT decision tool increased from 0% to 80% by February 2024 (figure 3). We learnt that the new process remained stable with a smaller number of deviations from the average line. There was a shift in the control chart to highlight the improvements achieved against each PDSA cycle. As a balancing measure, staff on the ward were asked to complete questionnaire feedback, and 90% agreed that the change in process did not cause additional time wastage and it helped improve patient care and experience by reducing delays in commencing artificial nutrition.

### Enteral feeding in the critically ill: the role of the gastroenterologist [^113LEah1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Expertise in enteral nutrition (EN) is an important aspect of the skill set of the clinical gastroenterologist. Delivery of adequate EN in critically ill patients is an active therapy that attenuates the metabolic response to stress and favorably modulates the immune system. EN is less expensive than parenteral nutrition and is favored in most cases because of improvement in patient outcomes, including infections and length of stay. Newer endoscopic techniques for placing nasoenteric feeding tubes have been developed, which improve placement success and efficiency. It appears that there is an ideal window period of 24–48 h when enteral feeding should be started in critically ill patients. Most patients can be fed into the stomach, but certain groups may benefit from small bowel feeding. Protocols on how to start and monitor enteral feeding have been developed. Immune-modulating feeding formulations also appear to be beneficial in specific patient populations. The gastroenterologist is a crucial member of the multidisciplinary team for nutritional support in the intensive care unit patient, with his knowledge of gastrointestinal pathophysiology, nutrition, and endoscopic feeding-tube placement.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride (Oxaydo) [^115Mbja9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

OXAYDO should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.
Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of OXAYDO for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.
Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.
There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with OXAYDO. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
OXAYDO must be swallowed whole. Take each tablet with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth.
OXAYDO is not amenable to crushing and dissolution. Do not administer OXAYDO via nasogastric, gastric or other feeding tubes as it may cause obstruction of feeding tubes.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes: summary and recommendations [^115RQFrr]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding initiation — Recommendation 3 states that in patients who undergo PEG tube placement, the ASGE recommends that PEG tubes may be used for feeding early (within 4 hours) over routine delays in initiation, with a strong recommendation and low to moderate quality of evidence. For the evidence synthesis, early feeding was defined as initiation at or before 4 hours after PEG tube placement and delayed initiation as over 4 hours, and 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) plus 4 non–randomized controlled comparative studies totaling 1120 patients were identified. All-cause mortality at 30 days was similar based on 2 RCTs: 23.3% for delayed versus 24.6% for early initiation; when 3 observational studies were additionally included, these values were 9.3% versus 12% for delayed versus early initiation. Short-term (< 72 hours) mortality was similar between early and delayed feeding in RCTs (6.7% vs 3.3%) and across all studies (1.3% vs 1.6% for delayed versus early). All studies showed no difference in overall adverse event rate (12.4% vs 12.4%), which was also observed when combining observational studies (15.4% vs 18.4% for delayed versus early feeding).

### Definition of NG tube-NCI dictionary of cancer terms… [^113Kob5G]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

NG tubeListen to pronunciationA tube that is inserted through the nose, down the throat and esophagus, and into the stomach. It can be used to give drugs, liquids, and liquid food, or used to remove substances from the stomach. Giving food through an NG tube is a type of enteral nutrition. Also called gastric feeding tube and nasogastric tube.

### Prophylactic versus reactive (PvR) feeding in patients undergoing (chemo) radiation in head and neck cancers: results of a phase III randomized controlled trial [^111VX4x9]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal feeding strategy (Prophylactic vs. Reactive) during Radiation Therapy (RT) for Head and Neck Cancers (HNC) remains to be established.

Methods

This phase III trial randomized (1:1) patients of HNC to prophylactic [nasogastric tube (NGT) placed at least 1day before RT starting] versus reactive arm (NGT when required). The primary endpoint was the incidence of significant weight loss at 6months. Secondary endpoints were weight changes, tube duration, dependence, and compliance.

Results

Due to high denial rates, the trial was prematurely closed. Eighty-four patients (40-prophylactic, 44-reactive) were analyzed intention-to-treat. Seventeen patients (39%) required a reactive tube insertion. The proportion of patients with significant weight loss at 6months in the prophylactic versus reactive arms was 13 (32.5%) versus 10 (15.9%), p = 0.44. The median tube duration was 56days (IQR: 16.5–91) versus 47days (IQR: 24–59), p = 0.255.

Conclusion

Our limited analysis found that a reactive NGT should be considered for most HNC patients undergoing RT.

### ACG clinical guideline: nutrition therapy in the adult hospitalized patient [^112ERS2F]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG nutrition therapy — enteral access and infusion site in hospitalized adults — a nasogastric or orogastric feeding tube should be used as the initial access device for starting EN in a hospitalized patient (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). Radiologic confirmation of placement in the stomach should be carried out prior to feeding (except with use of electromagnetic transmitter-guided feeding tubes). Repeated periodic/radiologic confirmation of correct tube position in the GI tract is not required unless there is concern for tube displacement because of nausea/vomiting, regurgitation, coughing, retching, or overt displacement (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). Conversion to a post-pyloric feeding tube should be carried out only when gastric feeding has been shown to be poorly tolerated or the patient is at high risk for aspiration (strong recommendation, moderate-to-high level of evidence). Simultaneous aspiration/decompression of the stomach with jejunal feeding may be accomplished by using a dual lumen aspirate/feed nasoenteric tube, a combined percutaneous GJ tube, or the use of both gastrostomy and jejunostomy tubes (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). When long-term enteral access is needed in a patient with gastroparesis or chronic pancreatitis, a jejunostomy tube should be placed (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). A percutaneous enteral access device should be placed, either via the gastric or jejunal route, if enteral feeding is anticipated to be required for greater than 4 weeks duration (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). A percutaneous gastrostomy should be placed preferentially in the gastric antrum in order to facilitate conversion to a GJ tube in the event that the patient is intolerant to gastric feeding (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). For the patient at high risk for tube displacement, steps should be taken proactively to secure the access device at the time of placement (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence).

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes: methodology and review of evidence [^114HvNFJ]. VideoGIE (2025). Medium credibility.

This guideline document was prepared by the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy using the best available scientific evidence and considering a multitude of variables including, but not limited to, adverse events, patients' values, and cost implications. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide the best practice recommendations that may help standardize patient care, improve patient outcomes, and reduce variability in practice.

We recognize that clinical decision-making is complex. Guidelines, therefore, are not a substitute for a clinician's judgment. Such judgments may, at times, seem contradictory to our guidance due to many factors that are impossible to fully consider by guideline developers. Any clinical decisions should be based on the clinician's experience, local expertise, resource availability, and patient values and preferences.

This article is not a rule and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care, or as encouraging, advocating for, mandating, or discouraging any particular treatment. Our guidelines should not be used in support of medical complaints, legal proceedings, and/or litigation, as they were not designed for this purpose.

### The role of endoscopically placed feeding or decompression tubes [^1112vPt6]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The minimally invasive nature of endoscopically placed gastrostomy tubes makes them a viable consideration in palliative care. Complications related to the procedure appear to correlate with age and underlying comorbidities. However, in many instances, the scientific basis for establishing benefit or harm from tube placement is methodologically inadequate. Decisions must be preceded by a discussion of the value and potential risk of artificial nutrition in a particular setting, respecting the wishes and beliefs of each patient and his or her family. The decision to use PEG placement for any reason should be consistent with legal and ethical principles, reflect patient autonomy over any other consideration (including beneficence), and arise from a clear determination of the goals of care (and whether the PEG placement will truly help meet those goals). Whenever possible, further studies with better design are needed to evaluate whether the use of PEG truly affects quality of life and patient outcome in palliative care. PEG tubes for decompression are placed successfully most of the time. Symptom relief occurs usually within 7 days of the procedure. Overall, the morbidity related to the PEG procedure for decompression is only slightly higher than when the same technique is used for nutritional purposes. The appropriate timing for PEG tube placement for nutritional support and for decompression throughout the course of disease progression may be difficult to determine and yet may be a factor in its overall efficiency. Only minor modifications of the basic technique used for PEG placement for nutritional purposes are required to adapt the technique to a variety of other applications in palliative care.

### Continuous nasogastric milk feeding versus intermittent bolus milk feeding for preterm infants less than 1500 grams [^115KbVpK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Milk feedings can be given via nasogastric tube either intermittently, typically over 10 to 20 minutes every two or three hours, or continuously, using an infusion pump. Although the theoretical benefits and risks of each method have been proposed, their effects on clinically important outcomes remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To examine the evidence regarding the effectiveness of continuous versus intermittent bolus tube feeding of milk in preterm infants less than 1500 grams.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to run comprehensive searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 7) in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily and Versions; and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) on 17 July 2020. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs comparing continuous versus intermittent bolus nasogastric milk feeding in preterm infants less than 1500 grams.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed all trials for relevance and risk of bias. We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal to extract data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Primary outcomes were: age at full enteral feedings; feeding intolerance; days to regain birth weight; rate of gain in weight, length and head circumference; and risk of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC).

Main Results

We included nine randomised trials (919 infants) in this updated Cochrane Review. One study is awaiting classification. Seven of the nine included trials reported data from infants with a maximum weight of between 1000 grams and 1400 grams. Two of the nine trials included infants weighing up to 1500 grams. Type(s) of milk feeds varied, including human milk (either mother's own milk or pasteurised donor human milk), preterm formula, or mixed feeding regimens. In some instances, preterm formula was initially diluted. Earlier studies also used water to initiate feedings. We judged six trials as unclear or high risk of bias for random sequence generation. We judged four trials as unclear for allocation concealment. We judged all trials as high risk of bias for blinding of care givers, and seven as unclear or high risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessors. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for imprecision, due to low numbers of participants in the trials, and/or wide 95% confidence intervals, and/or for risk of bias. Continuous compared to intermittent bolus (nasogastric and orogastric tube) milk feeding Babies receiving continuous feeding may reach full enteral feeding almost one day later than babies receiving intermittent feeding (mean difference (MD) 0.84 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.13 to 1.81; 7 studies, 628 infants; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain if there is any difference between continuous feeding and intermittent feeding in terms of number of days of feeding interruptions (MD -3.00 days, 95% CI -9.50 to 3.50; 1 study, 171 infants; very low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain if continuous feeding has any effect on days to regain birth weight (MD -0.38 days, 95% CI -1.16 to 0.41; 6 studies, 610 infants; low-certainty evidence). The certainty of evidence is low and the 95% confidence interval is consistent with possible benefit and possible harm. It is uncertain if continuous feeding has any effect on rate of gain in weight compared with intermittent feeding (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.09, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.46; 5 studies, 433 infants; very low-certainty evidence). Continuous feeding may result in little to no difference in rate of gain in length compared with intermittent feeding (MD 0.02 cm/week, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.08; 5 studies, 433 infants; low-certainty evidence). Continuous feeding may result in little to no difference in rate of gain in head circumference compared with intermittent feeding (MD 0.01 cm/week, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.05; 5 studies, 433 infants; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain if continuous feeding has any effect on the risk of NEC compared with intermittent feeding (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.11; 4 studies, 372 infants; low-certainty evidence). The certainty of evidence is low and the 95% confidence interval is consistent with possible benefit and possible harm.

Authors' Conclusions

Although babies receiving continuous feeding may reach full enteral feeding slightly later than babies receiving intermittent feeding, the evidence is of low certainty. However, the clinical risks and benefits of continuous and intermittent nasogastric tube milk feeding cannot be reliably discerned from current available randomised trials. Further research is needed to determine if either feeding method is more appropriate for the initiation of feeds. A rigorous methodology should be adopted, defining feeding protocols and feeding intolerance consistently for all infants. Infants should be stratified according to birth weight and gestation, and possibly according to illness.

### Does routine nasogastric tube placement after an operation for perforated appendicitis make a difference? [^111u33AY]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Divergent opinions exist regarding the routine use of nasogastric (NG) tubes in the postoperative management of patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Empiric use of an NG tube after abdominal surgery is presumed to prevent abdominal distension, vomiting, and ileus, which may complicate the postoperative course. To investigate the validity of this assumption, we compared the postoperative course of patients who underwent appendectomy for perforated appendicitis who subsequently either had or did not have an NG tube placed postoperatively.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of all children operated for perforated appendicitis between 1999 and 2004 was performed. Patients with prolonged hospitalizations were excluded to eliminate bias created by patients with multiple operations and opportunities for NG placement. The use of an NG tube, time to first and to full oral feeds, length of hospitalization, and complications were compared between groups.

Results

Patients with NG tubes left in place (N = 105) were compared with those who did not receive an NG tube (N = 54) following appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. Mean time to first oral intake was 3.8 d in those with NG tubes compared with 2.2 d in those without NG tubes (P < 0.001). Similarly, mean time to full feeds was 4.9 d when an NG tube was left compared with 3.4 d in those without tubes (P < 0.001). Mean length of stay was 6.0 d in those with NG tubes compared to 5.6 d in those without (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

The use of NG decompression after an operation for perforated appendicitis does not appear to improve the postoperative course and we recommend that it is not routinely used in this patient population.

### Improving the documentation of nasogastric tube insertion and adherence to local enteral nutrition guidelines [^116HnNFY]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) has issued guidance to NHS organisations in England and Wales, relating to adults, children and infants, entitled "Reducing the harm caused by misplaced nasogastric feeding tubes". This was followed in 2011 by an update in response to further clinical incidents. In 2005, the NPSA stated that 11 deaths and one case of serious harm due to misplaced nasogastric (NG) tubes had occurred over a two-year period. The 2011 NPSA update revealed that the NPSA's National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) had received reports of a further 21 deaths and 79 cases of harm since September 2005. Noble's Hospital is the main hospital on the Isle of Man, a crown dependency distinct from the UK; it has local guidelines based on the above NPSA guidelines.

The NPSA 2005 guidelines state that for standard NG tube insertions in adult patients, the first-line method of checking the placement of NG tubes should be by obtaining an aspirate of between pH 1 and 5.5. This reliably shows the NG tube to be in the stomach, rather than the lung. If this is unsuccessful, the second-line method of checking placement is to perform a chest x ray. Additional methods such as "the whoosh test" and the colour of aspirate and litmus paper should be avoided.

For high risk NG tube insertions, such as unconscious patients in ITU or for patients with swallowing difficulties or absent gag reflex, these should be confirmed by chest x ray in the first instance, though this decision depends on clinical judgement. The NPSA 2011 update reinforced the above guidelines, while also setting out a specific set of steps each time an NG tube is inserted, to ensure the following were considered:

ASGE guideline — early versus intentionally delayed feeding after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement is addressed with defined timing and evidence scope. "Recommendation 3. In patients who undergo PEG placement, the ASGE recommends that PEG tubes may be used for feeding early (within 4 hours) over routine delays in initiation (strong recommendation and low to moderate quality of evidence)". The review identified "4 RCTs, which included 290 patients, 145 of whom underwent intentionally delayed tube feed initiation after PEG placement and 145 underwent early tube feed initiation", with early defined "within 1 hour", "within 3 hours", "at 3 hours", or "at 4 hours" after placement and delayed at "24 hours" in most RCTs. Additional evidence included "4 non-RCT comparative studies comprising 3 retrospective cohorts and 1 prospective observational study", totaling "829 total additional patients, 371 of whom underwent early feeding and 458 underwent delayed feeding", where early was defined as "at 3 hours", "before 4 hours after PEG placement", "within 4 hours", or "at or before 4 hours after PEG placement", and delayed as "at or later than 4 hours", "more than 4 hours", "between 4 and 24 hours", or "16 to 24 hours after PEG placement"; outcomes of interest included "all-cause mortality at 30 days, short-term mortality (< 72 hours), adverse events, vomiting, aspiration, peristomal leak, wound infection, and PEG site stomatitis".

Add the carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension to the water in the cup.
Carefully stir the tablet and water mixture.
Draw up the mixture into a catheter-tip syringe.
Administer the mixture immediately through the NG tube or G-tube. Pieces of the tablet may remain in the catheter-tip syringe or the feeding tube.
Flush immediately with 1 to 2 mL of additional water to clear the NG tube or G-tube.
Flush the NG tube or G-tube again, as needed, until no pieces of the tablet are left in the syringe or the feeding tube.

### Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) expert opinion / guidance on the use of clinically assisted nutrition in patients with advanced cancer [^113Xj2To]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Definitions

For the purposes of this guidance, CAN refers to all forms of tube-feeding (e.g. via nasogastric tube, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), or parenteral nutrition (PN). It does not cover oral feeding, by cup, spoon, or any other method of delivering food or nutritional supplements into a patient's mouth. Synonymous terms within the medical literature include "medically-assisted nutrition", "artificial nutrition", "artificial feeding", and "hyperalimentation" (specifically for parenteral nutrition). The term "medical nutrition therapy" includes the use of oral nutritional supplements as well as "tube feeding".

Other definitions used in this guidance include "advanced cancer" (i.e. "cancer that is unlikely to be cured or controlled with treatment. The cancer may have spread from where it first started, to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body. Treatment may be given to help shrink the tumour, slow the growth of cancer cells, or relieve symptoms"), "end-of-life" (i.e. the last year of life), and "terminal phase" (i.e. the last days to weeks of life). It should be noted that patients with advanced cancer may not be at the end-of-life (as defined), and that prognostication remains exceptionally challenging (especially when the prognosis is of the order of months to years rather than days to weeks). Thus, the trajectory of the illness may change (i.e. accelerate or decelerate), and/or acute events may intervene (i.e. cancer-related or separate condition).

Nutritional requirements

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence/NICE (United Kingdom) recommend a "total intake" for all adults that includes (a) 25–35 kcal/kg/day total energy; (b) 0.8–1.5 g protein (0.13–0.24 g nitrogen)/kg/day; (c) 30–35 mL fluid/kg (allowing for excessive losses, and other sources of fluids); and (d) adequate electrolytes, minerals, micronutrients, and fibre. Other guidelines recommend similar amounts of nutrients for cancer patients Fig. 1.

### A guide to enteral access procedures and enteral nutrition [^116p3Vhv]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

The advent of total parenteral nutrition in the late 1960s meant that no situation remained in which a patient could not be fed. Unfortunately, total parenteral nutrition was complicated by serious infective and metabolic side effects that undermined the beneficial effects of nutrient repletion. Consequently, creative ways of restoring upper gut function were designed, based on semielemental diets and novel feeding tube systems. The employment of specific protocols and acceptance of increased gastric residual volumes has allowed most patients in intensive care to be fed safely and early by nasogastric tube. However, nasogastric feeding is unsuitable for patients with severely compromised gastric emptying owing to partial obstruction or ileus. Such patients require postpyloric tube placement with simultaneous gastric decompression via double-lumen nasogastric decompression and jejunal feeding tubes. These tubes can be placed endoscopically 40–60 cm past the ligament of Treitz to enable feeding without pancreatic stimulation. In patients whose disorders last more than 4 weeks, tubes should be repositioned percutaneously, by endoscopic, open or laparoscopic surgery. Together, the advances in enteral access have improved patients' outcomes and led to a 70–90% reduction in the demand for total parenteral nutrition.

### ACG clinical guideline: nutrition therapy in the adult hospitalized patient [^114StY1x]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — selection of long-term enteral access: When long-term enteral access is needed in a patient with gastroparesis or chronic pancreatitis, a jejunostomy tube should be placed (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). A percutaneous enteral access device should be placed, either via the gastric or the jejunal route, if enteral feeding is anticipated to be needed for > 4 weeks after insertion (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). If the duration of provision of EN is anticipated to exceed 4 weeks, then a percutaneous enteral access device is generally indicated, with the 4-week cutoff based on potential morbidity of a nasoenteric tube including erosion of the nares, an increase in aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, and esophageal ulceration or stricture. Long-term jejunal access is best achieved by a jejunostomy tube placed endoscopically, radiologically or surgically; because of frequent displacement of the jejunal extension tube back into the stomach with a GJ device, this is generally not a good long-term option, although design changes such as a stiffer double pigtail catheter with a sleeve in the jejunal portion may result in less displacement and reconsideration of GJ tube use may be warranted.

### A systematic review and quality appraisal of guidelines and recommendations for home enteral tube feeding in adults [^1112iTj2]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

A protocol for this systematic review of guidelines was developed a priori and registered with PROSPERO (identification CRD42023456223) in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. A protocol amendment was submitted (12 th December 2024) with changes to the grey literature sources searched and eligibility criteria after piloting the study selection process. Further detail for the data extraction plan was also provided. This review was also informed by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Johnston et al. methodological guide for systematic reviews of clinical practice guidelines.

Literature search

Five bibliographical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycInfo (OVID interface), CINAHL, and Scopus) were searched for published eligible guidelines on HETF on September 26, 2023. A search strategy was developed for Medline and translated across the remaining four databases (Table S1).

Additionally a grey literature search including seven guideline repositories and 64 key government health agency and nutrition association websites was conducted on September 29, 2023. The choice of guideline repository was based on Cochrane recommendations and the websites included were informed by a preliminary Google search and content experts on the research team. A summary of the sources and search methods used is provided in Table S2. The reference lists of included guidelines were also hand-searched to identify additional potentially eligible guidelines.

Eligibility criteria

Included guidelines contained a dedicated set of recommendations specific to the provision of HETF to people aged over 18 years old. Guidelines covering any aspect or stage of the patient journey associated with HETF, from initiation to management and discontinuation were included. These had to be explicitly identified as a guide, guideline, standard or recommendations. Guidelines had to be evidence-based and/or developed through consensus, although could be presented in any format and with any intended end-user. Records providing inadequate methodological detail to ascertain whether evidence-based and/or consensus methods were used were excluded. Guidelines pertaining exclusively to short term enteral feeding or where the duration of feeding could not be determined were excluded, as where guidelines for specific diseases or conditions unless they specifically addressed HETF. Narrative reviews and opinion pieces were excluded. Guidelines were included if they were available in English and were produced from 2000 onwards to ensure currency.

### Comparative safety assessment of nasogastric versus nasojejunal feeding initiated within 48 hours post-admission versus unrestricted timing in moderate or severe acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114QP2jh]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data sources and search strategy

Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we reviewed studies published in four databases: PubMed, EMbase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science. To identify relevant studies, we also examined the references of these articles. The search terms included "Pancreatitis", "NG feeding", "Nasojejunal feeding", and "mortality", used in various combinations. We excluded case reports, review articles, and non-randomized controlled trials (RCTs), limiting the language to English. The detailed search strategy was provided in Supplementary Table S1.

Study selection

The following criteria were used to select studies suitable for meta-analysis: (1) RCTs. (2) Population: Patients with AP. (3) NG or NJ feeding initiated within the first 72 h of admission. (4) Studies must report at least one primary or secondary outcome. (5) Only English language articles were considered. The primary outcome was overall mortality, while secondary outcomes included organ failure, length of hospital stay, complications, infection rates, surgical intervention, requirement for parenteral nutrition, and the success rate of the procedure. Studies included in the meta-analysis were those in which enteral feeding (NG or NJ) was initiated within the first 72 h post-admission, specifically categorized into two subgroups: less than 48 h and 48 to 72 h.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by two independent reviewers using a structured data abstraction form, achieving high inter-observer consistency. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus or consultation with a third author. We extracted information including the authors' names, article titles, journals of publication, countries and years of the studies, methodological variables, and clinical outcomes. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the risk of bias assessment tool developed by the Cochrane Collaboration.

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [formula: see text] [^112GsEkw]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube dislodgement — management and replacement timing are described as follows: A dislodged PEG tube can become a medical emergency, and the tube should not be reinserted blindly; possible approaches include immediate reinsertion under radiographic or endoscopic guidance, laparotomy, or conservative management followed by reinsertion in 7–10 days. If displacement occurs after the tract is mature (> 30 days), prompt replacement with a percutaneously balloon gastrostomy tube is recommended. The minimum duration to allow for safe gastrostomy replacement remains unknown, and the authors recommend waiting at least 2 or 3 months for safe tube replacement. Most gastrostomy tubes with internal bolsters (ie, PEG tubes) allow transcutaneous replacement to be performed without endoscopy, and with optimal care most bolster-type gastrostomy tubes may remain in place for up to 1–2 years; however, some institutions routinely replace EADs at 6-month intervals and preventive maintenance with elective change every 3–6 months for balloon gastrostomy tubes is the standard of practice in some facilities.

Discussion

The panel noted that beyond the risks for cardiovascular events, there are other risks or disadvantages associated with holding antithrombotic medications. This includes keeping patients on nasal feeds, increasing length of stay, and delays in transfer to longer-term acute care facilities. In addition, consistent with expert opinion, the bleeding events were not life-threatening. The patient advocate also preferred bleeding over a cardiovascular event. No data were available on patient values, cost-effectiveness, and equity. No data were available on maneuvers to reduce bleeding such as tightening bumper for a short duration immediately after placement.

Given the totality of evidence, a conditional recommendation was drafted suggesting against the routine withholding of antiplatelet medications, including DAPT. Conversely, given the low quality of evidence, the ASGE suggests that the management of anticoagulant medications should be based on a multidisciplinary discussion regarding the competing risks of bleeding (with continuation of medications) and cardiovascular adverse events (with stopping medications).

Question 3: In patients who undergo PEG placement, should tube feeds be initiated early or intentionally delayed?

Recommendation 3. In patients who undergo PEG placement, the ASGE recommends that PEG tubes may be used for feeding early (within 4 hours) over routine delays in initiation (strong recommendation and low to moderate quality of evidence).

For this question, a systematic review of published literature comparing intentionally delayed versus early tube feed initiation after PEG placement was performed. The PRISMA diagram detailing study screening and inclusion is provided in Figure 9. For this, we used Ovid MEDLINE and Embase for all studies published through September 27, 2022. We used search terms and subheadings including enteral nutrition, enteral feeding, tube feeding, nutritional support, postpyloric, enteric, enteral, transpyloric, endoscopy, GI, digestive system, gastrostomy, PEG, interval, early, timing, initiation, delayed, and immediate (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 13, Figure 14, Figure 15, Figure 16, Figure 17, Figure 18, Figure 19, Figure 20, Figure 21, Figure 22, Figure 23, Figure 24, Figure 25).

### Nutrition support for neurologically impaired children: a clinical report of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^112Vo9Yi]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Medium credibility.

Route of administration — criteria for maintaining oral feeding and considering tube feeding are outlined: Oral feedings can be maintained in children with adequate oral motor skills who have a low risk of aspiration. Adequate positioning and adjusting food consistency with thickening agents may improve feeding efficiency. Increasing the energy density of food maximizes energy intake. If oral intake is insufficient to promote weight gain, linear growth, and adequate hydration; if the amount of time to feed the child is excessive because of chewing and swallowing dysfunction; or if aspiration is a risk, enteral tube feedings may be considered. The type of enteral access selected will depend upon the nutritional and clinical status of the child and the anticipated duration of enteral feedings. Nasogastric or nasojejunal tube feedings are minimally invasive methods that may be used for short-term nutritional support in undernourished children.

Question 3: How to achieve enteral access?

Decisions regarding enteral access are often determined by local expertise, anticipated duration of feeding, and evidence of gastroparesis or impaired gastrointestinal transit.

Short-term feeding may be facilitated by blind bedside placement of a nasogastric tube. Reliable aids to confirm location within the stomach include an abdominal radiograph, continuous CO2 monitor, or differential esophageal/tracheal compliance to intermittent suction.

The decision to switch from gastric to postpyloric feeding is based on perceived intolerance or delayed gastric emptying. The placement of a postpyloric tube can be achieved endoscopic techniques, blind corkscrew technique, or GPS-guided or optically-guided tubes. Use of a magnet-directed or flanged Tiger tube should be avoided. Surgical or radiologic techniques require transport to the operating room or radiologic suite, respectively. Randomized trials show a switch to postpyloric feeding reduces pneumonia significantly, but arguably no other outcome benefits are incurred, thereby underlying controversial views. The decision to switch from nasoenteric to percutaneous access is predicated on an anticipated duration of feeding of greater than four weeks. A size of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube larger than 18–20 French should be avoided, as torsion on the side wall leading to enlarged stomal diameter is more likely. Surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube is preferred in the presence of ascites, excluded stomach following bariatric surgery, or altered postoperative anatomy. Radiologic placement of a gastrostomy tube utilizes a variant of the "Introducer" technique.

The decision to attain deep jejunal access, such as converting a PEG to a PEGJ, is based on evidence of delayed gastric emptying. A new PEG can be converted even at initial placement by shortening the length of the PEG and placing a second smaller jejunostomy tube (J-tube) through the PEG into the small bowel. A mature tract (> 7–10 days since initial placement) is required to place a one-piece PEGJ, which affords a larger lumen for both feeding and aspiration.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes: methodology and review of evidence [^111STpxD]. VideoGIE (2025). High credibility.

ASGE guideline — early tube feed initiation after PEG includes practice recommendations and caveats. The panel made a strong recommendation for early initiation of tube feed after PEG tube placement with overall low to moderate quality evidence. The panel agreed that routine gastric residual measurement should not be performed. The panel noted a misconception that delaying feeds allows the stoma to heal and stated the stoma site takes at least several weeks to heal. It emphasized that early initiation may not be clinically appropriate in some situations (patients on vasopressors, with severe ileus or obstruction, or with bowel ischemia) and that early initiation may not always be feasible due to logistics. The panel also noted that medications may be given immediately via the PEG after placement unless there are contraindications to enteral medications.

### Diagnosis and management of a misplaced nasogastric tube into the pulmonary pleura… [^113JULoX]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

A significant number of patients undergoing surgery for disorders of the head and neck will receive a Dobbhoff tube or a nasogastric tube. The tube placement may be used for the short term, to get patients through a critical illness, or for the long term, when patients need nutritional supplementation for an extended period. The feeding tube may be placed in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia or at the bedside in a regular hospital setting. Many methods of monitoring the correct placement of the feeding tube have been described. Recently, in our institution, feeding tubes were placed into the lungs or pleural space in 3 cases, including 1 case on the otolaryngology service. Lo JO, Wu V, Reh D, Nadig S, Wax MK.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^117WLGeg]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Enteral feeding indications in specific non-gastrointestinal diseases — recommendations are as follows: Evaluate all patients who have had a stroke for dysphagia as early as possible to establish route of nutrition support. Initiate enteral nutrition (EN) using a nasogastric tube (NGT) in a patient who has had a stroke, for whom oral intake has been deemed unsafe, and who is not likely to recover within 7 days, and evaluate the patient for a nasal tube retaining system to reduce the risk of tube displacement. Consider placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in patients with persistent inability to swallow safely for > 2–4 weeks. Initiate EN support in adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and malnutrition who are unable to meet their nutrition needs with diet and oral supplements alone. Initiate EN in malnourished patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are unable to meet nutrition needs with diet and oral supplements alone, including patients who are not on dialysis and patients on either intermittent hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD).

### Improving the documentation of nasogastric tube insertion and adherence to local enteral nutrition guidelines [^114xq7Sr]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Baseline measurement

For this project, three baseline measures were proposed. The first was the process measure of how many NG tubes were being inserted. The second was an outcome measure of how many of these NG tubes had been inserted in accordance with the local guidelines. The third was a process measure to see whether documentation in patient case notes was adequate.

It was decided not to use an outcome measurement (such as morbidity or mortality) as the sample size would be small and these are rare occurrences.

Prospective data collection was to start on 11th November 2013. Therefore, it was decided to retrospectively collect data on NG tubes placed in the preceding four weeks for use as baseline data. These patients were identified by asking staff on 10 hospital wards if they remembered any patients who had recently had an NG tube inserted. As such, there may be an element of selection bias. What this did identify was that there was no formal system of measurement in place at that time to identify patients who were having NG tubes inserted.

Using this method, 13 NG tube insertions were reviewed. Eight of these NG tubes were inserted on ward 7, the stoke unit. Subsequent data confirmed that the majority of NG tube insertions take place here. A quality score out of 5 was devised to assess whether these NG tube insertions were done in accordance with local guidelines, as follows:

There is a clear and appropriate indication for NG tube insertion
It is the right time to place the NG tube and there is the appropriate equipment available
There is sufficient knowledge/expertise available at this time to test for safe placement of the NG tube?
The NG tube position is confirmed appropriately:

- The first-line method of checking NG tube placement is by aspirate of 5.5 or less

- The second-line method of checking NG tube placement is by chest x ray

5. No inappropriate tests were used, eg litmus paper/x ray as first-line (except in high risk patients)/whoosh test, etc.

### Improving safety and timeliness around nasogastric tube feeding on an acute stroke unit [^114zRXfV]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Available knowledge

NGT feeding is required for artificial nutrition and hydration in those who have lost their swallowing ability due to a stroke in the acute phase. NGT is a temporary measure while we wait for swallow to improve, and if it doesn't improve, a more long-term plan could be followed, such as a percutaneous gastrostomy tube feeding. In the acute stage of stroke, anyone with dysphagia as identified by bedside swallow screening will need specialist swallow assessment and decision on nasogastricNGT feeding within 24 hours of admission.

c) Is there sufficient knowledge/expertise available at this time to test for safe placement of the NG tube?

In response to further clinical incidents where chest x rays were wrongly interpreted, it was also suggested that:

i) X ray request forms clearly state that the purpose of the x ray is to establish the position of the NG tube for the purpose of feeding

ii) The radiographer takes responsibility to ensure that the NG tube can be clearly seen on the x ray to be used to confirm tube position

iii) Documentation of the tube placement checking process includes confirmation that any x ray viewed was the most current x ray for the correct patient, how placement was interpreted, and clear instructions as to required actions. Any tubes identified to be in the lung are removed immediately, whether in the x ray department or clinical area.

The above guidelines have a broad scope. As such, it was realised during the course of the quality improvement project that it should have a specifically focus, ie initial insertion of NG tubes and confirmation of placement, using the NPSA 2005 guidelines as the agreed standard. We were aiming for 100% attainment. A time frame of 90 days was initially proposed, however, this was later extended to 120 days as the project developed.

### How often should percutaneous gastrostomy feeding tubes be replaced? A single-institute retrospective study [^113ZSFJk]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Percutaneous gastrostomy (PG) is an effective method for delivering enteral nutrition to the gastric lumen while bypassing the oral cavity in patients who cannot tolerate oral or nasogastric tube feeding. The rate of this procedure has greatly increased since the 1980s commensurate with the growth in home nursing care. Currently published guidelines for this procedure and its postoperative care recommend PG tube insertion for candidates who are at risk of moderate-to-severe malnutrition within 2–3 weeks of nasogastric tube feeding. Although this minimally invasive procedure is quite safe and instructions for tube care are well-known, the risks of minor or major complications (such as wound infection, occlusion, peristomal leakage, tube dislodgement, stomal hypergranulation, and buried bumper syndrome) increase as long as tube feeding persists. Because of such complications, the PG tube should be exchanged periodically; however, physicians and nurses have remained uncertain about the optimal time to perform these exchanges with respect to the different types of tubes as well as the patients' conditions. There have been a few studies comparing the durability of PG tubes constructed of different materials in small populations; however, no clinical data have been published addressing how often PG tubes need to be replaced. Within this context, the aim of this study was to investigate longevity of PG tube patency according to type, and thus to determine the optimal replacement time.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding initiation timing — practice recommendations state to use a PEG tube for feedings within several hours of placement, and "current literature supports ≤ 4 hours in adults and children". Clinicians should also educate providers on the appropriate timing of use of the PEG tube postprocedure and review procedural documentation for time of PEG insertion. As context, tube feedings have traditionally been delayed to the next day and up to 24 hours after the procedure, with no consensus regarding initiation after placement.

### Enteral feeding during chemoradiotherapy for advanced head-and-neck cancer: a single-institution experience using a reactive approach [^117NUVSH]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The optimal method for providing enteral nutrition to patients with head-and-neck cancer is unclear. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our reactive policy, which consists of the installation of a nasogastric (NG) feeding tube only when required by the patient's nutritional status.

Methods and Materials

The records of all patients with Stage III and IV head-and-neck cancer treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy between January 2003 and December 2006 were reviewed. The overall and disease-free survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test.

Results

The present study included 253 patients, and the median follow-up was 33 months. At 3 years, the estimated overall survival and disease-free survival rate was 82.8% and 77.8%, respectively, for the whole population. No survival difference was observed when the patients were compared according to the presence and absence of a NG tube or stratified by weight loss quartile. The mean weight loss during treatment for all patients was 10.4%. The proportion of patients requiring a NG tube was 49.8%, and the NG tube remained in place for a median duration of 40 days. No major complications were associated with NG tube installation. Only 3% of the patients were still dependent on enteral feeding at 6 months.

Conclusion

These results suggest that the use of a reactive NG tube with an interdisciplinary team approach is a safe and effective method to manage malnutrition in patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer.

### The protocol for a randomised-controlled trial of the evaluation of the tolerance and safety of early enteral nutrition in children after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement. (protocol version 09.01.2015) [^112y3jJ2]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The appropriate time to initiate enteral nutrition after the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube has been an area of limited research. Historically, data to guide decisions regarding the initiation of feedings has been extrapolated from surgical experience with gastrostomy tubes. The recommended time for the resumption of feeding in adults and children is inconsistent, and varies from 1 to 24 h. There are few published trials in the literature to guide post-PEG feeding decisions. Choudhry et al. prospectively analysed 41 subjects in a randomised controlled fashion to early (after 3 h) versus delayed feedings (after 24 h) after PEG placement. Two subjects in the early intervention group versus one subject in the late intervention group had feedings held due to significant gastric residuals (arbitrarily defined significant gastric residual volumes as 60 mL). Complication rates and mortality data were similar among the groups. Stein et al. prospectively enrolled 80 patients in a randomised controlled trial comparing immediate feeding within one hour after PEG placement versus feeding after 24 h in intensive care and intermediate unit patients. Gastric residual volumes were measured as the primary endpoint. Residual volumes were similar between groups on days 1 and 3. Complication rates and mortality rates were similar between groups. Brown et al. prospectively enrolled 57 patients in a controlled randomised trial comparing early (within 3 h) versus a delayed (next-day) feeding regimen post PEG-placement. All patients tolerated the feeding regimen without complication. Chumley et al. describes in abstract form a prospective randomised controlled study of 150 patients. Three groups were compared. Groups 1 and 2 were fed early (Group 1, n = 50 — fed at 3 h; Group 2, n = 50 — fed at 6 h). Delayed feedings took place after 24 h. Only one patient in the 3-h group developed increased gastric residuals (volume not defined). McCarter et al. prospectively studied 112 patients in a controlled randomised fashion comparing early feedings (4 h) versus delayed feeding (24 h) after PEG placement. Twenty five percent of the early feeding group had a high gastric residual on day 1 compared to 9% in the delayed feeding group (p = < 0.029). By day two, there was not a statistically significant difference in gastric residuals between the groups. One patient in the study died of aspiration pneumonia (delayed-feeding group). Minor complications were similar between the groups. In 2008 Bechtold et al. performed meta-analysis and only RCTs on adult subjects that compared early (≤ 4 h) versus delayed or next-day feedings after PEG placement were included. Authors concluded that early feeding can represent a safe alternative to delayed or next-day feedings. Although an increase in significant gastric residual volumes at day 1 was noted, overall complications were not affected. Szary et al. in 2011 in their meta-analysis demonstrated that feeding initiated 3 h after PEG placement in adult patients is safe and effective. By initiating feeding earlier after PEG placement, many patients can avoid acute care hospital stays, unnecessarily prolonged intravenous access and medications and receive earlier substantial nutrition. The study evaluating the safety of early (6 h) feeding in children after PEG placement (6 h) was performed by Werlin et al. This was an uncontrolled series of 24 paediatric patients, and they found no increase in the complication rate with the earlier feedings. The recent prospective randomised study with earliest feeding in children after PEG placement is by Corkins et al. Forty successive patients who met the entry criteria were enrolled, with 20 in each group. The authors compared the tolerance of feedings at 3 and 6 h after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement. The change in abdominal girth before and 1 h after the initial feeding, any vomiting, and the gastric residual volume before the next feeding. were recorded and the length of stay was also documented. They found no increase in complications with the earliest feeding (3 h after PEG insertion).

### Improving the documentation of nasogastric tube insertion and adherence to local enteral nutrition guidelines [^111nC2hr]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

However, after the second PDSA cycle it became apparent that points 2 and 3 (based on the NPSA 2011 update) were too subjective. They were therefore removed from the analysis and all data retrospectively analyzed using a simplified three-point quality score. This meant that data collected was more objective and took less time to be collected and analyzed.

A seven-point quality of documentation score to record a minimum data-set was also devised, as follows:

There is documentation of a decision/indication for NG tube
There is documentation of the NG tube insertion
There is documentation of the length of NG tube insertion
There is documentation of which nostril the NG tube was inserted into
There is documentation of whether an aspirate was obtained or not
There is documentation of whether NG tube placement has been checked and what method was used – either an aspirate with a pH 5.5 or less, or a chest x ray which is documented in the case notes that it is the most recent and the four anatomical criteria to confirm placement
There were instructions written as to required actions, eg safe to feed, needs to be pushed in further etc.

The three-point quality of guidelines score showed that 8/13 (62%) cases were following guidelines appropriately. The seven-point quality of documentation score showed no case notes had full documentation. However, it did highlight a marked discrepancy between quality of documentation score when looking at documentation in case notes (average score of 2/7 (29%)) compared to nurse and case notes combined (average Score of 4/7 (57%)).

### AGA clinical practice update on management of short bowel syndrome: expert review [^114YuUqq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Short bowel syndrome (SBS) — enteral nutrition (EN) and tube feeding in adults: There are few published reports of EN support and it appears to be rarely used, but the benefit of tube feeding was demonstrated in a randomized crossover study of 15 adult SBS patients showing increased net absorption. We suggest consideration of EN (ie, tube feeding) in combination with oral feeding in stable patients with SBS-IF and insufficient oral intake when stool output is < 2 L/d and expected gains may allow weaning from parenteral nutrition (PN). For long-term EN, intermittent self-placement of a nasogastric tube or placement of a percutaneous gastrostomy tube are considerations, and a temporary trial of nasogastric tube feeding should be considered to ensure tolerance. Once enteral access has been obtained, slow continuous infusion into the stomach, rather than bolus or small-bowel infusion, is suggested to maximize intestinal transit time, improve nutrient contact time and absorption, and reduce diarrhea.

### Gastrostomy tube use in pediatrics: a systematic review [^116JekLy]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Despite frequency of gastrostomy placement procedures in children, there remains considerable variability in preoperative work-up and procedural technique of gastrostomy placement and a paucity of literature regarding patient-centric outcomes.

Objectives

This review summarizes existing literature and provides consensus-driven guidelines for patients throughout the enteral access decision-making process.

Data Sources

PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, and Scopus.

Study Selection

Included studies were identified through a combination of the search terms "gastrostomy", "g-tube", and "tube feeding" in children.

Data Extraction

Relevant data, level of evidence, and risk of bias were extracted from included articles to guide formulation of consensus summaries of the evidence. Meta-analysis was conducted when data afforded a quantitative analysis.

Evidence Review

Four themes were explored: preoperative nasogastric feeding tube trials, decision-making surrounding enteral access, the role of preoperative imaging, and gastrostomy insertion techniques. Guidelines were generated after evidence review with multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement adhering to GRADE methodology.

Results

Nearly 900 publications were reviewed, with 58 influencing final recommendations. In total, 17 recommendations are provided, including: (1) tTrial of home nasogastric feeding is safe and should be strongly considered before gastrostomy placement, especially for patients who are likely to learn to eat by mouth; (2) rRoutine contrast studies are not indicated before gastrostomy placement; and (3) lLaparoscopic placement is associated with the best safety profile.

Limitations

Recommendations were generated almost exclusively from observational studies and expert opinion, with few studies describing direct comparisons between GT placement and prolonged nasogastric feeding tube trial.

Conclusions

Additional patient- and family-centric evidence is needed to understand critical aspects of decision-making surrounding surgically placed enteral access devices for children.

### Comparative safety assessment of nasogastric versus nasojejunal feeding initiated within 48 hours post-admission versus unrestricted timing in moderate or severe acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113z7kAJ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Initially, our systematic search across multiple databases yielded a total of 1160 studies. After applying strict inclusion criteria based on the study design, population, and outcomes of interest, only four RCTs were deemed eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis (Table 1). The RCTs we included involving a total of 217 patients, with 112 in the NG Feeding Group and 105 in the NJ Feeding Group. The specific study selection process was depicted in Fig. 1. Among all patients, there was a higher proportion of males, with an average age exceeding 35 years, and most were administered NG tube feeding within 48 h of hospital admission. The risk of bias in the included studies was presented in Fig. 2. The results indicated that none of the studies blinded participants and personnel, and three studies did not blind outcome assessment, leading to a high risk of performance and detection bias.

Primary outcome

Mortality

Mortality data were extracted from three of the included RCTs, 12 patients in the NG Feeding Group and 11 in the NJ feeding Group died. The forest plot results indicated similar mortality rates between the two groups, with low heterogeneity (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.77, I² = 5%, P = 0.68) (see Fig. 3 A). The funnel plot revealed no evidence of publication bias in these studies (Figure S1 A).

Fig. 3
Forest plots of mortality and subgroup analyses A: Mortality comparison; B: Subgroup analysis of age-related mortality; C: Subgroup analysis of mortality related to time of nasogastric tube feeding

Mean age ≤ 45 years vs. Mean age > 45 years

Subgroup analysis was conducted based on patient age. The RR was 1.31 in the group with an average age ≤ 45 years and 0.58 in the group with an average age > 45 years. These results indicate that age is not a significant factor affecting mortality (P = 0.27) (Fig. 3 B).

Early intervention vs. varied-timing intervention

Subgroup analysis was performed based on the timing of NG tube feeding initiation in patients. The RR was 1.31 in the early intervention patients (within 48 h of admission) compared to interventions initiated at varied timings. These results suggest that the timing of intervention is not a significant factor affecting mortality (P = 0.27) (Fig. 3 C).

Randomised and quasi-randomised clinical trials comparing continuous versus intermittent bolus nasogastric milk feeding in premature infants less than 1500 grams.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed all trials for relevance and methodologic quality. The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used to extract data.

Main Results

Overall, the seven included trials, involving 511 infants, found no differences in time to achieve full enteral feeds between feeding methods (weighted mean difference (WMD) 2 days; 95% CI -0.3 to 3.9). In the subgroup analysis of those studies comparing continuous nasogastric versus intermittent bolus nasogastric milk feedings the findings remained unchanged (WMD 2 days, 95% CI -0.4 to 4.1). There was no significant difference in somatic growth and incidence of NEC between feeding methods irrespective of tube placement. One study noted a trend toward more apneas during the study period in infants fed by the continuous tube feeding method compared to those fed by intermittent feedings delivered predominantly by orogastric tube placements [mean difference (MD) 14.0 apneas during study period; 95% CI -0.2 to 28.2]. In subgroup analysis based on weight groups, one study suggested that infants less than 1000 grams and 1000 to 1250 grams birth weight gained weight faster when fed by the continuous nasogastric tube feeding method compared to intermittent nasogastric tube feeding method (MD 2.0 g/day; 95% CI 0.5 to 3.5; MD 2.0 g/day; 95% CI 0.2 to 3.8, respectively). A trend toward earlier discharge for infants less than 1000 grams birth weight fed by the continuous tube feeding method compared to intermittent nasogastric tube feeding method (MD -11 days; 95% CI -21.8 to -0.2).

Authors' Conclusions

Small sample sizes, methodologic limitations, inconsistencies in controlling variables that may affect outcomes, and conflicting results of the studies to date make it difficult to make universal recommendations regarding the best tube feeding method for premature infants less than 1500 grams. The clinical benefits and risks of continuous versus intermittent nasogastric tube milk feeding cannot be reliably discerned from the limited information available from randomised trials to date.

Intervention

Participants are allocated to standard care or enteral tube feeding in addition to standard care. Standard care consists of intravenous rehydration and, when considered necessary, laboratory monitoring, electrolyte and/or vitamin supplementation, antiemetic medication and dietetic advice. Type of rehydration regimen, medication and duration of hospitalisation is prescribed according to local protocol. In case of prolonged hospital admission or readmissions, tube feeding can be initiated at the decision of the attending physician.

When allocated to the intervention group, participants receive a nasogastric tube as soon as possible after randomisation, in addition to standard care. If the initial nasogastric tube is dislocated or poorly tolerated a nasoduodenal or nasojejunal insertion can also be considered. Tube feeding regimen and mix is prescribed according to local protocol. As soon as tube feeding is tolerated and participants have received safety instructions (e.g. recognising symptoms that need to be evaluated in hospital, because of potential tube blockage, dislocation or aspiration), discharge home with tube feeding is encouraged under the guidance of a hospital dietician. Energy intake per tube is continued at least until the patient is able to maintain an oral intake of 1000 cal per day for one week. According to the NICE guideline on nutrition, tube feeding in a home setting is considered to be safe.

Data collection

At the day of randomisation, participants fill out a questionnaire. This questionnaire consists of validated NVP symptom and NVP specific quality of life measures (24-h Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis and nausea score, PUQE-24; Hyperemesis Impact of Symptoms questionnaire, HIS; Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy Quality of Life questionnaire, NVPQoL), psychopathology (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS; Symptoms CheckList 90, SCL-90) and general health related questions (Short Form 36, SF-36; EuroQol 5 Dimensions questionnaire, EQ5D).

Participants fill out additional questionnaires (NVPQoL, HIS, HADS) 1 and 3 weeks after randomisation and record a diary at weekly intervals (PUQE-24, weight, medication use, dietary intake) from randomisation until 20 weeks gestation. If dietary intake has normalised from 15 weeks gestation onwards, this is no longer recorded. Six weeks postpartum (HADS, SF-36, EQ5D) and 12 months postpartum a final questionnaire is filled out (HADS, SF-36, EQ5D, SCL-90). See Table 1.

### Nasogastric versus nasojejunal tube feeding for severe acute pancreatitis [^112PySR7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nutrition is an important aspect of management in severe acute pancreatitis. Enteral nutrition has advantages over parenteral nutrition and is the preferred method of feeding. Enteral feeding via nasojejunal tube is often recommended, but its benefits over nasogastric feeding are unclear. The placement of a nasogastric tube is technically simpler than the placement of a nasojejunal tube.

Objectives

To compare the mortality, morbidity, and nutritional status outcomes of people with severe acute pancreatitis fed via nasogastric tube versus nasojejunal tube.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS on 17 October 2019 without using any language restrictions. We also searched reference lists and conference proceedings for relevant studies and clinical trial registries for ongoing trials. We contacted authors for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing enteral feeding by nasogastric and nasojejunal tubes in participants with severe acute pancreatitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias of the included studies, and extracted data. This information was independently verified by the other review authors. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane to assess the risk of bias and perform data synthesis. We rated the certainty of evidence according to GRADE.

Main Results

We included five RCTs that randomised a total of 220 adult participants from India, Scotland, and the USA. Two of the trial reports were available only as abstracts. The trials differed in the criteria used to rate the severity of acute pancreatitis, and three trials excluded those who presented in severe shock. The duration of onset of symptoms before presentation in the trials ranged from within one week to four weeks. The trials also differed in the methods used to confirm the placement of the tubes and in what was considered to be nasojejunal placement. We assessed none of the trials as at high risk of bias, though reporting of methods in four trials was insufficient to judge the risk of bias for one or more of the domains assessed. There was no evdence of effect with nasogastric or nasojejunal placement on the primary outcome of mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.17; I² = 0%; 5 trials, 220 participants; very low-certainty evidence due to indirectness and imprecision). Similarly, there was no evidence of effect on the secondary outcomes for which data were available. These included organ failure (3 trials, 145 participants), rate of infection (2 trials, 108 participants), success rate (3 trials, 159 participants), complications associated with the procedure (2 trials, 80 participants), need for surgical intervention (3 trials, 145 participants), requirement of parenteral nutrition (2 trials, 80 participants), complications associated with feeds (4 trials, 195 participants), and exacerbation of pain (4 trials, 195 participants). However, the certainty of the evidence for these secondary outcomes was also very low due to indirectness and imprecision. Three trials (117 participants) reported on length of hospital stay, but the data were not suitable for meta-analysis. None of the trials reported data suitable for meta-analysis for the other secondary outcomes of this review, which included days taken to achieve full nutrition requirement, duration of tube feeding, and duration of analgesic requirement after feeding tube placement.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to conclude that there is superiority, inferiority, or equivalence between the nasogastric and nasojejunal mode of enteral tube feeding in people with severe acute pancreatitis.

[^1115oQUA]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis — early enteral nutrition initiation: We suggest that patients with moderate to severe acute pancreatitis should have a naso/oroenteric tube placed and enteral nutrition (EN) started at a trophic rate and advanced to goal as fluid volume resuscitation is completed (within 24–48 hours of admission) [Quality of Evidence: Very Low]. Failure to initiate EN therapy for > 72–96 hours following admission in a patient with moderate to severe acute pancreatitis runs the risk of rapid deterioration of nutrition status and its inherent complications.

Enteral access device placement — rationale and bedside tests highlight the need for imaging and limits of pH/auscultation: radiographic imaging is recommended to confirm the position of any blindly placed enteral feeding tube. Errors in blindly placed NG tubes occur, with a reported 1.3%–2.4% misplacement in 2000 NG tube insertions into adults and 28% resulting in pulmonary complications, including 2 deaths. Aspirate characteristics may guide location, with pleural space fluid having a pH of 7 or higher and gastric fluid a pH of 5 or less, and studies indicate a pH of ≤ 5.5 from tube aspirate is adequate to check stomach position. The auscultatory method is unreliable and cannot differentiate respiratory vs gastric placement, and although capnography may show nonbronchotracheal placement, a radiograph is still required to ensure proper placement in the stomach.

### Improving the documentation of nasogastric tube insertion and adherence to local enteral nutrition guidelines [^115gffaf]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Often it is the successful quality improvement projects that are presented or published. This project encountered a number of logistic, methodological and local challenges that needed to be overcome to get to the point finally reached ie an intervention trialled on a small scale, in a single setting, that showed some potential to improve clinical practice, rather than outright success.

However, it will hopefully have highlighted some local systems-based limitations that can now be addressed to ensure future quality improvement projects can avoid some of the challenges faced. Similarly, it has given weight to the argument that a local quality improvement lead may be beneficial to set in motion and support future quality improvement projects, as well as increasing local awareness of quality improvement methodology.

Similarly, the challenges faced in the initial stages of the project and how to overcome them may be of value to others embarking on quality improvement projects. There is a temptation to collect large amounts of data without a clear focus, rather than small amounts of useful focused data; to trial interventions on a large scale, rather than testing on a small scale without the expectation of getting it right first time; the value of a multi-disciplinary approach was only realised in the latter stages of the project, but in retrospect could have been in place from the outset.

Finally, the sustainability and usefulness of the intervention is unclear. While there was potential for documentation scores to improve when the intervention was successfully implemented, the sample size was small and impact of the intervention inconsistent. A number of other factors were identified that would limit the successful roll out of the intervention across the rest of the hospital which would need to be addressed.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) — feeding and nutrition: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses highlight the benefit of early oral feeding across mild, moderately severe, and severe AP without requiring stepwise advancement from clear liquids, and this approach reduces time to solid feeding, hospital stay, and costs. In severe AP, parenteral nutrition should be avoided and enteral nutrition should be begun, with continuous infusion preferred over cyclic or bolus administration. A meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled clinical trials involving 381 patients found decreased infectious complications, organ failure, and mortality with enteral nutrition vs TPN. For tube routes, nasogastric enteral nutrition seems safe; a systematic review of 92 patients from 14 studies found it safe and well tolerated in predicted severe AP, and nasogastric tube placement is far easier than nasojejunal, which requires interventional radiology or endoscopy. Regarding timing in predicted severe AP, early enteral tube feeding within 24 hours did not reduce infection (25% vs 26%) or mortality (11% vs 7%) compared with on-demand feeding.

### A systematic review and quality appraisal of guidelines and recommendations for home enteral tube feeding in adults [^114XFsbZ]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This review is the first to systematically identify, synthesise and evaluate the methodological quality of available guidelines and their recommendations for HETF. We identified and assessed 15 guidelines of which many were of poor methodological quality, either failing to employ systematic searches of the literature, utilising informal consensus methods, or simply lacking transparency and detail as to the methods employed. Only three of the identified guidelines were of high methodological quality however none of the recommendation clusters relevant to HETF from these guidelines achieved an overall AGREE-REX quality score > 50%. Numerous low-scoring items and domains from both the AGREE-II and AGREE-REX evaluations were attributed to the same methodological shortcomings of the appraised guidelines.

'Rigour of development' has been acknowledged as a critical domain in the appraisal of guideline quality. While scores in this domain were low there was an improvement in the use of systematic search methods and structured consensus over time. A noticeable limitation of most guidelines was the absence of criteria for regular update with only four guidelines ever having been renewed. In the past six years, no updates had been made. 'Evidence' scores were generally low with a majority of recommendations being good practice points, based on low-level evidence or extrapolated from moderate-level evidence. Inconsistent alignment between the definitiveness of some of these good practice point recommendations and the rationale provided, or lack thereof, was the main reason for lower scoring on 'applicability to target users'. Discordant recommendations, that is, when the strength of a recommendation is not reflective of the certainty of evidence, are warranted when there is low quality evidence suggesting benefit in life-threatening situations. The absence of clinical equipoise in providing EN would constitute the conduct of certain randomised controlled trials in this population unethical. When evidence is limited, guideline developers should be transparent as to the considerations made when formulating recommendations. This would include the perspective taken, the value assigned to relevant outcomes, acceptability of the recommendation to relevant stakeholders, resource requirements and the feasibility of implementation. Scarcity of high-quality evidence should not deter guideline developers from creating or updating clinical guidance, rather the well documented limitations of the evidence base could support a redistribution of some resources to rigorous conduct in other aspects of guideline development such as stakeholder engagement and ensuring implementability. Benchmarking studies of local guideline uptake have demonstrated inconsistent adherence and thus further engagement with HETF stakeholders including people receiving HETF, their carers, clinicians involved in service provision, service managers and guideline and policy-makers, would be warranted.

### A randomised controlled comparison of early post-pyloric versus early gastric feeding to meet nutritional targets in ventilated intensive care patients [^1168xCvT]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Insertion of post-pyloric tube

In order to limit bias, all participants received 500 mg erythromycin intravenously prior to insertion of the enteric tubes. The insertion of the post-pyloric tube commenced after at least 30 minutes of drug administration. The patient was placed in a semi-supine position at 30°. The Corflo ® -Ultra Lite feeding tube was inserted into the stomach to a length of approximately 45 cm. Placement was confirmed by auscultating the stomach while insufflating air. As per the manufacturer's instructions, the tube was flushed with 2 mL water to lubricate the guide wire. The tube was advanced very slowly until a further 15 cm of tube had been inserted. The frequent insertion of 5 to 10 mL air checked for kinking or misplacement. The tube continued to be advanced until it reached 90 cm at the nare for a patient under 80 kg, or 110 cm for a patient weighing more than 80 kg. Abdominal radiography confirmed correct positioning. If the tube was not successfully placed after three attempts, further attempts were abandoned, and the patient was fed via the nasogastric route.

An enteral feeding algorithm which prescribed the appropriate type of feed and target rate was developed by the dietetic department. Height was used to estimate the ideal body weight or adjusted body weight for obese patients. The algorithm prescribed 30 kcal/kg of ideal body weight as this was comparable with 1.3 times the resting energy expenditure as determined by indirect calorimetry. The protein requirement selected for the algorithm was 1.5 g/kg ideal body weight, except in the case of liver and renal failure where the requirement was provided at 1 to 1.2 g/kg.

Enteral feeds were commenced at 40 ml/hour. The nasogastric tube was aspirated every four hours. If the gastric residual was less than 200 mL after four hours, the rate was increased to the recommended target rate. Nasogastric aspirates of greater than 200 mL warranted the use of prokinetic agents. Initially, metoclopramide 10 mg every six hour was prescribed. Erythromycin 250 mg twice daily was added if large aspirates persisted. If GRV remained above 200 mL in the gastric group, a post-pyloric feeding tube was inserted and the feeding regime recommenced. Despite these measures, some participants were unable to successfully absorb enteral feed. These patients progressed to parenteral nutrition.

### Gastric versus small-bowel tube feeding in the intensive care unit: a prospective comparison of efficacy [^112ZUzw1]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the outcomes of intensive care unit patients fed through a nasogastric vs. a nasal-small-bowel tube including the time from tube placement to feeding, time to reach goal rate, and adverse events.

Design

Sixty patients were prospectively randomized to receive gastric or small-bowel tube feedings. Nursing staff attempted to place a feeding tube in the desired position, and placement was confirmed radiographically after each bedside attempt. After two unsuccessful attempts, the feeding tube was placed under fluoroscopy. Feedings were started at 30 mL/hr and advanced to the patient's specific goal rate.

Setting

Twenty-bed medical intensive care unit.

Patients

Sixty medical patients admitted/transferred to the intensive care unit.

Interventions

Tube feeds were held for 2 hrs if any residual was > 200 mL.

Measurements

Times were recorded at the initial tube insertion, onset of feeding, achievement of goal rate, and termination of feeding. Adverse outcomes included witnessed aspiration, vomiting, and clinical/radiographic evidence of aspiration. Patients were followed up for the duration of feeding, until leaving the intensive care unit, or for a maximum of 14 days.

Main Results

Patients fed in the stomach received nutrition sooner from initial placement attempt (11.2 hrs vs. 27.0 hrs) and with fewer attempts (one vs. two) than those fed in the small bowel. Patients achieve goal rate sooner (28.8 hrs vs. 43.0 hrs) with gastric feeding compared with small-bowel feeding. There was no difference in aspiration events.

Conclusions

Gastric feeding demonstrates no increase in aspiration or other adverse outcomes compared with small-bowel feeding in the intensive care unit. Gastric feeding can be started and advanced to goal sooner with fewer placement attempts than small-bowel feeding.

### Year in review 2013: critical care – metabolism [^116GCqWi]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Feeding routes

Previous studies demonstrated that early enteral nutrition reduces the risk of infections when compared with parenteral nutrition. Whether the feeding tubes should be preferentially placed into the stomach or small bowel remains contentious. Nasogastric tubes are relatively easy to insert. However, the disadvantage of the intragastric approach includes delayed gastric emptying and predisposes to inadequate nutrient administration. Small bowel feeding tubes are more difficult to insert, often requiring specific expertise and equipment. Their potential advantages include bypassing the stomach, which should theoretically guarantee delivery of nutrients. In fact, the major gastrointestinal motility disorders in the critically ill appear to occur in the antral-pyloro region of the stomach. A further consideration is that the delivery of nutrients into the small bowel does imply an intact absorption of nutrients.

Over the past decade, four systematic reviews were published about the risk of pneumonia with gastric or small bowel feeding and seemingly reached conflicting results. Two suggested that small bowel feeding reduces the risk of pneumonia, whereas the other two did not. These conflicting results could be related to differences in search strategies, type of patients included, management of gastric emptying, or outcome definition. A new systematic review and meta-analysis including 19 trials (n = 1,394 patients) tried to determine the effect of small bowel feeding compared with gastric feeding on the frequency of pneumonia. The results showed that small bowel feeding in comparison with gastric feeding reduces the risk of pneumonia in critically ill patients, but no difference was seen in mortality, length of ICU stay, or duration of mechanical ventilation. The mechanism by which small bowel feeding could reduce pneumonia is not entirely clear. It has been presumed that increased gastric volume leads to regurgitation and aspiration, yet multiple studies failed to demonstrate an association between elevated gastric residual volume and risk of aspiration. A second systematic review of the same topic was published last year. All randomized controlled studies published between 1990 and 2013 were included. As in the previous study, small bowel feeding was associated with a reduced risk of pneumonia. Duration of ventilation and mortality were also unaffected by the route of feeding.

### A systematic review and quality appraisal of guidelines and recommendations for home enteral tube feeding in adults [^115zLtM5]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Supporting documents including previous and abridged versions, quick reference guides, technical reports, methodological manuals, guideline development policy statements, standard operating procedures and supplementary materials were retrieved prior to quality appraisal. Where applicable, corresponding authors were contacted twice to request access to supporting documents cited in the guideline but not publicly available. If no response was received quality appraisal was conducted without the additional documents.

Data extraction and quality appraisal using AGREE-II was conducted concurrently by two independent reviewers (AK, IT). All appraisers were trained to apply the AGREE-II tool by studying the manual and relevant publications. Application of the tool was also discussed prior to its use by the research team to promote consistency in how the tool was applied (MAF, AK, IT). For AGREE-II items which were not applicable to a guideline a rating of 1 (absence of information) was provided and this score was contexualised as recommended in the AGREE-II manual. 'Recommendations for use' were informed by both the quality assessment and the availability of alternative guidelines. Differences in scores were resolved through discussion and final item scores and overall assessments reached through consensus. An experienced user of the tool (SC) then reviewed consensus scores from items where the two appraisers' scores differed by > 1. Consensus is an appropriate approach when less than four appraisers are available and has been previously employed

Scaled domain scores were calculated using consensus scores and the formula: (obtained consensus score – minimum possible score)/(maximum possible score – minimum possible score). As the AGREE-II user manual does not define quality cut-off scores, high quality guidelines were considered those with domain 3 'rigour of development' scaled scores ≥ 70% as a high score in this domain is indicative of high methodological quality and transparency in reporting. The quality of recommendations from high quality guidelines were then assessed using the AGREE-Recommendation EXcellence (AGREE-REX) tool.

### Definitions and clinical guidance on the enteral dependence component of the avoidant / restrictive food intake disorder diagnostic criteria in children [^114ttKuf]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of the current article is to offer definitive guidance on weaning children who are reliant on nasogastric/gastrostomy feeding tubes. To date, no internationally recognized definitions or principles for interventions exist, and clinics have been reliant on creating their own unique intervention criteria. To achieve the aim, 2 goals are set out within the current article. The first goal was to definitively define the process of tube weaning. To achieve this, both tube dependency and oral eating also required definitions. It is necessary for these 2 additional definitions to fully understand the process of tube weaning and the transition that the child is making within these clinical interventions. The second goal of this article was to propose a set of minimum measurement criteria within a tube weaning protocol so that different clinical practices and perspectives may be measured accurately. This would then allow outcomes from different clinical services to be compared for efficacy. The culmination of this article is a set of 5 core principles that should govern clinics that adhere to the auspices of evidence-based practice. These principles, if adopted, will provide the basis of a set of internationally recognized criteria within this field of pediatric gastroenterology.

### Do prolonged nasogastric tube feedings reduce gastroesophageal reflux in infants? [^116UpJ8t]. publications.aap.org (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Gastroesophageal reflux is common in the neonatal population. While generally benign in infancy, it may lead to adverse respiratory and nutritional outcomes and lengthen hospital stay. Prolonged nasogastric feeding is frequently used to reduce GER. However, prolonging NG feeds may delay gastric emptying or increase transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. Multi-channel intraluminal impedance with pH probe is considered the gold standard for evaluation of GER. To our knowledge, no study has been performed investigating the relationship of feeding duration and GER using MII-pH study as an objective measure. Objective: To determine if prolonging NG tube feedings for one hour or greater is associated with decreased GER and acid exposure. Methods: This is a retrospective data analysis of all infants who underwent MII-pH study between October 2009 and August 2017 and received NG feedings.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^117PcKiV]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Head and neck cancers — use of alternative routes for nutrition (nasogastric [NG] and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy [PEG] tubes) notes that the Panel does not recommend prophylactic PEG or NG tube placement in patients with very good PS and without significant pretreatment weight loss, significant airway obstruction, or severe dysphagia. Prophylactic feeding tube placement should be strongly considered for patients with severe weight loss prior to treatment, 5% weight loss over 1 month, or 10% weight loss over 6 months; ongoing dehydration or dysphagia, anorexia, or pain interfering with the ability to eat/drink adequately; significant comorbidities that may be aggravated by poor tolerance of dehydration, lack of caloric intake, or difficulty swallowing necessary medications; severe aspiration; mild aspiration in patients who are older or have compromised cardiopulmonary function; or for patients for whom long-term swallowing disorders are likely, including those anticipated to receive large fields of high-dose radiation to the mucosa and adjacent connective tissues. For those who did not warrant prophylactic PEG or NG tube placement pre-treatment, caloric intake, treatment-related side effects, and change in body weight should be monitored weekly during treatment. Consider reactive feeding tube placement if two or more of the following criteria apply: inadequate food intake (60% of estimated energy expenditure) anticipated for > 10 days; weight loss of ≥ 5% in 1 month; severe mucositis/mucosal pain, odynophagia, dysphagia (grade 3+), or aspiration; age > 60 years. To maintain swallowing function during and following treatment, patients who may have feeding tube placement should be encouraged to intake orally if they can swallow without, or with minimal, aspiration or any other compromises, and alterations in swallowing function can occur long after treatment and should be monitored for the lifetime of the patient. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Enteral nutrition (EN) feeding system — contamination and infection prevention is addressed under this section, which asks how contamination can be best prevented, and practice recommendations state to "Use a closed EN delivery systems when possible" and "Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for duration of infusion through an intact delivery device (container and administration set)", and "Do not reuse the enteral delivery device for open or closed systems (container and administration set) in excess of what is recommended by the manufacturer". For open systems, the guidance is to "follow recommended hang times and avoid topping off remaining formula" and to "Limit infusion time for open EN feeding systems to 4–8 hours maximum (12 hours in the home setting)", "Limit infusion time for a reconstituted powder product or modular to 4 hours maximum", and "Change the delivery device (container and administration set) according to the manufacturer's recommendations for open systems". Asepsis and handling directions include "Use effective hand hygiene in all aspects of EN preparation and administration", "Give preference to selecting systems that require minimal handling", and "Use equipment dedicated for EN use only". Storage and discard guidance states to "Store prepared or opened ready-to- feed solutions in an appropriate refrigerator, discarding unused solutions within 24 hours of preparation or opening".

### Continuous nasogastric milk feeding versus intermittent bolus milk feeding for premature infants less than 1500 grams [^112qNrEY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Most premature infants less than 1500 grams birth weight must be fed initially by tube because of their inability to suck effectively, or to coordinate sucking, swallowing and breathing. Milk feedings can be given by tube either intermittently, typically over 10–20 minutes every two or three hours, or continuously, using an infusion pump. Although theoretical benefits and risks of each method have been proposed, effects on clinically important outcomes remain uncertain.

Objectives

To examine the evidence from randomized trials regarding the effectiveness of continuous versus intermittent bolus nasogastric milk feeding in premature infants less than 1500 grams. The primary outcomes reviewed included feeding tolerance, days to reach full enteral feeding, somatic growth, days to discharge and incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

Search Strategy

Searches were performed of MEDLINE, CINAHL, HealthSTAR, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. As well, studies identified from abstracts and conference proceedings and references from relevant publications were retrieved.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials that met the following criteria for relevance: a) Enrollment of infants < 1500 grams birth weight with no major congenital anomalies which might interfere with feeding tolerance b) Comparison of continuous nasogastric versus intermittent bolus tube feedings using breastmilk or formula c) Assessment of relevant outcomes including feeding tolerance, days to full feeds, somatic growth, days to discharge, and complications such as NEC or apnea

Data Collection and Analysis

All articles retrieved from the complete search were assessed independently by the two reviewers for relevance (see selection criteria), and for methodologic quality using the following criteria: blinding of randomization, blinding of intervention, complete follow-up and blinding of outcome measurement. Only those articles judged by both reviewers to be relevant and to have appropriate methodologic quality were included in the analysis. Differences were resolved through discussion and consensus of the reviewers.

Main Results

Infants fed by continuous tube feeding method took longer to reach full enteral feeds (weighted mean difference 3.0 days; 95% CI 0.7, 5.2). Although there was no evidence of a difference in the days to discharge overall, one study suggested a trend toward earlier discharge for infants less than 1000 grams birth weight fed by the continuous tube feeding method (mean difference (MD) -11days; 95% CI -21.8, -0.2). Overall, there was no evidence of a difference in somatic growth (weight, length, head circumference or skinfold thickness) between the two groups, but subgroup analyses in one study suggested that infants less than 1000 grams and 1000–1250 grams birthweight gained weight faster when fed by the continuous tube feeding method (MD 2.0 g/day; 95% CI 0.5, 3.5; MD 2.0 g/day; 95% CI 0.2, 3.8, respectively). There was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of NEC. One study showed a trend toward more apneas during the study period in infants fed by the continuous tube feeding method (MD 14.0 apneas during study period; 95% CI -0.2, 28.2).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Infants fed by the continuous tube feeding method took longer to reach full feeds, but there was no difference in somatic growth, days to discharge, or the incidence of NEC for infants fed by continuous versus intermittent bolus tube feeds. Small sample sizes, methodologic limitations and conflicting results of the studies to date, together with inconsistencies in controlling variables that may affect outcomes, make it difficult to make universal recommendations regarding the best tube feeding method for premature infants less than 1500 grams. The clinical benefits and risks of continuous versus intermittent nasogastric tube milk feeding cannot be reliably discerned from the limited information available from randomized trials to date.

### Improving safety and timeliness around nasogastric tube feeding on an acute stroke unit [^112vhPcn]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Our QIP was a successful improvement journey. The project was able to meet its two aims of reducing NGT insertion delays (aimed for < 3 hours but achieved an average of 1.7 hours) as well as to improve risk–benefit documentation in case notes (aimed for > 50% improvement but achieved 80% improvement). The staff survey revealed that there was a change in culture and behaviour within the team, which resulted in sustained improvement.

### Enteral nutrition… [^112EGv9d]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Nutrition is essential to health and can be provided via feeding tube directly into the gut. Nutrition. Short-term Nutrition The preferred means of nutrition, enteral nutrition, is through the gut. It is the most natural way in which nutrients are absorbed, allowing the intestines to do their job, and is safer than intravenous nutrition, which is delivered into the bloodstream. The preferred route for enteral nutrition is through the stomach. A very thin plastic tube can be inserted into a nostril and pushed all the way into the stomach. Liquid nutrition can be given this way at a continuous, set rate or intermittently. Occasionally, a nasojejunal tube is placed instead. This tube is inserted into the part of the small bowel called the jejunum.

This can be done for a variety of reasons, including a condition called gastroparesis, in which the stomach is not working but the rest of the intestine is. The pylorus is the valve that separates the stomach from the rest of the small bowel. Therefore, nasojejunal tubes are also referred to as postpyloric tubes. Long-term Nutrition If patients are expected to require enteral nutrition for longer than a couple of weeks, a long-term solution is needed. This may involve use of tubes that go directly through the abdominal wall into the gut. A gastrostomy tube or a jejunostomy tube can be placed into the stomach or the jejunum, respectively. There are 3 main ways to place these tubes: surgically by a surgeon using general anesthesia; fluoroscopically via x-ray guidance by a radiologist using sedation; or endoscopically by a gastroenterologist or a surgeon using sedation.

These types of tubes can be left in place for months to years. If these tubes become dislodged and come out, the patient, family members, or other caregivers can replace them at home once the tract that the tube has been in is well formed. If a patient regains the ability to eat and no longer needs the tube, it can be removed. The hole usually closes on its own.

### Transitioning from gavage to full oral feeds in premature infants: when should we discontinue the nasogastric tube? [^1129Vriv]. Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal timing for discontinuation of nasogastric (NG) tube in premature infants transitioning to oral feeding is not known.

Objective

To determine whether early removal of NG-tube is appropriate in low-risk premature infants.

Methods

Prospectively collected data of premature infants started on oral feeds at ≤ 34 weeks gestation were reviewed. Infants were categorized into 'early' or 'late' NG-removal groups based on the proportion of oral intake in the preceding 2-days, i.e., 60–79% or 80–100% of the total volume, respectively.

Results

In total 50 infants in early group vs. 43 in late group. Both groups had similar oral intake and weight change in the subsequent 2-days post-NG removal. The days from NG-removal to target oral volume, and to hospital discharge trended shorter in early vs. late group.

Conclusions

Discontinuing NG-tube when the oral feeding competency reaches ~75% of prescribed feeding volume is safe and appropriate in low-risk premature infants.

### Geriatric nutrition in the surgical patient: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care and geriatric trauma committees clinical consensus document [^114P7XPp]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

What is the preferred location for nasoenteric feeding (prepyloric or postpyloric) and permanent access (stomach or small bowel) in geriatric surgical patients with dysphagia?

Recommendation

For geriatric patients with proven dysphagia, we recommend gastric feeds for most patients and reserve small bowel feeds for those not able to tolerate gastric feeds. The choice between gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) and jejunostomy tubes (J-tubes) should be individualized based on a comprehensive evaluation by the medical team.

Discussion

Enteral access management in geriatric surgical patients with dysphagia is a critical aspect of care, necessitating evidence-based decision-making to ensure optimal outcomes. Dysphagia, prevalent in the elderly population, poses significant risks such as aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and dehydration. Therefore, selecting the most appropriate type of enteral access is paramount to mitigate these risks and provide adequate nutrition and hydration. In most instances, gastric feeds are safe, effective, and easier to obtain. Although some studies have shown small bowel feedings to be associated with a lower rate of pneumonia and improved nutrient delivery, these findings have not translated into a significant difference in overall clinical outcomes, including mortality, LOS, or ventilator duration. For this reason, ASPEN suggests, by consensus, that gastric feeds are appropriate in most cases. Ultimately, after considering the lack of significant clinical outcome, our group agrees that gastric feeds are appropriate in most cases, but acknowledge small bowel feeds should be considered for patients who have failed gastric feeds or those considered at very high risk for aspiration.

The decision between permanent G-tubes and J-tubes is also multifaceted and should be guided by individual patient characteristics, surgical considerations, and nutritional requirements. G-tubes, although more straightforward to place and potentially better tolerated in some patients, carry a higher risk of reflux and aspiration due to their placement within the stomach in patients with gastroesophageal reflux. Conversely, J-tubes require a more complex surgical procedure but offer the advantage of bypassing the stomach, which may be particularly beneficial in patients at high risk of aspiration or those with gastric motility disorders. Therefore, the choice between G-tubes and J-tubes necessitates a comprehensive evaluation, considering factors such as the patient's overall health status, underlying medical conditions, surgical feasibility, and long-term nutritional goals.

Predicted severe or necrotizing pancreatitis — route of enteral tube feeding: In patients with predicted severe or necrotizing pancreatitis requiring enteral tube feeding, the AGA suggests either nasogastric or nasoenteral route (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence). Trials did not demonstrate a mortality benefit with either modality (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.44–2.30), and the panel recognizes that safety concerns regarding the risk of aspiration may preclude practitioners from using nasogastric tubes in patients with severe AP.

### Prophylactic versus reactive (PvR) feeding in patients undergoing (chemo) radiation in head and neck cancers: results of a phase III randomized controlled trial [^114ifZcU]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Optimal feeding strategy (Prophylactic vs. Reactive) during Radiation Therapy (RT) for Head and Neck Cancers (HNC) remains to be established.

Methods

This phase III trial randomized (1:1) patients of HNC to prophylactic [nasogastric tube (NGT) placed at least 1 day before RT starting] versus reactive arm (NGT when required). The primary endpoint was the incidence of significant weight loss at 6 months. Secondary endpoints were weight changes, tube duration, dependence, and compliance.

Results

Due to high denial rates, the trial was prematurely closed. Eighty‐four patients (40‐prophylactic, 44‐reactive) were analyzed intention‐to‐treat. Seventeen patients (39%) required a reactive tube insertion. The proportion of patients with significant weight loss at 6 months in the prophylactic versus reactive arms was 13 (32.5%) versus 10 (15.9%), p = 0.44. The median tube duration was 56 days (IQR: 16.5–91) versus 47 days (IQR: 24–59), p = 0.255.

Conclusion

Our limited analysis found that a reactive NGT should be considered for most HNC patients undergoing RT.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^116QNZXx]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Stroke — enteral nutrition (EN) decisions after acute stroke indicate that if the gut is functional and there are no other contraindications, EN is preferred; dysphagia is common after a stroke, occurring in about 25%–50% of all patients, and pneumonia in hospitalized acute stroke patients is reported at 5.6%, increasing hospital cost per patient by $15,000. About 10%–30% of all patients are tube fed in the early phase of stroke. Guidelines recommend considering EN using an nasogastric tube (NGT) if oral intake is not likely to be recovered within 7 days, and stroke guidelines recommend time-limited trials of NGT feeding, typically 2–4 weeks, prior to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. Practice data show variation: a retrospective observational study of 34,623 patients with acute ischemia and stroke found more than half (53%) received PEG within 7 days of admission, with age the greatest determinant of early PEG tube placement (≥ 85 vs 18–54 years); another study reported later placement of PEG tubes (median 17 days from admission to tube placement) associated with a lower 30-day mortality but higher severe disability at discharge. A Cochrane review analyzing 33 RCTs (n = 6779) stated limited data are available of the effects of nutrition, and suggest that PEG and NGT feedings do not differ in terms of case fatality, death, or dependency, while PEG is associated with fewer treatment failures, less GI bleeding, and greater nutrition delivery. For tube security, patients should be considered for a naso tube retaining system or nasal bridle when they are at risk of inadvertent NGT removal or require frequent tube replacement.
