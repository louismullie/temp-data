## Question

Elevated direct bilirubin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate elevated direct (conjugated) bilirubin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true direct hyperbilirubinemia and why fractionation matters. Then, I should verify age-specific thresholds and immediate triage triggers. Next, I will consider the core differential and the initial laboratory and imaging workup. After that, I need to outline condition-specific pathways for neonates, adults, and special populations. Finally, I should double-check pitfalls, assay nuances, and when to escalate to biopsy or transplant referral, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the laboratory abnormality and its significance. Elevated direct bilirubin implies impaired excretion of conjugated bilirubin and is never physiologic in neonates or adults, so I should always fractionate total bilirubin into direct and indirect components before proceeding, because this single step directs the entire diagnostic pathway and prevents misclassification of unconjugated causes as cholestasis [^113iG5vj] [^114Kk3U6] [^116ESYnj].

> Wait, let me verify the neonatal thresholds because I initially thought a direct-to-total ratio greater than 20% might suffice, but hold on, that older ratio-based rule has been de-emphasized. Current AAP and NASPGHAN/ESPGHAN guidance define conjugated or direct hyperbilirubinemia as greater than 1.0 mg/dL (17 μmol/L) and recommend measuring total and direct bilirubin in any formula-fed infant still jaundiced at 2 weeks or any breastfed infant still jaundiced at 3–4 weeks, with urgent evaluation warranted when direct bilirubin exceeds this threshold [^116ESYnj] [^112Vxztf] [^111BDsYZ] [^112U9JL1].

> I should confirm the adult threshold and clinical context. In adults, any elevation of direct bilirubin is abnormal and should prompt evaluation for hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction; I need to ensure I do not anchor on a ratio and instead interpret the absolute direct value alongside liver enzymes and clinical features to distinguish hepatocellular from cholestatic injury patterns [^113iG5vj] [^114Kk3U6] [^1155asMt].

> Next, I should review the initial laboratory panel to characterize the pattern of injury. I will now examine AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT to determine whether the pattern is hepatocellular or cholestatic, add CBC and reticulocytes to screen for hemolysis, and assess synthetic function with albumin and INR, because a cholestatic pattern with elevated ALP and GGT plus direct hyperbilirubinemia points toward impaired bile flow or cholangiopathy, whereas an isolated direct hyperbilirubinemia with otherwise normal enzymes suggests hereditary transport defects such as Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndromes [^1155asMt] [^114Kk3U6] [^114qp9im].

> Hold on, I should verify the first-line imaging choice. Right upper quadrant ultrasound is the initial imaging test of choice to assess for extrahepatic biliary obstruction, ductal dilation, gallstones, mass lesions, and, in infants, features concerning for biliary atresia such as a small or absent gallbladder and nonvisualized common bile duct; if ultrasound is nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high, MRCP or ERCP can further delineate the biliary tree depending on age and clinical context [^116KWv4a] [^112SbFyr] [^114LDDbW].

> Let me consider the neonatal pathway more carefully because time-sensitive surgical disease must be excluded. If a neonate has direct bilirubin greater than 1.0 mg/dL, I should urgently obtain fractionated bilirubin, liver enzymes, GGT, CBC, INR, albumin, glucose, and urine studies including reducing substances, verify newborn screening results for hypothyroidism and galactosemia, and perform an urgent abdominal ultrasound. If biliary atresia remains suspected or imaging is indeterminate, I should arrange expedited hepatology consultation and consider liver biopsy and cholangiography, recognizing that early Kasai portoenterostomy before about 60 days improves native liver survival [^111BDsYZ] [^116wTJS9] [^112aj6wx] [^116G6aU4].

> But wait, what if the infant is younger than 3 days old and already has elevated direct bilirubin. I should double-check for early biliary atresia signals, because emerging data show that some neonates with biliary atresia manifest direct hyperbilirubinemia within the first week of life; in this scenario, a lower direct bilirubin threshold around 0.45 mg/dL has been proposed for early detection, though this requires clinical judgment and correlation with evolving guidelines [^113AK2xS] [^115uEwA4].

> Next, I should review the adult pathway. If ultrasound shows ductal dilation, I need to evaluate for choledocholithiasis, strictures, or malignancy with MRCP or ERCP and proceed to intervention as indicated. If there is no ductal dilation, I should assess for intrahepatic cholestasis with autoimmune markers such as AMA, ANA, and SMA, viral hepatitis serologies, and consider drug-induced liver injury, because conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in adults most commonly reflects hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction rather than hereditary transport defects [^114Kk3U6] [^113iG5vj] [^113s1NHW].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook special populations and rare etiologies. In pregnancy, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy can present with pruritus and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. In critical illness or sepsis, multifactorial cholestasis is common. In patients with cystic fibrosis, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia may signal advanced CF liver disease and should prompt intensified hepatobiliary surveillance. And in infants, low GGT cholestasis suggests specific genetic disorders of bile acid synthesis or transport, guiding targeted genetic testing [^114qp9im] [^116RPvTv] [^112XLmib].

> Hold on, I should verify assay nuances because direct bilirubin is not identical to conjugated bilirubin. The diazo method reports direct bilirubin, which includes conjugated bilirubin plus delta-bilirubin, and values tend to rise with higher total bilirubin. Therefore, when available, measuring true conjugated bilirubin is preferred, and I should avoid overinterpreting small direct fractions at high total bilirubin loads, especially in neonates [^114LWwmT] [^115iiVqh].

> I should double-check the role of the direct-to-total ratio. Historically, a ratio greater than 20% was used to flag cholestasis, but wait, guidelines now advise against relying on the ratio because it is variable and less reliable than an absolute direct bilirubin threshold. Instead, I should use the greater than 1.0 mg/dL cutoff and repeat testing if the initial abnormality is borderline to improve positive predictive value [^116ESYnj] [^113AK2xS] [^115uEwA4].

> Let me reconsider when to escalate to liver biopsy or transplant referral. If serologies and imaging fail to establish a diagnosis, if multiple etiologies are possible, or if there are features of acute liver failure such as INR greater than 1.5 with encephalopathy, I should arrange liver biopsy and urgent hepatology consultation with consideration of transplant center referral, because timely tissue diagnosis and staging can alter management and prognosis substantially [^114Kk3U6] [^1155asMt].

> Finally, I should confirm that my management plan aligns with the identified cause. Supportive care for cholestasis includes nutritional optimization with medium-chain triglycerides and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation, pruritus control with agents like ursodeoxycholic acid when appropriate, and treatment of underlying etiologies such as antiviral therapy for hepatitis, immunomodulation for autoimmune hepatitis, surgical or endoscopic relief of obstruction, and, in infants with biliary atresia, expedited Kasai portoenterostomy followed by long-term surveillance for complications including portal hypertension and cirrhosis [^116G6aU4] [^113Tte81].

Elevated direct (conjugated) bilirubin reflects **impaired bile excretion** due to hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction [^113iG5vj]. In adults, evaluate with **fractionated bilirubin**, liver enzymes, and right upper quadrant ultrasound [^112SbFyr] to distinguish intrahepatic from extrahepatic causes; if the ultrasound is normal, pursue MRCP/ERCP, autoimmune serologies, and consider liver biopsy [^114Kk3U6]. In infants, **direct bilirubin > 1.0 mg/dL is abnormal** [^116ESYnj] and warrants urgent evaluation for biliary atresia and other cholestatic disorders [^111BDsYZ]. Prompt recognition and targeted testing are essential to guide management and prevent progression [^112QciG4].

---

## Physiological basis of direct bilirubin elevation

Direct bilirubin is water-soluble and excreted in bile; its elevation indicates **reduced excretion** from hepatocellular injury or impaired bile flow [^113iG5vj].

---

## Causes of elevated direct bilirubin

Elevated direct bilirubin arises from **hepatocellular, cholestatic, or hereditary** disorders:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Hepatocellular disorders | - Viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV) [^114qp9im] <br/> - Alcoholic hepatitis [^114qp9im] <br/> - Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^notfound] <br/> - Drug-induced liver injury [^114qp9im] <br/> - Autoimmune hepatitis [^1155asMt] |
| Cholestatic disorders | - Primary biliary cholangitis [^114qp9im] <br/> - Primary sclerosing cholangitis [^114qp9im] <br/> - Choledocholithiasis [^114qp9im] <br/> - Biliary strictures [^114qp9im] <br/> - Malignant obstruction (cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer) [^114Kk3U6] |
| Hereditary disorders | - Dubin-Johnson syndrome [^114qp9im] <br/> - Rotor syndrome [^114qp9im] <br/> - Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) [^115k3Uq5] |
| Neonatal cholestasis | - Biliary atresia [^112QciG4] <br/> - Neonatal hepatitis [^117A4dCS] <br/> - Alagille syndrome [^112aj6wx] <br/> - Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^111BDsYZ] |

## Clinical evaluation

### Initial laboratory tests

- **Fractionated bilirubin**: Differentiate direct from indirect hyperbilirubinemia [^113iG5vj].
- **Liver enzymes**: AST, ALT, ALP, GGT to characterize injury pattern [^112XLmib].
- **Complete blood count**: Assess for hemolysis or infection [^112XLmib].
- **Prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR)**: Evaluate hepatic synthetic function [^112RBbyZ].
- **Albumin**: Assess chronic liver disease severity [^112RBbyZ].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging is essential to localize disease and guide next steps. Ultrasound is **first-line** to assess biliary dilation, gallstones, masses, and liver parenchyma [^112SbFyr]. MRCP or ERCP is indicated when ultrasound is inconclusive or to delineate strictures or stones [^113BpbEZ]. CT scan is used when malignancy is suspected or to further characterize masses [^notfound].

---

### Additional tests

Additional tests refine the differential. Autoimmune serologies (ANA, ASMA, AMA) screen for **autoimmune hepatitis, PBC, and PSC** [^113BpbEZ]. Viral hepatitis serologies (**HBV, HCV**) identify viral causes [^1155asMt]. Genetic testing is considered for suspected hereditary cholestasis (e.g. PFIC, Alagille) [^116wTJS9]. Liver biopsy is indicated when noninvasive tests are inconclusive or **to stage disease** [^1155asMt].

---

## Clinical significance and implications

Elevated direct bilirubin indicates **significant hepatobiliary disease** and is never physiologic in neonates or adults [^113iG5vj]. It is associated with pruritus, fat malabsorption, and coagulopathy, and persistent elevation can lead to liver failure and complications such as portal hypertension and encephalopathy [^116G6aU4].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Hepatocellular injury**: Treat underlying cause (e.g. antivirals, immunosuppression, alcohol cessation) [^notfound].
- **Cholestatic disorders**: Relieve obstruction (ERCP, surgery), immunosuppression for autoimmune cholangiopathies [^notfound].
- **Hereditary disorders**: Supportive care, genetic counseling, liver transplantation in advanced cases [^notfound].
- **Neonatal cholestasis**: Urgent evaluation for biliary atresia; surgical intervention (Kasai) if indicated [^112zf4UR].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **etiology and timeliness of intervention**. Early recognition and targeted therapy improve outcomes, whereas delayed diagnosis — particularly in biliary atresia — leads to significant morbidity and mortality [^113RnYSA].

---

Elevated direct bilirubin signals impaired bile excretion from hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction; **prompt, structured evaluation** with fractionated bilirubin, liver enzymes, and imaging enables accurate diagnosis and timely management [^113iG5vj].

Hyperbilirubinemia — bilirubin measurement and consultation triggers state that the direct-reacting or conjugated bilirubin concentration should not be subtracted from the total serum bilirubin concentration when using Figs 2 or 3. If the direct-reacting or conjugated fraction of the TSB exceeds 50% of the TSB, consultation with a knowledgeable specialist (eg, pediatric gastroenterologist or neonatologist) is recommended, and the figure caption also advises to consult an expert. Infants < 24 hours old with a TSB at or above the phototherapy threshold are likely to have a hemolytic process and should be evaluated for hemolytic disease.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

NASPGHAN guideline — Additional testing for chronic liver diseases in children with suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) lists the following: screening labs (complete blood count [CBC] with differential, AST, bilirubin [total, conjugated], alkaline phosphatase, GGT, international normalized ratio [INR], albumin, total protein, hemoglobin A1c); exclude infections (eg, hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, other chronic viral infections); exclude endocrine disorders (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], free thyroxine [T4]); exclude autoimmune causes of ALT elevation (total IgA, total IgG and tissue transglutaminase antibody, antinuclear antibody, antismooth muscle antibody, anti–liver-kidney microsomal antibody); exclude genetic causes (ceruloplasmin and/or 24-hour urine copper, lysosomal acid lipase, alpha-1 antitrypsin phenotype); imaging (abdominal ultrasound to rule out anatomical abnormalities or assess features of portal hypertension, magnetic resonance imaging, or spectroscopy to measure hepatic fat); liver biopsy (histology, copper measurement, stain for microvesicular fat, assess fibrosis); and red flags for advanced liver disease including chronic fatigue, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, jaundice, splenomegaly, firm liver on examination, enlarged left lobe of the liver, low platelets, low white blood cell count, elevated direct bilirubin, elevated international normalized ratio (INR), and long history of elevated liver enzymes (> 2 years).

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^116ESYnj]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

KAS 9 — evaluation of prolonged jaundice: For breastfed infants who are still jaundiced at 3 to 4 weeks of age, and for formula-fed infants who are still jaundiced at 2 weeks of age, the total and direct-reacting (or conjugated) bilirubin concentrations should be measured to identify possible pathologic cholestasis (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X, Recommendation). A direct serum bilirubin concentration > 1.0 mg/dL is defined as abnormal, whereas a cutoff of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL has been used for conjugated bilirubin; nearly all (> 99%) infants with a single elevation of direct or conjugated bilirubin do not have biliary atresia, and the positive predictive value can be greatly improved with a repeat measurement within a few days to 2 weeks. A direct bilirubin concentration of > 20% of the total is no longer regarded as necessary for the diagnosis of cholestasis. When prolonged jaundice occurs, clinicians should also review the newborn screening results, and in formula-fed infants with any prolonged jaundice, or in breastfed infants with direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, consultation with a gastroenterologist or other expert is recommended.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^117A4dCS]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy are diverse.

Objective

Determine the prevalence rates of the specific etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy.

Data Sources

EMBASE and Pubmed were searched electronically and the bibliographies of selected studies were search manually. The search was conducted independently by two authors.

Study Selection

(1) prospective or retrospective case series or cohort study with 10 or more subjects; (2) consecutive infants who presented with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia; (3) subjects underwent appropriate diagnostic work-up for conjugated hyperbilirubinemia; (4) no specific diagnoses were excluded in the studied cohort.

Data Extraction

Patient number, age range, country of origin, and categorical and specific etiologies.

Results

From 237 studies identified, 17 studies encompassing 1692 infants were selected. Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (INH) occurred in 26.0% of cases; the most common specific etiologies were extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) (25.89%), infection (11.47%), TPN- associated cholestasis (6.44%), metabolic disease (4.37%), alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency (4.14%), and perinatal hypoxia/ischemia (3.66%). CMV was the most common infection identified (31.51%) and galactosemia (36.49%) was the most common metabolic disease identified.

Limitations

Major limitations are: (1) inconsistencies in the diagnostic evaluations among the different studies and (2) variations among the sample populations.

Conclusions

INH is the most common diagnosis for conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy while EHBA and infection are the most commonly identified etiologies. The present review is intended to be a guide to the differential diagnosis and evaluation of the infant presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pediatric pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to MRCP/ERCP/EUS, INSPPIRE 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain detailed imaging of the pancreatic ducts and biliary tree (MRCP) if GGT levels are > 2 times the ULN or the direct bilirubin fraction is elevated, even in the absence of evidence of obstructive etiology on ultrasound.

### Neonatal cholestasis [^114C1wUF]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Neonatal jaundice is common and usually not concerning when it is secondary to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, below the neurotoxic level, and resolves early. Primary care providers should be vigilant, however, about evaluating infants in whom jaundice presents early, is prolonged beyond 2 weeks of life, or presents at high levels. Even in well-appearing infants, fractionated (direct and indirect) bilirubin levels should be obtained in these clinical scenarios to evaluate for potential cholestasis. This review presents an approach to the evaluation of a jaundiced infant and discusses diagnosis and management of several causes of neonatal cholestasis.

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^1152D5wG]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

For the primary care provider, cholestatic jaundice in infancy, defined as jaundice caused by an elevated conjugated bilirubin, is an uncommon but potentially serious problem that indicates hepatobiliary dysfunction. Early detection of cholestatic jaundice by the primary care physician and timely, accurate diagnosis by the pediatric gastroenterologist are important for successful treatment and a favorable prognosis. The Cholestasis Guideline Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition has formulated a clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in the infant. The Cholestasis Guideline Committee, consisting of a primary care pediatrician, a clinical epidemiologist (who also practices primary care pediatrics), and five pediatric gastroenterologists, based its recommendations on a comprehensive and systematic review of the medical literature integrated with expert opinion. Consensus was achieved through the Nominal Group Technique, a structured quantitative method. The Committee examined the value of diagnostic tests commonly used for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice and how those interventions can be applied to clinical situations in the infant. The guideline provides recommendations for management by the primary care provider, indications for consultation by a pediatric gastroenterologist, and recommendations for management by the pediatric gastroenterologist. The Cholestasis Guideline Committee recommends that any infant noted to be jaundiced at 2 weeks of age be evaluated for cholestasis with measurement of total and direct serum bilirubin. However, breast-fed infants who can be reliably monitored and who have an otherwise normal history (no dark urine or light stools) and physical examination may be asked to return at 3 weeks of age and, if jaundice persists, have measurement of total and direct serum bilirubin at that time. This document represents the official recommendations of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition on the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics has also endorsed these recommendations. These recommendations are a general guideline and are not intended as a substitute for clinical judgment or as a protocol for the care of all patients with this problem.

KAS 9 — prolonged jaundice evaluation in term and late preterm infants: For breastfed infants who are still jaundiced at 3 to 4 weeks of age and for formula-fed infants who are still jaundiced at 2 weeks of age, the total and direct-reacting (or conjugated) bilirubin concentrations should be measured to identify possible pathologic cholestasis; this is stated as an Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X recommendation.

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^113AXwby]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

We therefore sought to re-evaluate the poorly evidenced thresholds through characterising the natural history of both total and direct bilirubin levels. Total bilirubin levels have previously been shown to decrease reverse-exponentially with age in disease-free neonates, but to our knowledge the variation of direct bilirubin levels with age in this population is yet to be characterised (explaining the lack of evidence behind NICE's 25 µmol/L cut-off). Hence, our aims were to establish the spread of direct bilirubin levels in our sample and concordantly inform national guidance for the investigation of prolonged neonatal jaundice.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® abnormal liver function tests [^112SbFyr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver function tests are commonly obtained in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Various overlapping lab patterns can be seen due to derangement of hepatocytes and bile ducts function. Imaging tests are pursued to identify underlying etiology and guide management based on the lab results. Liver function tests may reveal mild, moderate, or severe hepatocellular predominance and can be seen in alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease, acute hepatitis, and acute liver injury due to other causes. Cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase can be seen with various causes of obstructive biliopathy. Acute or subacute cholestasis with conjugated or unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be seen due to prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic causes. We discuss the initial and complementary imaging modalities to be used in clinical scenarios presenting with abnormal liver function tests. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Phototherapy thresholds — no hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors other than gestational age are presented by gestational age and age in hours from birth to 72 hours (ie, 3 days) and from 3 to 14 days, and these thresholds are based on expert opinion rather than strong evidence. Use total serum bilirubin (TSB) concentrations and do not subtract direct-reacting or conjugated bilirubin; in rare cases of severe hyperbilirubinemia in which the direct-reacting or conjugated bilirubin exceeds 50% of the TSB, consult an expert. Note that infants < 24 hours old with a TSB at or above the phototherapy threshold are likely to have a hemolytic process and should be evaluated for hemolytic disease. Hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors include gestational age < 38 weeks; albumin < 3.0 g/dL; isoimmune hemolytic disease, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or other hemolytic conditions; sepsis; or any significant clinical instability in the previous 24 hours.

### Cystic fibrosis screening, evaluation, and management of hepatobiliary disease consensus recommendations [^116RPvTv]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

M6. The CFF recommends that PwCF and advanced liver disease undergo liver-specific physical examination and measurement of AST, ALT, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, conjugated (or direct) bilirubin, albumin, platelets, and international normalized ratio (INR) at least every 6 months to detect progression of liver disease.

Elevations of AST and ALT are seen during hepatocellular inflammation and of GGT during cholestasis or biliary inflammation. GGT elevation has been associated with the presence of CFHBI or progression to aCFLD. Elevated conjugated bilirubin may occur in aCFLD with profound hepatocellular destruction. Albumin and INR are markers of liver synthetic function. Previous studies have not specifically evaluated the utility of monitoring albumin and INR to detect progression of hepatobiliary disease in CF. However, in the presence of aCFLD, understanding liver synthetic function is essential in evaluating progression of liver disease and risk for comorbidities such as ascites or variceal bleeding. Low or decreasing platelets over time may indicate development/progression of portal hypertension, regardless of the absolute value. aCFLD is generally a slowly progressive disease for which twice-yearly evaluation of inflammation, cholestasis, liver function, and progression of portal hypertension will allow earlier recognition of changes in those PwCF who have already been identified to have aCFLD.

### NASPGHAN guidelines for training in pediatric gastroenterology [^115yJQHk]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Medium credibility.

NASPGHAN hepatology training — importance and medical knowledge emphasize that because diseases of the liver and biliary tract have a significant impact on children, trainees in pediatric gastroenterology should have comprehensive exposure to the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders, their complications, and their pathophysiology; trainees should understand the normal structure and function of the liver and biliary tree and the prevalence, natural history, age-appropriate differential diagnoses, and genetic and other risk factors of hepatobiliary disorders; caring for children with hepatobiliary disease requires understanding of both common and rare causes including infectious, metabolic, genetic, anatomic, immunologic, and toxic; trainees should understand varying clinical manifestations including issues unique to pediatric hepatobiliary disorders (eg, effects on growth, nutrition, puberty, psychosocial functioning); and trainees also should have a complete understanding of diagnostic criteria that distinguish liver and biliary diseases with common patterns of presentation (eg, cholestasis, neonatal cholestasis, elevated aminotransferases, hepatomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, acute liver failure, direct or indirect hyperbilirubinemia, ascites) including differences in affected populations, results of laboratory evaluations, histopathology, radiologic studies, and disease course.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is an emerging literature suggesting that the current reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions. Elevations of either fraction will therefore lead to a rise in the measured bilirubin concentration. The most common cause of an isolated elevated bilirubin concentration is Gilbert's syndrome, which is an inherited disorder of metabolism and leads to impaired conjugation via reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase.

Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (INH) occurred in 26.0% of cases; the most common specific etiologies were extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) (25.89%), infection (11.47%), TPN- associated cholestasis (6.44%), metabolic disease (4.37%), alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency (4.14%), and perinatal hypoxia/ischemia (3.66%). CMV was the most common infection identified (31.51%) and galactosemia (36.49%) was the most common metabolic disease identified.

Limitations

Major limitations are: (1) inconsistencies in the diagnostic evaluations among the different studies and (2) variations among the sample populations.

Conclusions

INH is the most common diagnosis for conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy while EHBA and infection are the most commonly identified etiologies. The present review is intended to be a guide to the differential diagnosis and evaluation of the infant presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^115SQBtF]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Synthesis of results

Results from all of the studies were pooled to provide rate estimates of categorical and specific etiologies of cholestasis. Rate estimates for etiologic categories were calculated from the number of subjects used in the entire review. Rate estimates for specific infectious and metabolic etiologies used the total number of subjects reported with specific infectious and metabolic disorders as the denominator.

Sources of bias across studies

Variability in diagnostic evaluations and the potential for overestimation of INH represent possible sources for bias. The identification of multiple etiologies in individual patients as well as inconsistencies and vagaries in nomenclature were potential sources of error when studies were combined. In some cases, delayed clinical presentation may have affected diagnostic accuracy.

### Direct bilirubin and risk of biliary atresia… [^115uEwA4]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

Early detection of biliary atresia is important for optimal treatment. Direct bilirubin levels are used for BA screening. In this study, we aimed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of elevated D-bil and the direct-to-total bilirubin ratio for BA detection in high-risk infants. D-bil ≥ 1. 0 mg/dL was better for BA detection than the D/T ratio in infants aged 3 to 60 days. For newborns aged < 3 days, a more definitive cutoff point is required. Patients with biliary atresia have elevated direct or conjugated bilirubin levels shortly after birth, suggesting their potential for earlier biliary atresia detection. Direct bilirubin ≥ 1. 0 mg/dL was optimal in infants aged 3 to 60 days and is preferable to the direct-to-total bilirubin ratio. For newborns aged < 3 days, D-bil > 0. 45 mg/dL is the acceptable cutoff point. Cholestatic jaundice affects ∼1 in every 2500 to 5000 infants.

1–3 In the joint guidelines of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, abnormal direct bilirubin is defined as a serum level > 1. 0 mg/dL in the presence of elevated total bilirubin. 4 Previously, a direct-to-total bilirubin ratio > 20% was also considered to indicate cholestasis.
5. However, there was no clearly defined upper limit for the newborn group, and the normal ranges varied among laboratories. Therefore, a positive result was defined as D-bil ≥ 0. 5 mg/dL on the basis of a study by Harpavat et al, 18 who used this as the cutoff point for newborns within the first 72 hours of life. 18 demonstrated elevated D-bil levels in patients with BA during the first 24 hours of life, with higher mean D-bil levels seen in patients with BA compared with healthy infants at 24 to 48 hours after birth.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of antiviral therapy [^112yic8T]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common side effect of antiviral medications. The mechanisms underlying its development are multiple and unique to each therapy. During administration of antiviral medications, the hyperbilirubinemia observed in the absence of liver injury is most frequently manifested by isolated increases in the indirect-reacting fraction. Relevant mechanisms leading to indirect hyperbilirubinemia in this setting include hemolysis, decreased hepatic bilirubin clearance as a result of impairment of bilirubin conjugation, or circumstances in which both processes occur simultaneously. Underlying genetic susceptibilities may potentiate these side effects of antiviral therapy. Conjugated (direct-reacting) hyperbilirubinemia can be a consequence of generalized hepatocellular injury, selective cholestatic defects, biliary obstruction, or, rarely, genetic disorders of bilirubin transport. In the specific setting of antiviral therapy, preexisting liver disease or antiviral hepatotoxicity, such as is encountered with the use of the nucleoside and non-nucleoside human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are the most frequent causes of direct-reacting or mixed direct- and indirect-reacting hyperbilirubinemia. Modification in antiviral drug choice or dose may be required in cases of liver injury or of brisk hemolysis leading to significant anemia. The mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia associated with impairment in conjugation tends to be well tolerated and of little consequence. The decision to continue or discontinue antiviral therapy in the face of hyperbilirubinemia should be made after an assessment of the cause of the elevated bilirubin level and a thorough assessment of the risks and benefits of antiviral therapy.

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^112QciG4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice in infancy affects approximately 1 in every 2500 term infants and is infrequently recognized by primary providers in the setting of physiologic jaundice. Cholestatic jaundice is always pathologic and indicates hepatobiliary dysfunction. Early detection by the primary care physician and timely referrals to the pediatric gastroenterologist/hepatologist are important contributors to optimal treatment and prognosis. The most common causes of cholestatic jaundice in the first months of life are biliary atresia (25%-40%) followed by an expanding list of monogenic disorders (25%), along with many unknown or multifactorial (eg, parenteral nutrition-related) causes, each of which may have time-sensitive and distinct treatment plans. Thus, these guidelines can have an essential role for the evaluation of neonatal cholestasis to optimize care. The recommendations from this clinical practice guideline are based upon review and analysis of published literature and the combined experience of the authors. The committee recommends that any infant noted to be jaundiced after 2 weeks of age be evaluated for cholestasis with measurement of total and direct serum bilirubin, and that an elevated serum direct bilirubin level (direct bilirubin levels > 1.0mg/dL or > 17μmol/L) warrants timely consideration for evaluation and referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist or hepatologist. Of note, current differential diagnostic plans now incorporate consideration of modern broad-based next-generation DNA sequencing technologies in the proper clinical context. These recommendations are a general guideline and are not intended as a substitute for clinical judgment or as a protocol for the care of all infants with cholestasis. Broad implementation of these recommendations is expected to reduce the time to the diagnosis of pediatric liver diseases, including biliary atresia, leading to improved outcomes.

### Newborn with lethargy, jaundice, and coagulopathy [^116agbHu]. Pediatrics in Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Laboratory results include the following: white blood cell count, 21,600/μL (21.6×109/L; reference range, 9,000–30,000/μL [9–30×109/L]); hemoglobin, 18.2 g/dL (182 g/L; reference range, 14.0–24.0 g/dL [140–240 g/L]); platelet count, 111×103/μL (111×109/L; reference range, 150–450×103/μL [150–450×109/L]); blood type, B+; direct antiglobulin test, negative; and reticulocyte count, 4% (reference range, 3%-7%). Comprehensive metabolic panel is significant for hyponatremia, with a sodium level of 132 mEq/L (132 mmol/L; reference range, 135–145 mEq/L [135–145 mmol/L]). Liver enzyme levels are normal (alanine aminotransferase, 41 U/L [0.68 μkat/L]; aspartate aminotransferase, 86 U/L [1.44 μkat/L]), as are total protein (5.4 g/dL [54 g/L]) and albumin (3.0 g/dL [30 g/L]) levels. Repeated bilirubin level is 12.4 mg/dL (212 µmol/L) at 14 hours after birth, with an elevated direct bilirubin level of 2.9 mg/dL (49.6 µmol/L). Direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is defined as a direct bilirubin level greater than 2 mg/dL (34.2 mmol/L) or more than 20% of total bilirubin. γ-Glutamyl transferase level is normal. Coagulation studies show an elevated prothrombin time of 23.4 seconds (reference range, 11–17 seconds), with an international normalized ratio of 2.1 (reference range, 0.9–1.3); activated partial thromboplastin level is 49.5 seconds (reference range, 30–60 seconds). Fibrinogen level is decreased at 70 mg/dL (0.70 g/L) (reference range, 230–450 mg/dL [230–450 g/L]). Lactate level is 24.3 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L; reference range, 2.0–26.9 mg/dL [0.22–2.98 mmol/L]). Ammonia level is 96.6 µg/dL (69 μmol/L; reference range, 89.6–149.9 µg/dL [64–107 μmol/L]). Cerebrospinal fluid studies are unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and echocardiography are normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows diffuse hepatic echogenicity. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures are negative. Further testing reveals the diagnosis.

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^113D2Jke]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Biliary atresia and other congenital liver diseases are distinguished from physiological prolonged neonatal jaundice as they are associated with conjugated (direct), rather than unconjugated, hyperbilirubinaemia.
The natural history of the total bilirubin level in the first 4 weeks of life in disease-free neonates is to decrease over time.
The criteria currently recommended for further investigation in cases of prolonged neonatal jaundice are variable and supported by little evidence.

What this study hopes to add?

In disease-free states, direct bilirubin decreases with age, particularly at the level of the individual. We produce centile charts that may serve as reference tools.
However, the direct–total bilirubin ratio shows no clear trend and thus is an unreliable marker of serious pathology, including congenital liver disease.
Our data support the NICE guidance advocating investigation for liver disease in neonates with conjugated bilirubin > 25 µmol/L, although more stringent criteria may also be valid.

Differential diagnosis

The differential is broad in a patient presenting with jaundice and pruritus whose laboratory workup show conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. A useful branch point is determining if the obstruction is extrahepatic or intrahepatic. A history that is inconsistent with an acute presentation and an unremarkable right upper quadrant ultrasound narrows the differential to intrahepatic causes of cholestasis. With findings of ductal dilatation and non-necrotising granulomas on biopsy, the leading differential for our patient included primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and biliary sarcoidosis.

### Findings in percutaneous trans-hepatic cholecysto-cholangiography in neonates and infants presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia: emphasis on differential diagnosis and cholangiographic patterns [^115k3Uq5]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The presence of normal opacification and morphology on PTCC makes the diagnosis of BA very unlikely, and helps avoid further invasive investigations, such as laparotomy with intraoperative cholangiography, in most patients. These results are consistent with previous studies which have identified up to 72.2% reduction of other invasive diagnostic procedures using PTCC. On later follow-up, none were subsequently diagnosed as BA. In our practice, a normal PTCC does not change the decision to perform a planned liver biopsy during the same visit to IR as histologic assessment will aid in the differential diagnosis of the ongoing cholestasis.

The GGT levels were significantly higher in patients with an abnormal PTCC compared to a normal PTCC. In jaundiced neonates and infants presenting with an elevated GGT, an abnormal cholangiography may be likely. High GGT cholestasis has been described in Alagille syndrome, PFIC type 3 and frequently in BA. In the diagnosis of BA, elevated GGT has diagnostic accuracies at varying cut-off levels, and is particularly useful in patients < 120 days old; it is incorporated into diagnostic work-up for BA. In this study the levels of GGT were significantly higher in patients diagnosed with BA compared to other diagnoses. This study's results further support the use of GGT in the diagnostic work-up of suspected BA.

### Association of early direct bilirubin levels and biliary atresia among neonates [^113RnYSA]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Biliary atresia (BA) is a fibrosclerosing cholangiopathy resulting in obstruction of the biliary tree. Diagnosis and early performance of the Kasai hepatic portoenterostomy improves outcomes. Current guidelines recommend measurement of direct bilirubin (DB) or conjugated bilirubin levels in neonates who are still jaundiced at age 2 to 3 weeks. However, recent studies have documented the elevation of DB or conjugated bilirubin levels within the first days after birth in neonates with BA, suggesting that BA is a developmental cholangiopathy associated with a genetic, prenatal, or developmental event. To test this hypothesis, this case series evaluated DB levels in the first days after birth among neonates who were subsequently diagnosed with BA.

### Rolling stones: an instructive case of neonatal cholestasis [^114Y56Rm]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Jaundice within the first 1–2weeks of a neonate's life will generally self-resolve; however, if it lasts longer than this time frame it warrants further work up. Direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia can suggest neonatal cholestasis, which in turn reflects marked reduction in bile secretion and flow. The differential diagnosis for neonatal cholestasis is broad. Neonatal choledocholithiasis is a rare cause of neonatal cholestasis, but should be considered on the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with elevated conjugated bilirubin.

Case Presentation

We describe an infant who presented with neonatal cholestasis. He subsequently underwent work up for biliary atresia, as this is one of the more time-sensitive diagnoses that must be made in neonates with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. He was ultimately found to have choledocholithiasis on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. He was managed conservatively with optimizing nutrition and ursodeoxycholic acid therapy.

Conclusions

We found that conservative management, specifically optimizing nutrition and treating with ursodeoxycholic acid, can be a sufficient approach to facilitating resolution of the choledocholithiasis and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to bilirubin measurement, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider using the rate of increase to identify infants at higher risk of subsequent hyperbilirubinemia if > 1 transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin measure is available. Suspect hemolysis in case of a rapid rate of increase (≥ 0.3 mg/dL/hour in the first 24 hours or ≥ 0.2 mg/dL/hour thereafter). Obtain a direct antiglobulin test in this case if not previously done.

### Neonatal cholestasis [^116G6aU4]. Seminars in Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Any infant who is jaundiced beyond two to three weeks of life should be evaluated for neonatal cholestasis. Neonatal cholestasis is defined as accumulation of bile substances in blood due to impaired excretion. These infants should always have fractionated serum bilirubin levels checked to differentiate the conjugated hyperbilirubinemia of cholestasis from unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that is usually benign and spontaneously resolves. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, pale stools and dark urine are the cardinal features of neonatal cholestasis. The differential diagnosis of cholestasis is extensive and a systematic approach is helpful to quickly establish the diagnosis. Biliary atresia is a common cause of neonatal cholestasis and affected infants need surgery before 60 days of life for better prognosis. Premature infants have multifactorial cholestasis and need a modified approach to the evaluation of cholestasis. Management of cholestasis is mostly supportive, consisting of medical management of complications of chronic cholestasis like pruritus and nutritional support for malabsorption and vitamin deficiency.

Persistently cholestatic infant — targeted investigations (Tier 1 and Tier 2) are organized stepwise. Tier 1 aims "to evaluate after cholestasis has been established in order to both identify treatable disorder as well as to define the severity of the liver involvement", including laboratory tests such as "Blood — CBC + differential, INR, AST, ALT, AP, GGTP, TB, DB (or conjugated bilirubin), albumin and glucose", urine testing ("Urine — urinalysis, culture, reducing substances (rule out galactosemia)"), confirmation of newborn screening results ("Verify results of treatable disorders (such as galactosemia and hypothyroidism) from newborn screen"), and imaging ("Obtain fasting ultrasound"). Tier 2 aims "to complete a targeted evaluation in concert with pediatric gastroenterologist/hepatologist", expanding to endocrine and bile acid labs ("General — TSH and T4 values, serum bile acids, cortisol"), infectious and genetic assessments ("ID — direct nucleic acid testing via PCR for CMV, HSV, listeria" and "Genetics — in discussion with pediatric gastroenterologist/hepatologist, with a low threshold for gene panels or exome sequencing"), cystic fibrosis testing ("Sweat chloride analysis (serum immunoreactive trypsinogen level or CFTR genetic testing as appropriate)"), additional imaging ("CXR — lung and heart disease" and "Spine — spinal abnormalities (such as butterfly vertebrae)"), cardiac evaluation ("Echocardiogram — evaluating for cardiac anomalies seen in Alagille syndrome"), tissue diagnosis ("Liver biopsy (timing and approach will vary according to institution and expertise)"), and selected specialty consultations ("Cardiology/ECHO (if murmur present or has hypoxia, poor cardiac function)").

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^115Txxj6]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Jaundice is an indication of hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by derangements in bilirubin metabolism. It is typically apparent when serum bilirubin levels exceed 3 mg/dL and can indicate serious underlying disease of the liver or biliary tract. A comprehensive medical history, review of systems, and physical examination are essential for differentiating potential causes such as alcoholic liver disease, biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, drug-induced liver injury, hemolysis, or hepatitis. Initial laboratory evaluation should include assays for bilirubin (total and fractionated), a complete blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio. Measuring fractionated bilirubin allows for determination of whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Ultrasonography of the abdomen, computed tomography with intravenous contrast media, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are first-line options for patients presenting with jaundice, depending on the suspected underlying etiology. If the etiology of jaundice is unclear despite laboratory testing and imaging, liver biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the disease.

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^117GESt2]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolonged neonatal jaundice is yellowing of the skin and sclerae, secondary to hyperbilirubinaemia, persisting beyond 14 days after birth. It is very common — 20–30% of breastfed neonates are still jaundiced at 1 month — and is usually transient and benign; however, it can be an important indicator of serious underlying pathology. The most common cause is physiological jaundice (especially in breastfed neonates), but a number of disease processes must be excluded, including haemolysis, sepsis, hypothyroidism, cystic fibrosis, metabolic disease and liver disease (mainly congenital hepatitis B/C or biliary atresia). It is particularly important to diagnose biliary atresia as, although rare, it is the only cause that is usually asymptomatic but in which early specialist assessment and surgery (Kasai portoenterostomy; ideally within 6–8 weeks of age) are crucial for prognosis. The abnormality of the biliary tree causes an obstructive jaundice with conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinaemia, whereas physiological jaundice and almost all other pathological causes result in a predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence — the primary publisher of UK clinical guidelines (NICE) — guidance is that the cause of prolonged jaundice requires investigation and referral for any neonate with a conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia > 25 µmol/L, but this is based on no referenced data. The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHN) recently released an updated guideline in collaboration with their European Society (ESPGHN) recommending further investigation under the definition of an abnormal direct bilirubin (a slight overestimate of conjugated bilirubin — see the Methods section) as > 1.0 mg/dL (17.2 µmol/L). Their previous guideline, which also incorporated the direct–total bilirubin ratio, acknowledged that their thresholds are based on 'lower quality studies'. And they now state that the move away from using the ratio is for simplicity rather than any novel evidence.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hyperbilirubinemia [^113RoB3n]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Jaundice, the physical finding associated with hyperbilirubinemia, results when the liver is unable to properly metabolize or excrete bilirubin. The purpose of this review is to examine some of the most common causes of jaundice in adults, provide insight into the diagnostic evaluation of jaundice, and review information on the outcomes of patients with jaundice.

Recent Findings

An elevated level of bilirubin almost always indicates the presence of an underlying disease state. The best approach to evaluating a patient with jaundice is to start with a careful history and physical examination, followed by imaging assessment of the biliary tree and liver. There are algorithm models that incorporate bilirubin levels in their predictor models for outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease (i.e., the model for end-stage liver disease). However, there are few studies that have examined the outcomes of patients with jaundice.

Summary

Evaluation of patients with jaundice starts with a careful history and physical examination, followed by directed imaging of the biliary tree and liver. Although jaundice is generally believed to be a serious medical condition, there is little literature that addresses outcomes in patients with jaundice.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Findings in percutaneous trans-hepatic cholecysto-cholangiography in neonates and infants presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia: emphasis on differential diagnosis and cholangiographic patterns [^112wcRbQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

PTCC is a percutaneous procedure in which radio-opaque contrast is injected into the gallbladder (GB) under fluoroscopy to delineate the biliary tree. It is a minimally invasive diagnostic alternative to intra-operative cholangiography. Timely and expedited BA diagnosis is essential to improve outcomes, as the earliest a Kasai procedure is performed, the better the prognosis for native liver survival.

There are a limited number of studies focused on PTCC in this clinical context. Due to the disease rarity, there is a paucity of published images, and patient cohorts are small.

The objectives of this study are to retrospectively analyze PTCC findings in a cohort of neonates and infants with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and suspected BA, correlating the imaging with their final diagnosis; and to identify abnormal patterns which warrant further investigations, such as intra-operative cholangiography.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113iG5vj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

Diagnostic approach to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and initial laboratory testing includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin, with serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) as severity markers. Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: an unexpected cause [^117E5NEu]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common cause for newborn hospital admission. Although the cause of hyperbilirubinemia is usually benign and self-limited, there is always a large differential diagnosis. Atypical presenting signs and symptoms, such as significant anemia or bleeding, should encourage further evaluation for underlying disorders, such as inherited coagulation defects. This article describes the case of a 5-day-old infant who presented to the emergency department with hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and ecchymoses from birth trauma. His hospital course is described, along with a review on the background, evaluation, management, and complications of hemophilia A.

### Association of early direct bilirubin levels and biliary atresia among neonates [^113AK2xS]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Our study had limitations, including the retrospective design and a small sample size. We could also have missed some cases of BA and excluded others because there was no measurement of DB in the first week. Nevertheless, our findings confirmed published data documenting that neonates with BA manifest direct hyperbilirubinemia within the first week of life (and, in some cases, as early as the first day) and that DB levels increase over time. Harpavat et alfound that all 35 patients with BA in their study had an elevated conjugated bilirubin or DB level within 60 hours of birth. Although previously considered relevant, a DB-to-TSB ratio of more than 20% is no longer recommended as a diagnostic test that suggests the presence of cholestatic jaundice. The North American and European Societies for Pediatric Gastroenterology Guideline recommended that "an elevated serum direct bilirubin level (direct bilirubin levels > 1 mg/dL or 17 μmol per liter) warrants timely consideration for evaluation and referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist or hepatologist". Most of our patients had initial DB-to-TSB ratios less than 0.2, which questions the clinical relevance of a ratio of 0.2 or greater as a screening modality for neonatal cholestasis.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^116f2hGF]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia exchange transfusion thresholds by gestational age for infants with any recognized hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors other than gestational age are presented for two time windows: from birth to 72 hours (ie, 3 days) and from 3 to 14 days, and these thresholds are based on expert opinion rather than strong evidence; the stippled lines for the first 24 hours indicate uncertainty because of the wide range of clinical circumstances and responses to intensive phototherapy. Use total serum bilirubin concentrations; do not subtract direct bilirubin from the total serum bilirubin, and in rare cases of severe hyperbilirubinemia in which the direct-acting or conjugated bilirubin exceeds 50% of the TSB, consult an expert; hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors include gestational age < 38 weeks; albumin < 3.0 g/dL; isoimmune hemolytic disease, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or other hemolytic conditions; sepsis; or any significant clinical instability in the previous 24 hours.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^113EquiN]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice in adults can be an indicator of significant underlying disease. It is caused by elevated serum bilirubin levels in the unconjugated or conjugated form. The evaluation of jaundice relies on the history and physical examination. The initial laboratory evaluation should include fractionated bilirubin, a complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, ?-glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time and/or international normalized ratio, albumin, and protein. Imaging with ultrasonography or computed tomography can differentiate between extrahepatic obstructive and intrahepatic parenchymal disorders. Ultrasonography is the least invasive and least expensive imaging method. A more extensive evaluation may include additional cancer screening, biliary imaging, autoimmune antibody assays, and liver biopsy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with increased bilirubin production caused by red blood cell destruction, such as hemolytic disorders, and disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs in disorders of hepatocellular damage, such as viral and alcoholic hepatitis, and cholestatic disorders, such as choledocholithiasis and neoplastic obstruction of the biliary tree.

### Circulating bilirubin levels and risk of colorectal cancer: serological and mendelian randomization analyses [^114KZxYg]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We investigated the relation between pre-diagnostic levels of circulating UCB, the main component of total bilirubin, and CRC risk in the EPIC study, and then complemented these analyses with an MR approach using data from large-scale genetic consortia of CRC. In the serological analysis, higher circulating levels of UCB were positively associated with CRC risk in men and inversely associated in women. The complementary MR analysis supported a positive association between total bilirubin levels, genetically predicted by a UGT1A1 SNP (rs6431625), and CRC risk in men, but not in women. We further found that bilirubin levels predicted by instrumental variables excluding the UGT1A1 SNP were suggestive of an inverse association with CRC in men, which is in line with our initial hypothesis, but not in women.

These directionally different associations of bilirubin-raising genetic instruments with CRC in men suggest that the UGT1A1 SNP either has horizontal pleiotropic effects through pathways other than elevated blood levels of bilirubin or indicates an elevated bilirubin distribution among individuals with GS as compared to the general population. Both scenarios are biologically plausible.

Potential pleiotropic effects of the UGT1A1 SNP include a reduced capacity of the UGT1A1 enzyme in the liver or gut to metabolize xenobiotics and toxic substances (e.g. heterocyclic aromatic amines, in well-done red meat). Furthermore, the influence of sex hormones on UGT1A1 activity, and differences in UGT1A1 expression between men and women, leading to differential bilirubin conjugation and circulating levels, might partly explain the sex differences in CRC risk found in this study. There is suggestive evidence for sex differences in the UGT1A1 variants and CRC risk. In our control outcome and yet unpublished work, we observed similar sex differences in associations between bilirubin, predicted by the same UGT1A1 SNP, and risk of pancreatic cancer (suggestive positive association in men and null association in women) using data of genetic consortia on pancreatic cancer (Supplementary Table 5, see Additional file 1).

### The patient presenting with isolated hyperbilirubinemia [^114SbPka]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common laboratory finding in clinical practice, being found in several haematological and liver diseases as well as in familial conditions (5–10% in Western countries). Although most of the familial forms of hyperbilirubinemia are classically viewed as benign conditions, they have gained an increased interest in the last few years since recent data have indicated that subjects with an impaired bilirubin metabolism may have an increased susceptibility to drug toxicity. The authors briefly review the main steps of bilirubin metabolism, with a special emphasis on the emerging concepts on the molecular mechanisms of regulation by nuclear receptors (NRs) and genetic factors. Then the different forms of isolated hyperbilirubinemia occurring in both adults and paediatrics are systematically analysed, and a new categorisation is also proposed in light of the recent advances in bilirubin research. Finally, a diagnostic algorithm is discussed, along with a correct approach to its management, in order to avoid unnecessary medical investigations.

Prolonged indirect hyperbilirubinemia — definition and management: Infants 7 days or older with a persistently elevated TSB within 2 mg/dL of the phototherapy threshold may have prolonged indirect hyperbilirubinemia, which can be confirmed by measuring serum direct-reacting or conjugated bilirubin in addition to total bilirubin, and because most such infants have been discharged, it is an option to treat prolonged indirect hyperbilirubinemia within 2 mg/dL of the phototherapy threshold with home phototherapy.

### Rolling stones: an instructive case of neonatal cholestasis [^113Tte81]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Jaundice within the first 1–2 weeks of a neonate's life will generally self-resolve; however, if it lasts longer than this time frame it warrants further work up. Direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia can suggest neonatal cholestasis, which in turn reflects marked reduction in bile secretion and flow. The differential diagnosis for neonatal cholestasis is broad. Neonatal choledocholithiasis is a rare cause of neonatal cholestasis, but should be considered on the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with elevated conjugated bilirubin.

Case presentation

We describe an infant who presented with neonatal cholestasis. He subsequently underwent work up for biliary atresia, as this is one of the more time-sensitive diagnoses that must be made in neonates with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. He was ultimately found to have choledocholithiasis on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. He was managed conservatively with optimizing nutrition and ursodeoxycholic acid therapy.

Conclusions

We found that conservative management, specifically optimizing nutrition and treating with ursodeoxycholic acid, can be a sufficient approach to facilitating resolution of the choledocholithiasis and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

### Unusual case of immune haemolytic disease causing severe neonatal cholestasis in a newborn [^11558j4C]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is a very common entity witnessed in most of the newborns. Rarely are there events where the bilirubin levels reach extreme values mandating invasive therapy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia when solely present is easy to manage and diagnose the common aetiological factors associated with it. The issue arises when we come across a mixed picture of conjugated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and puts us in a dilemma as to what are we treating. Our case highlights a similar picture where we witnessed the highest documented levels of total bilirubin but to our surprise the major component of which was direct bilirubin. This report takes us through the differentials which were ruled out and our management strategies for solving this rare mystery.

### Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the neonate and young infant [^116pxvo2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice in the first few weeks of life may herald potentially life-threatening pathology. It is therefore incumbent upon the pediatric practitioner to have a high index of suspicion for severe disease when investigating jaundice in a young infant.

Bilirubin thresholds and assay considerations in neonatal cholestasis: Jaundice or icterus is clinically evident when the total serum bilirubin level exceeds 2.5 to 3.0 mg/dL (42–51 μmol/L). Because the diazo or van den Bergh method does not specifically measure conjugated bilirubin but rather direct bilirubin, which includes both conjugated bilirubin and delta bilirubin, and because the higher the total bilirubin the higher the reported direct bilirubin, specific measurement of conjugated bilirubin is preferred when available. In the presence of elevated total bilirubin, direct/conjugated bilirubin levels are considered abnormal when values are > 1.0 mg/dL (17 μmol/L) regardless of the total bilirubin; thus, for this guideline, an abnormal direct/conjugated bilirubin is defined as a serum value > 1.0 mg/dL (17 μmol/L).

### Assessment of UGT polymorphisms and neonatal jaundice [^112qqg88]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevation of the serum bilirubin level is a common, if not universal, finding during the first week of life. This can be a transient phenomenon that resolves spontaneously or can signify a serious or even life-threatening condition. There are many causes of hyperbilirubinemia and related therapeutic and prognostic implications. The diseases in which there is a primary disorder of the metabolism of bilirubin will be reviewed regarding their clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. These disorders-Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar Syndrome-both involve abnormalities in bilirubin conjugation secondary to deficiency of bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase. The purpose of this article is to review the current understanding of the genetic polymorphisms that result in these diseases and discuss recent advances in diagnosis and treatment.

Evaluation of jaundice in infants — initial testing and timing at the 2‑week visit: The most important initial step in evaluating a jaundiced infant is measurement of total and direct (or conjugated) bilirubin, as visual estimation is unreliable and cannot determine indirect versus direct hyperbilirubinemia. Jaundice at 2 weeks of age is a relatively common finding, observed in 2.4% to 15% of newborns, but it should alert the provider of the possibility of cholestasis. Providers have several options: the most direct is to test serum for total and direct bilirubin at the 2‑week visit (or if concerned at any age). If the 2‑week‑old infant is breast‑fed with a normal physical examination and no history of dark urine or acholic stool, another option is follow‑up in 1 week; if jaundice persists at 3 weeks of age, laboratory evaluation is recommended to include fractionation of serum bilirubin.

### Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in children [^115Vx4qz]. Pediatrics in Review (2012). Low credibility.

A variety of anatomic, infectious, autoimmune, and metabolic diseases can lead to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, both in the newborn period and later in childhood. The pediatric practitioner is most likely to encounter conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period. It is crucial to maintain a high degree of suspicion for cholestasis in the persistently jaundiced newborn. The goal is recognition of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia between 2 and 4 weeks after birth, allowing for the prompt identification and management of infants who have biliary atresia, which remains the most common cause of neonatal cholestasis.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^111ctzqU]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The etiologies of infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are numerous. Because of the consequences of untimely correction of EHBA as well as the potential consequences of untreated galactosemia, hypothyroidism and other etiologies associated with this problem, clinical evaluation needs to be prompt, focused, and complete. While specific symptoms may narrow the diagnostic possibilities, a complete history and physical examination, diagnostic imaging and laboratory investigations directed at the more common etiologies is required to make a prompt, definitive diagnosis. This systematic review provides evidence to direct the investigation of an infant with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

### Jaundice in the adult patient… [^114cDjMN]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

10 Hemolytic anemias usually result in mild bilirubin elevation, to about 5 mg per dL, with or without clinical jaundice. Hemolytic anemias result from abnormal red blood cell survival times. These anemias may occur because of membrane abnormalities or enzyme abnormalities. Other etiologies of hemolysis include autoimmune disorders, drugs, and defects in hemoglobin structure such as sickle cell disease and the thalassemias.
11. 1 Typically, the disease results in a mild decrease in the activity of the enzyme glucuronosyltransferase, causing an increase in the indirect fraction of serum bilirubin. Gilbert syndrome is typically an incidental finding on routine liver function tests, when the bilirubin level is slightly increased and all other liver function values are within normal limits.

Jaundice and further elevation of the bilirubin level may occur during periods of stress, fasting, or illness. However, these changes are usually transient, and there is no need to pursue treatment or liver biopsy.
1. Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia The predominant causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are intrahepatic cholestasis and extrahepatic obstruction of the biliary tract, with the latter preventing bilirubin from moving into the intestines. Viruses, alcohol, and autoimmune disorders are the most common causes of hepatitis. Intrahepatic inflammation disrupts transport of conjugated bilirubin and causes jaundice. Evaluation The initial work-up of the patient with jaundice depends on whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. A urinalysis that is positive for bilirubin indicates the presence of conjugated bilirubinemia. Conjugated bilirubin is water soluble and therefore able to be excreted in urine.

The findings of urinalysis should be confirmed by measurements of the serum total and direct bilirubin levels. SERUM TESTING First-line serum testing in a patient presenting with jaundice should include a complete blood count and determination of bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase levels.

### Understanding and managing breast milk jaundice [^114ufjpV]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2011). Low credibility.

The breastfed infant with prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia can present a vexing clinical dilemma. Although it is a frequently observed and usually benign finding, prolonged jaundice in the breastfed newborn requires a thoughtful evaluation that excludes possible pathological aetiologies. While recommendations for the treatment of unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in the first 7 days of life are straightforward, the approach to the breastfeeding infant with jaundice that persists beyond the immediate neonatal period is less clearly delineated. A sound understanding of bilirubin physiology and familiarity with current literature must guide the management of the otherwise well breastfeeding infant with prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

### A cholestatic diagnostic dilemma [^113mH35x]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old man with hereditary spherocytosis presented with abdominal pain and jaundice. He had severe, mainly conjugated (642 μmol/l), hyperbilirubinaemia (1033 μmol/l), with elevated liver enzymes: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (163 IU/l), γ-glutamyltransferase (gGT) (277 IU/l) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (358 IU/l). Abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed gallstones in the gallbladder but an absence of biliary duct dilation. Liver biopsy was consistent with cholestasis but showed no large duct obstruction. The cause of the cholestasis was unclear, was it a primary intrahepatic pathology or secondary to a posthepatic cause? He presented with similar symptoms days later with gallstones in the bile duct (choledocholithiasis) and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and cholecystectomy. This report guides one through the assessment of jaundice and serves as an example whereby the diagnosis of a common cause of illness is blurred by an atypical clinical presentation and relevant comorbidities. A diagnosis of benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) is also considered.

### Findings in percutaneous trans-hepatic cholecysto-cholangiography in neonates and infants presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia: emphasis on differential diagnosis and cholangiographic patterns [^112aj6wx]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Biliary Atresia (BA) is a rare disease of unknown etiology affecting neonates and infants. It is characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and obliteration of the intra and extra-hepatic portions of the biliary tree. In some cases, it may be due to defective morphogenesis of the bile ducts. The incidence of BA ranges from 1 in 5000 to 1 in 18,000 live births globally. It is the most common cause of neonatal cholestasis and the most frequent indication for pediatric liver transplantation. If untreated, BA leads to end stage liver disease, liver cirrhosis and death.

The definitive clinical diagnosis of BA may be difficult due to its non-specific clinical presentation of jaundice, acholic stools and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Persistent jaundice after 2 weeks of age necessitates fractionated bilirubin levels analysis, and if conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is found, an abdominal ultrasound (US) scan, tests easily obtainable by a primary care provider.

Other conditions such as neonatal hepatitis, parenteral nutrition (PN)-associated liver disease (PNALD), and Alagille syndrome have similar presentations. To help with early identification of patients with suspected BA, Chen et al have reported success using colored stool cards. Based on laboratory tests, imaging findings, clinical history and physical examination, a liver biopsy with a percutaneous trans-hepatic cholecysto-cholangiography (PTCC) may be considered in the diagnostic work-up.

Liver biopsy can be diagnostic in cases of intrahepatic disease, demonstrating histologic signs of obstruction and prognostic factors (such as degree of fibrosis). However as early histologic findings of BA may be non-specific, false negative diagnoses may occur. Intra-operative cholangiography (either open or laparoscopic) and histologic examination of the duct remnant remains the standard criterion for diagnosis or exclusion of BA. A Hepatobiliary Imino-Diacetic Acid (HIDA) scan is not routinely used in this center in the diagnostic work-up of this patient population as it has a high sensitivity but low specificity for the diagnosis of BA and current guidelines suggest a limited diagnostic role.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113LJvTk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

### Jaundice in the adult patient [^116MrcMJ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Jaundice in an adult patient can be caused by a wide variety of benign or life-threatening disorders. Organizing the differential diagnosis by prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic causes may help make the work-up more manageable. Prehepatic causes of jaundice include hemolysis and hematoma resorption, which lead to elevated levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. Intrahepatic disorders can lead to unconjugated or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The conjugated (direct) bilirubin level is often elevated by alcohol, infectious hepatitis, drug reactions, and autoimmune disorders. Posthepatic disorders also can cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gallstone formation is the most common and benign posthepatic process that causes jaundice; however, the differential diagnosis also includes serious conditions such as biliary tract infection, pancreatitis, and malignancies. The laboratory work-up should begin with a urine test for bilirubin, which indicates that conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is present. If the complete blood count and initial tests for liver function and infectious hepatitis are unrevealing, the work-up typically proceeds to abdominal imaging by ultrasonography or computed tomographic scanning. In a few instances, more invasive procedures such as cholangiography or liver biopsy may be needed to arrive at a diagnosis.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114i1ouT]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Biochemical liver tests — patterns in Wilson disease include that serum aminotransferase activities are generally abnormal except at a very early age (infancy), and the elevation may be relatively mild and disproportionate to the severity of liver disease. In patients with cirrhosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is often elevated at levels above alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Transient hyperbilirubinemia, mainly unconjugated, may occur with brief self-limited episodes of hemolysis. Low-normal or subnormal serum alkaline phosphatase is typical of Wilson disease associated with intravascular hemolysis; it is also found with severe disease not meeting criteria for ALF (acute liver injury [ALI] without hepatic encephalopathy) and may be associated with episodic hemolysis.

Obstructive jaundice is a clinical symptom that results from cholestasis. Cholestasis can be extrahepatic or intrahepatic and is typically associated with biochemical abnormalities in the liver function tests. Once these abnormalities are identified, more extensive imaging tests can be performed to determine the nature, etiology, and level of obstruction. This information is essential for clinicians as they decide on management and treatment strategies.

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^111SZp2U]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In a clinically relevant population of disease-free neonates referred with prolonged jaundice, we found the 95th centile for direct bilirubin decreased slowly with age but was approximately 25 µmol/L. Failure for direct bilirubin to decrease with time at an individual level is particularly concerning. In contrast, the direct–total bilirubin ratio was highly variable and hence an unreliable indicator of pathology. While we acknowledge our data do not include any patients with liver disease, they nonetheless provide support for the NICE recommendation that well neonates with prolonged jaundice do not require investigation for liver disease if the conjugated bilirubin is ≤ 25 µmol/L. This threshold has the merits of simplicity and a high margin of safety; however, compared with other more stringent criteria, it may result in more neonates being extensively investigated with negligible gain in sensitivity.

The normal length of the GB in the first year of life has been described to be approximately 1.5 to 3.5 cm, however it can be difficult to differentiate between a small and a contracted GB. The spectrum of US findings in BA includes a small, absent or an atretic GB without a lumen. A collapsed or non-visualized GB on US is found in 50–60% of BA patients. In the group with normal PTCC, 73% of the patients had a normal GB on their pre-procedure diagnostic US, the remainder had a small or contracted GB, therefore a small or contracted GB is not a contraindication for a PTCC and can be seen in normal studies. The majority of patients (94%) with abnormal PTCC findings had small or contracted GB on pre-procedure diagnostic US, one patient had an absent GB (cyst noted at the procedure day) and one had a small cyst. Only one patient with BA had a normal GB reported in pre-procedure diagnostic US. Based on this, independent of the size, presence, or absence of a GB in the pre-procedure diagnostic US, the GB is re-assessed at the time of the procedure. If nothing is visible to target, a liver biopsy is obtained, or the procedure is aborted. Attempts to access intrahepatic bile ducts are not routinely performed.

When the clinical, laboratory and sonographic findings remain indeterminate, a PTCC is recommended. A PTCC can delineate the anatomy of the biliary system to either exclude BA or help direct further diagnostic steps. Lack of CHD opacification with CBD narrowing is not pathognomonic for any condition, as it may be associated with BA or hypoplasia [Figs. 2, 6,7]. 16 cases had this pattern, 11 of whom (61%) were diagnosed with BA. However, the pattern was also found in biliary hypoplasia/Alagille syndrome and Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Similar findings with Alagille syndrome have been found by others.

A morphologically abnormal GB associated with a non-communicating cyst in either an intra-hepatic or extra-hepatic location is most consistent with cystic BA. Cystic BA was seen in 12% of BA cases, which is consistent with previous reports. The main differential diagnosis of this condition is a choledochal cyst, which can be associated with dilated intra-hepatic bile ducts, a larger cyst, and normal appearing GB.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Kk3U6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117C8yTD]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Except in the neonatal period, the majority of measurable bilirubin should be conjugated, even in individuals with significant liver disease. Hence if the majority of the elevated bilirubin comprises the unconjugated fraction then the cause, in the absence of haemolysis, is virtually always Gilbert's syndrome. As Gilbert's syndrome is not associated with liver disease or ill health, any such individuals should be fully reassured. In the neonatal period, there may be a physiological increase in total bilirubin, which is unconjugated. This may be pathological if high or prolonged. In neonates and infants in whom the conjugated bilirubin is > 25 μmol/L, referral to a paediatrician for urgent assessment of possible liver disease is essential.

Albumin is a protein that is produced only in the liver and has multiple biological actions, including maintenance of oncotic pressure, binding of other substances (such as fatty acids, bilirubin, thyroid hormone and drugs), metabolism of compounds, including lipids, and antioxidant properties. As albumin is only produced by the liver, the serum albumin concentration is often considered as a marker of the synthetic function of the liver. However, overinterpretation of the measured concentrations of albumin as a marker of the severity of liver disease is not always merited. Albumin concentrations are reduced in many clinical situations, including sepsis, systemic inflammatory disorders, nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption and gastrointestinal protein loss.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^11134N7L]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations

Infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia presents with persistent jaundice as part of a clinical constellation that may include other symptoms based on the underlying etiology. The differential diagnosis is broad and requires timely evaluation. The data presented in this review suggest that INH, EHBA, and infection (with CMV being the most common infection) account for 63.36% of all cases of infants presenting with elevated serum concentrations of conjugated bilirubin.

The diagnostic evaluation should be guided by symptomatology and may include various imaging studies and serologic, hematologic, and urine investigations for various infections and endocrinopathies, as well as genetic testing for inborn errors of metabolism. While the definitive diagnosis of EHBA requires a percutaneous liver biopsy, ongoing research is investigating less invasive methods of differentiating EHBA from other etiologies of infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Inconsistency of the diagnostic approach is a major limitation of this review. While there are general guidelines directing the evaluation of an infant with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, reports published prior to establishment of these guidelines are included in the present review. Moreover, diagnostic practices vary by country and multiple studies focused on the ability of a specific radiologic test to differentiate EHBA from other causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Together, these conditions may introduce inherent disparities in evaluation and may contribute to bias among these studies.

Variability in sample populations is also a potential source of bias. While 12 countries and 5 continents are represented, there is no data from Eastern Europe or South America. Disorders that may be uniquely prevalent in these areas may be underrepresented. Finally, summary data that includes subjects from all over the world may be less relevant to any specific country given the uneven distribution of etiologies between developed and developing countries as well as diseases endemic to the East and West.

Finally, the use of the category of INH to include all idiopathic cases of infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a potential source of bias in this review. While Ipek et. al defined INH as conjugated hyperbilirubinemia that persists beyond 3 months without another identifiable cause, multiple studies did not specifically use the term INH or provide a definition.

### Imaging of biliary disorders in children [^114LDDbW]. Pediatric Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia and related disorders of the biliary tree, such as choledochal cyst, must be considered in the differential diagnosis of prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infants and children. Pediatric biliary tract diseases include a variety of entities with a wide range of clinical presentations. Radiology plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of these pathologies. Unrecognized causes of biliary disease, like biliary atresia, can lead to liver transplantation during the first year of life. The aim of this article is to review the imaging of pediatric biliary disorders, including the implications of interventional radiology in some biliary diseases.

Results and discussion

Study selection

The results of the literature search are shown in the Fig. 1. Searches of Medline and EMBASE databases yielded 193 references. An additional 44 citations were found by extensively searching the bibliographies of selected articles. From the 237 studies identified, 180 studies were excluded after a cursory review of the title, abstract, and, when necessary, the results section. The full text of the remaining 57 articles was reviewed in detail. Forty of the remaining studies were excluded: 11 reports failed to report specific diagnoses; 6 reports had inclusion criteria that were too narrow; 6 reports included patients without conjugated hyperbilirubinemia; 6 reports were not case series or cohort studies; 5 reports had subjects with previously identified disease processes; 2 failed to include a detailed clinical evaluation; 1 each had vague inclusion criteria, non-consecutive patients, included the same patient population from another selected study, or had a sample size of less than 10. The remaining 17 studies comprise this review.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults | AAFP… [^112WABNi]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice occurs when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 3 mg per dL. It can be difficult to detect by physical examination alone. Pathophysiology Approximately 250 mg of bilirubin per day is produced by an average adult through the catabolism of the heme molecule. 4, 6 Jaundice occurs when there are disruptions along this metabolic pathway, causing an increase in unconjugated bilirubin or conjugated bilirubin. Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia INCREASED BILIRUBIN PRODUCTION Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is usually a result of too much bilirubin presented to the conjugating machinery.

Increased red blood cell breakdown may be caused by red blood cell membrane disorders, 9 red blood cell enzyme disorders, 10 hemoglobin disorders, 11 autoimmune red blood cell destruction, 12 or some cancers. The excess turnover of red blood cells results in increased heme metabolism, producing large amounts of bilirubin that overwhelm the conjugating machinery, leading to decreased excretion and clinical jaundice. 17 Although the exact mechanism is poorly understood, liver lipid deposition may trigger inflammation and fibrosis, particularly when coupled with type 2 diabetes. 17 Sepsis may also induce hyperbilirubinemia as circulating acute phase reactants and bacterial endotoxins disrupt bilirubin transport, leading to cholestasis and elevated bile salt levels. 18, 19.

Drug-induced liver injury has multiple potential mechanisms, including direct hepatocellular toxicity and activation of an immune response that advances the inflammatory cascade, inhibiting bilirubin transport into canaliculi, which causes cholestasis. 20 Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder, is associated with a loss of function of a cellular transporter responsible for moving dietary copper into liver canaliculi. Elevated liver copper levels affect hepatic lipid metabolism, which leads to steatosis and cholestasis. 21 Additional causes of intrahepatic hyperbilirubinemia include autoimmune disorders, such as autoimmune hepatitis and the rare autoimmune condition primary biliary cirrhosis, which occurs most commonly in middle-aged women. Both conditions are associated with inflammation, which disrupts the transport of bilirubin within the liver. 3.

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^112zf4UR]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Infant cholestasis — diagnostic and laboratory evaluation underscores timely workup and key tests: In addition to laboratory studies, imaging, and liver histopathology are important to evaluate for bile duct patency because cholestatic infants must be evaluated promptly to exclude treatable surgical conditions, and performance of the Kasai HPE for BA is much less likely to benefit infants if performed after 3 months of age, underscoring the need for an expedient evaluation. During the evaluation of the infant with cholestasis, laboratory investigations will help define the etiology, with a critical and important initial blood test being the measurement of serum conjugated (direct) bilirubin (DB), which, if elevated, is a reliable laboratory indicator of cholestasis at this age; additionally, bacterial cultures of blood, urine, and other fluids should be obtained as dictated by the clinical assessment, and when evaluating a patient with cholestasis, it is crucial to review the standard local newborn screening as many diseases that cause cholestasis are tested such as hypothyroidism, galactosemia, tyrosinemia, and CF.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to bilirubin measurement, ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2017 guidelines recommend to measure total and conjugated serum bilirubin for the evaluation of cholestasis in any formula-fed infant noted to be jaundiced after 2 weeks of age.
Consider observing otherwise well-appearing breastfed infants clinically until 3 weeks of age. Measure total and conjugated serum bilirubin if they appear icteric at that time.

### Involvement of the liver in COVID-19: a systematic review [^116mvcWW]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Elevation in aminotransferase levels.

The commonest liver test abnormalities reported are mild to moderate elevations in ALT and AST levels (seen in 14–53% of cases). Significant elevations of ALT and AST are commoner in those with other digestive symptoms. Raised liver aminotransferases are associated with significantly longer hospital stays. A multicenter retrospective cohort study of 5,771 adult COVID-19 patients found AST to increase initially followed by ALT. Aspartate transaminase abnormalities were associated with the highest risk of mortality. Although ALT is more specific to the liver, higher AST levels may be associated with injury to other organs or because of mitochondrial injury and should thus be interpreted with caution.

Elevations in bilirubin levels.

Elevated bilirubin levels are observed in 20–40% of patients and 10% had very high levels. Bilirubin levels are significantly higher in those with severe disease and are associated with a poorer prognosis. Most of the studies do not indicate whether the hypebilirubinemia is of the direct or indirect type. A study from Spain found a biphasic pattern of hyperbilirubinemia, initially hepatocellular and later cholestatic in type. This suggests that the elevation of bilirubin may be because of both direct hepatic injury and cholestasis. In addition to the increase in serum total bilirubin levels, raised conjugated bilirubin levels and conjugated to unconjugated bilirubin ratios were observed in COVID-19 patients. The high bilirubin levels may also be related to hemolysis. Further studies would delineate the predominant pathogenesis of elevated bilirubin levels in COVID-19.

### Evaluation of transcutaneous bilirubin levels in healthy and preeclamptic pregnancies: a pilot study [^113RbtaL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy defined by the new onset of hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation, accompanied by proteinuria and/or signs of maternal organ dysfunction. It complicates approximately 2–8% of all pregnancies and is responsible for at least 17% of maternal deaths worldwide. PE may progress to multiorgan failure and maternal mortality, and it is a major contributor to fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality due to compromised placental perfusion and preterm delivery. Despite extensive research efforts, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PE remain incompletely elucidated.

Due to its involvement in diverse pathological pathways and its heterogeneous clinical manifestations, PE is frequently described as a "disease of theories". The clinical course of PE can deteriorate rapidly and unpredictably, and currently, the only definitive treatment is delivery. The potential for life-threatening complications — such as acute renal injury, hepatic dysfunction, and neurological, cardiac, or hematologic involvement — has intensified efforts to enhance early diagnosis and risk prediction. Nevertheless, existing predictive tools remain suboptimal. A 2024 study reported a predictive accuracy of only 41% for term PE at a 10% false-positive rate, highlighting the limitations of current diagnostic strategies. Consequently, ongoing research continues to seek improvements in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of PE.

The pathophysiology of PE is characterized by abnormal placental perfusion, tissue hypoxia, and subsequent cellular injury. This injury is commonly associated with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a well-established marker of cellular damage. Hemolysis is also a prominent feature, resulting in erythrocyte destruction and the release of bilirubin, a breakdown product of hemoglobin catabolism. Heme is enzymatically degraded by heme oxygenase (HO) into ferrous iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin, which is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. While bilirubin possesses notable antioxidant properties, it may exert cytotoxic effects when present at elevated concentrations. In the circulation, bilirubin binds tightly to albumin and is transported to the liver, where it undergoes conjugation by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, increasing its solubility and facilitating biliary excretion. Elevated levels of indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin typically reflect hemolysis or impaired hepatic conjugation, whereas increased direct (conjugated) bilirubin suggests biliary obstruction or impaired hepatic excretory function.

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests

There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results whose recognition can aid diagnosis:
Isolated raised bilirubin — most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome (affects 5–8% of the population). Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and a direct and indirect bilirubin; the total bilirubin should rise further, owing to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting reticulocyte count/lactate dehydrogenase/haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L) then rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndromeshould be considered and genetic testing undertaken.
Cholestatic — predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and not be liver related, or it may relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood, and thus the presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, however, GGT is characteristically low or normal. In these disorders, cholestasis occurs without GGT elevation.
Hepatitic — predominantly raised ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular liver injury (hepatitis). Common causes include viral hepatitis, NAFLD, ARLD, AIH and drug-induced liver injury. Details of the approach to these liver blood test abnormalities are given in the subsequent section on outcomes and pathways.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice in infants — initial bilirubin evaluation recommends that any formula-fed infant noted to be jaundiced after 2 weeks of age should be evaluated for cholestasis with measurement of total and conjugated (direct) serum bilirubin (1A), while breast-fed babies that appear otherwise well may be followed clinically until 3 weeks of age and, if still icteric, should then undergo serum evaluation of total and conjugated (direct) serum bilirubin. Measurements of serum bilirubin should always be fractionated into unconjugated (indirect) or conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia (1A), and conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia (> 1.0 mg/dL, 17 μmol/ L) is considered pathologic and warrants diagnostic evaluation (1A).

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^116UApRo]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Our study does not allow calculation of a definitive threshold for direct bilirubin below which biliary atresia or other significant congenital liver disease can be excluded. However, there are data on the rise in direct bilirubin in neonates less than 2 weeks of age found to have biliary atresia demonstrating levels well above 25 µmol/L. Harpavat et al found that the mean direct bilirubin in 34 neonates with biliary atresia was 25 µmol/L at 24–48 hours and 45 µmol/L at 72–96 hours. Terui et al noted a direct bilirubin level of around 90 µmol/L at 2–3 weeks of age in 19 neonates with biliary atresia. Siu and colleaguesreported a mean direct bilirubin of 142 µmol/L in 20 neonates aged less than 3 months (median 45 days) with biliary atresia. According to our data (see figure 1B), a threshold of 25 µmol/L would result in investigation of roughly 5% of all neonates with prolonged jaundice and seem to carry little risk of missing a case of biliary atresia.

This threshold may even contain a large safety margin. Many centres will measure direct bilirubin, where a threshold of 25 µmol/L would actually reflect a more conservative conjugated bilirubin of 22–25 µmol/L. Furthermore, there is a published audit of a prolonged jaundice service in the UK. The protocol for further investigation was a direct bilirubin > 18 µmol/L and > 20% of total. Ten of 882 (1.1%) neonates tested positive on this measure; eight of whom were confirmed to have neonatal liver disease. None of the others went on to receive such a diagnosis. Thirty-three other neonates were diagnosed with liver disease outside of the prolonged jaundice service, but within the study area during the audit period, and all also met the criteria — the authors conclude that their criteria are 100% sensitive for liver disease. Our data suggest that 5% of neonates with prolonged jaundice have direct bilirubin levels above 25 µmol/L — approximately 4.5 times greater than the 1.1% satisfying Cartledge's criteria. Their investigation threshold must, therefore, have been more stringent than that recommended by NICE, but still failed to miss a single case of neonatal liver disease.

### Serum bilirubin and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a systematic review [^1149UGfc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) standards. Our protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42019145747).

Data sources and searches

We searched MEDLINE® and Embase databases using Ovid® (search updated October 1st, 2019) for peer-reviewed, English language studies. The search strategy for the MEDLINE® search is provided in Additional file 1: Appendix 1.

Study selection

Two authors (AKB and DMM) independently reviewed each study at the abstract and full-text level to determine eligibility. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and evaluation by a third reviewer, if needed.

Reports were eligible if they were randomized or observational (cohort, cross-sectional, case control) studies that enrolled participants greater than 18 years of age. We did not exclude studies based on pulmonary function or pulmonary diagnoses and included studies conducted in both general populations and in samples restricted to those with obstructive lung disease. We excluded case reports and case series, studies published in only abstract form, and those without a full text publication in English. We did not have a numerical cutoff for bilirubin levels because there are no defined criteria for what constitutes a pathologic elevation in bilirubin, but we excluded studies evaluating elevations in serum bilirubin in the context of hepatobiliary diseases and drug-induced liver injury. Eligible studies reported serum bilirubin levels and any outcome of interest related to our three key questions.

Outcome measures

We examined clinically important outcomes by cross sectional measures and longitudinal measures. Clinical effect sizes are included in Additional file 1: Appendix 2.

### Interpreting conjugated bilirubin levels in newborns [^114VDMzH]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the clinical significance of elevated conjugated bilirubin (CB) levels in newborns.

Study Design

This retrospective study evaluated a birth cohort of 271 186 full-term newborns born within a Northern California hospital network from 1995 to 2004. All CB and direct bilirubin (DB) levels were available in a database and were correlated with the patients' inpatient and outpatient International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision diagnoses.

Results

The 99th percentile for CB is 0.5 mg/dL, and the 99th percentile for DB is 2.1 mg/dL. CB levels between 0.5 and 1.9 mg/dL can be associated with infection, but most often remain unexplained. Liver and biliary disease become increasingly likely as CB levels increase; for CB ≥ 5 mg/dL, 47% of newborns have biliary disease and 43% have liver disease.

Conclusions

CB and DB levels are not interchangeable. In newborns with CB levels ≥ 0.5 mg/dL and < 2 mg/dL, infection must be ruled out, and the newborn should be observed. In newborns with levels ≥ 2 mg/dL, a more in-depth assessment of the hepatobiliary system is indicated.

### Neonatal cholestasis [^115K5C5A]. NeoReviews (2013). Low credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice is a common presenting feature of neonatal hepatobiliary and metabolic dysfunction. Any infant who remains jaundiced beyond age 2 to 3 weeks should have the serum bilirubin level fractionated into a conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (indirect) portion. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is never physiologic or normal. The differential diagnosis of cholestasis is extensive, and a step-wise approach based on the initial history and physical examination is useful to rapidly identify the underlying etiology. Early recognition of neonatal cholestasis is essential to ensure timely treatment and optimal prognosis. Even when specific treatment is not available, infants who have cholestasis benefit from early medical management and optimization of nutrition. Future studies are necessary to determine the most reliable and cost-effective method of universal screening for neonatal cholestasis.
