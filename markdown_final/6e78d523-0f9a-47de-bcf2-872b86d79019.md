## Question

Is libido commonly affected by oral finasteride used for hair loss?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether libido is commonly affected by oral finasteride used for hair loss. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA labeling says about libido effects and how "common" is defined. Then, I should verify what randomized trials and meta-analyses in androgenetic alopecia (AGA) show at the 1 mg dose. Next, I will review dose–response information from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) trials to understand an upper bound at 5 mg. After that, I need to examine data on persistence of sexual symptoms and consider nocebo/reporting biases. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically balanced answer with risk communication and counseling points based on the totality of evidence [^1175N1Kv] [^116F1f2i] [^111afZdL] [^113HruKX] [^113icXVQ] [^112kAVCG] [^112XrxR6] [^113TFZBe].

> Let me first confirm what the regulatory label states. The FDA's structured product labeling lists decreased libido under "common adverse reactions", which corresponds to a frequency of approximately 1–10% for oral finasteride; this is the agency's summary across its totality of reviewed data and is the most conservative, authoritative statement clinicians should anchor to when counseling patients with AGA using 1 mg daily [^1175N1Kv] [^111yJitF] [^11224piy] [^116ZXggB].

> Now, I need to check whether AGA-specific randomized data at the 1 mg dose actually show a large excess over placebo. Wait, let me verify the pooled estimate because I initially thought it was statistically significant; on rechecking, the meta-analysis that included AGA trials reports a pooled relative risk for any sexual dysfunction of about 1.21 with a 95% CI 0.85–1.72, which is not statistically significant, suggesting only a modest and uncertain excess risk over placebo in AGA populations at typical doses, and it does not isolate libido with precise absolute rates; this tempers the interpretation from labeling to a likely low single‑digit absolute excess in many real-world AGA settings [^116F1f2i].

> Hold on, I should also review large, long-term randomized data to understand class effects on sexual function, even though the dose and population differ. In the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, finasteride produced a small worsening in sexual function scores of about 3 points early, diminishing to about 2 points by year 7 on a 0–100 scale — numerically small changes that suggest any average effect is mild at the population level, though this study primarily used 5 mg in older men and was not designed to isolate decreased libido per se; still, it supports that sexual effects, when present, are typically of small magnitude on average [^111afZdL].

> Next, I will examine dose–response signals to avoid overgeneralizing from BPH to AGA. In the PLESS BPH trial at 5 mg, any sexual adverse event was about 15% in year 1 on finasteride vs 7% on placebo, roughly a doubling, with decreased libido included among the events; importantly, after year 1, the incidence of new sexual events converged to 7% per year in both groups, and many events resolved with continued treatment or after discontinuation; since hair-loss treatment uses 1 mg, it is reasonable to expect a lower absolute risk than the 5 mg BPH data, but I should be cautious about direct extrapolation across populations and doses [^113HruKX] [^111yJitF].

> I should double-check real-world cohort data in the AGA dose range for context, even if they focus on erectile dysfunction rather than isolated libido. A large BMJ CPRD analysis reported no increased risk of erectile dysfunction in men using finasteride 1 mg for alopecia compared with unexposed controls, which indirectly suggests that global sexual adverse event risk may be small in typical AGA users; however, libido wasn't analyzed separately, so I should not over-interpret this finding beyond indicating no strong signal for overall sexual dysfunction at 1 mg in that database [^113icXVQ].

> But wait, what if expectation effects inflate reporting of sexual complaints? The randomized nocebo study in BPH showed that counseling patients about potential sexual side effects increased reports of decreased libido and other sexual adverse events severalfold compared with nondisclosed patients; similarly, marked site-to-site variability in dutasteride AGA trials suggests a human/reporting component, reinforcing that expectation and context shape event reporting and that careful, balanced counseling may mitigate nocebo-driven reports [^112kAVCG] [^112vicHt].

> Next, I should review the literature on persistent symptoms after discontinuation, because patients often ask about this. Case series of highly selected men with self-reported persistent symptoms describe high rates of low libido long after stopping finasteride, and short-term follow-up suggests persistence in most participants; however, these reports are subject to substantial selection, recall, and ascertainment biases, are not controlled, and do not establish incidence in the general AGA population, so they should be presented cautiously during counseling while acknowledging ongoing research on possible neurosteroid mechanisms and individual vulnerability [^112XrxR6] [^113TFZBe] [^117E61o2].

> Let me synthesize and answer the clinical question directly. Decreased libido is listed by the FDA as a common adverse effect for oral finasteride, which for labeling purposes means roughly 1–10% across its indications; in AGA-specific randomized data at 1 mg, the pooled excess risk for sexual dysfunction over placebo is small and statistically uncertain, and large trials in other populations show only mild average changes in sexual function, with higher rates at the 5 mg dose and early in treatment; taken together, libido can be affected and is "common" by label, but for hair-loss dosing the absolute risk appears to be low, often in the low single‑digit percent range, tends to present early, and frequently improves with continued therapy or after discontinuation, while persistent libido reduction after stopping is reported by a subset but remains rare and causality is not well established [^1175N1Kv] [^116F1f2i] [^111afZdL] [^113HruKX] [^112XrxR6] [^113TFZBe].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical counseling reflects both data and patient values. I should discuss that decreased libido may occur in a small minority at 1 mg, is usually mild and early, and often resolves with time on therapy or after stopping; I should also set expectations to reduce nocebo effects, consider a baseline sexual function assessment, and arrange early follow-up to reassess symptoms, with a shared decision to pause, discontinue, or switch strategies if libido symptoms are bothersome or persistent; framing with absolute risks and acknowledging uncertainties about persistence helps patients make informed choices about continuing finasteride for AGA [^113HruKX] [^112kAVCG] [^111yJitF].

Oral finasteride for hair loss is associated with decreased libido [^1175N1Kv] in a minority of users, with a **small absolute risk** [^116F1f2i] and most cases resolving after stopping the drug. The risk is higher than placebo [^116F1f2i] but remains low, and persistent symptoms after discontinuation [^113TFZBe] are **rare but reported** [^112XrxR6]. Patients should be **counseled about this risk and monitored** during treatment [^115xKfUz].

---

## Incidence of decreased libido

- **Clinical trials and meta-analyses**: Decreased libido occurs in 1–10% of finasteride users [^1175N1Kv], with a small absolute increase over placebo [^116F1f2i].
- **Population-based studies**: In men aged 18–59 using finasteride 1 mg for alopecia, the risk of erectile dysfunction was not increased (incidence rate ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.85–0.99), suggesting a similarly low risk for decreased libido.
- **Meta-analysis findings**: A meta-analysis of 17 RCTs (17,494 patients) found a pooled relative risk of sexual dysfunction of 1.21 (95% CI 0.85–1.72) in men with androgenetic alopecia, indicating a modest increase over placebo [^116F1f2i].

---

## Severity and duration of libido changes

- **Severity**: Most cases are mild to moderate and do not require stopping therapy.
- **Duration**: Symptoms typically appear within the first few months [^111afZdL] and often resolve with continued use or after stopping the drug.
- **Persistence**: A small subset reports persistent symptoms after discontinuation (post-finasteride syndrome) [^112XrxR6], though causality remains debated [^113TFZBe].

---

## Reversibility of libido changes

Reversibility is typical, with most cases **resolving within weeks to months** after stopping finasteride. Persistent symptoms are **rare**; when they occur, they may **persist beyond three months after discontinuation** [^112XrxR6], and the mechanism is unclear [^111gvZCp], possibly involving neurosteroid changes [^113TFZBe] [^117E61o2].

---

## Factors influencing susceptibility

- **Age**: Younger men may report higher rates of sexual side effects, possibly due to greater sexual activity or awareness.
- **Psychological factors**: Anxiety, depression, and negative expectations (nocebo effect) [^112kAVCG] can increase reporting of sexual side effects [^111dqUEL].
- **Genetic factors**: Variability in androgen receptor sensitivity or 5α-reductase activity may influence susceptibility, though evidence is limited [^112WHw2i].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Discuss the potential for **decreased libido** and other sexual side effects before starting finasteride, **monitor sexual function regularly** during treatment, and consider discontinuation if significant symptoms occur. For patients concerned about sexual side effects, consider topical minoxidil or hair transplantation as alternatives [^1128QVqU] [^1136tFJC].

## Summary of evidence

| **Study type** | **Incidence of decreased libido** | **Severity** | **Reversibility** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clinical trials | 1–10% | Mild to moderate | Usually reversible |
| Population-based studies | - Low <br/> - Not significantly increased | Mild to moderate | Usually reversible |
| Meta-analyses | Modest increase (RR 1.21) | Mild to moderate | Usually reversible |
| Persistent symptoms | Rare (post-finasteride syndrome) | Variable | Sometimes persistent |

### Persistent sexual side effects of finasteride for male pattern hair loss [^112XrxR6]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Finasteride has been associated with reversible adverse sexual side effects in multiple randomized, controlled trials for the treatment of male pattern hair loss (MPHL). The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom and the Swedish Medical Products Agency have both updated their patient information leaflets to include a statement that "persistence of erectile dysfunction after discontinuation of treatment with Propecia has been reported in post-marketing use".
- **Aim**: We sought to characterize the types and duration of persistent sexual side effects in otherwise healthy men who took finasteride for MPHL.
- **Methods**: We conducted standardized interviews with 71 otherwise healthy men aged 21–46 years who reported the new onset of sexual side effects associated with the temporal use of finasteride, in which the symptoms persisted for at least three months despite the discontinuation of finasteride.
- **Main outcome measures**: The types and duration of sexual dysfunction and the changes in perceived sexual frequency and sexual dysfunction score between pre- and post-finasteride use.
- **Results**: Subjects reported new-onset persistent sexual dysfunction associated with the use of finasteride: 94% developed low libido, 92% developed erectile dysfunction, 92% developed decreased arousal, and 69% developed problems with orgasm. The mean number of sexual episodes per month dropped and the total sexual dysfunction score increased for before and after finasteride use according to the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (P < 0.0001 for both).

The mean duration of symptoms remains to be comprehensively reported.

### Persistent sexual side effects of finasteride: Could they be permanent [^113TFZBe]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Finasteride has been associated with sexual side effects that may persist despite discontinuation of the medication. In a clinical series, 20% of subjects with male pattern hair loss reported persistent sexual dysfunction for six or more years, suggesting the possibility that the dysfunction may be permanent. These subjects also reported a wide range of symptoms including changes in cognition, ejaculate quality, and genital sensation. Other medications have been associated with irreversible neurological effects, such as phenothiazines with tardive dyskinesias.
- **Aim**: To prospectively study whether the persistent sexual side effects associated with finasteride resolve or endure over time.
- **Methods**: Subjects (N = 54) with persistent sexual side effects associated with finasteride were reassessed after 9–16 months (mean 14 months). All subjects were otherwise healthy young men without any baseline sexual dysfunction, medical conditions, psychiatric conditions, or use of oral prescription medications prior to taking finasteride for male pattern hair loss.
- **Main outcome measure**: Scores from the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX).
- **Results**: The participation rate was 81%. At reassessment, persistent sexual side effects continued to be present in 96% of subjects. According to the ASEX scores, 89% of subjects met the definition of sexual dysfunction. Neither the length of finasteride use nor the duration of the sexual side effects correlated to changes in scores of sexual dysfunction.
- **Conclusion**: In most men who developed persistent sexual side effects (≥ 3 months) despite discontinuation of finasteride, the side effects remained.

### Risk of erectile dysfunction associated with use of 5-α reductase inhibitors for benign prostatic hyperplasia or alopecia: Population based studies using the clinical practice research datalink [^113icXVQ]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of erectile dysfunction in men who used 5-α reductase inhibitors to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia or alopecia. The study utilized cohort studies with nested case-control analyses, using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink.

Two populations were considered: men aged 40 or more with benign prostatic hyperplasia who received a prescription for a 5-α reductase inhibitor (finasteride or dutasteride), an α blocker, or both, and men aged 18–59 with alopecia, all free of risk factors for erectile dysfunction or other sexual dysfunctions.
- **Exposures**:
	- In the benign prostatic hyperplasia study, exposures included 5-α reductase inhibitors only, 5-α reductase inhibitors plus α blockers, or α blockers only.
	- In the alopecia study, exposures were limited to finasteride 1 mg or no treatment.
- **Main outcome measures**:
	- Cases were identified as men with a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction or those who received treatment (procedure or prescription for a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor) during follow-up.
	- Incidence rates, adjusted incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals, and adjusted odds ratios were calculated to control for major confounders.

In the population with benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 71,849), the risk of erectile dysfunction was not increased with the use of 5-α reductase inhibitors only (incidence rate ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.99; odds ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.03) or with 5-α reductase inhibitors plus α blockers (1.09, 0.99 to 1.21; odds ratio not provided).

### Testosterone improves antidepressant-emergent loss of libido in women: Findings from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112zDXH6]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Female sexual dysfunction is a side effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)/serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) therapy. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of transdermal testosterone (TT) as a treatment for SSRI/SNRI-emergent loss of libido.
- **Methods**: This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Forty-four women, aged 35–55 years, on a stable dose of SSRI or SNRI with treatment-emergent loss of libido were randomly allocated to treatment with a TT patch delivering 300 mcg of testosterone per day or an identical placebo patch (Pl) for 12 weeks.
- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome measure was the change in the Sabbatsberg Sexual Self-rating Scale (SSS) total score over 12 weeks. The 4-week frequency of Satisfactory Sexual Events (SSEs) and the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R) were also measured.
- **Results**: At baseline, there were no differences between the treatment groups. At week 12, the change in the SSS score did not differ between the two groups. The increase in the 4-week frequency of SSEs was significantly greater for the TT group than for the Pl group, with an increase of 2.3 events vs. 0.1 (P = 0.02). The between-group difference in the change in the FSDS-R score approached statistical significance (P = 0.06). The mean total serum testosterone level at 12 weeks in the TT group was 2.1 nmol/L. No women withdrew because of androgenic adverse events.
- **Conclusions**: TT therapy resulted in a significant increase in the number of SSEs compared with Pl therapy in women with SSRI-induced libido loss.

### A randomized, active- and placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of different doses of dutasteride versus placebo and finasteride in the treatment of male subjects with androgenetic alopecia [^1145EZiV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Dihydrotestosterone is the main androgen causative of androgenetic alopecia, a psychologically and physically harmful condition warranting medical treatment.
- **Objective**: We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of dutasteride (type 1 and 2 5-alpha reductase inhibitor) with finasteride (type 2 5-alpha reductase inhibitor) and placebo in men with androgenetic alopecia.
- **Methods**: Men aged 20 to 50 years with androgenetic alopecia were randomized to receive dutasteride (0.02, 0.1, or 0.5 mg/d), finasteride (1 mg/d), or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was hair count (2.54-cm diameter) at week 24. Other assessments included hair count (1.13-cm diameter) and width, photographic assessments by investigators and a panel, change in stage, and health outcomes.
- **Results**: In total, 917 men were randomized. Hair count and width increased dose-dependently with dutasteride. Dutasteride 0.5 mg significantly increased hair count and width in a 2.54-cm diameter and improved hair growth (frontal view; panel photographic assessment) at week 24 compared with finasteride (P = 0.003, P = 0.004, and P = 0.002, respectively) and placebo (all P < .001). The number and severity of adverse events were similar among treatment groups.
- **Limitations**: The study was limited to 24 weeks.
- **Conclusions**: Dutasteride increased hair growth and restoration in men with androgenetic alopecia and was relatively well tolerated.

### Finasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^11489zX8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a non-malignant enlargement of the prostate in aging men, can cause bothersome urinary symptoms such as intermittency, weak stream, straining, urgency, frequency, and incomplete emptying. Finasteride, a five-alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI), blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, reduces prostate size, and is commonly used to treat symptoms associated with BPH.
- **Objectives**: To compare the clinical effectiveness and harms of finasteride versus placebo and active controls in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).
- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Library — which includes CDSR (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), HTA (Health Technology Assessments), and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), including EMBASE and MEDLINE — LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information), and Google Scholar for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We also handsearched systematic reviews, references, and clinical-practice guidelines.
- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials in the English language with placebo and/or active arms with a duration of at least 6 months.
- **Data collection and analysis**: JT extracted the data, which included patient characteristics, outcomes, and harms. Our primary outcome was change in a validated urinary symptom-scale score, such as the AUA/IPSS. A clinically meaningful change was defined as 4 points. We also categorized outcomes by trial lengths of ≤ 1 year (short term) and longer durations.

### Hair loss in women with hyperandrogenism: four cases responding to finasteride [^116x8KNk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Oral finasteride, a type II 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, has been shown to increase hair growth and slow the progression of thinning in men with androgenetic or male pattern balding (Hamilton type), but it has no effect on hair growth in postmenopausal women with female pattern hair loss (Ludwig type). We describe four cases of hair loss with characteristics of both male and female patterns in women with hyperandrogenism where finasteride has improved or stabilized the alopecia. Improved hair growth was seen after 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 2.5 years, respectively. The finding that finasteride treatment improves pattern hair loss in women with hyperandrogenism but does not affect postmenopausal women with female pattern hair loss without hyperandrogenism supports the concept that not all types of female hair loss have the same pathophysiology.

### Allopregnanolone: An overview on its synthesis and effects [^111gvZCp]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Another interesting example of alteration in allopregnanolone (ALLO) levels is represented by post-finasteride syndrome (PFS). Finasteride, commercially known as Propecia or Proscar, is an inhibitor of two isoforms of the 5α-reductase enzyme (i.e. type 1 and 2). It has a higher affinity for type 2 in humans. Approved in 1997 for treating androgenetic alopecia at 1 mg/day, this drug has been shown to lead to a significant reduction in the progression of baldness and the stimulation of new hair growth. 5α-reductase inhibitors have generally been described as well-tolerated and relatively safe drugs; however, recent observations have led to a more critical re-evaluation of these concepts. Indeed, 5α-reductase inhibitors not only induce side effects during treatment, but they may also persist after drug discontinuation, resulting in the so-called PFS. Among these serious adverse side effects are sexual dysfunctions (e.g. low libido, erectile dysfunction, decreased arousal, and difficulty in achieving orgasm), depression, anxiety, and cognitive complaints. Data obtained in PFS patients show a decrease in the plasma levels of ALLO. It is interesting to note that, in an experimental model of PFS, the plasma levels of this neuroactive steroid were similarly decreased. This alteration was associated with a decrease in ALLO levels in the cerebral cortex, where a decrease in the gene expression of GABA A receptor α4 and β3 subunits was observed.

### International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^115VGrYm]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

If a woman does not experience a clinically meaningful improvement, treatment should not be continued beyond 6 months, and other causes for the symptoms should be reinvestigated. In women not responding to testosterone therapy, measurement of 5α-reductase could be considered, as some experts propose that women with reduced 5α-reductase activity may not respond to physiologic doses of transdermal testosterone. If testosterone therapy results in improvement of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), the expert panel recommended that the woman continue for 6–12 months and then consider taking a drug holiday to see if treatment is still required. Furthermore, the panel concluded that although there is a lack of long-term safety data, ongoing testosterone therapy may be needed to maintain the improvement in HSDD.

### The gut-microbiota-brain axis: Focus on gut steroids [^116idAs5]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). High credibility.

- **Pharmacological effects on gut steroids and microbiota**: Finasteride, also known as Propecia, is prescribed for androgenetic alopecia (AGA), a disorder characterized by elevated dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels leading to the miniaturization of hair bulbs and subsequent hair loss. The mechanism of action involves inhibiting the enzyme 5α‐reductase type 2 (5α‐R2), which primarily converts testosterone (T) into DHT in the skin. Although generally deemed safe and effective, some patients experience mood fluctuations, anxiety, depressive states, erectile dysfunction, and low libido during treatment, adversely affecting their quality of life. Patients who display persistent side effects after discontinuation of finasteride are referred to as post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) patients.

	- A clinical study indicated that in PFS patients, persistent alterations in steroid levels in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid were linked to andrological and psychiatric symptoms. Moreover, research using a PFS animal model demonstrated that finasteride treatment and withdrawal led to altered steroid levels not only in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid but also in the brain. Fascinatingly, a 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis of fecal samples from PFS patients identified specific modifications in the gut microbiota community composition, suggesting a potential etiological role in the syndrome. Specifically, the α‐diversity was markedly lower in the PFS group compared to healthy controls, indicating decreased richness in fecal samples with a unique taxonomic profile.

### Characteristics of men who report persistent sexual symptoms after finasteride use for hair loss [^112WHw2i]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Some men who use finasteride for hair loss report persistent sexual and other symptoms after discontinuing finasteride therapy. The study's objective was to determine whether these persistent symptoms are due to androgen deficiency, decreased peripheral androgen action, or persistent inhibition of steroid 5α-reductase (SRD5A) enzymes.

Participants included finasteride users who reported persistent sexual symptoms after discontinuing the drug (group 1), age-matched finasteride users who did not report sexual symptoms (group 2), and healthy men who had never used finasteride (group 3).

Outcomes measured were sexual function, mood, affect, cognition, hormone levels, body composition, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response to sexually and affectively valenced stimuli, nucleotide sequences of androgen receptor (AR), SRD5A1, and SRD5A2; and expression levels of androgen-dependent genes in skin. The study was conducted at an academic medical center.

Results showed that symptomatic finasteride users were similar in body composition, strength, and nucleotide sequences of AR, SRD5A1, and SRD5A2 genes compared to asymptomatic finasteride users and nonusers. However, symptomatic finasteride users had impaired sexual function, higher depression scores, a more negative affectivity balance, and more cognitive complaints than men in groups 2 and 3. Despite these findings, they had normal objectively assessed cognitive function. Testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol-glucuronide, and testosterone to dihydrotestosterone as well as androsterone glucuronide to etiocholanolone glucuronide ratios, and markers of peripheral an[test results truncated].

### Menopause, skin and common dermatoses. Part 1: Hair disorders [^114NwG3i]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

It is clear from studies that there is an association between menopause and both alopecia (scarring and non‐scarring) and hirsutism. This is supported by the use of enzyme inhibition (finasteride, dutasteride) and anti-androgens (spironolactone) as effective treatments in these conditions.

Although the exact mechanism requires further research, the association with menopause and the dramatic changes in hormonal milieu are evident. Despite this association, there is surprisingly little research on the role of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in hair conditions, and further research on this is required.

In conclusion, we have discussed the hormonal changes associated with menopause and the hair conditions in which it is implicated.
- **Learning points**:
	- Oestrogen is synthesized by the peripheral tissues, including skin, and ovaries, with the latter predominating prior to menopause.
	- Androgens, oestrogen, and progesterone have all been shown to affect the hair cycle.
	- Increased oestrogen levels can promote the anagen phase in hair follicles.
	- Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) commonly presents in menopause; however, the role of oestrogen and progesterone is yet to be established.
	- The aetiology of frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) is unclear; however, the role of antiandrogens in treatment of this condition supports the role of hormones in the disease process.
	- It is postulated that a relative imbalance of oestrogen and testosterone is implicated in the development of hirsutism.

To summarize the 6-year clinical trial data with finasteride, benign prostatic hyperplasia is a chronic and progressive disease; therefore, assessment of long-term safety and efficacy is important.

- **Methods**: The North American and International Phase III Finasteride trials enrolled symptomatic men with enlarged prostate glands. The initial 1-year placebo-controlled study was followed by a 5-year open-label extension. In total, 6-year finasteride data were available in 487 patients originally randomized to finasteride, and 5-year data were available on 238 patients originally randomized to placebo.

- **Results**: After 6 years of treatment with finasteride 5 mg, the mean quasi-American Urological Association Symptom Score improved by 4.0 points, the median prostate volume decreased by 24%, and the mean maximal urinary flow rate increased by 2.9 mL/s (P < 0.001 for all parameters). Long-term finasteride treatment was well-tolerated, with a low incidence of drug-related sexual adverse events occurring during the first year and even fewer occurrences during the 5-year open extension.

- **Conclusions**: Treatment with finasteride leads to durable improvement in urinary tract symptoms, flow rate, and prostate volume, with no increase in the prevalence of drug-related adverse events over time.

### Diagnosing and treating hair loss [^114z1WW7]. American Family Physician (2009). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for androgenetic alopecia, specifically concerning 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and male-pattern hair loss, the AAFP 2009 guidelines recommend acknowledging that discontinuation of finasteride results in the loss of any positive effects of treatment (e.g. hair growth) within 12 months.

### Prospective randomized study of sexual function in men taking dutasteride for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia [^116ezjsB]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Minimal changes in IIEF domain scores for intercourse satisfaction, orgasmic function, sexual desire, and overall satisfaction were observed. Some of the extreme drops in IIEF scores might have been caused by external factors (e.g. extended time out of town and a fight with their partner were reported) and were not necessarily correlated with the occurrence of sexual AE. Only 13 of the 30 participants with a worsening of IIEF-EF of 4 units or more had a corresponding AE of impotence or decreased libido.

As expected, hair growth satisfaction during the study was higher in the dutasteride than in the placebo group.

The impact of alopecia on QoL was minimal at baseline. The DLQI may not be the most appropriate tool because the impact on QoL of alopecia is primarily on self-esteem rather than daily activities. The small sample size in this study may be a limitation. The study was not powered to detect a significant difference between groups but was adequate to assess the persistence and reversibility of sexual AE.

In conclusion, no new safety signals were identified for dutasteride in this study. The sexual AE of impotence, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorders associated with dutasteride treatment were expected, tolerable, and reversible. Most sexual AE were mild or moderate, occurred early, and resolved while participants remained on treatment. Dutasteride was not associated with any persistent sexual dysfunction following treatment cessation.

### Side effects related to 5 α-reductase inhibitor treatment of hair loss in women: A review [^116xVjHK]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

5 α-reductase inhibitors, such as finasteride and dutasteride, have been studied for the treatment of hair loss in men, with finasteride being the only Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment. Increasingly, in recent years, off-label use of these drugs has been employed in the treatment of female pattern hair loss (FPHL) and frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) in women. Side effects with 5 α-reductase inhibitors can include changes in sexual function, and recent publications have characterized an increasing prevalence of these in men.

A review of 20 peer-reviewed articles found that very few side effects or adverse events related to sexual function have been reported in studies in which dutasteride or finasteride has been used to treat hair loss in women. Future publications should investigate not only the efficacy of these drugs in treating FPHL and FFA but the side effect profile in patients as well.

### Finasteride cream in hirsutism [^111eAf5w]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

To determine, in a preliminary study, whether women with hirsutism attributable to various causes would benefit from treatment with finasteride cream, a study was conducted using finasteride cream (0.25%) and placebo cream. These were administered to eight women with varying degrees of facial hirsutism. The creams were applied on opposite sides of the face in areas of excessive hair growth. The side chosen for the application of finasteride cream versus placebo was randomized and blinded. Hair counts were taken in a 1 cm² area on each side of the face every 2 months throughout the 6-month study period, and hair thickness was measured.

Hair follicles respond to testosterone by converting it to dihydrotestosterone through the action of 5α-reductase. Finasteride partially blocks this enzyme. Due to the high solubility of this medication through the skin, a cream applied to the area of hair growth would be expected to decrease hirsutism locally. After a 6-month period, mean hair counts significantly decreased from 27.5 to 15.5 (P < 0.05) in the finasteride-treated sites but showed no significant change from baseline in the placebo-applied sites. Moreover, the mean thickness of the measured hairs (in hundredths of millimeters) was significantly different between the placebo and finasteride-treated sites (4.33 versus 3.11, respectively; P < 0.001).

In this study of women with facial hirsutism, topically applied finasteride significantly decreased hair growth and thickness, and no adverse effects were noted.

### Evaluation of long-term efficacy of finasteride in Korean men with androgenetic alopecia using the basic and specific classification system [^115f7fQR]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

In the present study, the proportion of patients showing improvement — including no disease progression — was 98.4% after 5 years of treatment with finasteride. This score is similar to previous studies by Rossi et al. (93.0%) and Yoshitake et al. (100%). This suggests that the long-term use of finasteride can, at least, prevent the progression of androgenetic alopecia (AGA) in most cases. AGA is a progressive disease.

In a previous randomized, placebo-controlled trial, it was shown that AGA deteriorates gradually over a 5-year period if not treated. Thus, disease management may be as important in the treatment of AGA as the treatment itself. The proportion of patients who showed improvement in the present study was 85.7%, which is higher than Rossi et al. (38.6%) and lower than Yoshitake et al. (99.4%). This discrepancy may be due to differences in study design. The present study is retrospective, while the others were prospective and open-label. There might have been some selection bias in this study, potentially leading to an overestimation of treatment efficacy. However, the response rate in this study was lower than in the Japanese study.

Little is known about this discrepancy. Yoshitake et al. suggested it might be due to the characteristics of Asian hair — lower hair density, greater hair diameter, and greater contrast with the black color of the hair shaft compared with Caucasian hair — which may increase the likelihood of noticing minor changes. Additionally, drug efficacy may be impacted by racial differences.

### SPL drug information for finasteride [^114HxYCS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of finasteride PO (also known as Proscar) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: do not use. Evidence indicates fetal harm in humans. Finasteride is contraindicated during pregnancy. Pregnant women or females trying to conceive should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets. Finasteride and other 5-α-reductase inhibitors, by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to 5-α-dihydrotestosterone, have the ability to cause abnormalities in the external genitalia of the male fetus if administered to pregnant females. The drug finasteride PO (also known as Proscar) is classified under category X in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug poses such a high risk of causing permanent damage to the fetus that it should not be used during pregnancy or when there is a possibility of pregnancy.

Regarding medical management for androgenetic alopecia, specifically concerning 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and male-pattern hair loss, the EDF 2018 guidelines recommend considering oral dutasteride 0.5 mg/day as second-line therapy. This is suggested in cases where there has been previous ineffective treatment with 1 mg/day finasteride for more than 12 months.

### A novel multi-targeting approach to treating hair loss, using standardized nutraceuticals [^114c2t5H]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Hair loss is a complicated problem that causes significant concern for those who are affected. Patients seeking medical treatment have limited options that include topical minoxidil and oral finasteride. While these treatments are backed by long-term clinical use and research outcomes, many patients find topical minoxidil difficult to incorporate into their daily routine, and some are concerned with the side effects associated with finasteride.

In the office setting, patients may be treated with more invasive procedures such as platelet-rich plasma injections (PRP) and hair transplantation, treatments that often must be repeated and can lead to a costly investment. Consumers are increasingly interested in natural treatments for hair loss. Many turn to basic supplements only to be disappointed when they fail to deliver due to lack of standardization and efficacy.

In this paper, we review the benefits of a nutraceutical containing a specific blend of highly purified, standardized, bio-optimized, and bioavailable botanical extracts to treat hair loss. These phytoactives were selected because of their diverse multi-modal biologic activity against inflammation, DHT, stress mediators, oxidative damage, and intermediary signaling cascades. This supplement represents a paradigm shift as it addresses not only the factors that trigger hair loss but the downstream mediators of inflammation as well. Multi-center clinical studies are currently underway to confirm the efficacy and benefits of this unique nutraceutical.

### Testosterone replacement in men with sexual dysfunction [^111cn3Tq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for men with sexual dysfunction and testosterone deficiency. However, TRT is commonly promoted for men without testosterone deficiency, and existing trials often do not clearly report participants' testosterone levels or testosterone-related symptoms. This review assesses the potential benefits and harms of TRT in men presenting with complaints of sexual dysfunction.
- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of testosterone replacement therapy compared to placebo or other medical treatments in men with sexual dysfunction.
- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search of CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the trials registries ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, with no restrictions on language of publication or publication status, up to 29 August 2023.
- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in men (40 years or over) with sexual dysfunction. We excluded men with primary or secondary hypogonadism. We compared testosterone or testosterone with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5I) to placebo or PDE5I alone.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened the literature, assessed the risk of bias, extracted data, and rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) according to GRADE using a minimally contextualized approach. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to standard Cochrane methodology.

### Prospective randomized study of sexual function in men taking dutasteride for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia [^111G8hMV]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Mean changes from baseline on the DLQI to DB at weeks 12 and 24 were 0.2 and 0.7 units for the placebo group, and −0.4 and 0.2 units for the dutasteride group, respectively. There were no notable between-group differences.

### Prospective randomized study of sexual function in men taking dutasteride for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia [^115drKUG]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Health outcomes**: There were minimal mean changes from baseline in IIEF domain scores for intercourse satisfaction, orgasmic function, sexual desire, and overall satisfaction (range, −0.4 to 0.2). The IIEF‐EF domain mean scores in the placebo group remained stable (mean change, −0.5), while there was a trend towards worsening of erectile function in the dutasteride group from baseline to DB week 12 (mean change, −1.3) and 24 (mean change, −1.2).

	- There were large variations in individual participant scores across groups and time points, such as a change from baseline of −26 at a single visit, and 0 to −5 at preceding and following visits. The proportion of participants with an IIEF‐EF score decrease of 4 units or more from baseline to DB week 12 and 24 was higher with dutasteride (13% and 12%, respectively) than with the placebo group (7% and 5%, respectively) [week 12 treatment difference, 6.4% (95% confidence interval, −4.7% to 17.6%); week 24 difference, 6.3% (95% CI, −4.2% to 16.7%)]. In the OL period, only four participants switching from placebo to dutasteride experienced a decrease of 4 units or more.

	- The majority of participants (75−86%) reported "no change" to the global assessment questions on sexual function. The ability to achieve/maintain an erection was reported as "a little worse" for 9% in the placebo group and 13% in the dutasteride group (one additional participant reported "much worse") at DB week 24 and for 12% of participants overall at OL week 24.

	- Hair growth satisfaction was higher with dutasteride than placebo at DB weeks 12 and 24, with the adjusted mean change.

### Update on male hormonal contraception [^114dGdWC]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

In trials that tested testosterone-only regimens, the most common side effects were related to high-dose testosterone administration: acne, altered libido, night sweats, increased weight, and mood changes. The combination of testosterone with a progestin allowed a reduction of testosterone dose, minimizing androgenic side effects. When the testosterone dose was decreased and combined with a progestin, side effects were correlated with the type of progestin used. Progestins derived from nortestosterone, which retain their androgenic activity, more often caused androgen-related adverse side effects such as weight gain, acne, or decreased HDL-cholesterol.

Although side effects were reported in all studies, a placebo-controlled study that compared treatment with etonogestrel combined with TU versus placebo proved very interesting. In this study, active treatment was more frequently associated with mood and libido alterations, acne, weight gain, and night sweats. Interestingly, although not surprisingly, adverse side events reported by 93% of men on active treatment were also reported by 81% of men on placebo treatment. In this placebo-controlled trial, treatment was associated with a decrease of total cholesterol, HDL-, and LDL-cholesterol, with an increase in the total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio. This placebo-controlled trial was methodologically precise; however, a different regimen and longer administration time may lead to different adverse side events. For this reason, postmarketing monitoring is recommended to further evaluate the long-term safety profile.

### Diagnosing and treating hair loss [^115dMVro]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Physicians should be careful not to underestimate the emotional impact of hair loss for some patients. Patients may present with focal patches of hair loss or more diffuse hair loss, which may include predominant hair thinning or increased hair shedding. Focal hair loss can be further broken down into scarring and non-scarring. Scarring alopecia is best evaluated by a dermatologist. The cause of focal hair loss may be diagnosed by the appearance of the patch and examination for fungal agents. A scalp biopsy may be necessary if the cause of hair loss is unclear.

Alopecia areata presents with smooth hairless patches, which have a high spontaneous rate of resolution. Tinea capitis causes patches of alopecia that may be erythematous and scaly. Male and female pattern hair losses have recognizable patterns and can be treated with topical minoxidil, and also with finasteride in men. Sudden loss of hair is usually telogen effluvium, but can also be diffuse alopecia areata. In telogen effluvium, once the precipitating cause is removed, the hair will regrow.

### Prospective randomized study of sexual function in men taking dutasteride for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia [^111a2arV]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment with 5α-reductase inhibitors has been associated with sexual adverse events such as impotence (erectile dysfunction) and decreased libido. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate adverse events related to sexual function, based on their frequency, duration, persistence, and associated treatment discontinuations, in men treated with dutasteride for androgenetic alopecia. Participants were randomized to receive double-blind dutasteride 0.5 mg or placebo once daily for 24 weeks, followed by open-label dutasteride 0.5 mg for an additional 24 weeks. Sexual adverse events were followed up until resolution or for up to 24 weeks after the last dose.

Overall, 117 men, aged 23 to 50 years, were randomized. The incidence of sexual adverse events was approximately twofold higher in the dutasteride group (16%) compared to the placebo group (8%) during the double-blind period. The overall incidence of sexual adverse events was lower (5%) during the open-label period. All adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and considered treatment-related. The adverse events resolved while on study treatment or after the end of treatment, and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. A limitation of this study was the small sample size. The sexual adverse events of impotence, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorders reported in this study were expected and reversible.

### Finasteride-mediated hair regrowth and reversal of atrophy in a patient with frontal fibrosing alopecia [^114poaLn]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) is a form of cicatricial alopecia that predominantly affects perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Although the precise cause is unknown, it is currently classified as a primary lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia that is closely related to lichen planopilaris (LPP). FFA not only causes scarring hair loss but also frequently leads to skin atrophy within the frontal hairline.

Until recently, the treatment for FFA has mirrored the treatment algorithms used for other primary lymphocytic scarring alopecias. Topical steroids, steroid injections, hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline, tetracycline, and mycophenolate mofetil have been the main treatments. However, in the last few years, an increasing number of reports have suggested a beneficial role for the 5-alpha reductase inhibitory medications, finasteride and dutasteride.

At the time of writing, the published studies of FFA treatment outcomes have focused on hair follicles — whether they are lost, stabilized, or promoted to regrow. The other important feature of the condition, cutaneous atrophy, has not received much attention. Here, I report a patient with FFA who experienced not only marked frontal hair regrowth with the 5α-reductase inhibitor, finasteride, but also a marked reversal of cutaneous atrophy.

### Effective treatment of female androgenic alopecia with dutasteride [^114nAF88]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Dihydrotestosterone is the main molecule responsible for androgenic alopecia. Finasteride, which reduces the transformation of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone and decreases dihydrotestosterone activity, is approved for the treatment of androgenic alopecia in men. We describe the case of a 46-year-old woman with androgenic alopecia, who was non-responsive to minoxidil and initially benefited from finasteride.

Due to only limited improvement after finasteride and persisting profound psychological distress resulting from androgenic alopecia, another 5-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride, was introduced. Clinical evaluation and trichogram were applied for the assessment of dutasteride efficacy in this patient. Additionally, the mean hair diameter was monitored by means of computer dermoscopy. After 6 months of therapy, significant improvement was observed, and after 9 months, the clinical diagnosis of androgenic alopecia could no longer be made in this patient. No side effects were observed.

In conclusion, theoretical data and our experience in this case show that dutasteride might develop into a true alternative in the treatment of androgenic alopecia.

### Finasteride-mediated hair regrowth and reversal of atrophy in a patient with frontal fibrosing alopecia [^1125zvuX]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Emerging evidence suggests that 5α-reductase inhibitors may be among the most effective treatments for frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA). Although these drugs are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in women and must not be used in women of childbearing potential, they are increasingly used off-label for the treatment of postmenopausal FFA. Recent studies by Vano-Galvan et al. support the notion that partial hair regrowth may be possible for a significant proportion of FFA patients treated with 5α-reductase inhibitors. Specifically, 52 of 111 FFA patients (47%) experienced hair regrowth after treatment with these drugs. At the time of writing, hair regrowth does not appear to be a feature of any other class of drugs besides the 5α-reductase inhibitors.

It is well recognized that atrophy is a part of the clinical presentation of FFA. Atrophy can also be a side effect of topical steroids or steroid injections used to treat FFA. In our patient, atrophy was present before the initiation of the short course of topical mid-potency steroids; thus, atrophy cannot be attributed to the use of topical steroids. Moreover, the reversal of atrophy cannot be attributed to the cessation of topical steroid therapies. The timing of improvement of both atrophy and hair regrowth strongly favor this as an effect of finasteride therapy.

Descriptive studies and rating scales to document atrophy have not been undertaken. Of the main published FFA studies, only a brief mention is made of the atrophy or the presence of dilated veins in women with FFA. It is increasingly clear that disease activity scales often applied for the closely related conditions are necessary to better understand and manage FFA.

### Finasteride in the treatment of clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia: A systematic review of randomised trials [^113nSdFG]. BMC Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia affects older men. This systematic review determined the efficacy and adverse effects of finasteride.
- **Review methods**: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and reference lists of reports and reviews were searched for randomized, double-blind trials of finasteride in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Outcomes included symptom score, urinary flow rate, prostate volume, discontinuation, and adverse effects. Relative risk and NNT or NNH were calculated for dichotomous data. Sensitivity analyses assessed influences of baseline symptom severity, initial prostate volume, a dominating trial, and previous interventions.
- **Results**: Three trials had active controls and 19 had placebo. In placebo-controlled trials, 8,820 patients received finasteride 5 mg and 5,909 received a placebo over 3–48 months. Over 48 months, finasteride produced greater improvements in total symptom score, maximum urinary flow rate, and prostate volume. Significantly more sexual dysfunction, impotence, ejaculation disorder, and decreased libido occurred with finasteride at 12 months; the NNH for any sexual dysfunction at 12 months was 14. Significantly fewer men treated with finasteride experienced acute retention or had surgery at 24 or 48 months than with placebo; at 12 months, the NNT was 49 (31 to 112) to avoid one acute urinary retention and 31 (21 to 61) to avoid one surgery. Sensitivity analyses showed the benefit with finasteride 5 mg to be constant irrespective of the initial prostate volume.
- **Conclusions**: Information from many patients in studies of high quality showed beneficial effects of finasteride on benign prostatic hyperplasia outcomes.

### Dihydrotestosterone: Biochemistry, physiology, and clinical implications of elevated blood levels [^112qVZSZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Sexual function

Perhaps the most controversial area regarding the non-prostate-related effects of DHT in male health is sexual function, particularly concerning the reversibility, or lack thereof, of sexual side effects attributed to 5AR-Is. Multiple large studies have reported sexual dysfunction in men with BPH taking finasteride or dutasteride, including three large, placebo-controlled studies. Overall, the use of 5AR-Is is associated with a 5% to 9% prevalence of new-onset erectile dysfunction and decreased libido. These data strongly suggest a role for endogenous DHT in maintaining normal sexual and ejaculatory function and sexual desire. In fact, this has been shown to be true in healthy young men, where serum DHT concentration was the sole independent predictor of orgasm frequency, a surrogate for overall male sexual function.

The impact of reductions in serum DHT in younger men, who may be using 5AR-Is for MAA, is more controversial. Notably, some retrospective analyses and case series have suggested that sexual side effects in younger men taking 5AR-Is are irreversible; however, it should be noted that such analyses may suffer from recall bias and all lack a placebo control, so the findings should be treated with caution until appropriately designed trials are conducted. Of particular interest is one placebo-controlled trial in healthy young men that revealed small changes in sexual function and semen parameters (but not fertility) with both finasteride and dutasteride over one year. However, all of these changes.

### Finasteride use in the male infertility population: effects on semen and hormone parameters [^116Cwiyd]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

To determine the degree of improvement in semen parameters after finasteride discontinuation, a prospective database of men presenting for a fertility evaluation was analyzed for semen and hormone parameters before and after the discontinuation of finasteride. This study was conducted in a male infertility specialty clinic and involved men presenting for fertility evaluation from 2008–2012 who were on finasteride.

At presentation, 27 (0.6%) of 4,400 men were on finasteride. The mean duration of treatment with finasteride was 57.4 months, with a mean dose of 1.04 mg/day. After finasteride discontinuation, there was an average 11.6-fold increase in sperm counts. Among men with severe oligospermia (≤ 5 M/mL), counts improved to > 15 M/mL after finasteride cessation. No man experienced a decrease in sperm count. Moreover, there was no change in hormone parameters, sperm motility, or sperm morphology.

In conclusion, finasteride, even at low doses, may cause reduced sperm counts in some men. In this population, counts improved dramatically for the majority after finasteride discontinuation. Hormone parameters, sperm motility, and sperm morphology remained unchanged after cessation. Finasteride should be discontinued in subfertile men with oligospermia and used cautiously in men who desire fertility.

### Long-term (7 to 8-year) experience with finasteride in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112u9BbU]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effects of finasteride, a specific type II 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, on symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate volume, and urinary flow during a 7 to 8-year period, a study was conducted.
- **Methods**: A total of 190 men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia and enlarged prostates entered one of two Phase II double-blind 3 to 6-month studies. Of these, 156 patients continued taking open-label finasteride, and more than 70 patients completed 7 to 8 years of treatment. The symptoms were scored using a patient self-administered modified Boyarsky symptom questionnaire. Prostate volume was measured by magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography, and the maximal urinary flow rate was assessed noninvasively.
- **Results**: Treatment with finasteride for 7 to 8 years led to sustained improvement in symptoms, reduction in prostate volume (28% from baseline), and increased urinary flow (median 2.5 mL/s from baseline). Decreases in dihydrotestosterone (86%) and prostate-specific antigen (54%) levels were also maintained. Long-term finasteride treatment was safe and generally well tolerated.

In conclusion, long-term treatment with finasteride was well tolerated and resulted in durable symptom relief and improvement in prostate volume and urinary flow.

### Longitudinal analysis of sexual function reported by men in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial [^111afZdL]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2007). High credibility.

The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating the efficacy of finasteride in preventing prostate cancer in 18,882 men aged 55 years or older. The PCPT provided an opportunity to prospectively study the effects of finasteride and other covariates on sexual dysfunction.
- **Methods**: We assessed sexual dysfunction in 17,313 PCPT participants over a 7-year period. A battery of questionnaires evaluated sexual dysfunction (Sexual Activity Scale score), age, race, SF-36 Mental Health Inventory-5, Physical Function, and Vitality scores; body mass index; smoking status; and the presence of diabetes and hypertension. Assessments began at month 6 after random assignment and included the Sexual Activity Scale score at randomization as a covariate. Two-sided general t-tests, with a cutoff P value of less than .05, determined the statistical significance for mixed model effects with correlated random time slopes and intercepts. The changing impact of covariates on sexual dysfunction was also assessed at 6 months, 3.5 years, and 6.5 years after randomization.
- **Results**: Finasteride increased sexual dysfunction only slightly, and its impact diminished over time. The increase in the Sexual Activity Scale score relative to placebo was 3.21 points (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.83 to 3.59 points; p < 0.001) at the first assessment, and it decreased to 2.11 points (95% CI = 1.44 to 2.81 points; p < 0.001) at the end of the study. These Sexual Activity score values were small on a scale of 0–100, the range observed in the study.

### Prospective randomized study of sexual function in men taking dutasteride for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia [^112vicHt]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment-related adverse events (AE) during the double-blind (DB) period were reported by more participants in the dutasteride group (19%) than the placebo group (8%); the majority were associated with sexual function.

The incidence of sexual AEs was approximately twofold higher in the dutasteride group (16%) than the placebo group (8%) during the DB period but was lower (5%) in the open-label (OL) period. All sexual AEs were mild to moderate in severity and considered treatment-related. The onset of most sexual AEs occurred within the first 3 months of dutasteride treatment.

Overall, 20 participants experienced one or more sexual AEs: 14 participants during dutasteride treatment (nine DB and five OL), five with placebo, and one after placebo was discontinued. Notably, nine out of ten impotence AEs during the DB period were reported at a single study center (representing 56% of the 16 participants enrolled at that center), and four of six decreased libido AEs were reported at a different center (representing 17% of 23 participants).
- **Figure 1**: Onset and duration of on-treatment sexual adverse events (AEs). † Participant experienced two occurrences of AEs during the study. ‡ Participant 601 did not enter the OL period; therefore, his AE resolution was post-treatment.

### Adverse side effects of 5α-reductase inhibitors therapy: Persistent diminished libido, erectile dysfunction, and depression in a subset of patients [^115xKfUz]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

5α-reductase inhibitors (5α-RIs), such as finasteride and dutasteride, have been approved for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, demonstrating marked clinical efficacy. Finasteride is also approved for the treatment of hair loss (androgenetic alopecia). Although the adverse side effects of these agents are thought to be minimal, the magnitude of adverse effects on sexual function, gynecomastia, depression, and quality of life remains ill-defined.
- **Aim**: The goal of this review is to discuss 5α-RIs therapy, the potential persistent side effects, and the possible mechanisms responsible for these undesirable effects.
- **Methods**: We examined data reported in various clinical studies from the available literature concerning the side effects of finasteride and dutasteride.
- **Main outcome measures**: Data reported in the literature were reviewed and discussed. Prolonged adverse effects on sexual function, such as erectile dysfunction and diminished libido, are reported by a subset of men, raising the possibility of a causal relationship.
- **Conclusions**: We suggest discussion with patients on the potential sexual side effects of 5α-RIs before commencing therapy. Alternative therapies may be considered in the discussion, especially when treating androgenetic alopecia.

### Finasteride 5 mg and sexual side effects: How many of these are related to a nocebo phenomenon [^112kAVCG]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Sexual adverse experiences such as erectile dysfunction (ED), loss of libido, and ejaculation disorders have been consistent side effects of finasteride, affecting up to 15% of patients after one year of therapy. This data might seem unrealistic when compared to higher percentages observed in common clinical practice.

The aim of this study is to explain the dichotomy between literature data and clinical practice data.

One hundred twenty patients with a clinical diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), who were sexually active and had an International Index of Erectile Function-erectile function (IIEF-EF) domain score of ≥ 25, were randomized. They were assigned to receive finasteride 5 mg, concealed as an unspecified "X compound of proven efficacy for the treatment of BPH", for one year, with (group 2) or without (group 1) counseling on the drug's potential sexual side effects. The phrase used to inform group 2 patients was, "… it may cause erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, problems of ejaculation but these are uncommon".

- **Main outcome measures**: The estimation of side effects was conducted at six and twelve months using the Male Sexual Function-4 (MSF-4 item) questionnaire and a self-administered questionnaire.

One hundred seven patients completed the study. Group 2 patients (N = 55) reported a significantly higher proportion of one or more sexual side effects compared to group 1 (N = 52), with proportions of 43.6% vs. 15.3%, respectively (P = 0.03). The incidence of ED, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorders were 9.6%, 7.7%, and 5.7% for group 1, and 30.9%, 23.6%, and 16.3% for group 2, respectively.

### Why odds ratios can be tricky statistics: The case of finasteride, dutasteride, and sexual dysfunction [^114NCCWe]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Finasteride and dutasteride are 5α-reductase inhibitor drugs used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in men with BPH show that these drugs impair libido and cause erectile dysfunction. Meta-analyses of the RCTs confirm the findings, estimating odds ratio (OR) values for these adverse effects at around 1.50. A problem with meta-analyses that do not report absolute risks with drug vs. placebo, and that extract ORs instead of relative risks (RRs) from RCT data, is that it is hard for the reader to know how to interpret the findings and communicate them to patients.

Had the RR been 1.50, the reader would conclude that the risk with the drug is 50% higher than the risk with placebo; this is easily understood because the risk with placebo would be available from the RCTs. In contrast, an OR of 1.50 means that the odds with the drug are 50% higher than the odds with placebo; understanding this requires knowledge of the odds with placebo as well as an understanding of what odds mean. Odds are not as easily understood as risks are. Odds are numerically different from risks, and the OR is numerically different from the RR. The difference between the OR and the RR is numerically small when the risks are similar in the two groups. It is also small when the risks are dissimilar but the risk is small in the group of interest.

The difference between the OR and the RR becomes increasingly large when the risks are dissimilar in the two groups and when the risk in the group of interest is not small.

### Controversies in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia: The history of finasteride [^114gn1rU]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Male androgenetic alopecia (AGA) affects up to 60% of men by the age of 50. Currently, there are only two approved drugs for the treatment of male AGA: topical minoxidil and oral finasteride. Topical minoxidil is readily available over the counter and has a well-established safety record. However, following 24 weeks of treatment, less than 40% of men respond to the drug. Additionally, due to the topical route of administration, compliance with minoxidil remains low.

In contrast, oral finasteride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, demonstrated efficacy in arresting hair loss in more than 80% of patients following 12 months of treatment. However, controversy surrounding potential adverse sexual side effects has negatively affected public perception of the drug and may significantly reduce the number of patients that can benefit from the drug.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^113mwFg4]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Men with hypogonadism prescribed daily 1% generic testosterone gel use 30 tubes or packets per month; the starting dose for women with HSDD should be one-tenth of a tube or packet each day or 3 tubes per month. Resealable tubes are much preferred to packets to avoid evaporation and resulting change in testosterone concentration in the gel; tubes should be specified when prescribing testosterone gel. Using resealable tubes at room temperature, one-tenth of a male dose is approximately 4 drops/day. With the 1% cream available in Australia, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg/day testosterone (0.5 ml), which may be titrated to 10 mg/day (1.0 ml) as needed.

These topical preparations should be applied to a skin surface, typically the back of the calf or the upper outer thigh (at least an hour after shaving) or the buttock. The patient should be counseled about potential transference of testosterone from the application site to the skin of individuals (young children, female partners) and pets with whom the woman has close contact, while the risk of exposure to a male partner is minimal. The FDA warnings for men should be explained to women, including the need to wash hands immediately with soap and water after application of gel. If contact does occur, the residual testosterone can be washed off with soap and water. Long-term continual exposure may result in signs of virilization, changes in body hair, and acne, although these adverse effects are described in case reports of transference from men to women and children.

Patients should be monitored for clinical response to treatment.

### Long-term treatment with finasteride in men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia: 10-year follow-up [^116KQ58q]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of finasteride 5 mg during a 10-year period, men with enlarged prostates from a single center participated in the double-blind and extension phases of the multicenter, Phase III North American benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) trial. It is important that the long-term safety and efficacy of drugs intended for chronic administration in men with BPH be well understood.
- **Methods**: The Phase III North American BPH trial involved a 1-year, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, followed by a 5-year open extension with finasteride 5 mg/day. The trial enrolled men with symptomatic BPH, an enlarged prostate on digital rectal examination, and no evidence of prostate cancer. Of the 46 patients originally enrolled from our institution, 43 were randomized to receive finasteride or placebo, of whom 41 (95%) completed the double-blind study and entered the 5-year extension. Thirty (73%) of these 41 patients completed the 5-year extension. Patients continued to be followed up by their physicians for an additional 5 years, for a total follow-up of at least 10 years.
- **Results**: Twenty-four (56%) of the original 43 patients randomized to finasteride or placebo were judged as successfully treated during the 10-year finasteride follow-up, with 17 patients taking finasteride alone at 10 years and 7 patients who were taking finasteride alone when they discontinued during the 10-year follow-up for reasons not related to finasteride treatment. Altogether, 22 (51%) of the original 43 randomized patients continued finasteride treatment at 10 years.

### Topical finasteride: A potential therapeutic option for hidradenitis suppurativa [^117WE5HB]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Androgens may influence hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in several ways, but recommendations on hormonal therapies are based on limited evidence. Topical finasteride, inhibiting local hyperandrogenism caused by in-situ production of potent androgens, may be a promising option for HS therapy. However, larger studies are needed to demonstrate its role effectively.

### Neuroactive steroid levels are modified in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma of post-finasteride patients showing persistent sexual side effects and anxious/depressive symptomatology [^117E61o2]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Observations performed in a subset of subjects treated with finasteride (an inhibitor of the enzyme 5α-reductase) for male pattern hair loss seem to indicate that sexual dysfunction as well as anxious/depressive symptomatology may occur at the end of the treatment and continue after discontinuation.
- **Aim**: A possible hypothesis to explain depression symptoms after finasteride treatment might be impairment in the levels of neuroactive steroids. Therefore, neuroactive steroid levels were evaluated in paired plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained from male patients who received finasteride for the treatment of androgenic alopecia and who, after drug discontinuation, still show long-term sexual side effects as well as anxious/depressive symptomatology.
- **Methods**: The levels of neuroactive steroids were evaluated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in three post-finasteride patients and compared to those of five healthy controls.
- **Main outcome measures**: Neuroactive steroid levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of post-finasteride patients and healthy controls.
- **Results**: At the examination, the three post-finasteride patients reported muscular stiffness, cramps, tremors, and chronic fatigue in the absence of clinical evidence of any muscular disorder or strength reduction. Severity and frequency of the anxious/depressive symptoms were quite variable; overall, all the subjects had a fairly complex and constant neuropsychiatric pattern. Assessment of neuroactive steroid levels in patients showed some interindividual differences. However, the most reliable outcome…

### Prospective randomized study of sexual function in men taking dutasteride for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia [^111dqUEL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

In the study, most sexual adverse events (AE) resolved while participants remained on treatment. The four AE ongoing at the end of treatment resolved within six weeks after the last dose of dutasteride. The sexual AE profile of dutasteride treatment for male lower urinary tract symptoms/BPH has been consistent in previous randomized control trials. Interestingly, most sexual AE occur in the first six months of dutasteride treatment in BPH clinical trials, and the likelihood of patients experiencing such AE even decreases over time. Furthermore, it has been previously reported in the combAT study that impotence was the most frequently reported sexual AE in patients with BPH who received treatment with dutasteride. In a study of patients with androgenetic alopecia (ARI114264 study), sexual AE resolved while on treatment in six participants and resolved within six months after the end of treatment in 13 participants. The resolution pattern of sexual AE in the AGA population of the study seems to be analogous to the findings previously reported. These results also support the reversibility of sexual AE that occur with dutasteride treatment.

The majority of impotence AE (9 out of 12 participants) were reported at a single study center; thus, variability in reporting sexual AE also appears to be influenced by a human component. The inter-site and inter-study variability could be linked to the nocebo phenomenon, where the occurrence of symptoms is related to a patient's negative expectations. This phenomenon was shown in a randomized controlled study evaluating sexual dysfunction.

### Evidence-based (S3) guideline for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in women and in men - short version [^111yN9aC]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for androgenetic alopecia, more specifically with respect to 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and female-pattern hair loss, the EDF 2018 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of oral finasteride in patients with female-pattern hair loss.

### Long-term treatment with finasteride results in a clinically significant reduction in total prostate volume compared to placebo over the full range of baseline prostate sizes in men enrolled in the MTOPS trial [^115Ybqeh]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

In the present analysis, we examined data from the MTOPS (Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms) trial to determine the effect of long-term finasteride treatment, either alone or in combination with doxazosin, on total prostate volume across the full range of baseline total prostate volume values in men enrolled in this study.
- **Materials and methods**: In this trial, a total of 3,047 patients with lower urinary tract symptoms were randomized to receive placebo, doxazosin (4 to 8 mg), finasteride (5 mg), or the combination of doxazosin and finasteride. The average length of treatment was 4.5 years. Total prostate volume was measured by transrectal ultrasound in all patients at baseline, yearly, and at study end or upon termination of participation.
- **Results**: Long-term treatment with finasteride led to a consistent reduction of approximately 25% in total prostate volume compared to placebo. This effect was observed in men with a relatively small prostate (less than 25 to 30 ml), as well as in those with a moderate-sized (30 to less than 40 ml) or enlarged prostate (40 mL or greater) at baseline.
- **Conclusions**: In this MTOPS data analysis, long-term (more than 4 years) treatment with finasteride, either alone or in combination with doxazosin, led to a consistent and clinically significant reduction in total prostate volume compared to placebo. This was true for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and benign prostatic hyperplasia whose baseline prostate size ranged from relatively small (less than 25 to 30 ml) to enlarged (40 mL or greater).

### Prospective randomized study of sexual function in men taking dutasteride for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia [^112eAdxu]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment with 5α-reductase inhibitors has been associated with sexual adverse events such as impotence (erectile dysfunction) and decreased libido. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate adverse events related to sexual function, based on their frequency, duration, persistence, and associated treatment discontinuations, in men treated with dutasteride for androgenetic alopecia. Participants were randomized to receive double‐blind dutasteride 0.5 mg or placebo once daily for 24 weeks, followed by open-label dutasteride 0.5 mg for an additional 24 weeks. Sexual adverse events were followed up until resolution or for up to 24 weeks after the last dose.

Overall, 117 men, aged 23–50 years, were randomized. The incidence of sexual adverse events was approximately twofold higher in the dutasteride group (16%) than in the placebo group (8%) during the double‐blind period. The overall incidence of sexual adverse events was lower (5%) during the open-label period. All adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and considered treatment-related. The adverse events resolved while on study treatment or after the end of treatment and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. A limitation of this study was the small sample size. The sexual adverse events of impotence, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorders reported in this study were expected and reversible.

### Long-term consequences of finasteride vs placebo in the prostate cancer prevention trial [^111DwG5b]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2016). Low credibility.

Finasteride has been found to reduce the risk of low-grade prostate cancer but does not impact overall survival. The long-term adverse and beneficial consequences of finasteride have not been examined.
- **Methods**: We used a linkage between data from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) and Medicare claims. Patients were examined by randomized study arm (finasteride vs. placebo for 7 years) for long-term consequences of the intervention, including cardiac, endocrine, and sexual dysfunction, depression, diabetes, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related events. To examine time to events, we used cumulative incidence and Cox regression, adjusting for covariates. All statistical tests were two-sided.
- **Results**: A total of 13,935 of 18,880 participants (73.8%) in the PCPT were linked to Medicare claims, with a median Medicare follow-up assessment time of 16 years from trial registration. There were no differences between finasteride and placebo participants concerning important baseline factors or the amount of Medicare follow-up assessment time. Finasteride patients had a 10% higher risk of new claims for depression (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01 to 1.19, P = 0.04) and a 6% lower risk of procedures for BPH-related events (primarily lower urinary tract symptoms; HR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.89 to 1.00, P = 0.03). No other differences were found in rates of long-term consequences of intervention in the two study arms.
- **Conclusions**: Finasteride use is associated with a reduced need for procedures for relief of BPH-related events and a modest increase in depression risk.

### Evaluation of long-term efficacy of finasteride in Korean men with androgenetic alopecia using the basic and specific classification system [^111nSGEY]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common type of baldness, characterized by a patterned, progressive hair loss of the scalp. Traditionally, various classification methods have been proposed to describe the pattern and severity of AGA, including the Hamilton, Norwood–Hamilton, and Olsen classifications. Recently, Lee et al. devised a new method – the basic and specific (BASP) classification – that can describe the variable clinical patterns of AGA. This classification provides a precise description of female pattern hair loss and may be applicable to both male and female patients. The BASP classification was demonstrated to be useful in describing the exact amount and distribution of hair loss in those with patterned hair loss; therefore, it has been utilized in previous studies to investigate the association between the distribution of hair loss and familial factors.

Finasteride 1 mg is an approved treatment for male AGA patients aged 18–40 years. It selectively inhibits type 2-selective 5α-reductase, which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, known to be the main pathogenetic factor of AGA. Although finasteride has been widely used to treat male AGA in clinical settings, to the best of our knowledge, its efficacy or safety has not been fully studied in the Korean population at the time of writing. Furthermore, there are only a few clinical studies investigating its long-term (> 5 year) efficacy, and none – to the best of our knowledge –

### Incidence and severity of sexual adverse experiences in finasteride and placebo-treated men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^113HruKX]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the incidence and resolution of sexual adverse experiences (AEs) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia treated with finasteride 5 mg compared with placebo. The Proscar Long-term Efficacy and Safety Study (PLESS) was a 4-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of finasteride 5 mg in 3040 men, aged 45 to 78 years, with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia, enlarged prostates, and no evidence of prostate cancer. Patients completed a questionnaire at screening regarding their history of sexual dysfunction. During treatment, spontaneously self-reported sexual AEs were recorded.

At screening, 46% of patients in each treatment group reported some history of sexual dysfunction. During year one of the study, 15% of finasteride-treated patients and 7% of placebo-treated patients had sexual AEs that were considered drug-related by the investigator (P < 0.001). During years two to four, no between-group difference was noted in the incidence of new sexual AEs (7% in each group). The drug-related sexual AE profile for finasteride was similar for men with or without a history of sexual dysfunction. Sexual AEs resolved while continuing therapy in 12% of finasteride patients and 19% of placebo patients. Furthermore, only 4% of finasteride and 2% of placebo patients discontinued the study because of sexual AEs. In men who discontinued with a sexual AE, 50% and 41% experienced resolution of their sexual AE after discontinuing finasteride or placebo therapy, respectively.

In conclusion, compared with placebo, men treated with finasteride demonstrated a higher incidence of drug-related sexual AEs in the first year, but there were no significant differences in subsequent years or in the resolution of AEs.

### Effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors on sexual function: A meta-analysis and systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^116F1f2i]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

5α-Reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) are widely used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as well as androgenetic alopecia (AGA).
- **Aim**: To review all the available data on the effect of 5ARIs on sexual function and assess whether 5ARIs increase the risk of sexual dysfunction.
- **Methods**: A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The search was limited to articles published in English and up to October 2015. Article selection proceeded according to the search strategy based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses criteria. Data were analyzed using Stata 12.0. A fixed- or a random-effects model was used to calculate the overall combined risk estimates. Publication bias was assessed using Begg and Egger tests.
- **Main outcome measures**: Sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, and decreased libido.
- **Results**: After screening 493 articles, 17 randomized controlled trials with 17,494 patients were included. Nine studies evaluated the efficacy of 5ARIs in men with BPH, while the other eight reported using 5ARIs in the treatment of men with AGA. The mean age of participants was 60.10 years across all studies. We included 10 trials (6,779 patients) on the efficacy and safety of finasteride, 4 trials (6,222 patients) on the safety and tolerability of dutasteride, and 3 trials (4,493 patients) using finasteride and dutasteride for AGA. The pooled relative risks for sexual dysfunction were 2.56 (95% CI = 1.48–4.42) in men with BPH and 1.21 (95% CI = 0.85–1.72) in men with AGA.
