## Question

How does phenylephrine cause bradycardia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how phenylephrine causes bradycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's primary pharmacology and whether it has direct chronotropic effects. Then, I should verify the baroreflex physiology that links increased afterload to vagal activation. Next, I will examine the magnitude and clinical contexts where this reflex bradycardia is most pronounced. After that, I should consider exceptions and modifiers, including anesthesia, drug interactions, and patient-specific factors. Finally, I will synthesize a concise mechanism and translate it into practical clinical implications and management strategies.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology, because if I misstate the mechanism, everything downstream will be off. Phenylephrine is a selective alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that causes peripheral vasoconstriction and increases systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure, with minimal direct beta-adrenergic activity, so it lacks meaningful direct chronotropic stimulation of the sinoatrial node [^f2f9afc3] [^dc703eaa] [^a95261c4].

> Wait, let me verify the reflex pathway before I jump ahead. As mean arterial pressure rises, arterial baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch are stretched, increasing afferent input to the medulla and triggering increased parasympathetic (vagal) efferent output to the heart, which slows sinus node automaticity and atrioventricular conduction, producing reflex bradycardia; this is a classic baroreceptor-mediated response described in FDA labeling and supported by contemporary neuroscience mapping of baroreflex circuits [^f2f9afc3] [^dc703eaa] [^864cd4ca].

> I should double-check the magnitude and clinical contexts where this is most evident. In obstetric neuraxial anesthesia, phenylephrine reliably increases blood pressure but frequently causes reflex bradycardia, with randomized trials and meta-analyses showing higher bradycardia incidence versus norepinephrine or ephedrine, and dose-ranging work illustrating that infusion strategies can mitigate but not eliminate this effect; similarly, in critical care and perioperative settings, phenylephrine is associated with decreased cardiac output due to bradycardia and increased afterload, reinforcing the clinical relevance of the baroreflex mechanism [^f7d7d86a] [^a012a67c] [^4ba9c7a2] [^6e691252].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universality. I need to check modifiers that blunt or amplify the baroreflex. General anesthesia, particularly with volatile agents, can impair baroreflex gain, so the expected bradycardia may be attenuated or absent in some anesthetized patients; conversely, enhanced baroreflex sensitivity, as seen in certain genetic or pathophysiologic states, can exaggerate the bradycardic response to phenylephrine, and coadministration of anticholinergics like atropine can block the vagal limb and blunt reflex bradycardia, though this may unmask hypertension [^8d27034b] [^fe272670] [^6736714a] [^2ca02fff].

> Let me consider special populations and formulations, because absorption and autonomic tone matter. In neonates and infants, topical ophthalmic phenylephrine can be systemically absorbed and provoke marked bradycardia even at lower concentrations, underscoring that the baroreflex is intact and responsive in this age group; in heart transplant recipients with cardiac denervation, phenylephrine raises blood pressure without triggering reflex bradycardia, providing a natural experiment that confirms the afferent-efferent baroreflex loop as the mediator in intact autonomic systems [^c64ee331] [^86b0de31].

> I should confirm the clinical implications and management so the mechanism translates to bedside care. Because phenylephrine can cause severe bradycardia and reduce cardiac output, it is not ideal as a sole first-line vasopressor in shock states where heart rate and forward flow are critical; guidelines and expert statements recommend norepinephrine as preferred in cardiogenic shock and favor agents with beta-activity when bradycardia is a concern, while in obstetric anesthesia, prophylactic phenylephrine infusions are effective for hypotension but require readiness to treat bradycardia with anticholinergics or adjust the vasopressor strategy if heart rate falls excessively [^6e691252] [^194520c9] [^a012a67c].

> Let me synthesize the mechanism succinctly, and I will sanity-check it against the sources one more time. Phenylephrine causes bradycardia indirectly via baroreflex activation: alpha-1–mediated vasoconstriction increases afterload and mean arterial pressure, baroreceptors sense this as hypertension, and the medulla responds by increasing vagal tone, which slows the heart rate; this is a predictable, dose-related, and context-sensitive reflex that can be blunted by anesthesia or blocked by anticholinergics, and it explains why phenylephrine is associated with reflex bradycardia across multiple clinical scenarios [^f2f9afc3] [^dc703eaa] [^864cd4ca].

---

Phenylephrine causes bradycardia by **activating arterial baroreceptors** [^864cd4ca] when it raises blood pressure, triggering a reflex increase in vagal tone that slows the heart rate [^f2f9afc3]. This is a **predictable, dose-dependent reflex** [^fe272670] and not a direct myocardial effect. Clinically, bradycardia is most often mild and transient, but it can be severe in sensitive patients or with high doses; management includes reducing the dose or stopping the infusion, and using atropine if the bradycardia is symptomatic [^6eac6188].

---

## Mechanism of phenylephrine-induced bradycardia

### Primary mechanism: baroreceptor reflex

- **Baroreceptor activation**: Phenylephrine's α1-agonism causes peripheral vasoconstriction, increasing SVR and MAP, which stretches baroreceptors and increases afferent signaling to the medulla [^f2f9afc3].

- **Central integration**: The medulla responds by increasing parasympathetic (vagal) efferent output to the heart, slowing SA node firing and AV conduction [^864cd4ca].

- **Resulting bradycardia**: The net effect is reflex bradycardia with preserved or increased blood pressure [^4ba9c7a2].

---

### Secondary mechanisms and modulating factors

- **Venous return and preload**: Vasoconstriction can reduce venous return, potentially lowering preload and contributing to bradycardia in preload-dependent states [^1262338d].

- **Autonomic tone**: Baseline vagal tone and baroreflex sensitivity modulate the magnitude of bradycardia; higher sensitivity yields stronger reflex slowing [^fe272670].

- **Drug interactions**: Beta-blockers can blunt compensatory tachycardia, while anticholinergics (e.g. atropine) block the vagal effect and prevent bradycardia [^2ca02fff].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting baroreflex-mediated bradycardia

Multiple clinical and experimental studies confirm the **baroreflex mechanism**:

| **Study type** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|
| FDA labeling | Explicitly states that as MAP rises, vagal activity increases, causing reflex bradycardia [^f2f9afc3] [^dc703eaa] |
| Randomized trials | Phenylephrine increases blood pressure and causes dose-related bradycardia during spinal anesthesia and other settings [^f7d7d86a] [^a012a67c] |
| Meta-analyses | Phenylephrine is associated with higher bradycardia incidence than norepinephrine or ephedrine in obstetric anesthesia [^a6e9a300] [^9f38e970] |
| Experimental studies | Animal models show robust baroreflex-mediated bradycardia with phenylephrine, with baroreflex gain determining the magnitude [^864cd4ca] [^fe272670] |

---

## Clinical significance and management

- **Incidence and severity**: Bradycardia is common with phenylephrine, usually mild and transient, but can be severe (HR < 50 bpm) in sensitive patients or with high doses [^f7d7d86a] [^a012a67c].

- **Patient populations at risk**: Patients with high vagal tone, autonomic dysfunction, or preload dependence are more susceptible [^5c8df198].

- **Management strategies**: Reduce dose or stop infusion; use atropine for symptomatic bradycardia; consider alternatives like norepinephrine or ephedrine when bradycardia is problematic [^6eac6188] [^194520c9].

---

## Comparison with other vasopressors

Compared with other vasopressors, **norepinephrine** causes less bradycardia because its beta-1 activity helps maintain heart rate, whereas **ephedrine** tends to cause tachycardia due to beta-agonism and is less likely to cause bradycardia [^f7d7d86a] [^a6e9a300].

---

Phenylephrine-induced bradycardia is a **predictable baroreflex response** to increased afterload and blood pressure, mediated by vagal activation rather than direct myocardial depression. It is dose-related and context-dependent, and management centers on dose adjustment and vagal blockade when indicated.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Phenylephrine hydrochloride is an α-1 adrenergic receptor agonist.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Phenylephrine is the active moiety. Metabolites are inactive at both the α-1and α-2 adrenergic receptors. Following parenteral administration of phenylephrine hydrochloride, increases in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, and total peripheral vascular resistance are observed. The onset of blood pressure increase following an intravenous bolus phenylephrine hydrochloride administration is rapid and the effect may persist for up to 20 minutes. As mean arterial pressure increases following parenteral doses, vagal activity also increases, resulting in reflex bradycardia.

Most vascular beds are constricted, including renal, splanchnic, and hepatic.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Following an intravenous infusion of phenylephrine hydrochloride, the effective half-life was approximately 5 minutes. The steady-state volume of distribution (340 L) exceeded the body volume by a factor of 5, suggesting a high distribution into certain organ compartments. The average total serum clearance (2095 mL/min) was close to one-third of the cardiac output.

A mass balance study showed that phenylephrine is extensively metabolized by the liver with only 12% of the dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Deamination by monoamino oxidase is the primary metabolic pathway resulting in the formation of the major metabolite (m-hydroxymandelic acid) which accounts for 57% of the total administered dose.

### Phenylephrine hydrochloride [^312f8577]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Phenylephrine hydrochloride is an α-1 adrenergic agonist drug that is used in ophthalmology mainly for its mydriatic effect. After topical application to the conjunctiva, phenylephrine acts directly on α-adrenergic receptors in the eye, producing contraction of the dilator muscle of the pupil and constriction of the arterioles in the conjunctiva.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Maximal mydriasis occurs in 20 to 90 minutes with recovery after 3 to 8 hours.

Systemic absorption of sufficient quantities of phenylephrine may lead to systemic α-adrenergic effects, such as rise in blood pressure which may be accompanied by a reflex atropine-sensitive bradycardia.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The systemic exposure following topical administration of phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution has not been studied. A higher systemic absorption is expected for the 10% solution than the 2.5% solution and when the corneal barrier function is compromised.

Evidence profile for the safety and efficacy of blood pressure elevation using any vasopressor drug compared to no vasopressor drug in patients acute ischaemic stroke and clinical deterioration not treated with reperfusion therapies.

Additional information

In a pilot trial, 15 patients recruited within 7 days of symptom onset, with > 20% diffusion – perfusion mismatch on MRI and quantifiable, stable or worsening of aphasia, hemispatial neglect and/or hemiparesis were randomly assigned to induced hypertension with phenylephrine or control. There was more improvement in NIHSS scores in the induced hypertension group compared to the control group on day 3 and on day 90. Since functional outcome was not assessed with mRS at 90 days the study was not included in our meta-analysis.

The Early Manipulation of Arterial Blood Pressure in Acute Ischaemic Stroke (MAPAS) trial randomised 218 patients within 12 hours of acute ischaemic stroke to maintain systolic blood pressure during 24 hours within three ranges; Group 1: SBP target 140–160 mm Hg, Group 2: SBP target 161–180 mm Hg, and Group 3: SBP target 181–200 mm Hg. Overall, systolic blood pressure was increased in 41% of the patients. Norepinephrine was used to increase blood pressure in 17% of patients in Group 1, 48% of patients in Group 2 and 62% of patients in Group 3. There was no difference between the groups in functional outcome at 90 days. Adverse events (acute coronary syndrome and bradycardia) were limited to group 2 (4%) and Group 3 (7.6%) and were associated with norepinephrine infusion. There was also a significantly higher sICH rate in Group 3.

In addition, observational data from small pilot studies indicate that phenylephrine induced hypertension may be associated with neurological improvement in patients with AIS due to large artery atherosclerotic steno-occlusive disease or small vessel occlusion. –

Expert consensus statement

In patients with acute ischaemic stroke not treated with reperfusion therapies (intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy) and with clinical deterioration where a haemodynamic mechanism is suspected or shown to be directly responsible for the deterioration, we suggest:

- stopping existing blood pressure lowering therapy,

- administering intravenous fluids and

- introducing non-pharmacological procedures to raise blood pressure

before considering

- careful use of vasopressor agents to increase blood pressure with close monitoring of blood pressure values. Vote 10 of 10.

### Cardiovascular adverse effects of phenylephrine eyedrops: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^44c82110]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Topical phenylephrine hydrochloride is routinely administered with few safety precautions, but evidence regarding its systemic safety to date is controversial. As even short-term variations in 24-hour blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) can adversely affect cardiovascular health, better evidence on phenylephrine's effects on HR and BP is required.

Objective

To perform a meta-analysis of available evidence regarding cardiovascular adverse effects of topical phenylephrine.

Data Sources

PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Clinical Trials were searched for relevant literature from January 1, 1970, to January 1, 2014, using a combination of the following search terms: topical, ocular, ophthalmic, phenylephrine, tropicamide, cardiovascular effect, side effect, blood pressure, heart rate, mydriatic, and eye drops. A total of 70 articles related to the topic were identified and all full texts were retrieved.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials reporting change in BP and HR for adults were included in this review. All studies reporting results for neonates or infants, not reporting standard deviations, or not specifying the time of measurement or the concentration of phenylephrine used were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data from randomized clinical trials that reported BP and/or HR as well as the time following administration of topical phenylephrine at which measurements were obtained by concentration of phenylephrine as a mean change and its standard deviation were extracted. Data were synthesized by concentration of phenylephrine and time of measurement following topical application using random-effects models with inverse variance weighting to account for heterogeneity across studies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Difference in BP and HR after topical administration of phenylephrine.

Results

Eight RCTs with a total of 916 participants were included. Data were available for phenylephrine, 2.5%, at 20 to 30 minutes and 60 minutes or longer after administration, and neither BP nor HR changed at either time. Following application of phenylephrine, 10%, BP increased at 5 and 10 minutes (mean difference for both, +15 mm Hg; 95% CI, 11.94–18.54; P < .001) but decreased at 20 to 30 minutes and 60 minutes or longer with no changes detected against baseline. A mean increase in HR by 4.48 beats/min (95% CI, 1.09–7.88; P = 0.01) was present at 20 to 30 minutes following application of phenylephrine, 10%, and HR decreased by 60 minutes or longer with no changes detected compared with baseline.

Conclusions and Relevance

Phenylephrine, 2.5%, leads to no clinically relevant change in BP or HR, and the changes in BP and HR seen with phenylephrine, 10%, are short lived. Thus, phenylephrine, 2.5%, is safe to use in clinical routine.

### A randomised controlled trial of phenylephrine and noradrenaline boluses for treatment of postspinal hypotension during elective caesarean section [^ee87d190]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Phenylephrine is currently the vasopressor of choice during elective caesarean section, but it can cause reflex bradycardia. Noradrenaline, a potent α-agonist and weak β-agonist, may be associated with a lower incidence of bradycardia. However, comparative information is limited. This double-blind randomised controlled trial compared the effects of 100 μg phenylephrine and 5 μg noradrenaline administered as boluses for the treatment of postspinal hypotension during elective caesarean section in women with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy. Hypotension was defined as a decrease of ≥ 20% from baseline systolic arterial pressure, or an absolute value < 100 mmHg. Ninety women were included in the study. The primary outcome was the incidence of maternal bradycardia < 60 beats.min -1. There was no difference in the incidence of bradycardia (37.8% with phenylephrine vs. 22.2% with noradrenaline; p = 0.167), number of hypotensive episodes, number of boluses required to treat the first hypotensive episode or reactive hypertension. The total number of boluses used was higher in the phenylephrine group (p = 0.01). Maternal heart rate at 1 min after vasopressor administration was non-significantly lower using phenylephrine vs. noradrenaline (p = 0.034, considering p < 0.01 as statistically significant). The umbilical artery pH was higher using phenylephrine than with noradrenaline (p = 0.034). In conclusion, both vasopressors reversed postspinal hypotension without a statistically significant difference in maternal bradycardia. However, in view of the lower umbilical artery pH when using noradrenaline, further research is warranted to study its placental transfer and fetal metabolic effects.

### Molecularly defined circuits for cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary control [^864cd4ca]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

The baroreflex selectively activates ACV

We sought to identify physiological stimuli that activate ACP and ACV neurons. Amb Cardiac neurons are knownto mediate the baroreceptor reflex, a classic cardiovascular reflex essential for homeostatic maintenance of arterial pressure and end-organ perfusion. Aortic arch baroreceptors convert increases in blood pressure to an afferent neuronal signal that results in activation of Amb Cardiac neurons, which counteract the increases in blood pressure by decreasing heart rate. To determine if ACP and ACV neurons are activated by the baroreceptor reflex, we induced the reflex with phenylephrine, a peripherally-acting α 1 -adrenergic receptor agonist that causes vasoconstriction and reflex activation of Amb Cardiac neurons leading to bradycardia. Awake wild-type mice were administered phenylephrine, and 150 minutes later animals were euthanized and ACP and ACV neurons immunostained for c-Fos, a neuronal activity marker (Fig. 5a). In vehicle-treated control mice, neither ACP or ACV neurons expressed c-Fos, indicating ACP and ACV activity is off or low under baseline conditions (Fig. 5b, Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). However, in phenylephrine-treated mice, we observed robust activation of ACV neurons (Fig. 5b, d), with ~70% staining positive for c-Fos. The effect was selective for ACV because ACP neurons remained c-Fos-negative under these conditions (Fig. 5b, c, Extended Data Fig. 9). Thus, the baroreceptor reflex selectively recruits ACV neurons.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Severe bradycardia and decreased cardiac output (5.2)
Extravasation: during intravenous administration may cause necrosis or sloughing of tissue (5.4)
Concomitant use with oxytocic drugs: pressor effect of sympathomimetic pressor amines is potentiated (5.5)

5.1 Exacerbation of Angina, Heart Failure, or Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

Because of its pressor effects, phenylephrine hydrochloride can precipitate angina in patients with severe arteriosclerosis or history of angina, exacerbate underlying heart failure, and increase pulmonary arterial pressure.

5.2 Bradycardia

Phenylephrine hydrochloride can cause severe bradycardia and decreased cardiac output.

5.3 Risk in Patients with Autonomic Dysfunction

The pressor response to adrenergic drugs, including phenylephrine, can be increased in patients with autonomic dysfunction, as may occur with spinal cord injuries.

5.4 Skin and Subcutaneous Necrosis

Extravasation of phenylephrine can cause necrosis or sloughing of tissue. Avoid extravasation by checking infusion site for free flow.

5.5 Pressor Effect with Concomitant Oxytocic Drugs

Oxytocic drugs potentiate the pressor effect of sympathomimetic pressor amines including phenylephrine hydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7.1)], with the potential for hemorrhagic stroke.

5.6 Peripheral and Visceral Ischemia

Phenylephrine hydrochloride can cause excessive peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction and ischemia to vital organs, particularly in patients with extensive peripheral vascular disease.

5.7 Renal Toxicity

Phenylephrine hydrochloride can increase the need for renal replacement therapy in patients with septic shock. Monitor renal function.

### Yohimbine attenuates baroreflex-mediated bradycardia in humans [^00628525]. Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Alpha-2 adrenoreceptor stimulation profoundly augments baroreflex-mediated bradycardia presumably through parasympathetic activation. We tested the hypothesis that endogenous alpha-2 adrenergic tone mediates a similar response. In 10 healthy men (age: 33 ± 3 years; body mass index: 24 ± 1.3 kg/m(2)), we determined baroreflex control of heart rate and sympathetic traffic after ingestion of the selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (20 mg) or placebo. Testing was conducted in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. We measured heart rate, brachial and finger blood pressure, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity. Sympathetic and parasympathetic baroreflex curves were determined using incremental phenylephrine and nitroprusside infusions (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 microg/kg per minute). Plasma norepinephrine increased with yohimbine (50 ± 38 ng/L; P < 0.05) and was unchanged with placebo (2.2 ± 7.6 ng/L). Blood pressure increased 13 ± 4/8 ± 1 mm Hg with yohimbine and 6 ± 2/3 ± 1 mm Hg with placebo (P < 0.01). HR increased 5 ± 1 bpm with yohimbine but did not change with placebo (P < 0.01). Ninety minutes after drug ingestion, resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity was similar with yohimbine and with placebo. Baroreflex control of heart rate was decreased with yohimbine (6 ms/mm Hg versus 10 ms/mm Hg; P < 0.01) and reset to higher blood pressure and heart rate values. In contrast, yohimbine did not alter the sympathetic baroreflex curve. Yohimbine selectively attenuates baroreflex heart rate control in normotensive young men possibly through parasympathetic mechanisms.

### 2025 concise clinical guidance: an ACC expert consensus statement on the evaluation and management of cardiogenic shock: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^6e691252]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) vasoactive therapy and escalation — Inodilators or vasodilators may be considered in normotensive CS, with intravenous milrinone used judiciously in worsening renal function, and chronotropes trialed in bradycardia-induced CS; since pure vasopressors such as phenylephrine can cause reflex bradycardia and reduce cardiac output, their use as a single first-line continuous intravenous medication is strongly discouraged; although there is no clear consensus on first-line vasoactive agent, the writing committee agrees that norepinephrine is a reasonable first choice for most hypotensive CS patients; Level 2 and 3 CS centers should pursue consultation and consider potential transfer to a Level 1 CS center when patients are refractory to initial pharmacological therapy for consideration of temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) and/or advanced therapies.

### Comparison of intermittent intravenous boluses of phenylephrine and norepinephrine to prevent and treat spinal-induced hypotension in cesarean deliveries: randomized controlled trial [^f7d7d86a]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Phenylephrine (PE) is currently the vasopressor of choice to prevent and treat spinal-induced hypotension at cesarean delivery (CD). However, its use is often associated with reflex bradycardia. Norepinephrine (NE) has been put forward as an alternative vasopressor during CD due to its ability to treat hypotension while maintaining heart rate (HR). Recent studies have focused on the role of NE used as an infusion with favorable results compared to PE. No studies have compared equipotent bolus doses of PE and NE at CD. We hypothesized that when used in equipotent doses as an intermittent bolus regimen to prevent and treat spinal-induced hypotension, NE would result in a reduction in the incidence of bradycardia compared to PE.

Methods

This was a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of women undergoing elective CD under spinal anesthesia. Women were randomized to receive either PE 100 µg or NE 6 µg when the systolic blood pressure (SBP) was below baseline. In addition to the randomized treatment, ephedrine was given intravenously to both groups if the SBP was below baseline and the HR < 60 bpm or if the SBP was < 80% of baseline for 2 consecutive readings. The primary outcome was bradycardia (HR < 50 bpm) in the predelivery period. Secondary outcomes included hypotension (SBP < 80% of baseline), hypertension (SBP > 120% of baseline), tachycardia (HR > 120% of baseline), ≥ 2 episodes of bradycardia, nausea, vomiting, umbilical artery and vein blood gases, and Apgar scores.

Results

One hundred twelve patients were randomized. The incidence of bradycardia was lower in the NE group compared to the PE group (10.7% vs 37.5%; P < .001; difference [95% confidence interval {CI}], -26.8% [-41.8% to -11.7%]), implying an estimated 71% relative reduction (95% CI, 35%-88%). The distribution of the number of bradycardia episodes was also different between the 2 groups (P = 0.007). Further testing showed that the patients in the PE group had a higher risk of multiple bradycardia episodes (≥ 2 episodes) compared to the NE group (19.6% for PE versus 3.6% for NE; P = 0.008). The proportion of patients requiring rescue boluses of ephedrine was lower in the NE group compared to the PE group (7.2% for NE versus 21.4% for PE; P < .03; difference [95% CI], -14.3% [-27.0% to -1.6%]). No differences were observed between the 2 groups in the incidence of other secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

When used as an intermittent bolus regimen to prevent and treat spinal-induced hypotension during CD, NE resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of bradycardia as compared to an equipotent bolus regimen of PE. We conclude that the hemodynamic profile offered by NE during CD is superior to that of PE due to less fluctuations in HR and possibly cardiac output.

### Prophylactic phenylephrine for caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^9a1a0426]. Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

We conducted a systematic review to determine the harm and benefit associated with prophylactic phenylephrine for caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. We included 21 randomised controlled trials with 1504 women. The relative risk (95% CI) of hypotension with phenylephrine infusion – as defined by authors – before delivery was 0.36 (0.18–0.73) vs placebo, p = 0.004; 0.58 (0.39–0.88) vs an ephedrine infusion, p = 0.009; and 0.73 (0.55–0.96) when added to an ephedrine infusion, p = 0.02. After delivery, the relative risks of hypotension and nausea and vomiting with phenylephrine compared with placebo were 0.37 (0.19–0.71), p = 0.003, and 0.39 (0.17–0.91), p = 0.03, respectively. There was no evidence that hypertension, bradycardia or neonatal endpoints were affected. Phenylephrine reduced the risk for hypotension and nausea and vomiting after spinal doses of bupivacaine generally exceeding 8 mg, but there was no evidence that it reduced other maternal or neonatal morbidities.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Exacerbation of Angina, Heart Failure, or Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

Because of its pressor effects, phenylephrine hydrochloride can precipitate angina in patients with severe arteriosclerosis or history of angina, exacerbate underlying heart failure, and increase pulmonary arterial pressure.

5.2 Bradycardia

Phenylephrine hydrochloride can cause severe bradycardia and decreased cardiac output.

5.3 Risk in Patients with Autonomic Dysfunction

The pressor response to adrenergic drugs, including phenylephrine, can be increased in patients with autonomic dysfunction, as may occur with spinal cord injuries.

5.4 Skin and Subcutaneous Necrosis

Extravasation of phenylephrine can cause necrosis or sloughing of tissue.

5.5 Pressor Effect with Concomitant Oxytocic Drugs

Oxytocic drugs potentiate the pressor effect of sympathomimetic pressor amines including phenylephrine hydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7.1)], with the potential for hemorrhagic stroke.

5.6 Allergic Reactions

This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.

5.7 Peripheral and Visceral Ischemia

Phenylephrine hydrochloride can cause excessive peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction and ischemia to vital organs, particularly in patients with extensive peripheral vascular disease.

5.8 Renal Toxicity

Phenylephrine hydrochloride can increase the need for renal replacement therapy in patients with septic shock. Monitor renal function.

### Promethazine and phenylephrine (promethazine hydrochloride and phenylephrine hydrochloride) [^a95261c4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Promethazine:

Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative which differs structurally from the antipsychotic phenothiazines by the presence of a branched side chain and no ring substitution. It is thought that this configuration is responsible for its relative lack (1/10 that of chlorpromazine) of dopamine antagonist properties.

Promethazine is an H1receptor blocking agent. In addition to its antihistaminic action, it provides clinically useful sedative and antiemetic effects.

Promethazine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical effects are apparent within 20 minutes after oral administration and generally last four to six hours, although they may persist as long as 12 hours. Promethazine is metabolized by the liver to a variety of compounds; the sulfoxides of promethazine and N-demethylpromethazine are the predominant metabolites appearing in the urine.

Phenylephrine:

Phenylephrine is a potent postsynaptic α-receptor agonist with little effect on β-receptors of the heart. Phenylephrine has no effect on β-adrenergic receptors of the bronchi or peripheral blood vessels. A direct action at receptors accounts for the greater part of its effects, only a small part being due to its ability to release norepinephrine.

Therapeutic doses of phenylephrine mainly cause vasoconstriction. Phenylephrine increases resistance and, to a lesser extent, decreases capacitance of blood vessels. Total peripheral resistance is increased, resulting in increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Pulmonary arterial pressure is usually increased, and renal blood flow is usually decreased. Local vasoconstriction and hemostasis occur following topical application or infiltration of phenylephrine into tissues. The main effect of phenylephrine on the heart is bradycardia; it produces a positive inotropic effect on the myocardium in doses greater than those usually used therapeutically. Rarely, the drug may increase the irritability of the heart, causing arrhythmias. Cardiac output is decreased slightly. Phenylephrine increases the work of the heart by increasing peripheral arterial resistance.

Phenylephrine has a mild central stimulant effect.

Following oral administration or topical application of phenylephrine to the mucosa, constriction of blood vessels in the nasal mucosa relieves nasal congestion associated with allergy or head colds. Following oral administration, nasal decongestion may occur within 15 or 20 minutes and may persist for up to 4 hours.

Phenylephrine is irregularly absorbed from and readily metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract. Phenylephrine is metabolized in the liver and intestine by monoamine oxidase. The metabolites and their route and rate of excretion have not been identified. The pharmacologic action of phenylephrine is terminated at least partially by uptake of the drug into tissues.

### A systematic review of phenylephrine vs. noradrenaline for the management of hypotension associated with neuraxial anaesthesia in women undergoing caesarean section [^48874f9a]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Phenylephrine is recommended for the management of hypotension after spinal anaesthesia in women undergoing caesarean section. Noradrenaline, an adrenergic agonist with weak β-adrenergic activity, has been reported to have a more favourable haemodynamic profile than phenylephrine. However, there are concerns that noradrenaline may be associated with a higher risk of fetal acidosis, defined as an umbilical artery pH < 7.20. We performed a systematic review of trials comparing noradrenaline with phenylephrine, concentrating on primary outcomes of fetal acidosis and maternal hypotension. We identified 13 randomised controlled trials including 2002 patients. Heterogeneity among the studies was high, and there were too few data to calculate a pooled effect estimate. Fetal acidosis was assessed in four studies that had a low risk of bias and a low risk of confounding, that is, studies which used a prophylactic vasopressor and where women received the allocated vasopressor only. There were no significant differences between these studies. No significant differences were observed for hypotension. Two trials found a significantly lower incidence of bradycardia when using noradrenaline. Cardiac output was significantly higher after noradrenaline in two of three studies. For other secondary outcomes including nausea, vomiting and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min, no studies found significant differences. The evidence so far is too limited to support an advantage of noradrenaline over phenylephrine. Concerns of a deleterious effect of noradrenaline on fetal blood gas status cannot currently be assuaged by the available data from randomised controlled studies.

### Comparison of vasopressors for management of hypotension in high-risk caesarean section under neuraxial anesthesia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^f2f0bd46]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Some of our findings are identical and different from previous findings on this topic. For example, Fitzgerald et al. investigated the prophylactic use of vasopressors to address hypotension following elective cesarean sections and found ephedrine to be the least effective, with norepinephrine surpassing phenylephrine in efficacy. However, we examined both preventive and therapeutic use in high-risk pregnancies and found that phenylephrine was superior to norepinephrine in episodes of hypotension but inferior to norepinephrine in other outcomes. Furthermore, another meta-analysis comparing ephedrine and phenylephrine revealed no significant intergroup differences in fetal outcomes, which is similar to our results. Our study also indicates a similar ranking of fetal outcomes for norepinephrine and phenylephrine with the findings of Kumari et al. The distinct outcomes presented in our study might be attributed to sample size.

We found that phenylephrine-induced bradycardia during high-risk cesarean sections is higher than that of other vasopressors. In contrast to phenylephrine, norepinephrine demonstrates superior capabilities in maintaining maternal CO, which may theoretically lead to better outcomes for both the mother and fetus. Kee et al. found that norepinephrine contributes to high CO, primarily due to heart rate maintenance rather than an increase in stroke volume (SV). Furthermore, we observed a decrease in postoperative nausea and vomiting in women who received norepinephrine. This could be linked to enhanced gastrointestinal perfusion. However, the impact of bradycardia on placental perfusion remains debatable. While a reduction in CO is a potential risk factor for compromising placental perfusion, most studies have not identified significant differences in fetal outcomes between the use of norepinephrine and phenylephrine. Therefore, although phenylephrine may result in more frequent incidents of bradycardia, its influence on placental perfusion could be limited.

### Phospholemman phosphorylation regulates vascular tone, blood pressure, and hypertension in mice and humans [^ebdbf633]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

In Vivo Adaptations and Control of BP

The role of phospholemman phosphorylation in the regulation of vascular tone was also confirmed in vivo. AI is influenced by the velocity and amplitude of the aortic pressure wave reflection and is proportional to arterial stiffness. – In PLM 3SA mice, AI was similar to that in WT at baseline, but the response to acute administration of phenylephrine was profoundly amplified in PLM 3SA mice (Figure 2 A). In addition, hind-limb resistance vessels also show enhanced constriction in response to bolus infusion of phenylephrine in PLM 3SA mice (Figure 2 B– 2 D).

Surprising, despite this profoundly enhanced vascular responsiveness, in vivo BP was not different between the genotypes even during phenylephrine infusion (Figure 3 A). This lack of enhanced pressor response to phenylephrine despite a profound increase in both central and peripheral vasoconstriction is explained by an enhanced reflex bradycardia (Figure 3 B). This is best demonstrated by the change in baroreflex gain in Figure 3 C. The PLM 3SA mouse has a baroreflex sensitivity almost 3 times that of the WT mouse (1.42 ± 0.11 versus 0.5 ± 0.07 ms·mm Hg –1). There also appears to be an autonomic compensation under baseline conditions that is reflected in reduced the low/high frequency ratio (sympathetic dominance) of heart rate variability (Figure 3 D) measured in conscious telemetered mice. Pharmacological inhibition of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity revealed substantially lower activity in both limbs of the autonomic nervous system and lower intrinsic heart rate in PLM 3SA mice. New environment stress induced similar elevation of BP in both genotypes, but again, the chronotropic response was limited in PLM 3SA mice. Thus, different autonomic control of heart rate, lower intrinsic pacemaker activity, and higher baroreflex sensitivity appear to underlie adaptive mechanisms allowing PLM 3SA mice to maintain normal arterial BP despite the absence of phospholemman-dependent modulation of vascular function.

Promethazine

Promethazine competitively antagonizes H1 receptors located in most of the smooth muscle including the gastrointestinal tract, uterus, large blood vessels and bronchial muscle. Actions of histamine on H1 receptors increases capillary permeability and edema formation, flare and pruritus.

Interaction of phenylephrine with alpha-1 adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells causes activation of the cells and results in vasoconstriction. Following oral administration or topical application of phenylephrine to the mucosa, constriction of blood vessels in the nasal mucosa relieves nasal congestion associated with allergy or head colds.

### Effects of continuous infusion of phenylephrine vs. norepinephrine on parturients and fetuses under liDCOrapid monitoring: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^e4399966]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Spinal anesthesia (SA) is the standard and preferred mode of care for elective cesarean delivery (CD), but SA can negatively affect the parturient or the fetus by reducing the placental perfusion. SA-induced maternal hemodynamic fluctuations during CD can invoke nausea and vomiting, cardiovascular collapse, massive hemorrhage, unconsciousness with resulting pulmonary aspiration, or, in extreme cases, cardiorespiratory arrest. According to recent studies, SA-induced hypotension occurs in 80% of all parturients and nearly 60% of in-term parturients during CD without prophylactic use of vasopressors due to sympathetic blockade by the anesthesia. Thus, obstetric anesthetists increasingly opt for prophylactic vasopressor use for routine prevention of post-SA hypotension during CD. In recent years, the optimization of hemodynamics, particularly post-SA hypotension during CD, remains the critical management challenge for anesthesiologists.

Phenylephrine, an α-adrenergic agonist and a vasopressor of choice in obstetric anesthesia, is sometimes associated with maternal cardiac depression or reflex bradycardia. This cardiac depressant effect limits its use in parturients with cardiac comorbidities. Norepinephrine, a potent α-adrenergic agonist with weak β-adrenergic agonistic activity, is associated with a lower incidence of maternal bradycardia. Thus, recently, norepinephrine is considered a potential vasopressor of choice during CD at a maintenance dose of 0.05 μg/kg/min. These pharmacologic properties make norepinephrine and phenylephrine attractive choices as vasopressors in CD. However, new evidence points to post-SA hypotension reversal by phenylephrine without significant maternal bradycardia. In addition, prophylactic use of phenylephrine at 0.25 μg/kg/min results in better neonatal outcomes and reduced maternal mortality. The choice for phenylephrine has been reported to be more beneficial for parturients Nonetheless, comparative studies of these two drugs for continuous infusion are limited, and evidence on the optimum vasopressor choice is lacking.

Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of phenylephrine and norepinephrine administered as continuous infusion during elective CD on 1) maternal hemodynamic parameters using noninvasive LiDCOrapid™; and 2) maternal and fetal outcomes based on umbilical vein (UV), umbilical artery (UA), and maternal peripheral vein (PV) blood gas indexes.

### Effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on cerebral (tissue) oxygen saturation during carotid endarterectomy (PEPPER): a randomized controlled trial [^8d27034b]. Neurocritical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Both ephedrine and phenylephrine single-dose administration for correcting intraoperative hypotension during CEA showed to be effective in restoring MAP and are equally effective in preserving rSO 2 measured by NIRS. Based on the results of rSO 2 changes and CO, no preference can be expressed in favor of one of the investigated vasopressor agents. In this randomized controlled setting, our results do not confirm the findings of different clinical reports, which described a negative impact of administration of phenylephrine on rSO 2.

Phenylephrine, as a pure α 1 -adrenergic receptor agonist, solely increases peripheral total resistance, devoid of direct effects on cardiac contractility. By stretching the arterial baroreceptors, an increase in MAP results in a baroreflex leading to a decrease in sympathetic activity on the peripheral blood vessels and the heart. This results in bradycardia and a decrease in CO. It is remarkable that in the current study this suspected decrease in HR and CO, as a reflex to the increase in MAP, did not occur after administration of phenylephrine. These findings are confirmed by a recent study, showing that BRS is absent during GA with sevoflurane. This explains the nonappearance a suspected BRS-mediated decrease in HR. No difference was seen in CO after administration between groups. This can be explained by the ambiguous influence of phenylephrine on cerebral hemodynamics. In healthy subjects, phenylephrine administration led to a decrease in rSO 2. While SV was not influenced, HR was lowered following phenylephrine administration resulting in a decrease in CO and restraining of cerebral oxygenation. Others endorse the suggestion that administration of phenylephrine increases the arterial pressure, but lowers the rSO 2, as a consequence of the decrease in CO. Conversely, the impact of a bolus of phenylephrine on CO is also related to the preload dependence of the heart. In preload-dependent patients, no effect of phenylephrine on CO will be expected. Also, the patient population in the present study was vascular compromised, with a high possibility of systemic atherosclerotic vascular disease. This might suggest a different response in CO to phenylephrine in comparison with a healthy patient population.

Atropine-like signs and symptoms (dry mouth, fixed dilated pupils, flushing, tachycardia, hallucinations, gastrointestinal symptoms, convulsions, urinary retention, cardiac arrhythmias and coma) may be observed.

Impaired secretion from sweat glands following toxic doses of drugs with anticholinergic side effects may predispose to hyperthermia.

Phenylephrine

Signs and symptoms of overdosage with phenylephrine include headache, vomiting, hypertension, reflex bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular premature beats and ventricular tachycardia, convulsions, and cerebral hemorrhage. Overdosage may also be associated with a sensation of fullness in the head and tingling of the extremities. Headache may be a symptom of hypertension. Bradycardia may be seen early in phenylephrine overdosage through stimulation of baroreceptors.

Treatment of Overdose

Treatment of overdosage is driven by the overall clinical presentation, and consists of discontinuation of promethazine HCl, phenylephrine HCl and codeine phosphate oral solution together with institution of appropriate therapy. Give primary attention to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent and protected airway and the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. Gastric emptying may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug.

### Nitric oxide and regulation of heart rate in patients with postural tachycardia syndrome and healthy subjects [^4aba24c4]. Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

The objective is to study the role of nitric oxide (NO) on cardiovascular regulation in healthy subjects and postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) patients. Reduced neuronal NO function, which could contribute to a hyperadrenergic state, and increased NO-induced vasodilation, which could contribute to orthostatic intolerance, have been reported in POTS. In protocol 1, 13 healthy volunteers (33 ± 3 years) underwent autonomic blockade with trimethaphan and were administered equipressor doses of Nω-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, a NO synthase inhibitor) and phenylephrine to determine the direct chronotropic effects of NO (independent of baroreflex modulation). In protocol 2, we compared the effects of L-NMMA in 9 POTS patients (31 ± 3 years) and 14 healthy (32 ± 2 years) volunteers, during autonomic blockade. During autonomic blockade, L-NMMA and phenylephrine produced similar increases in systolic blood pressure (27 ± 2 versus 27 ± 3 mmHg). Phenylephrine produced only minimal heart rate changes, whereas L-NMMA produced a modest, but significant, bradycardia (-0.8 ± 0.4 versus -4.8 ± 1.2 bpm; P = 0.011). There were no differences between POTS and healthy volunteers in the systolic blood pressure increase (22 ± 2 and 28 ± 5 mm Hg) or heart rate decrease (-6 ± 2 and -4 ± 1 bpm for POTS and controls, respectively) produced by L-NMMA. In the absence of baroreflex buffering, inhibition of endogenous NO synthesis results in a significant bradycardia, reflecting direct tonic modulation of heart rate by NO in healthy individuals. We found no evidence of a primary alteration in NO function in POTS. If NO dysfunction plays a role in POTS, it is through its interaction with the autonomic nervous system.

BP Changes in PLM 3SA Mice: Changes in Baroreceptor Gain and Autonomic Function

Baseline BP was the same in conscious and anesthetized mice of both genotypes (Figure 3 A). Given the profoundly enhanced constrictor response of PLM 3SA mouse to phenylephrine both in vitro and in vivo, surprisingly, phenylephrine infusion (IV 10–300 μg/kg) induced identical dose-dependent pressor responses in WT and PLM 3SA mice (Figure 3 A). This appears to be explained by differences between genotypes in their baroreceptor function. Figure 3 B shows that the pressure-induced bradycardia was far more profound in PLM 3SA than WT mice. Baroreceptor sensitivity can be estimated by plotting the change in heart rate (RR interval) as a function of change in BP (Figure 3 C). From this figure, it is clear that the baroreceptor reflex gain, as measured by the slope of this relationship, is almost 3 times higher in PLM 3SA (1.42 ± 0.11 ms·mm Hg –1) than WT mice (0.5 ± 0.07 ms·mm Hg – 1). This baroreceptor adaptation clearly allows the PLM 3SA mouse to maintain normal BPs at rest, and over a range of pressor interventions, despite hypercontractile vascular smooth muscle.also shows that these changes in baroreceptor reflex gain allow the PLM 3SA mice to maintain comparable changes in systolic BP in response to acute environmental stress by limiting heart rate changes. Further evidence for autonomic adaptation in these mice is shown in the heart rate variability analysis in Figure 3 D and autonomic balance. PLM 3SA mice show significantly reduced low- to high-frequency ratio (Figure 3 D) consistent with a chronic adaptive reduced sympathetic dominance and altered autonomic balance.

### Dronedarone's inhibition of If current is the primary mechanism responsible for its bradycardic effect [^362d0813]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The mechanism(s) whereby dronedarone reduces sinus rate are not well understood, although L-type calcium channel antagonism, beta-adrenergic blockade, and inhibition of If are plausible.

Methods and Results

In anesthetized pigs, we compared the effects of dronedarone to the prototypical If inhibitor, ivabradine, and the L-type calcium channel antagonist diltiazem on heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and contractility. Dronedarone's effects on the phenylephrine-induced rise in MAP and on the chronotropic response to isoproterenol were also investigated. Cumulative doses of dronedarone (0.5 mg/kg, i.v., and 5.0 mg/kg, i.v.; plasma level: 80 ± 16.1 nM) progressively reduced heart rate (P < 0.02) without changes in MAP or contractility as assessed by LV dP/dt (N = 6). Ivabradine (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) similarly reduced heart rate (P < 0.01) without change in MAP (N = 6). Diltiazem (0.8 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced heart rate and MAP and decreased contractility (N = 6). Dronedarone blunted phenylephrine's alpha-receptor-mediated increase in MAP but did not alter the marked beta-adrenergic receptor (BAR)-mediated increase in heart rate induced by isoproterenol. When dronedarone injection was preceded by ivabradine, no further decrease in heart rate or change in MAP was observed (N = 6).

Conclusions

Dronedarone reduced heart rate without affecting MAP or contractility, effects that differ from L-type calcium channel blockade. Dronedarone did not antagonize BAR stimulation, and its heart-rate lowering effects were eliminated by prior administration of ivabradine. Thus, dronedarone's bradycardic action is likely due to inhibition of If and not to blockade of either L-type calcium channels or BAR.

### Effects of phenylephrine on systemic and cerebral circulations in humans: a systematic review with mechanistic explanations [^4ba9c7a2]. Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

We conducted a systematic review of the literature reporting phenylephrine-induced changes in blood pressure, cardiac output, cerebral blood flow and cerebral tissue oxygen saturation as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy in humans. We used the proportion change of the group mean values reported by the original studies in our analysis. Phenylephrine elevates blood pressure whilst concurrently inducing a reduction in cardiac output. Furthermore, despite increasing cerebral blood flow, it decreases cerebral tissue oxygen saturation. The extent of phenylephrine's influence on cardiac output (r = -0.54 and p = 0.09 in awake humans; r = -0.55 and p = 0.007 in anaesthetised humans), cerebral blood flow (r = 0.65 and p = 0.002 in awake humans; r = 0.80 and p = 0.003 in anaesthetised humans) and cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (r = -0.72 and p = 0.03 in awake humans; r = -0.24 and p = 0.48 in anaesthetised humans) appears closely linked to the magnitude of phenylephrine-induced blood pressure changes. When comparing the effects of phenylephrine in awake and anaesthetised humans, we found no evidence of a significant difference in cardiac output, cerebral blood flow or cerebral tissue oxygen saturation. There was also no evidence of a significant difference in effect on systemic and cerebral circulations whether phenylephrine was given by bolus or infusion. We explore the underlying mechanisms driving the phenylephrine-induced cardiac output reduction, cerebral blood flow increase and cerebral tissue oxygen saturation decrease. Individualised treatment approaches, close monitoring and consideration of potential risks and benefits remain vital to the safe and effective use of phenylephrine in acute care.

Interaction of phenylephrine with alpha-1 adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells causes activation of the cells and results in vasoconstriction. Following oral administration or topical application of phenylephrine to the mucosa, constriction of blood vessels in the nasal mucosa relieves nasal congestion associated with allergy or head colds. Following oral administration, nasal decongestion may occur within 15 or 20 minutes and may persist for up to 4 hours.

Phenylephrine increases resistance and, to a lesser extent, decreases capacitance of blood vessels. Total peripheral resistance is increased, resulting in increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Pulmonary arterial pressure is usually increased, and renal blood flow is usually decreased. Local vasoconstriction and hemostasis occur following topical application or infiltration of phenylephrine into tissues.

The main effect of phenylephrine on the heart is bradycardia; it produces a positive inotropic effect on the myocardium in doses greater than those usually used therapeutically. Rarely, the drug may increase the irritability of the heart, causing arrhythmias. Cardiac output is decreased slightly. Phenylephrine increases the work of the heart by increasing peripheral arterial resistance. Phenylephrine has a mild central stimulant effect [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of phenylephrine hydrochloride IV (also known as Pseudo Time PE, Actifed, Neo-Synephrine, 4 Way Fast Acting):
- **Bradycardia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as phenylephrine can cause severe bradycardia and decreased cardiac output.
- **Decreased drug efficacy**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as acidosis may reduce the effectiveness of phenylephrine. Correct acidosis and intravascular volume depletion.
- **Drug hypersensitivity reaction**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as intravenous formulation of phenylephrine contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in susceptible patients.
- **Exacerbation of angina pectoris**: use caution in patients with severe arteriosclerosis or history of angina.
- **Exacerbation of HF**: use caution in patients with HF.
- **Exacerbation of pulmonary hypertension**: use caution in patients with pulmonary hypertension.
- **Increased pressor response, hemorrhagic stroke**: use caution in patients taking concomitant oxytocic drugs.
- **Increased pressor response**: use caution in patients with autonomic dysfunction, such as in spinal cord injuries.
- **Injection site necrosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as extravasation of phenylephrine can cause tissue necrosis.
- **Nephrotoxicity**: use caution in patients with septic shock, as phenylephrine can increase the need for RRT in these patients. Monitor renal function.
- **Peripheral vasoconstriction, visceral vasoconstriction**: use caution in patients with extensive peripheral vascular disease, as phenylephrine can cause excessive peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction and ischemia to vital organs.

### Promethazine, phenylephrine, codeine (promethazine HCl, phenylephrine HCl, codeine phosphate) [^03b00429]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Stimulation may be evident, especially in children and geriatric patients. Convulsions may rarely occur. A paradoxical reaction has been reported in children receiving single doses of 75 mg to 125 mg orally, characterized by hyperexcitability and nightmares.

Atropine-like signs and symptoms (dry mouth, fixed dilated pupils, flushing, tachycardia, hallucinations, gastrointestinal symptoms, convulsions, urinary retention, cardiac arrhythmias and coma) may be observed.

Impaired secretion from sweat glands following toxic doses of drugs with anticholinergic side effects may predispose to hyperthermia.

Phenylephrine

Signs and symptoms of overdosage with phenylephrine include headache, vomiting, hypertension, reflex bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular premature beats and ventricular tachycardia, convulsions, and cerebral hemorrhage. Overdosage may also be associated with a sensation of fullness in the head and tingling of the extremities. Headache may be a symptom of hypertension. Bradycardia may be seen early in phenylephrine overdosage through stimulation of baroreceptors.

Treatment of Overdose

Treatment of overdosage is driven by the overall clinical presentation, and consists of discontinuation of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution together with institution of appropriate therapy. Give primary attention to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent and protected airway and the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. Gastric emptying may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug.

### Alpha-2 adrenergic transmission and human baroreflex regulation [^f572766e]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

We observed earlier that central alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation in mice greatly augments parasympathetic tone. To test the effects in humans, we assessed autonomic vasomotor tone and baroreflex regulation in 9 normal young adults on 2 occasions, once with and once without clonidine. We determined heart rate (HR), beat-by-beat blood pressure (BP), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity. HR variability was analyzed in the time and frequency domain. Pharmacological baroreflex slopes were determined using incremental phenylephrine and nitroprusside infusions. Clonidine lowered resting BP (122 ± 4/73 ± 3 versus 100 ± 7/55 ± 3 mm Hg, P < 0.01), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (18 ± 3 versus 4 ± 2 bursts/min, P < 0.01), and HR (62 ± 3 versus 56 ± 3 bpm, P < 0.05). The baroreflex heart rate curve was reset to much lower HR values and showed no saturation at low HR. HR variability profoundly increased during clonidine plus phenylephrine (total power: 3224 ± 843 versus 8943 ± 2329 ms2, P < 0.05). High-frequency power was 1451 ± 520 at baseline and 6720 ± 2475 ms2 during baroreceptor loading (P < 0.05). The low-frequency/high-frequency ratio decreased (1.94 ± 0.41 versus 0.69 ± 0.10, P < 0.05). In contrast, clonidine reduced resting sympathetic vasomotor tone and shifted the operating point of the sympathetic baroreflex to a flat part of the sympathetic baroreflex curve. The shift decreased the ability of the baroreflex to withdraw sympathetic vasomotor tone during baroreflex loading. These baroreflex changes were associated with a moderate increase in phenylephrine responsiveness. We conclude that alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation has a differential effect on baroreflex HR and vasomotor regulation. alpha-2 Adrenoceptor stimulation greatly augments baroreflex-mediated bradycardia, most likely by parasympathetic activation.

Summary estimates from pairwise meta-analysis of direct comparisons

BE, base excess; CI, confidence interval; NA, not available; RR, risk ratio; SMD, standard mean difference

Primary outcome assessment

The three drug comparisons did not yield statistically significant results. Notably, the comparison between ephedrine and phenylephrine demonstrated no heterogeneity among studies (P > 0.1; I 2 < 50%). Conversely, there was heterogeneity among studies when phenylephrine and noradrenaline were compared (P < 0.1; I 2 > 50%).

Secondary outcome assessments

None of the direct comparisons revealed statistically significant differences between interventions, except in five instances. The incidence of bradycardia was lower with noradrenaline than with phenylephrine (n = 4; RR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.61) and lower for ephedrine than phenylephrine (n = 6; RR: 6.80; 95% CI: 2.69 to 17.17). The incidence of nausea or vomiting was lower with phenylephrine (n = 8; RR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.69) and noradrenaline (n = 1; RR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.91) than ephedrine. Finally, noradrenaline was superior to ephedrine in terms of the umbilical artery BE value (SMD: 1.50; 95% CI: 0.59 to 2.41).

### Comparison of continuous infusion of epinephrine and phenylephrine on hemodynamics during spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery: a randomized controlled trial [^840c63e5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Phenylephrine is a commonly used vasopressor for the treatment of spinal-induced hypotension in obstetric patients, but it is associated with reflex bradycardia and a corresponding decrease in cardiac output. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of continuous epinephrine versus phenylephrine infusion in the prevention of postspinal maternal hypotension.

Methods

Eighty-two women undergoing cesarean delivery were randomly divided into the epinephrine group (group E) and the phenylephrine group (group P). The patients received a continuous infusion of phenylephrine 1 μg kg -1 min -1 or epinephrine 0.1 μg kg -1 min -1 synchronously with intrathecal administration. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded, and umbilical cord blood gases were analyzed after delivery. The incidence of maternal hypotension, bradycardia, nausea, and vomiting was recorded.

Findings

Blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output after spinal anesthesia induction were greater in group E than in group P (P < 0.05). In addition, there was a significant difference in the incidence of bradycardia (5% vs 22.5%, P = 0.02) and mean (SD) umbilical artery pH (7.31 [0.07] vs 7.28 [0.06], P = 0.04) between the groups.

Implications

With the dose of 0.1 μg kg -1 min -1, infusion of epinephrine is more effective at maintaining blood pressure close to baseline during spinal anesthesia with a lower decrease in maternal heart rate and cardiac output compared with phenylephrine. Epinephrine may be superior to phenylephrine in terms of the incidence of bradycardia and umbilical artery pH. chictr.org.cn identifier: ChiCTR-IIC-17010960.

### The safety and efficacy of push dose vasopressors in critically ill adults [^116b530e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate practice patterns, efficacy, and safety of push dose pressors (PDP) in critically ill patients outside of the operating room (OR) at a large academic medical center.

Materials and Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study (June 2018 to July 2020) conducted at a 1273-bed academic medical center. The primary outcome was efficacy, defined as a 25% increase in systolic blood pressure, and the cohort was analyzed according to PDP response (i.e. responders versus non-responders). A logistic regression model was used to assess predictors of response to PDPs. Safety outcomes included the incidence of hypertension, bradycardia, and tachycardia.

Results

1727 patients were included in the final analysis. The median doses of phenylephrine and epinephrine administered were 400 μg (IQR 200–888 μg) and 50 μg (IQR 20–100 μg). The primary outcome was achieved in 102 (71.8%) patients in the epinephrine group and 1140 (55.9%) of patients in the phenylephrine group. Adverse effects after PDP receipt were minimal, with the most common being hypertension in 6.6% and 13.4% of the phenylephrine and epinephrine groups respectively.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that PDP phenylephrine and epinephrine are safe and efficacious in treating the acute hypotensive period.

### Promethazine and phenylephrine (promethazine hydrochloride and phenylephrine hydrochloride) [^aa0ad1d2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions:

Promethazine

CNS Depressants - Promethazine may increase, prolong, or intensify the sedative action of other central-nervous system depressants, such as alcohol, sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricylic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore, such agents should be avoided or administered in reduced dosage to patients receiving promethazine HCl. When given concomitantly with promethazine, the dose of barbiturates should be reduced by at least one-half, and the dose of narcotics should be reduced by one-quarter to one-half. Dosage must be individualized. Excessive amounts of promethazine HCl relative to a narcotic may lead to restlessness and motor hyperactivity in the patient with pain; these symptoms usually disappear with adequate control of the pain.

Epinephrine - Because of the potential for promethazine to reverse epinephrine's vasopressor effect, epinephrine should NOT be used to treat hypotension associated with promethazine overdose.

Anticholinergics - Concomitant use of other agents with anticholinergic properties should be undertaken with caution.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) - Drug interactions, including an increased incidence of extrapyramidal effects, have been reported when some MAOI and phenothiazines are used concomitantly.

### Comparison of vasopressors for management of hypotension in high-risk caesarean section under neuraxial anesthesia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^28751b4b]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A combined systematic review and NMA was conducted to comprehensively evaluate maternal and fetal outcomes related to the prophylactic or therapeutic use of vasopressors in women undergoing spinal anesthesia for high-risk cesarean sections. Our NMA sorting results indicated that phenylephrine appears to be the optimal vasopressor for reducing hypotensive episodes. Phenylephrine and norepinephrine had similar fetal outcomes and were superior to ephedrine. Noradrenaline improved maternal outcomes, such as less bradycardia and the incidence of nausea or vomiting, better than the other vasopressors. The quality of evidence in the comparison was generally low, mainly because of the inaccuracy of the test. The intervention effect estimates were robust in several pre-planned sensitivity and subgroup analyses.

Previous studies have suggested that ephedrine use may be associated with more severe fetal acidosis than compared with phenylephrine and angiotensin II. These data suggest that ephedrine may not be an ideal drug for treating hypotension in obstetric patients. Phenylephrine is a selective α1-adrenergic agonist equivalent to ephedrine for spinal hypotension. Thomas et al. have shown that phenylephrine is more effective in increasing maternal uteroplacental blood flow, increasing fetal oxygen supply, and reducing acidosis. However, it has recently been found that norepinephrine, with its weak β-adrenergic and potent α-adrenergic receptor agonist activity, can reduce the incidence of maternal bradycardia. It has also been shown that norepinephrine has similar effects as phenylephrine in maintaining blood pressure during CS spinal anesthesia, but has less reduction in hemodynamic variables in maintaining larger CO, inhibiting venous dilatation, and increasing venous return to the heart. The incidence of hypotension is reduced due to the potent α and weakly potent β endogenous adrenergic potential of hypotension. These studies, as well as the current NMA, focus on healthy patients, but there are few studies on neonates with potential or existing fetal damage. These high-risk patients are at risk for uteroplacental insufficiency, which has led to concern about possible effects of vasopressors on uteroplacental circulation. Even minor adverse reactions to vasopressors can significantly impact fetal outcomes in cases of fetal damage. Fetuses experiencing impaired uteroplacental circulation may not compensate for further reductions in blood flow due to reduced maternal CO caused by vasoconstriction or vasopressor therapy. Bradycardia has a tendency to reduce placental perfusion and may cause harm to high-risk patients undergoing cesarean delivery, so it should be treated with caution as it may have clinical significance.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Atropine and catecholamines — mechanism and dosing notes for bradycardia: Atropine is described as "a parasympatholytic drug that blocks the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor," and in the sinus node "increases sinus node automaticity at doses of approximately 0.5 to 2 mg with a half-life of approximately 2 hours." Isoproterenol "is a nonselective beta agonist with both chronotropic and inotropic effects" and in SND infusion studies some patients "may require higher dosages, or may have a vasodilatory effect." Dopamine "is a catecholamine" where "at low doses of 1 to 2 mcg/kg/min, the effect is predominantly vasodilatory, while at doses of 5 to 20 mcg/kg/min, enhanced chronotropy and inotropy predominate," with higher doses requiring caution due to "profound vasoconstriction and proarrhythmias." Epinephrine "is a catecholamine with strong alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic stimulatory effects, including increasing chronotropy, inotropy, blood pressure, and myocardial oxygen consumption."

### Vagal sensory neurons mediate the bezold-jarisch reflex and induce syncope [^011f6b7f]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

NPY2R VSNs in the BJR

vNAS is sufficient to cause bradycardia, hypotension and reduced respiration, all of which are trademarks of the BJR. To check the necessity and specificity of NPY2R VSNs in mediating the BJR, we used four different approaches. Approach 1 involved a loss-of-function paradigm, whereby AAV.PHP.S-mCherry-Flex-DTA was injected into the nodose of NPY2R-Cre mice to ablate VSNs (Fig. 5a). This ablation abolished syncope and cardiovascular phenotypes associated with vNAS (Extended Data Fig. 13), whereas baseline physiology was unaltered (Extended Data Fig. 14a–d). This result suggests that NPY2R VSNs are not involved in the continuous maintenance of resting baseline physiology. Next, we induced the baroreflex or the BJR through injection of the widely accepted substrates phenylephrine (PE; baroreflex), sodium nitroprusside (SNP; baroreflex)or phenyl biguanide (PBG; BJR). PBG produced dose-dependent dips in heart rate (Extended Data Fig. 14e), which was abolished by NPY2R VSN ablation (Fig. 5c). The baroreflex response to PE–SNP was intact (Fig. 5b), as was other gut-mediated behaviour such as drinking (Extended Data Fig. 14f). This result shows that NPY2R VSNs are specifically needed for the BJR and not the baroreflex. For approach 2, we performed timed injections of PE and PBG alongside long-term vNAS (Fig. 5d). Long-term vNAS caused a reduction in response across time in the form of adaptation (Extended Data Fig. 10d–g). Therefore, drug-induced reflexes that share common pathways with vNAS should become occluded during periods of vNAS adaptation. PE-induced bradycardia was unaffected, whereas the PBG response was greatly reduced (Fig. 5e). This result confirmed that vNAS shares some common pathway with the PBG-induced BJR and does not overlap with the baroreflex. For approach 3, we did a comparative study of the effects of stimulating various branches of the vagus nerve using optogenetics in PIEZO2–ChR2 mice (mediates the baroreflex) and NPY2R–ChR2 mice (mediates the BJR) (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 14g). As expected, photostimulation of baroreflex afferents (carotid sinus and the superior laryngeal nerves that branch into the aortic depressor nerve and innervate the aortic arch and the airways, respectively,) caused bradycardia in PIEZO2–ChR2 mice but had no effects in NPY2R–ChR2 mice (Fig. 5g, h, regions 1 and 2). Stimulation of the vagal trunk at the level of the cardiac branch had no effect in PIEZO2–ChR2 mice but induced substantial bradycardia in NPY2R–ChR2 mice (Fig. 5g, h, region 3). Stimulation of abdominal branches had no effect on the heart rate (Extended Data Fig. 14h), which rules out gut-mediated effects. Consistent results were also obtained with respiration rate (Extended Data Fig. 14i, j). This result, combined with drug specificity, shows that NPY2R VSNs are specifically needed for the BJR and not the baroreflex. For approach 4, it was recently shown that stimulation of baroreflex-sensitive neurons in the NTS induces substantial bradycardia and is involved in sleep–wake brain-state regulation. We reanalysed EEG data from that report and found that there was no drop in EEG power (within 8–100 Hz), thus indicating the lack of syncope (Extended Data Fig. 14k, l). Thus, bradycardia (and by extension reduced cardiac output) has different effects on the brain, syncope in the case of vNAS and sleep–wake regulation in the case of the baroreflex, thereby indicating that there are distinct central circuit mechanisms at play. Taken together, our results demonstrate the specificity, sufficiency and necessity of NPY2R VSNs for the BJR. We also show that genetically and anatomically segregated vagal pathways mediate the baroreflex (PIEZO2 vagal afferents in the carotid sinus and aortic arch) and the BJR (NPY2R vagal afferents predominantly in the heart ventricles). Moreover, separate cardiac reflexes drive distinct brain states and behaviour; that is, the baroreflex is associated with sleep–wake regulation, whereas the BJR is involved in syncope.

### Acute drug reaction to phenylephrine and tropicamide collyrium in a late-preterm newborn: a case report [^fe1d5ec4]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

As reported in the case description, our patient never required resuscitation maneuvers. In fact, his initial apnea resolved after tactile stimulation and then, despite being bradycardic, the baby always remained in good clinical conditions. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is not indicated in newborns with isolated bradycardia, i.e. without oxygen desaturation. The child was closely monitored in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit until the arrythmia resolved, and always remained in good clinical conditions.

Interestingly, we also like to highlight that our patient's bradycardia developed before the actual fundus examination, and thus his clinical symptoms are not attributable to the cumulative effect of stress and pain of the ophthalmological examination.

Apart from newborns, adverse reaction to phenylephrine and tropicamide collyrium are very rare. A 2015 systemic review and metanalysis that included 916 participants showed that, in the adult population, 2.5% phenylephrine eye drops did not lead to clinically relevant change in blood pressure and heart rate, and 10% phenylephrine collyrium caused only short-lived blood pressure and heart rate rise. Severe adverse events to phenylephrine collyrium are described mainly in relation to ophthalmological procedures, as reported by Abdelhalim et al. The authors described the case of a 4-year-old boy who developed severe hypertension and acute pulmonary edema during retinal surgery (i.e. after surgical incision of the eye) due to systemic absorption of topical phenylephrine eye drops. The severe adverse reaction was characterized by an abrupt drop in oxygen saturation, a rapid increase of blood pressure (220/120 mmHg) associated with tachycardia (140 beats per minute) and the development of chest crepitations and intratracheal secretions. Hydralazine and furosemide were administered and, after 20 min from the onset of the event, all vital parameters went back to normal.

### The diagnosis and management of recurrent ischemic priapism, priapism in sickle cell patients, and non-ischemic priapism: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^d17d4ed2]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

AUA/SMSNA guideline — phenylephrine monitoring in acute ischemic priapism: In patients receiving intracavernosal injections of phenylephrine to treat acute ischemic priapism, clinicians should monitor blood pressure and heart rate. (Clinical Principle) Monitoring is supported because systemic absorption following intracavernosal administration raises concerns for adverse cardiovascular effects, possibly through coronary vasospasm; bedside dosage preparations may lack precision; and monitoring during and following treatment allows detection of elevation in blood pressure, tachycardia, or reflex bradycardia. Monitoring seems especially prudent in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, prior stroke, or those using monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Phenylephrine is a direct-acting sympathomimetic (alpha-1 selective) and there are no reports of toxicity when used for priapism in men using MAOI, and potentiation by MAOI is most significant with oral phenylephrine, which is dissimilar from intracavernosal administration.

### Type 5 adenylyl cyclase disruption alters not only sympathetic but also parasympathetic and calcium-mediated cardiac regulation [^f96557a0]. Circulation Research (2003). Low credibility.

In a genetically engineered mouse line with disruption of type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5-/-), a major cardiac isoform, there was no compensatory increase in other isoforms of AC in the heart. Both basal and isoproterenol (ISO)-stimulated AC activities were decreased by 30% to 40% in cardiac membranes. The reduced AC activity did not affect cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]) at baseline. However, increases in LVEF after ISO were significantly attenuated in AC5-/- (P < 0.05, n = 11). Paradoxically, conscious AC5-/- mice had a higher heart rate compared with wild-type (WT) mice (613 ± 8 versus 523 ± 11 bpm, P < 0.01, n = 14 to 15). Muscarinic agonists decreased AC activity, LVEF, and heart rate more in WT than in AC5-/-. In addition, baroreflex-mediated, ie, neuronally regulated, bradycardia after phenylephrine was also attenuated in AC5-/-. The carbachol-activated outward potassium current (at -40 mV) normalized to cell capacitance in AC5-/- (2.6 ± 0.4 pA/pF, n = 16) was similar to WT (2.9 ± 0.3 pA/pF, n = 27), but calcium (Ca2+)-mediated inhibition of AC activity and Ca2+ channel function were diminished in AC5-/-. Thus, AC5-/- attenuates sympathetic responsiveness and also impairs parasympathetic and Ca2+-mediated regulation of the heart, indicating that those actions are not only regulated at the level of the receptor and G-protein but also at the level of type 5 AC.

### The physiologic implications of isolated alpha (1) adrenergic stimulation [^1262338d]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Phenylephrine and methoxamine are direct-acting, predominantly α(1) adrenergic receptor (AR) agonists. To better understand their physiologic effects, we screened 463 articles on the basis of PubMed searches of "methoxamine" and "phenylephrine" (limited to human, randomized studies published in English), as well as citations found therein. Relevant articles, as well as those discovered in the peer-review process, were incorporated into this review. Both methoxamine and phenylephrine increase cardiac afterload via several mechanisms, including increased vascular resistance, decreased vascular compliance, and disadvantageous alterations in the pressure waveforms produced by the pulsatile heart. Although pure α(1) agonists increase arterial blood pressure, neither animal nor human studies have ever shown pure α(1)-agonism to produce a favorable change in myocardial energetics because of the resultant increase in myocardial workload. Furthermore, the cost of increased blood pressure after pure α(1)-agonism is almost invariably decreased cardiac output, likely due to increases in venous resistance. The venous system contains α(1) ARs, and though stimulation of α(1) ARs decreases capacitance and may transiently increase venous return, this gain may be offset by changes in afterload, venous compliance, and venous resistance. Data on the effects of α(1) stimulation in the central nervous system show conflicting changes, while experimental animal data suggest that renal blood flow is reduced by α(1)-agonists, and both animal and human data suggest that gastrointestinal perfusion may be reduced by α(1) tone.

Special anesthetic considerations for intercurrent surgery in heart transplant (HT) recipients highlight drug effects and hemodynamic responses: Single dose of etomidate during induction decreases cortisol for at least 24 hours but has not shown clinical relevance; cyclosporine may prolong muscle relaxants, unlike mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus; regional or neuraxial procedures have not shown increased infectious complications despite theoretical concern; due to complete cardiac denervation, autonomic agents have minimal effect on the transplanted heart; direct-acting sympathetic agents (norepinephrine, epinephrine, isoproterenol, dopamine) are effective though beta-adrenergic inotropy is attenuated early after HT; phosphodiesterases increase inotropy and phenylephrine's alpha-adrenergic response is effective without reflex bradycardia; indirect acting anticholinergics and anticholinesterases do not change heart rate of the cardiac allograft and neuromuscular reversal has been safe in a large-scale study; Sugammadex lacks direct cholinergic effects and is a reasonable alternative in HT recipients.

### Effects of continuous infusion of phenylephrine vs. norepinephrine on parturients and fetuses under liDCOrapid monitoring: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^4696b9f8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we compared the effects of phenylephrine and norepinephrine administered as continuous infusion during elective CD on the maternal hemodynamic parameters and the maternal and fetal outcomes. We determined that phenylephrine and norepinephrine have similar efficacy for the prevention of SA-induced hypotension, with no difference in the incidence of maternal bradycardia. However, phenylephrine better preserved the SVR by maintaining appropriate cardiac afterload and provided better neonatal outcomes base on blood gas parameter.

In phenylephrine group, the SBP remain stable during the whole operation. In T4, T5 timepoint, decreased the SBP, DBP and MAP were observed in control group, but no significant decrease observed in phenylephrine and norepinephrine groups.

In this study, we successfully employed the LiDCOrapid system for noninvasive assessment of the macro-hemodynamic parameters (CO, SV, and SVR) during phenylephrine or norepinephrine infusion in CD. The LiDCOrapid system was previously validated for use in non-pregnant and pregnant populations. This system enables continuous assessment of the SV based on noninvasive pulse contour analysis under spontaneous breathing, which provides a reliable hemodynamic trend. The typical hemodynamic response to SA in parturients adversely affects the SVR, a precise dynamic marker of preload responsiveness, and requires a compensatory antagonist. Phenylephrine increases the SVR to counteract the SA-induced vasodilatation. In our study, the SVR in the phenylephrine group was significantly higher than that in the other two groups at T4, T5, and T6 time points.

### Promethazine and phenylephrine (promethazine hydrochloride and phenylephrine hydrochloride) [^680cdb90]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Promethazine:

Signs and symptoms of overdosage with promethazine HCl range from mild depression of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system to profound hypotension, respiratory depression, unconsciousness, and sudden death. Other reported reactions include hyperreflexia, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, and extensor-plantar, reflexes (Babinski reflex).

Stimulation may be evident, especially in children and geriatric patients. Convulsions may rarely occur. A paradoxical reaction has been reported in children receiving single doses of 75 mg to 125 mg orally, characterized by hyperexcitability and nightmares.

Atropine-like signs and symptoms - dry mouth, fixed dilated pupils, flushing, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms, may occur.

Phenylephrine:

Signs and symptoms of overdosage with phenylephrine include hypertension, headache, convulsions, cerebral hemorrhage, and vomiting. Ventricular premature beats and short-paroxysms of ventricular tachycardia may also occur. Headache may be a symptom of hypertension. Bradycardia may also be seen early in phenylephrine overdosage through stimulation of baroreceptors.

Treatment:

The treatment of overdosage with promethazine and phenylephrine is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Only in cases of extreme overdosage or individual sensitivity do vital signs including respiration, pulse, blood pressure, temperature, and EKG need to be monitored. Activated charcoal orally or by lavage may be given, or sodium or magnesium sulfate orally as a cathartic. Attention should be given to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Diazepam may be used to control convulsions. Acidosis and electrolyte losses should be corrected. Note that any depressant effects of promethazine are not reversed by naloxone. Avoid analeptics which may cause convulsions.

Severe hypotension usually responds to the administration of norepinephrine or phenylephrine. EPINEPHRINE SHOULD NOT BE USED, since its use in a patient with partial adrenergic blockade may further lower the blood pressure.

Limited experience with dialysis indicates that it is not helpful.

### Acute drug reaction to phenylephrine and tropicamide collyrium in a late-preterm newborn: a case report [^c64ee331]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Collyrium administration is a common procedure in the neonatal ward, both in preterm and at term babies. Various molecules are used to induce mydriasis and cycloplegia: among them, phenylephrine and tropicamide are the most popular, and their administration is generally considered safe.

Case Presentation

A 35+2 weeks-old, 2510 g, well-appearing male newborn required an ophthalmologic evaluation after a doubtful red reflex test. A collyrium with 1% phenylephrine and 0.95% tropicamide was administered prior to the consult, one drop per eye. Two minutes after the administration, the baby developed a severe apnea that required tactile stimulation. Moreover, the area around his eyes became visibly pale. Three minutes later, the baby became severely bradycardic (59 bpm), but remained in good general condition, so that resuscitation maneuvers were not required. Bradycardia lasted for almost three hours and then gradually resolved.

Conclusions

Cardiopulmonary manifestations, such as bradycardia and even cardiopulmonary arrest, are severe complications that can happen after phenylephrine collyrium administration in preterm newborns. However, they have been described in babies below 1500 g or with concurrent respiratory manifestations. Our patient, on the other hand, was late preterm, and never required a ventilatory support prior to the collyrium administration. Practitioners who deal with premature babies, even if late preterm, must be aware of these possible complications and administer phenylephrine collyrium carefully, where cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment and personnel are available.

### Norepinephrine versus phenylephrine infusion for preventing postspinal hypotension during cesarean section for twin pregnancy: a double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial [^303f0003]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study shows that infusion of NE at a fixed rate of 3.2 mcg/min failed to provide less overall decrease in HR compared to PE infused at 40 mcg/min during caesarean delivery for twin pregnancy performed under spinal anesthesia (78 ± 12 vs. 74 ± 11 beats/min, mean difference 4.4; P = 0.057); nevertheless, incidence of bradycardia was significantly lower with NE (6% vs. 30%, P = 0.002). In addition, with these vasopressor infusion settings, there was a higher incidence of hypotension in the NE group (24% vs. 6%, P = 0.01). Overall, requirements of physician interventions to correcting maternal hemodynamic abnormalities (i.e. atropine for heart rate less than 50 beats/min, rescuing vasopressor bolus for hypotension and temporary cessation of vasopressor infusion for reactive hypertension) were similar with these two vasopressor infusion regimen. There was no difference in fetal outcomes either.

Most parturients with twin pregnancy are delivered by cesarean section, and their anesthetic management is largely the same as for singleton pregnancy. From this point of view, PE-induced bradycardia and resultant decrease in cardiac output (CO) could be a particular concern during cesarean section for twin pregnancy, as a higher heart rate contributes substantially to the augmented CO developed in twin pregnancy.

In our study, NE failed to produce a greater overall HR after spinal anesthesia during cesarean section for twins, although this nearly achieved statistical significance (P = 0.0567). In addition, the incidence of bradycardia was significantly higher in patients receiving PE, although the requirements of atropine were not different between the two vasopressors. Nevertheless, most of the bradycardia episodes (13/15) occurred before skin incision and spontaneously recovered afterwards. The similar umbilical blood gas status and fetal outcomes we found between NE and PE is furthermore reassuring. In a recent study recruiting more than 600 parturients with singleton pregnancy, it was also found that umbilical arterial pH was similar between NE and PE, although PE was associated with higher incidence of bradycardia. But other studies have reported better umbilical arterial base excess with NE, versus PE, so further studies will still be needed to clarify this issue.

### Norepinephrine versus phenylephrine infusion for preventing postspinal hypotension during cesarean section for twin pregnancy: a double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial [^762ab9bf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Compared with singleton pregnancy, twin gestation is featured by a greater increase in cardiac output. Therefore, norepinephrine might be more suitable than phenylephrine for maintaining blood pressure during cesarean section for twins, as phenylephrine causes reflex bradycardia and a resultant decrease in cardiac output. This study was to determine whether norepinephrine was superior to phenylephrine in maintaining maternal hemodynamics during cesarean section for twins.

Methods

Informed consent was obtained from all the patients before enrollment. In this double-blinded, randomized clinical trial, 100 parturients with twin gestation undergoing cesarean section with spinal anesthesia were randomized to receive prophylactic norepinephrine (3.2 μg/min) or phenylephrine infusion (40 μg/min). The primary outcome was the change of heart rate and blood pressure during the study period. The secondary outcomes were to compare maternal complications, neonatal outcomes, Apgar scores and umbilical blood acid-base status between the two vasopressors.

Results

There was no significant difference observed for the change of heart rate between two vasopressors. The mean standardized area under the curve of heart rate was 78 ± 12 with norepinephrine vs. 74 ± 11 beats/min with phenylephrine (mean difference 4.4, 95%CI − 0.1 to 9.0; P = 0.0567). The mean standardized area under the curve of systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly lower in parturients with norepinephrine, as the mean of differences in standardized AUC of SBP was 6 mmHg, with a 95% CI from 2 to 9 mmHg (P = 0.0013). However, requirements of physician interventions for correcting maternal hemodynamical abnormalities (temporary cessation of vasopressor infusion for reactive hypertension, rescuing vasopressor bolus for hypotension and atropine for heart rate less < 50 beats/min) and neonatal outcomes were also not significantly different between two vasopressors.

Conclusion

Infusion of norepinephrine was not associated with less overall decrease in heart rate during cesarean section for twins, compared with phenylephrine.

### A quantitative, systematic review of randomized controlled trials of ephedrine versus phenylephrine for the management of hypotension during spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery [^23528d88]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

This quantitative systematic review compared the efficacy and safety of ephedrine with phenylephrine for the prevention and treatment of hypotension during spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Seven randomized controlled trials (n = 292) were identified after a systematic search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry), published articles, and contact with authors. Outcomes assessed were maternal hypotension, hypertension and bradycardia, and neonatal umbilical cord blood pH values and Apgar scores. For the management (prevention and treatment) of maternal hypotension, there was no difference between phenylephrine and ephedrine (relative risk [RR] of 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96–1.06). Maternal bradycardia was more likely to occur with phenylephrine than with ephedrine (RR of 4.79; 95% CI, 1.47–15.60). Women given phenylephrine had neonates with higher umbilical arterial pH values than those given ephedrine (weighted mean difference of 0.03; 95% CI, 0.02–0.04). There was no difference between the two vasopressors in the incidence of true fetal acidosis (umbilical arterial pH value of < 7.2; RR of 0.78; 95% CI, 0.16–3.92) or Apgar score of < 7 at 1 and 5 min. This systematic review does not support the traditional idea that ephedrine is the preferred choice for the management of maternal hypotension during spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean delivery in healthy, nonlaboring women.

Implications

Phenylephrine and ephedrine to manage hypotension during spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean delivery were compared in this systematic review. Women given ephedrine had neonates with lower umbilical cord blood pH values compared with those given phenylephrine. However, no differences in the incidence of fetal acidosis (pH value of < 7.2) or neonatal Apgar scores were found.

Secondary outcomes

Bradycardia

The NMA results for the incidence of bradycardia revealed that ephedrine was better than noradrenaline (RR: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.78) and phenylephrine (RR: 0.01; 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.12), and noradrenaline was more effective than phenylephrine (RR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.85). The ranking order for this variable was ephedrine > noradrenaline > phenylephrine. The probability that ephedrine is the best treatment was 98%.

Nausea or vomiting

The NMA results demonstrated that noradrenaline (RR: 3.58; 95% CI: 1.33 to 10.21) and phenylephrine (RR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.68 to 5.21) were better than ephedrine. The rank order for this outcome was noradrenaline > phenylephrine > ephedrine, with a 71% probability of noradrenaline being the most effective.

Umbilical arterial base excess

The NMA results did not reveal significant differences in any of the comparisons. The rank order for this variable was noradrenaline > phenylephrine > ephedrine, with a 52% probability of noradrenaline being the most effective.

Umbilical arterial pH

Comparing the three drugs did not yield statistically significant differences. The rank order for this variable was phenylephrine > noradrenaline > ephedrine, with a 51% probability of phenylephrine being the most effective.

Umbilical arterial pH < 7.2

The NMA results did not show statistically significant differences in any of the comparisons. The rank order for this variable was phenylephrine > noradrenaline > ephedrine, with a 49% probability of phenylephrine being the most effective treatment.

Apgar score at 1 min

The NMA results did not reveal statistically significant differences in any of the intergroup comparisons. The rank order for this variable was noradrenaline > phenylephrine > ephedrine, with a 77% probability of noradrenaline being the most effective treatment.

Apgar score at 5 min

The NMA results did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in any of the intergroup comparisons. The rank order for this variable was noradrenaline > phenylephrine > ephedrine, with a 64% probability of noradrenaline being the most effective treatment.

### Effect of phenylephrine infusion on postpartum blood loss after cesarean delivery: a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^d0946253]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Preclinical studies have documented the role of alpha-adrenergic agonists in myometrial contraction. Phenylephrine is frequently used to prevent and treat post-spinal hypotension during cesarean delivery. We hypothesized phenylephrine would reduce postpartum blood loss due to alpha-1 receptor-mediated uterine and vascular smooth muscle contraction.

Objectives

This translational study aimed to evaluate the role of phenylephrine in reducing postpartum blood loss due to alpha-1 receptor mediated uterine and vascular smooth muscle contraction.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded, pilot, clinical trial. Low-risk parturients undergoing cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia were recruited in this study. The women were randomized to receive phenylephrine or placebo (normal saline) infusion. Each mL of phenylephrine contained 60 micrograms. The study drug began simultaneously with the start of spinal anesthesia, and was stopped at the end of surgery. The infusion rate was started at 50 mcg/min and was titrated to maintain the systolic blood pressure between 80% and 120% of baseline. The primary outcome measure was postpartum blood loss till 24 hours postpartum, and it was assessed using a surgical swab weighing technique added to suction canister blood contents. The secondary outcomes were incidence of hypertension, hypotension, Apgar score, cord blood gas analysis and neonatal intensive care unit admission (NICU) admission.

Results

One hundred six women received study drugs and were eligible for final analysis. The demographic data, obstetric profiles, and medications were comparable. In the phenylephrine group, the mean postpartum blood loss (median [interquartile range]) was significantly lower ([420 {349–502} vs 494 {397–600} mL; p = .009]). Additionally, a significantly lower number of women had > 500 mL of blood loss in the phenylephrine group (26.4% vs 47.1%; p = .02). Furthermore, more women in the control arm needed blood transfusion (37.7% vs 16.9%; p = .01). Six women each had bradycardia and hypertension in the phenylephrine group. NICU admission, Apgar score, and umbilical artery PH were comparable.

Conclusion

Continuous phenylephrine infusion led to a statistically significant but clinically inconsequential reduction in postpartum blood loss in low-risk parturients undergoing cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia.

### Prophylactic IM small-dose phenylephrine blunts spinal anesthesia-induced hypotensive response during surgical repair of hip fracture in the elderly [^99c4bdee]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized study, we evaluated the effect of prophylactic IM phenylephrine at doses of 1.5 and 3 mg on hyperbaric tetracaine spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in 90 normotensive and hypertensive patients aged > 65 yr undergoing surgery for hip fracture. Thirty normotensive patients received 1.5 or 3 mg of phenylephrine IM (N/P-1.5 and N/P-3.0 groups; n = 15 in each), whereas controls received saline (N/C group; n = 15), and 45 hypertensive patients were treated in a similar manner (H/P-1.5, H/P-3.0, and H/C groups; n = 15 in each). All groups had a peak sensory block height of T9, with a range of T8 to T10. The incidence of hypotension (> 25% decrease in mean arterial blood pressure [MAP] from baseline) was significantly lower in the patients who received phenylephrine 1.5 or 3 mg than in the controls, both in the normotensive and hypertensive groups (P < 0.01). The N/P-3.0 and N/P-1.5 groups and the H/P-3.0 group had significantly lower percentage reductions in MAP (P < 0.05) and required significantly smaller doses of rescue IV ephedrine (P < 0.05) than did the N/C group or the H/C group. The H/P-1.5 group also required significantly less rescue IV ephedrine (P < 0.05), although it was not sufficient to significantly attenuate the percentage decrease in MAP compared with that in the H/C group. Bradycardia (heart rate < 50 bpm) as an adverse effect after IM administration of phenylephrine was not observed in any of the groups. Hypertension (MAP > 20% increase from baseline) after medication occurred in the N/P-3.0 and H/P-3.0 groups, but not in the N/P-1.5 and H/P-1.5 groups. We conclude that prophylactic IM injection of 1.5 mg of phenylephrine is a safe (defined as the inhibition of bradycardia and hypertension) and effective means of reducing the incidence of hypotension associated with spinal anesthesia in normotensive and hypertensive elderly patients.

Implications

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of small-dose IM phenylephrine for prophylaxis against spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in normotensive and hypertensive elderly patients. Phenylephrine 1.5 mg IM was effective for reducing the incidence of hypotension and avoided adverse effects.

### Promethazine hydrochloride and phenylephrine hydrochloride [^1dd809a0]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Promethazine

Signs and symptoms of overdosage with promethazine HCl range from mild depression of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system to profound hypotension, respiratory depression, unconsciousness, and sudden death. Other reported reactions include hyperreflexia, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, and extensor-plantar reflexes (Babinski reflex).

Stimulation may be evident, especially in children and geriatric patients. Convulsions may rarely occur. A paradoxical reaction has been reported in children receiving single doses of 75 mg to 125 mg orally, characterized by hyperexcitability and nightmares.

Atropine-like signs and symptoms – dry mouth, fixed dilated pupils, flushing, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms, may occur.

Phenylephrine

Signs and symptoms of overdosage with phenylephrine HCl include hypertension, headache, convulsions, cerebral hemorrhage, and vomiting. Ventricular premature beats and short paroxysms of ventricular tachycardia may also occur. Headache may be a symptom of hypertension. Bradycardia may also be seen early in phenylephrine overdosage through stimulation of baroreceptors.

Treatment

The treatment of overdosage with promethazine and phenylephrine is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Only in cases of extreme overdosage or individual sensitivity do vital signs including respiration, pulse, blood pressure, temperature, and EKG need to be monitored. Activated charcoal orally or by lavage may be given, or sodium or magnesium sulfate orally as a cathartic. Attention should be given to the re-establishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Diazepam may be used to control convulsions. Acidosis and electrolyte losses should be corrected. Note that any depressant effects of promethazine are not reversed by naloxone. Avoid analeptics which may cause convulsions.

Severe hypotension usually responds to the administration of norepinephrine or phenylephrine. EPINEPHRINE SHOULD NOT BE USED, since its use in a patient with partial adrenergic blockade may further lower the blood pressure.

Limited experience with dialysis indicates that it is not helpful.

### The clinical implications of isolated alpha (1) adrenergic stimulation [^b56f5181]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Phenylephrine is a direct-acting, predominantly α(1) adrenergic receptor agonist used by anesthesiologists and intensivists to treat hypotension. A variety of physiologic studies suggest that α-agonists increase cardiac afterload, reduce venous compliance, and reduce renal bloodflow. The effects on gastrointestinal and cerebral perfusion are controversial. To better understand the effects of phenylephrine in a variety of clinical settings, we screened 463 articles on the basis of PubMed searches of "methoxamine", a long-acting α agonist, and "phenylephrine" (limited to human, randomized studies published in English), as well as citations found therein. Relevant articles, as well as those discovered in the peer-review process, were incorporated into this review. Phenylephrine has been studied as an antihypotensive drug in patients with severe aortic stenosis, as a treatment for decompensated tetralogy of Fallot and hypoxemia during 1-lung ventilation, as well as for the treatment of septic shock, traumatic brain injury, vasospasm status-postsubarachnoid hemorrhage, and hypotension during cesarean delivery. In specific instances (critical aortic stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot, hypotension during cesarean delivery) in which the regional effects of phenylephrine (e.g., decreased heart rate, favorable alterations in Q(p):Q(s) ratio, improved fetal oxygen supply:demand ratio) outweigh its global effects (e.g., decreased cardiac output), phenylephrine may be a rational pharmacologic choice. In pathophysiologic states in which no regional advantages are gained by using an α(1) agonist, alternative vasopressors should be sought.

### Contrasting experimental rodent aftercare with human clinical treatment for cervical spinal cord injury: bridging the translational "Valley of death" [^7fa523bc]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular management

After a high traumatic SCI, there is great risk of hemodynamic and/or neurogenic shock stemming from blood loss or interruption of sympathetic tone, respectively. Shock manifests as inadequate cardiac output and/or hypotension that worsen neurological outcome and can lead to death by hypoperfusion of vital tissues. Many post-SCI patients able to breathe without mechanical ventilation still experience hypoxemia despite adequate alveolar ventilation likely because of ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Thus, the ICU is the most appropriate care setting for patients with SCI because of the close monitoring necessary to identify and manage cardiopulmonary issues.

Early infusion of intravenous fluids and/or blood transfusions are vital to maintain an appropriate mean arterial blood pressure (BP), which is considered to be 85–90 mm Hg by most guidelines. Other therapeutic targets include systolic blood pressure of 90–100 mm Hg and heart rate (HR) of 60–100 beats per minute. Fluid status must be monitored (target of urine output > 30 mL/h) to avoid exacerbation of spinal cord swelling, kidney dysfunction, and edema, as well as other relevant pathologies. In addition to fluid resuscitation, sources of cardiovascular dysfunction apart from neurogenic shock (e.g. blood loss) should be determined and remedied.

Cervical or high thoracic SCIs (above T6) often lead to loss of sympathetic innervation and might require treatment with norepinephrine for its chronotropic and vasopressor activity at both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Vasopressors with only alpha-adrenergic activity such as phenylephrine or midrodine are more appropriate for management of hypotension caused by more distal SCIs, but caution should be used with midrodine because of its propensity to cause urinary retention. Close monitoring is required to avoid inducing elevated intracerebral pressure and cerebral edema via vasopressor treatment.

Bradycardia might require management with external pacing, atropine, or other pacemaker drugs,6,11 During anesthesia, ephedrine is preferred because of its alpha and beta-1 agonist activity that increases BP and cardiac output in persons with bradycardia. Norepinephrine and epinephrine are alternatives, but either requires central line placement for administration or is more suited for acute hypotensive episodes such as cardiac arrest or anaphylaxis, respectively. Phenylephrine or vasopressin/terlipressin can be used during anesthesia in persons with elevated or normal HR, but vasopressin and its analogues are most appropriate for refractory hypotension and are used as a last resort in context of neurological injury because of their propensity to induce cerebral vasoconstriction.

### Ocular phenylephrine 2.5% continues to be dangerous [^3d0f56bc]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Phenylephrine 10% is used for pupillary dilatation and capillary decongestion. It had been advised to use a 2.5% concentration instead of 10% to guard against systemic reactions. Here, a case of severe systemic manifestation following conjuctival application of 2.5% phenylephrine is described. A healthy adult was admitted for pterygium excision under ophthalmic blockade. Vital signs remained normal until a sponge soaked with phenylephrine 2.5% was applied over the excised pterygium to control bleeding. The patient developed bradycardia (heart rate of 30 bpm) and hypotension (pressure 80/40 mmHg), so intravenous atropine was given. This was followed by tachycardia (heart rate of 150 bpm) and hypertension (pressure 240/130 mmHg) and ECG showed ischaemic changes. Treatment included propofol, labetalol, frusamide, morphine and dexamethasone. The next day, a 12-lead ECG showed no ischaemic changes and the myocardial infarction screen was negative. Fundus examination showed no sign of papilloedema. This report emphasises that phenylephrine 2.5% is still dangerous, with unpredictable response.

### Comparison of phenylephrine bolus and infusion regimens on maternal and fetal outcomes during cesarean delivery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a012a67c]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to compare phenylephrine boluses versus prophylactic infusion in parturients undergoing cesarean delivery under spinal or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia on feto-maternal outcomes.

Methods

Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and US Clinical registry databases were searched. Studies comparing phenylephrine boluses (both therapeutic and prophylactic) with infusion (both fixed- and variable-rate) assessing various feto-maternal outcomes were included. The primary outcome was the incidence of maternal hypotension. Secondary maternal outcomes included the incidence of reactive hypertension, bradycardia, nausea, or vomiting; secondary neonatal outcomes included umbilical arterial pH, partial pressure of oxygen (paO2), umbilical venous pH, fetal acidosis, Apgar Scores at 1 and 5 minutes. All outcomes were quantitatively analyzed using the random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration R0B 2.0 tool.

Results

We included 15 studies with 2153 parturients. The parturients receiving phenylephrine bolus during cesarean delivery under spinal or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia had a significant increase in the incidence of predelivery hypotension compared to phenylephrine infusion (risk ratio [RR], 2.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.72–3.18). Reactive hypertension (RR, 0.48, 95% CI, 0.29–0.79) and bradycardia (RR, 0.57, 95% CI, 0.41–0.79) were less common in the parturients receiving phenylephrine bolus; whereas, vomiting (RR, 2.15, 95% CI, 1.53–3.03) was more common compared to the infusion group. No statistically significant difference was observed in the incidence of nausea or any fetal outcomes (umbilical artery pH, paO2, umbilical venous pH, fetal acidosis, and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes) between either of the groups. Three studies had a high risk of bias.

Conclusions

A prophylactic phenylephrine infusion significantly reduces the incidence of predelivery hypotension in parturients undergoing cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia in comparison to the therapeutic or prophylactic phenylephrine bolus group. A prophylactic phenylephrine infusion may be considered in all parturients without preexisting hypertensive disorder or cardiovascular disorders to reduce the risk of predelivery hypotension.

### Vasopressor drugs for the prevention and treatment of hypotension during neuraxial anaesthesia for caesarean delivery: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of fetal and maternal outcomes [^9f38e970]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal choice of vasopressor drugs for managing hypotension during neuraxial anaesthesia for Caesarean delivery is unclear. Although phenylephrine was recently recommended as a consensus choice, direct comparison of phenylephrine with vasopressors used in other healthcare settings is largely lacking. Therefore, we assessed this indirectly by collating data from relevant studies in this comprehensive network meta-analysis. Here, we provide the possible rank orders for these vasopressor agents in relation to clinically important fetal and maternal outcomes.

Methods

RCTs were independently searched in MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and clinicaltrials.gov (updated January 31, 2019). The primary outcome assessed was umbilical arterial base excess. Secondary fetal outcomes were umbilical arterial pH and Pco 2. Maternal outcomes were incidences of nausea, vomiting, and bradycardia.

Results

We included 52 RCTs with a total of 4126 patients. Our Bayesian network meta-analysis showed the likelihood that norepinephrine, metaraminol, and mephentermine had the lowest probability of adversely affecting the fetal acid-base status as assessed by their effect on umbilical arterial base excess (probability rank order: norepinephrine > mephentermine > metaraminol > phenylephrine > ephedrine). This rank order largely held true for umbilical arterial pH and Pco 2. With the exception of maternal bradycardia, ephedrine had the highest probability of being the worst agent for all assessed outcomes. Because of the inherent imprecision when collating direct/indirect comparisons, the rank orders suggested are possibilities rather than absolute ranks.

Conclusion

Our analysis suggests the possibility that norepinephrine and metaraminol are less likely than phenylephrine to be associated with adverse fetal acid-base status during Caesarean delivery. Our results, therefore, lay the scientific foundation for focused trials to enable direct comparisons between these agents and phenylephrine.

Dose-response curve of prophylactic phenylephrine infusions to prevent hypotension was plotted by estimating the probabilities of effective response (ranging from 1% to 99%) against the corresponding phenylephrine infusion rate, which was calculated using probit analysis

Side effects and neonatal outcomes are summarized in Table 2. Only one patient in group 20 experienced bradycardia, and there was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of maternal bradycardia (P = 0.31). No significant differences were found between the two groups regarding other side effects. Neonatal outcomes, including Apgar score, pH, and acid values of umbilical artery blood, were similar between the two groups.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Acute medical therapy synopsis for SND-related bradycardia — Atropine facilitates sinoatrial conduction and increases sinus node automaticity at doses of approximately 0.5 to 2 mg with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. Isoproterenol is a nonselective beta agonist with both chronotropic and inotropic effects on cardiac myocytes, enhancing sinus and atrioventricular nodal function without exerting a vasopressor effect, and in patients with SND undergoing isoproterenol infusion in the electrophysiology laboratory setting, heart rate increases similar to normal controls are described, although some patients do not demonstrate a robust heart rate response, may require higher dosages, or may have a vasodilatory effect. Dopamine is a catecholamine with mixed alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, and dopaminergic effects; at low doses of 1 to 2 mcg/kg/min the effect is predominantly vasodilatory, while at doses of 5 to 20 mcg/kg/min enhanced chronotropy and inotropy predominate, and higher doses may be required for a chronotropic response but must be used judiciously because of the association with profound vasoconstriction and proarrhythmias.

### Promethazine hydrochloride and phenylephrine hydrochloride (promethazine VC) [^179177da]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Promethazine:

Signs and symptoms of overdosage with promethazine HCl range from mild depression of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system to profound hypotension, respiratory depression, unconsciousness, and sudden death. Other reported reactions include hyperreflexia, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, and extensor-plantar reflexes (Babinski reflex).

Stimulation may be evident, especially in children and geriatric patients. Convulsions may rarely occur. A paradoxical reaction has been reported in children receiving single doses of 75 mg to 125 mg orally, characterized by hyperexcitability and nightmares.

Atropine-like signs and symptoms – dry mouth, fixed dilated pupils, flushing, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms, may occur.

Phenylephrine:

Signs and symptoms of overdosage with phenylephrine include hypertension, headache, convulsions, cerebral hemorrhage, and vomiting. Ventricular premature beats and short paroxysms of ventricular tachycardia may also occur. Headache may be a symptom of hypertension. Bradycardia may also be seen early in phenylephrine overdosage through stimulation of baroreceptors.

Treatment:

The treatment of overdosage with promethazine and phenylephrine is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Only in cases of extreme overdosage or individual sensitivity do vital signs including respiration, pulse, blood pressure, temperature, and EKG need to be monitored. Activated charcoal orally or by lavage may be given, or sodium or magnesium sulfate orally as a cathartic. Attention should be given to the re-establishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Diazepam may be used to control convulsions. Acidosis and electrolyte losses should be corrected. Note that any depressant effects of promethazine are not reversed by naloxone. Avoid analeptics which may cause convulsions.

Severe hypotension usually responds to the administration of norepinephrine or phenylephrine. EPINEPHRINE SHOULD NOT BE USED, since its use in a patient with partial adrenergic blockade may further lower the blood pressure.

Limited experience with dialysis indicates that it is not helpful.

Electrophysiologic considerations — effects of anesthetic and sedative agents on cardiac electrophysiology indicate that sedative and anesthetic drugs and agents can affect automaticity and triggered activity and can also affect intrinsic sympatho-vagal tone; automatic tachyarrhythmias and "normal heart VT" are particularly vulnerable to depth of sedation and autonomic nervous system manipulation; agents less likely to have significant autonomic or EP effects include opioids, benzodiazepines, volatile inhalational agents, nitrous oxide, and propofol, yet at high doses, opioids have vagotonic effects with attendant sinus bradycardia; all inhalational agents, even the popular sevoflurane, can modestly increase the QTc interval and also nonselectively enhance automaticity in ectopic atrial pacemakers; ketamine has inhibitory effects on norepinephrine reuptake, resulting in modest sympathomimetic effects; dexmedetomidine, a centrally acting alpha2 agonist, suppresses sinoatrial and AV node conduction and automaticity; phenylephrine, frequently used to support systemic blood pressure, can result in significant vagotonia due to baroreceptor unloading; and reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine, are used to reverse the effect of nondepolarizing muscle relaxing drugs, and have parasympathomimetic effects.

Alterations in Baro- and Chemoreflexes Induced by Central Infusion of Ang II

As shown in Figure 2 A, Ang II-infused rats presented significant reduction in the sensitivity of the baroreflex tachycardia (−3.18 ± 0.25 bpm/mm Hg) and baroreflex bradycardia (−1.50 ± 0.15 bpm/mm Hg) compared with saline-infused group (−5.14 ± 0.33 and −2.50 ± 0.35 bpm/mm Hg). The best fit line that correlates the changes in HR and changes in MAP (Figure 2 B) indicates a blunted slope during both tachycardia and bradycardia stages of the baroreflex, indicative of impairment in the baroreflex control of HR in the Ang II group. In contrast, the pressor response of the chemoreflex induced by KCN 80 µg was significantly enhanced in the Ang II group compared with the saline group (53 ± 7 versus 30 ± 9 mm Hg, respectively; Figure 2 C). There was no significant difference in the bradycardic response of the chemoreflex between the Ang II and saline groups (Figure 2 C).

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^487f48c5]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope — arrhythmic and drug-induced mechanisms — Bradycardia from subsidiary pacemaker sites can present with slow rates (25–40 b.p.m.) and "predisposes to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), especially of the torsade de pointes type." Syncope or near-syncope occurs at the onset of paroxysmal tachycardia before vascular compensation develops, and several drugs can cause brady- and tachyarrhythmias, including QT‑prolonging agents across antiarrhythmics, vasodilators, psychotropics, antimicrobials, and non‑sedating antihistamines. Syncope due to torsade de pointes is not uncommon and is caused by drugs prolonging the QT interval, being particularly frequent in long QT syndrome. Under‑reporting is substantial, with only 1% of adverse drug reactions reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

### Perioperative bradycardia and asystole: relationship to vasovagal syncope and the bezold-jarisch reflex [^039d4a4b]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Reflex cardiovascular depression with vasodilation and bradycardia has been variously termed vasovagal syncope, the Bezold-Jarisch reflex and neurocardiogenic syncope. The circulatory response changes from the normal maintenance of arterial pressure, to parasympathetic activation and sympathetic inhibition, causing hypotension. This change is triggered by reduced cardiac venous return as well as through affective mechanisms such as pain or fear. It is probably mediated in part via afferent nerves from the heart, but also by various non-cardiac baroreceptors which may become paradoxically active. This response may occur during regional anaesthesia, haemorrhage or supine inferior vena cava compression in pregnancy; these factors are additive when combined. In these circumstances hypotension may be more severe than that caused by bradycardia alone, because of unappreciated vasodilation. Treatment includes the restoration of venous return and correction of absolute blood volume deficits. Ephedrine is the most logical choice of single drug to correct the changes because of its combined action on the heart and peripheral blood vessels. Epinephrine must be used early in established cardiac arrest, especially after high regional anaesthesia.

### Sympathoexcitation increases the QT / RR slope in healthy men: differential effects of hypoxia, dobutamine, and phenylephrine [^aab177d0]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dynamic ventricular repolarization assessed by QT/RR slopes studies the effects of modifications in cardiac repolarization independently of variations in RR interval (RR). The effects of changes in sympathetic and vagal activity on the QT/RR slope are controversial. We tested the hypothesis that sympathoexcitation is an important determinant of the QT/RR slope.

Methods and Results

We compared the effects of a reflex sympathetic activation in response to hypoxia, to the direct effects of the infusion of the beta-adrenergic agent dobutamine, on the QTa (apex) and QTe (end)/RR slopes. Dobutamine was titrated to obtain similar increases in cardiac output than with hypoxia. Cardiac vagal activity was estimated by rMSSD and pNN50. In a second group of healthy subjects, we assessed the effect of a reflex cardiac vagal activation in response to phenylephrine infusion on the same variables. We observed a similar increase in QTa and QTe slopes during hypoxia and dobutamine (both P < 0.017 vs. normoxia), despite divergent changes in cardiac vagal activity, as rMSSD and pNN50 decreased with hypoxia compared to normoxia (P < 0.001) but increased during dobutamine infusion compared to hypoxia (P < 0.017). In contrast, these slopes did not change during the rises in rMSSD and pNN50 elicited by phenylephrine (P > 0.7).

Conclusion

Beta-adrenergic stimulation induces comparable increases in the QT/RR slopes than hypoxia, but in the presence of a larger cardiac vagal activity. Vagal cardiac activation by phenylephrine does not change the QT slopes. This reveals that the sympathetic system is an important determinant of QT/RR dynamicity in healthy men.

### First model of spontaneous vagal hyperreactivity and its mode of genetic transmission [^fd64b731]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The main purpose of our study was to define an animal model of vagal hyperreactivity and its genetic transmission.

Methods and Results

We first investigated the vagal reactivity with phenylephrine in conscious rabbits. Barosensitivity and the maximal bradycardic response were measured at the upper mean blood pressure plateau. Hyperreactive (H) animals were selected and crossbred with normal (N) ones. Results showed no significant difference between calculated barosensitivity values after the different doses of phenylephrine. In contrast, an increase of the values and a great dispersion appeared 1 to 5 beats after the end of the ramp. Marked pauses (6000 to 20 000 ms) were obtained with some rabbits, which were blocked by atropine. A significant excess of hyperreactive offspring was observed in HxH crossings compared with NxN ones (39.4% male and 42.3% female offspring versus 14.4% and 4.4%, respectively). Few female offspring were hyperreactive compared with males in NxH and NxN crossings (4.1% versus 23.4% and 4.4% versus 14.4%, respectively).

Conclusions

This study describes the first model of spontaneous vagal pauses. The inheritance could be polygenic with a partial sex-limited character.

Table 2
Incidence of Maternal Hemodynamic Abnormalities

Data reported as number (proportion) or OR [95% CI]

a Bradycardia is defined as heart rate is less than 60 beats/min

b Atropine is administrated when heart rate is less than 50 beats/min

Abbreviations: NE Norepinephrine; OR Odds Ratio; PE Phenylephrine

Patients receiving NE had significantly lower blood pressure than those receiving PE during the study period, as revealed in Fig. 2 B. However, the mean of differences in standardized AUC of SBP was 6 mmHg, with a 95% CI from 2 to 9 mmHg (P = 0.0013). The incidence of hypotension was 24% (12/50) with NE and 6% (3/50) with PE (OR with NE = 4.95; 95%CI, 1.30–18.81; P = 0.012). None of the hypotensive patients required more than one bolus of rescuing vasopressor to restore blood pressure. As rescuing bolus was used more frequently in patients with NE, the total volume of vasopressor was greater in group NE: 9.9 ± 2.3 versus 8.5 ± 2.9 mL with mean difference of 1.45; 95%CI, 0.42 to 2.48 (P = 0.006). Hypertension occurred in 6 patients receiving NE (12%, 6/50) and in 13 patients receiving PE (26%, 13/50), OR with NE = 0.39; 95%CI, 0.13–1.12, (P = 0.074). Taking all the above-mentioned maternal hemodynamic abnormalities into consideration (including atropine for heart rate < 50 beats/min, bolus of rescuing vasopressors for hypotension and temporary cessation of study drug infusion for reactive hypertension), there was no difference in requirements of physician interventions between the two groups (Fig. 3).

### New squatting test indices are useful for assessing baroreflex sensitivity in diabetes mellitus [^2704a424]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

There is an established link between the autonomic nervous system and life-threatening arrhythmias and cardiovascular mortality. In diabetic patients, cardiac autonomic neuropathy must be identified early because it is closely associated with a high risk of cardiac mortality. Quantitative approaches to assessing autonomic function are the determination of BRS and HR variability and 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy. In patients with myocardial infarction, heart failure and diabetes, BRS is of strong independent prognostic value. The method most extensively used to determine BRS involves the bolus injection of the presser drug phenylephrine. However, this method requires the i.v. administration of a pressor agent to raise the blood pressure and results in the artificial disruption of physiological cardiovascular function.

Previously, we proposed a new non-invasive method to assess BRS by downward tilting. We studied the relationship between systolic blood pressure and RR interval changes during downward tilting and found a significant correlation between these parameters in healthy subjects and diabetic patients. BRS calculated by downward tilting also correlated significantly with BRS obtained with the conventional phenylephrine method. Although BRS determined by downward tilting elicited a greater physiological cardiovascular response than did BRS determined by the conventional method, its wide applicability is compromised by the need for an electrical tilt table and equipment for continuous blood pressure monitoring.

In the present study we used the squatting test, a simple and easily performed posture-change manoeuvre. The cardiovascular reflex seen in the posture change from standing to squatting was similar to that observed during downward tilting. The squatting test is a simple method to assess parasympathetic and sympathetic activity based on the HR response. On the one hand, the immediate cardiovascular responses upon a posture change from standing to squatting consist of an increase in the blood pressure and RR intervals. The rise in blood pressure in response to squatting is thought to be primarily as a result of an increase in venous return followed by an increase in cardiac output; this involves activation of arterial baroreceptors followed by the activation of vagal efferents, resulting in lengthening of the RR interval. That the reflex nature of squatting induces bradycardia is confirmed by pharmacological autonomic blockade studies that suggested mediation by the parasympathetic nerve. On the other hand, a posture change from squatting to standing resulted in a blood pressure decrease and RR interval shortening secondary to sympathetic nerve stimulation. The present study also showed that tachycardia observed when the position changes from squatting to standing is primarily induced by sympathetic nerve stimulation coincident with vagal withdrawal.

### Effect of glycopyrrolate on vasopressor requirements for non-elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^6736714a]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The meta-analysis revealed no statistically significant reduction in hypotension when the prophylactic glycopyrrolate was compared with the placebo. Among the four studies included in the meta-analysis, a wide variation in the administration of the vasopressors was apparent. Two studies had used prophylactic phenylephrine, while in the other two studies, the authors did not use prophylactic vasopressor to prevent post-spinal hypotension. Nevertheless, whether the prophylactic vasopressor was used or not, pretreatment with glycopyrrolate did not offer any protection against post-spinal hypotension. We too observed no significant reduction in post-spinal hypotension when a combination of glycopyrrolate and phenylephrine was used prophylactically against phenylephrine alone. Interestingly, we did find a significant difference in the lowest systolic blood pressure (SBP) recorded. The mean lowest SBP recorded in the glycopyrrolate was 99.79 ± 11.29 mmHg compared to 95.21 ± 11.64 mmHg in the placebo group (P = 0.001). In our study, one of the criteria for defining post-spinal hypotension was SBP < 100 mmHg. In both the groups the mean lowest SBP recorded was < 100 mmHg. As a result, the incidence of post-spinal hypotension was comparable between the two groups.

In our study, the maternal heart rate was significantly higher in the glycopyrrolate group. Glycopyrrolate being an anticholinergic has a direct effect on the heart to increase its rate. Results from the meta-analysis showed that the administration of glycopyrrolate significantly increased the heart rate. Phenylephrine and ephedrine are two commonly used vasopressors as prophylactic or treatment measures to counter post-spinal hypotension. Ephedrine through its cardiac β-adrenoceptor agonist effects causes tachycardia while phenylephrine is associated with decreased maternal heart rate. Therefore, logically the effect on the heart rate may be influenced by the choice of vasopressor. However, when prophylactic glycopyrrolate and phenylephrine were used in combination, the maternal heart rate was higher than when phenylephrine was used alone. In our study, although 7 (6%) patients in the phenylephrine group had bradycardia (HR < 55/min) compared to 3 (2%) patients in the glycopyrrolate and phenylephrine combination group, the difference was not statistically significant. As a result, pretreatment with glycopyrrolate may not offer protection against phenylephrine-induced reflex bradycardia after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery.

### A randomised double-blind comparison of phenylephrine and norepinephrine for the management of postspinal hypotension in pre-eclamptic patients undergoing caesarean section [^9858d5c0]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies comparing phenylephrine and norepinephrine for the treatment of postspinal hypotension in pre-eclamptic patients are limited.

Objective

To compare bolus doses of phenylephrine and norepinephrine for treating hypotension in pre-eclamptic mothers undergoing caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. It was hypothesised that norepinephrine and phenylephrine use would be associated with similar neonatal outcome.

Design

Randomised controlled study.

Setting

Single centre, tertiary care, university teaching hospital, from December 2018 to March 2020.

Patients

A total of 86 women with pre-eclampsia and a singleton pregnancy who developed postspinal hypotension during caesarean section.

Interventions

Patients received intravenous phenylephrine (50μg) or norepinephrine (4μg) for treatment of hypotension, defined as a fall in baseline systolic BP by ≥ 20% or an absolute value < 100mmHg.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was umbilical artery pH. Secondary outcomes included Apgar scores, the number of hypotensive episodes, vasopressor requirements, the incidence of tachycardia/bradycardia/arrhythmias/hypertension and maternal complications.

Results

Umbilical artery pH was not different between the phenylephrine and norepinephrine groups (7.26 ± 0.06 and 7.27 ± 0.06, respectively; P = 0.903). The median [IQR] number of hypotensive episodes was higher in the norepinephrine than the phenylephrine group: 2 [1 to 3] vs 1 [1 to 2], respectively; P = 0.014. Apgar scores, total number of vasopressor boluses required, systolic BP trends and the incidence of maternal complications were comparable in the two groups. Heart rate (HR) values were lower in phenylephrine group (P = 0.026), and one patient in phenylephrine group and none in the norepinephrine group developed bradycardia (HR < 50bpm), P = 1.000.

Conclusions

In women with pre-eclampsia undergoing caesarean section, bolus doses of phenylephrine (50μg) and norepinephrine (4μg) used to treat hypotension after spinal anaesthesia are equally effective with similar neonatal and maternal outcomes.

### A comparison of the effect of phenylephrine and norepinephrine on uteroplacental vascular resistance during the treatment of postspinal hypotension in preeclamptic patients: a randomised controlled study [^dd917205]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Many factors can modify the effect of the two vasopressors on uteroplacental vascular resistance. The regulation of α-adrenergic and β-adrenergic receptor agonist activity might be an important mechanism. As a pure α-agonist drug, phenylephrine may have greater vasoconstriction effects on uterine arteries than norepinephrine. And the mild β-adrenergic receptor agonist activity of norepinephrine may partially weaken its strong α-adrenergic receptor agonist effect. The exact mechanism needs to be confirmed by further laboratory research.

In summary, our results showed that when an equivalent dose of phenylephrine and norepinephrine was used to treat spinal-induced hypotension in preeclamptic patients during caesarean section, vascular resistance changes in uterine arteries were less in patients receiving norepinephrine than in those receiving phenylephrine. Furthermore, compared with phenylephrine, norepinephrine can provide a greater maternal HR and CO in preeclamptic patients. Further research is needed to confirm the potential advantages of norepinephrine in preeclamptic patients.

### Paradoxical change in atrial fibrillation dominant frequencies with baroreflex-mediated parasympathetic stimulation with phenylephrine infusion [^9765980b]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Parasympathetic stimulation is known to promote atrial fibrillation (AF) through shortening of atrial refractory periods. We hypothesized that baroreflex-mediated parasympathetic stimulation via phenylephrine (PE) infusion would increase AF rate as measured by dominant frequency (DF).

Methods and Results

The protocol was performed in 27 patients (24 M, 59 ± 1 years old) prior to AF ablation. For 10 patients in AF, PE was infused until systolic blood pressure increased ≥ 30 mmHg. Electrograms were recorded in the left atrium before and after PE. DFs of each recording were calculated offline. Atrial effective refractory periods (ERPs) were measured before and after PE in 11 patients who were in sinus rhythm during the procedure. DFs were also measured in 6 patients in AF before and after complete parasympathetic blockade with atropine (0.04 mg/kg). PE resulted in increased RR intervals during sinus rhythm (1,170 ± 77 to 1,282 ± 85 ms, P = 0.03) and AF (743 ± 32 to 826 ± 30 ms, P = 0.03), consistent with parasympathetic effect on the sinus and AV nodes, respectively. DFs were decreased by PE in the left atrium (6.2 ± 0.2 to 6.0 ± 0.2 Hz, P = 0.004). Correspondingly, atrial ERPs significantly increased from 218 ± 13 to 232 ± 11 ms (P = 0.04). Atropine resulted in a decreasing trend in DF in the left atrium (5.9 ± 0.1 to 5.8 ± 0.1 Hz, P = 0.07).

Conclusions

Despite baroreflex-mediated parasympathetic effect, PE produced a slowing of AF along with lengthening of ERP, while parasympathetic blockade also slowed DF. It is therefore likely that the direct and indirect adrenergic effects of PE on atrial electrophysiology are more prominent than its parasympathetic effects.

According to our previous reports, in the first patient in the two groups, the initial infusion rate was initiated at 0.5 µg/kg/min and sustained until infant delivery. To treat hypotension (defined as a reduction in SBP below 80% of its baseline level), a 50 µg intravenous bolus dose of phenylephrine was administered. For hypertension (characterized by an increase in SBP exceeding 120% of its baseline measurement), we administer the phenylephrine infusion and resume it once the SBP drops below 120% of the baseline value. Bradycardia, characterized by a heart rate below 50 beats/min, was treated with 0.5 mg intravenous atropine if accompanied by hypertension or stopping phenylephrine infusion if hypotension was absent.

An effective infusion rate of prophylactic phenylephrine was defined as no episodes of hypotension occurring from the time of intrathecal injection until infant delivery. If hypotension occurred during this period, the infusion dose was deemed ineffective. The dose of phenylephrine infusion for each subsequent patient was adjusted on the patient's previous response to phenylephrine (effective or ineffective), using the traditional up-and-down allocation method. If the previous patient responded effectively to the dose rate, it was reduced by 0.05 µg/kg/min for the next patient. If the dose was ineffective for the previous patient, it was increased by 0.05 µg/kg/min for the next patient. The study duration was from intrathecal injection to infant delivery. The postpartum infusion rate was adjusted based on the variation of SBP by an independent anesthesiologist uninvolved in the study.

The primary outcome measurement of this study was the effective or ineffective infusion rate of prophylactic phenylephrine. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of side effects (hypotension, hypertension, bradycardia, shivering, and nausea and vomiting), total infusion of phenylephrine and lactated Ringer's solution administered during the study period, neonatal outcomes (Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min after delivery, umbilical arterial blood pH and lactic acid), surgical times, and anesthesia characteristics.

### Prophylactic phenylephrine and fluid co-administration to reduce spinal hypotension during elective caesarean section in a resource-limited setting: a prospective alternating intervention study [^f2db8f34]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Spinal hypotension is a common and clinically important problem during caesarean section. Current consensus recommendations for resource-rich settings suggest the use of a titrated phenylephrine infusion, in combination with fluid coloading, for prevention of maternal hypotension. In resource-limited settings, where syringe drivers are unavailable, these recommendations advise the addition of 500 μg phenylephrine to the first 1 l of intravenous fluid given after initiation of spinal anaesthesia, with additional vasopressor boluses as required. This prospective, alternating intervention study compared the use of a conventional phenylephrine rescue bolus strategy for prevention of hypotension, defined as systolic arterial pressure < 90 mmHg, with a phenylephrine infusion given according to the consensus recommendation. We studied 300 women having elective caesarean section. There were 77 (51%) women who developed hypotension in the bolus group vs. 55 (37%) in the phenylephrine infusion group (p = 0.011). This represented a 29% reduction in hypotension, with a number needed to treat of 6.8. The six highest systolic arterial pressure readings occurred in the phenylephrine infusion group (range 166–188 mmHg), and there were four instances of bradycardia (heart rate < 50 beats.min -1) with preserved systolic arterial pressure in each group. There were no adverse clinical sequelae, and no differences in neonatal Apgar scores in either group. The consensus recommendation for phenylephrine and fluid co-administration in resource-limited settings appears effective in preventing maternal hypotension, but at the cost of sporadic systolic hypertension.

### Evidence of α-adrenoceptor-mediated chronotropic action in children [^b9b5887f]. Pediatric Cardiology (2000). Low credibility.

We investigated alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated positive chronotropic action in children using a pharmacological autonomic function test. Under cardiac vagal and sympathetic blockade, chronotropic responses to intravenous infusion of an alpha-agonist, phenylephrine, were determined in 129 patients with suspected autonomic dysfunction. Heart rate changes to phenylephrine infusion (0.4 microg/kg/min) for 5 minutes ranged from -2 to 50 beats/min (mean ± SD, 13.8 ± 9.7 beats/min). alpha-Adrenoceptor-mediated chronotropic (APC) action more than 5 beats/min was observed in 88 (68%) subjects. APC was negatively correlated with age. Multivariate analysis showed that APC was correlated negatively with beta-sympathetic tone and positively correlated with intrinsic heart rate. These results suggest that the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated chronotropic action is a developmental phenomenon and may play an important role in controlling heart rate in response to cardiac sympathetic activation.

### Oral midodrine for prophylaxis against post-spinal anesthesia hypotension during hip arthroplasty in elderly population: a randomized controlled trial [^91ef60dc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hip arthroplasty is performed for various underlying pathologies and most patients undergoing this procedure are elderly. Neuraxial anesthesia is the preferred route of anesthesia since it reduces the risk of postoperative complications. However, elderly patients are at increased risk of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension. Intraoperative hypotension compromises vital organ perfusion which consequently increases the risk of kidney injury, brain ischemia, cardiac ischemia, and 30-day mortality. Elderly patients commonly have systemic medical disorder; therefore, they are highly vulnerable to the complications of hypotension. Thus, intraoperative hypotension during hip surgery has been recently recognized as a major risk factor for postoperative morbidity and mortality.

Through the inhibitory effect of spinal anesthesia on the sympathetic nervous system, hypotension is induced due to vasodilatation which decreases the venous return, and consequently the cardiac output. Therefore, the main line for prevention and management of spinal anesthesia- induced hypotension is vasopressors. The commonly used vasopressor drugs in the perioperative settings are alpha-adrenoreceptor agonists such as ephedrine, phenylephrine, and recently norepinephrine. All these agents are effective in maintaining blood pressure; however, they have some disadvantages; ephedrine is commonly associated with tachycardia (due to the beta-agonist activity), phenylephrine and norepinephrine are usually associated with reactive bradycardia. Furthermore, all the mentioned drugs are used intravenously.

Midodrine hydrochloride is another alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist which has the advantage of being an oral drug with minimal central nervous system side effects, and good oral bioavailability. Midodrine is metabolized to desglymidodrine which is a direct arteriolar and venous vasopressor. Midodrine is used for management of some hypotensive disorders. Midodrine was previously used for management of orthostatic hypotension, intra-dialysis hypotension, and in circulatory shock in critically ill patients. There is paucity of data about the value of midodrine in preoperative settings. in this study we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of midodrine as a prophylaxis against post-spinal hypotension in elderly patients undergoing hip arthroplasty.
