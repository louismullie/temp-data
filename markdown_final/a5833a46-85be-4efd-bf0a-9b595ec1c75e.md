## Question

upper back muscular tenderness with normal ck level

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate upper back muscular tenderness when the creatine kinase (CK) level is normal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of a normal CK in the context of muscle tenderness. Then, I should verify the most likely benign etiologies and how to screen for them. Next, I will consider medication-induced causes, especially statins, and outline a SAMS-focused approach. After that, I need to check for red flags that would prompt urgent workup despite a normal CK. Then, I will review targeted diagnostic testing when suspicion remains high. Finally, I will synthesize a practical management and follow-up plan, ensuring I reconcile areas where a normal CK might mislead us and where it reassures us appropriately [^116m285X] [^111HbPYV].

> Let me first confirm the clinical meaning of a normal CK in this setting, because I need to ensure I am not overinterpreting a single normal value. CK is a sensitive but imperfect marker of muscle injury; it can be normal in several myopathies and in many patients with muscle symptoms, so a normal CK does not exclude a muscle disorder or even statin-associated muscle symptoms, and it certainly does not exclude non-muscular causes of tenderness such as mechanical or inflammatory pain generators [^116m285X] [^113Vufxw] [^113ZbKdf]. Wait, let me verify the statin context specifically: most patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms have normal CK, and biopsy-proven myopathy has been documented with normal CK in select cases, reinforcing that symptoms and exam trump a single normal enzyme value [^111HbPYV] [^116WijLD]. I should also remember that CK reference ranges vary by sex, race, and age, and newer data suggest higher population-specific upper limits, which can further complicate interpretation if I rely solely on a generic lab range [^112u7TzE] [^111gVkKH].

> Next, I should review the most common benign explanations for focal upper back tenderness with a normal CK, and I need to check that I am not missing a mechanical or referred pain source. Mechanical strain of the paraspinals or rhomboids, postural overload, and myofascial pain are common and typically present with localized tenderness, reproduction of pain with palpation or stretch, and no systemic features; CK is usually normal because injury is mild and compartmentalized, and these entities respond to conservative therapy and activity modification [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not conflating this with compartment syndrome; true paraspinal compartment syndrome is rare, presents with severe pain and markedly elevated CK, and would not fit a normal CK scenario, so that helps anchor the differential away from a compartment process here [^111rqvCt]. But wait, what if the pain is referred from the cervical spine or ribs; radicular or costovertebral sources can mimic muscular pain, so a careful neck and thoracic exam with Spurling's and rib springing can help redirect the workup if positive [^114wu31m].

> I will now examine medication-induced etiologies, with statins at the top of the list, and I should double-check the timing and phenotype. Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) commonly present with myalgia, stiffness, or tenderness without CK elevation, often symmetric and involving proximal large muscle groups including the back; symptoms typically begin within 4–6 weeks of initiation or dose change, but can occur later, and risk is higher with higher-intensity regimens, interacting drugs, hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and in older adults or those of Asian ancestry [^111HbPYV] [^113ciXiT]. Let me consider the clinical approach: if SAMS is suspected, a therapeutic dechallenge and rechallenge strategy is reasonable, documenting baseline symptoms and function, then reducing dose, switching to a different statin, or temporarily stopping to observe resolution, with rechallenge if clinically indicated and safe; routine CK monitoring is not recommended in asymptomatic patients, but I should check CK if symptoms are moderate to severe or if weakness is present [^114Hkzp8] [^113fCbNs]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not missing immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy; persistent weakness with elevated CK that does not normalize after statin cessation, especially with anti-HMGCR antibodies, warrants urgent evaluation and immunosuppression rather than simple statin manipulation [^114Hkzp8] [^112bU263].

> But wait, what if the normal CK is falsely reassuring and I am missing a serious disease; I need to ensure I screen for red flags that mandate escalation regardless of CK. Progressive proximal weakness, systemic features such as fever, weight loss, or rash, dark urine suggesting myoglobinuria, or recurrent episodes should prompt broader evaluation for inflammatory myopathies, metabolic myopathies, or vasculitis, because these entities can present with normal or only modest CK elevations early on or in select phenotypes [^116m285X] [^114XXkA3]. I should confirm that dermatomyositis can present with normal CK in amyopathic forms or with subtle weakness, so skin exam for heliotrope, Gottron's, V- or shawl signs is essential even when CK is normal, and if suspected, I should not delay appropriate immunologic testing and imaging [^114PAAMa] [^115aMiw6]. Let me reconsider exertional rhabdomyolysis as a differential; by definition, rhabdomyolysis involves marked CK elevations and myoglobin release, so a normal CK effectively rules out that acute process here, though a history of unaccustomed eccentric exercise could still explain transient myalgia without CK rise [^113vW8Xu] [^111AHmcL].

> If suspicion persists after initial screening, I should review targeted diagnostics, and I need to check that I am choosing tests with the highest yield. Basic labs should include a repeat CK with attention to trends, thyroid-stimulating hormone, renal and hepatic function, and inflammatory markers such as ESR and CRP; an ANA with myositis-specific antibodies can screen for autoimmune myositis, while MRI of the symptomatic muscle groups can detect edema or fasciitis and guide biopsy if needed [^113MSGDq] [^113oyHng]. Hold on, I should verify the role of EMG; in the acute setting of muscle injury, EMG can be falsely abnormal, so if performed, it should be interpreted cautiously and ideally after recovery from the acute episode to avoid confounding by injury potentials rather than primary myopathy [^114EkSSe]. If imaging and serologies are non-diagnostic but clinical suspicion remains high, a targeted muscle biopsy can secure diagnoses such as vasculitis, metabolic myopathy, or IMNM, even when CK is normal, so I should not let a normal CK deter timely tissue diagnosis in the right phenotype [^114XXkA3] [^113oyHng].

> For initial management when no red flags are present, I should confirm a conservative, watchful approach. Activity modification, ergonomic correction, physical therapy emphasizing stretching and core stabilization, and short courses of NSAIDs or topical agents are appropriate; I should advise avoiding heavy lifting and prolonged poor posture while symptoms resolve, and I should set expectations for a gradual return to activity over 1–2 weeks if pain improves [^notfound]. Wait, let me verify that I am not overlooking a medication contributor; if the patient is on a statin or other myotoxic drug, a planned dechallenge can both clarify causality and provide symptomatic relief, with rechallenge later if cardiovascular risk mandates statin therapy and symptoms have resolved off therapy [^114Hkzp8]. I should arrange follow-up within 2–4 weeks to reassess symptoms, repeat CK only if symptoms persist or worsen, and pivot to advanced testing if new weakness, rash, systemic features, or lab abnormalities emerge [^113fCbNs].

> In summary, I need to ensure I do not anchor on a normal CK, because it neither confirms nor excludes clinically meaningful muscle disease in this context. The most likely diagnosis is a benign mechanical or myofascial pain syndrome, but I must actively screen for statin-associated muscle symptoms and for red flags suggesting inflammatory, metabolic, or vasculitic myopathies; a structured plan of conservative care, selective labs, imaging when indicated, and readiness to escalate to biopsy maintains diagnostic vigilance while avoiding unnecessary testing in low-risk presentations [^116m285X] [^111HbPYV] [^114XXkA3].

---

Upper back muscular tenderness with a normal CK level is most often due to **benign mechanical or myofascial pain** [^notfound] (strain, overuse, poor posture, trigger points) or **statin-associated muscle symptoms** [^111HbPYV] (myalgia without CK elevation). Less common causes include early or mild inflammatory myopathies [^116m285X], metabolic myopathies [^111RS6nz], or neuropathic pain [^114wu31m]; a normal CK does not exclude these, especially if weakness or systemic features are present [^113Vufxw]. Evaluation should focus on **history, exam, and selective testing** (TSH, vitamin D, autoimmune panel, MRI/EMG if weakness or red flags) [^114Hkzp8]; management is conservative (activity, PT, analgesics) [^notfound] or statin adjustment if applicable [^114Hkzp8], with biopsy reserved for persistent or progressive cases [^notfound].

---

## Common benign causes

### Mechanical or myofascial pain

- **Muscle strain or overuse**: Repetitive activities, poor posture, or sudden exertion can cause localized tenderness without CK elevation [^notfound].

- **Myofascial pain syndrome**: Trigger points in the upper back (e.g. trapezius, rhomboids) cause reproducible tenderness and referred pain, often without CK rise.

- **Postural factors**: Prolonged desk work or poor ergonomics contribute to chronic muscle tension and tenderness [^notfound].

---

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) present with myalgia, tenderness, or weakness, often with a **normal CK** [^111HbPYV] [^112bU263]. They are typically symmetric and proximal, including the back, and symptoms often improve with dose reduction or discontinuation [^114Hkzp8].

---

## Less common but clinically significant causes

### Inflammatory myopathies

Polymyositis and dermatomyositis can present with tenderness and normal or only mildly elevated CK, especially early or in **clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis** [^112vcK7Q]. Inclusion body myositis may show normal CK early or in mild cases, with **prominent weakness** [^notfound].

---

### Metabolic myopathies

Metabolic myopathies include **glycogen storage diseases** (e.g. McArdle, Pompe) and mitochondrial disorders, which can cause exercise-related myalgia with normal or mildly elevated CK [^111RS6nz].

---

### Neuropathic pain

Neuropathic pain includes **cervical radiculopathy**, in which nerve root compression causes upper back pain that may mimic muscle tenderness, and **thoracic outlet syndrome**, in which brachial plexus compression produces shoulder and upper back pain with minimal CK change [^114wu31m].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical evaluation

Clinical evaluation should include a detailed history of onset, duration, activity, posture, medications (especially statins), and systemic symptoms. The physical examination should assess **tenderness, trigger points, range of motion, strength, and neurologic signs** [^notfound].

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Thyroid function**: Hypothyroidism can cause myopathy and tenderness [^116BjiRP].

- **Vitamin D**: Deficiency can contribute to muscle pain [^114Hkzp8].

- **Autoimmune panel**: ANA, myositis-specific antibodies if inflammatory myopathy suspected [^113MSGDq].

- **CK isoenzymes**: If CK is normal but suspicion persists, consider CK-MM or CK-MB fractions [^notfound].

---

### Imaging and electrodiagnostic studies

Imaging and electrodiagnostic studies include **MRI** to evaluate for myositis, radiculopathy, or structural lesions when weakness or neurologic signs are present [^113oyHng], and **EMG** to distinguish neurogenic from myopathic processes when indicated [^115MG2Pk].

---

### Muscle biopsy

Muscle biopsy is reserved for persistent symptoms with suspected inflammatory or metabolic myopathy, especially when **CK is normal but clinical suspicion remains high** [^114XXkA3].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

Conservative management includes physical therapy with strengthening, stretching, and postural correction; analgesics such as NSAIDs or acetaminophen; and activity modification with ergonomic adjustments and avoidance of aggravating activities [^notfound].

---

### Medication-related management

Medication-related management includes adjusting statins — dose reduction, switching to another statin, or discontinuation if SAMS are suspected [^114Hkzp8] — and treating hypothyroidism or vitamin D deficiency when identified [^114Hkzp8].

---

### Advanced therapies

Advanced therapies include immunosuppressive therapy for confirmed inflammatory myopathies and surgical options for structural lesions (e.g. radiculopathy, thoracic outlet syndrome) when conservative measures fail [^112H5kji].

---

## Prognosis and follow-up

Prognosis is **generally favorable** for mechanical or myofascial pain with conservative care and activity modification [^notfound]. Follow-up should monitor for progression, new weakness, or systemic features; **repeat CK only if symptoms worsen or new features arise** [^113fCbNs].

---

Upper back muscular tenderness with a normal CK is most often due to mechanical or myofascial pain or SAMS, but inflammatory, metabolic, or neuropathic causes remain possible. A **focused history, exam, and selective testing** guide diagnosis; most cases resolve with conservative care, while persistent or atypical symptoms warrant further evaluation [^111HbPYV].

ABSTRACT

Background

Serum creatine kinase (CK) has been used as a diagnostic marker for neuromuscular disorders since 1959. As manufacturer‐provided normative data indicate, CK levels can be elevated in normal individuals. Recent evidence suggests these data often underestimate true CK values, which are influenced by age, race, gender, and other physiological factors. Therefore, establishing a reliable normal range for CK is crucial before further investigation, particularly in oligo/asymptomatic patients.

Objective

This systematic review aims to determine the normal CK levels across various populations.

Methods

We systematically reviewed observational studies with a cross‐sectional, descriptive design. We included studies focusing on healthy adults (> 18 years) of any race who aimed to establish normal CK values, including at least 100 participants. We utilized the following databases: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane.

Results

CK values typically exhibit a non‐Gaussian distribution. Black individuals demonstrate significantly higher CK values compared to Caucasians and Asians. The upper reference limits for CK in Caucasian and Asian males range from 227–440 U/L, while for Black males, it is between 520–810 U/L. The upper reference limits for females range from 135–248 U/L and up to 354 U/L, respectively.

Conclusions

Normal CK values might be higher than previously suggested, especially among specific racial groups. Each laboratory should ideally determine its reference values for CK that reflect its local population.

### Severe interscapular pain and increased creatine kinase activity: the answer was in the ankles [^111RwW8Z]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Severe thoracic back pain with increased creatine kinase activity is a clinical presentation that suggests a variety of life threatening conditions. If initial examination is unrevealing, multiple diagnostic tests are usually performed attempting to identify the origin of the problem, sometimes neglecting apparently unrelated subtle physical findings. A patient is described in whom this was the initial presentation of a sensory demyelinating neuropathy, resulting in a diagnostic challenge. This case expands the differential diagnosis of severe thoracic back pain and increased creatine kinase activity, and illustrates the importance of physical examination in reaching a final diagnosis.

Approach to the patient with statin intolerance

Statin intolerance can be a significant barrier to optimal lipid management (Fig. 5). Adverse effects attributed to statins that can lead to discontinuation are numerous, and include those that affect the musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, neurocognitive, and nervous systems. The most prevalent of these are the statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). These can take the form of muscle pain, aches, stiffness, tenderness, or cramps and usually present without elevations in CK. There is no universally accepted definition for SAMS, although the National Lipid Association has proposed a clinical scoring system based on symptomatology and temporal associations. There is significant heterogeneity in SAMS presentation; most common is involvement of the proximal large muscle groups including the thighs, buttocks, calves, and back muscles, typically in a symmetrical pattern. These symptoms usually occur within the first 4 to 6 weeks after statin initiation but may occur after several years of treatment. SAMS with CK elevations > 10× ULN occurs in 1 in 10 000 and rhabdomyolysis in 1 in 100 000 individuals per year of statin treatment.

Case Presentation

Case 1

A man in his early 40s presented to the neurologist for assessment of musculoskeletal lower back pain following a workplace incident. The patient had no significant medical history and was taking no regular medications. He was found to have an elevated creatine kinase (CK) level of 2300 (normal range 45–250 U/L), mildly deranged liver function tests (LFTs) depicting a transaminitis with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 65 (normal range 10–40 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 94 (normal range 5–40 U/L), and a persistent eosinophilia between 2 and 3 (normal range 0–0.6 × 10⁹/L), dating back to 2017. He had previously seen a dermatologist and an immunologist for investigation of his raised eosinophil count with ultimately no confirmation of the cause for his raised eosinophils. Strongyloides is another nematode endemic to North Queensland that causes a peripheral eosinophilia but has no association with myositis or reported muscular invasion; notably, faecal testing was performed in this patient and the results were negative. There were no constitutional symptoms, weakness, muscle pain or bulbar dysfunction. With regard to exposure history, the patient had travelled to Tasmania in his youth but otherwise lived in North Queensland with no overseas travel. He had consumed bush meat a few years previously on a deer hunting trip but otherwise was not an avid bushwalker and had no other history of wildlife exposure. Clinical examination of the cranial nerves and upper and lower limbs was normal. Repeat review with further serological testing confirmed ongoing raised CK levels despite avoiding strenuous activity over the preceding week. The myositis antibody panel and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase antibody tests were negative. Needle electromyography was performed and demonstrated increased spontaneous muscle activity in the lower limb muscles bilaterally. MRI displayed bilateral, symmetric, calf muscle signal change without fatty atrophy. The patient proceeded to have a quadriceps muscle biopsy which confirmed H. perplexum myositis, demonstrating the visualisation of the sarcoplasmic parasite in cross-section along with the infiltrate of eosinophils, macrophages and multinucleated giant cells (figure 1). The patient was commenced on oral albendazole 400 mg two times per day and remained asymptomatic with no adverse affects to therapy. Notably, within 1 month of albendazole commencement, there was normalisation of the patient's CK level, LFT derangement and eosinophilia.

### How to use: creatine kinase [^114vPAEM]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Creatine kinase (CK) remains an essential tool for assessment of muscular weakness and pain in children despite the advent of advanced diagnostic tests in this field. It is also useful in diagnosing and monitoring various other conditions. This article will explore the physiology of CK and clinical situations where the estimation of CK can help the clinicians' decision-making process with the diagnosis and management of these conditions. Some clinical scenarios are used to highlight how the tests can be used in different clinical situations. The role of CK as a biomarker of myocardial injury has been purposefully omitted in this article.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^111Xh7su]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is the combination of symptoms (myalgia, weakness and muscle swelling) and a substantial rise in serum creatine kinase (CK) > 50 000 IU/L; there are many causes, but here we specifically address exertional rhabdomyolysis. The consequences of this condition can be severe, including acute kidney injury and requirement for higher level care with organ support. Most patients have 'physiological' exertional rhabdomyolysis with no underlying disease; they do not need investigation and should be advised to return to normal activities in a graded fashion. Rarely, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the initial presentation of underlying muscle disease, and we review how to identify this much smaller group of patients, who do require investigation.

Returning to normal activities

The risk of recurrence is low if there is no suggestion of an underlying genetic cause: 1%–2% suffered recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis in the US Army study, the risk may be lower in the general population.

Most experts recommend a graded return to exercise. Exercise should be avoided in the first month and until symptoms have disappeared and the serum CK normalised. Light exercise can then be started and gradually increased in extent and duration if symptoms of weakness and/or myalgia do not recur. Eccentric training is best avoided, at least to start with, as is strenuous unaccustomed exercise. Patients with suspected underlying myopathies/genetic disorders need a stricter approach, as described elsewhere.

### Postoperative lumbar paraspinal compartment syndrome [^111rqvCt]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Lumbar paraspinal compartment syndrome is a rare cause of rhabdomyolysis and of chronic low back pain. A universal feature is high creatine kinase (CK) (generally > 5000 IU/L) and rhabdomyolysis. Characteristic symptomatology includes local paraspinal muscle pain exacerbated by passive movements, that is, lateral truncal tilting, forward flexion and straight leg raising, and alleviated with the extension of the back; and tenderness and firm texture/board-like rigidity of the affected paraspinal musculature on palpation. Timely diagnosis and appropriate surgical treatment will usually result in favourable outcomes.

Case presentation

A previously healthy 25-year-old Korean woman had a two-month history of progressive proximal muscle weakness. She had myalgia, fever, severe alopecia and a pruritic macular rash over her face, hand dorsum, upper anterior chest and upper back. She had difficulty in sitting up and could only move around using a wheelchair. She had no hypotonia, feeding difficulty, dysarthria, motor developmental delay, or orthopaedic abnormalities in infancy or early childhood. Her family history was unremarkable.

On physical examination, her vital signs were stable, and her body mass index was 21.8 kg/m² (height 156 cm, weight 53 kg). Her bilateral muscle strength was grade 4/5 at neck flexion, 4/5 at shoulder abduction, 4/5 in wrist flexion, 4/5 in hand grip, 2/5 in the proximal hips, and 4/5 in ankle dorsiflexion. She had normal reflexes of the biceps brachii, patella, and ankle. Facial erythema involving the nasolabial folds and an erythematous rash on the upper back and anterior chest wall compatible with V-neck sign and shawl sign were observed. Skin ulcers were seen on the hand knuckles, right elbow and lateral aspect of the right thigh (Fig. 1). She had widespread, palpable soft tissue thickening of the bilateral thigh and upper arm with tenderness, which turned out to be calcification. The laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell count, 6440/mm³ with lymphopenia (lymphocyte 322/mm³); haemoglobin, 9.1 g/dL; platelet, 148,000/mm³; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 72 mm/hr.; C-reactive protein (CRP), 0.44 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 95 (1–40) IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 30 (1–40) IU/L; creatine kinase (CK), 128 (20–270) IU/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 553 (100–225) g/dL; myoglobin, 47.1 (0–106) ng/mL; aldolase, 10.8 (0–7.6) U/L; C3, 83 (83–193) mg/dL; and C4, 19 (15–57) mg/dL. The antinuclear antibody test was positive and showed a homogeneous pattern at a 1:160 dilution, but the anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Scl-70, anti-centromere, anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein, anti-phospholipid, and anti-Jo-1 antibody tests were all negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thigh showed symmetric diffuse muscle signal changes with an enhanced T2 signal and diffuse patchy contrast enhancement involving both the anterior and posterior compartments of the thigh (Fig. 2). Her radiographs of shoulders and pelvis showed extensive, plaque-like soft tissue calcification of both hips, thighs and upper arms. Electromyography (EMG) showed fibrillations, positive sharp waves (PSWs), increased amplitudes of motor unit action potential (MUAP) and reduced interference pattern in the biceps. In the EMG of the tibialis and gastrocnemius muscles, fibrillations, PSWs, small and polyphasic MUAPs, and reduced interference pattern were identified. In contrast, the nerve conduction study revealed normal responses. A muscle biopsy of the right vastus lateralis demonstrated many degenerating and regenerating muscle fibers and perifascicular atrophy with moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells in the endomysial and perivascular areas, consistent with dermatomyositis. However, enzyme histochemical analysis showed centrally placed cores in the type I myofibers with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (NADH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) staining, suggesting CCD (Fig. 3 a). Electron microscopy showed both tubuloreticular bodies in the endothelial cells and disorganized myofilaments with scattered short Z-bands and structured central cores in the muscle fibers, findings that suggested a diagnosis of CCD with superimposed dermatomyositis (Fig. 3 c and d). Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen showed no evidence of interstitial lung disease or malignancy. The echocardiography was normal. The patient had no pathogenic mutations in the genes associated with congenital myopathy, including RYR1, SEPN1, ACTA1, AGRN, BIN1, CFL2, CHAT, CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND, CHRNE, COLQ, DNM2, DOK2, GFPT1, IGHMBP2, KBTBD13, KLHL40, LAMB2, MTM1, MUSK, MYH7, RAPSN, SLC5A7, SMN1, TNNT1, TPM2, TPM3 and TTN, in hybridization capture-based next-generation sequencing. However, she had a heterozygous mutation in the NEB gene of c.8318G > A (p. Arg2773Gln), which is considered a variant of uncertain significance. Parental genetic testing was negative.

### Muscle weakness with a hidden cause [^114dg47i]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Laboratory testing revealed elevated creatine kinase (CK 10 226 U/L; upper limit of normal (ULN) 170 U/L), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH 766 U/L; ULN 240 U/L), and transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 433 U/L; ULN 50 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 158 U/L; ULN 45 U/L). CRP (11 mg/L; ULN 5 mg/L) and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR 30 mm/h; ULN 8 mm/h) were slightly elevated, while leucocyte counts were normal. A mildly elevated high-sensitivity (hs) troponin T level (80 ng/L; ULN 14 ng/L) did not increase in a 1-hour and 3-hour follow-up. Echocardiography and ECG were unremarkable, and the patient had no signs of acute coronary syndrome. We therefore did not suspect heart disease, especially since active muscle diseases can be associated with elevated hs troponin T levels. Nevertheless, we chose to closely monitor his troponin T levels but did not detect further elevations in the subsequent follow-up period.

Based on these clinical and laboratory findings, a diagnosis of DM was suspected.

A subsequent screen for myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSA) was positive for anti-NXP-2 antibodies. Furthermore, an MRI of the right shoulder and plexus was remarkable for ubiquitous subcutaneous and muscle oedema. An MRI-correlated biopsy of the right deltoid muscle revealed T-lymphocytic myositis with accompanying fasciitis and perifasciitis. The cellular infiltrate particularly consisted of CD3-positive lymphocytes and CD68-positive macrophages, compatible with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in DM (figure 2). Initial serological results (ANA titres, ANCA) remained negative.

Approach to statin-associated muscle symptoms in adults — the algorithm defines statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) as "one or more muscular complaints (myalgia, weakness, tenderness) improved or resolved after dose reduction/discontinuation" with a "Minimum of 2 statin-treatment attempts (including ≥ 1 at the lowest approved dose)". It advises to "Evaluate risk factors: Age (older adults), race/ethnicity (Asian), vitamin D deficiency, hypothyroidism, CKD, genetics", "Correct underlying contributors (e.g., vitamin D deficiency/ hypothyroidism, drug-drug interactions etc.)", and then assess severity. For mild symptoms with "Normal/mild elevation (CK < 3 ULN)", the pathway includes "Consider rechallenge with other statin, or lower dose (including alternate-day dosing)". For moderate/severe symptoms with "CK 3–5X ULN", management includes "Add/start non-statin therapy (ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, PCSK9-based therapy and/or bile acid resins)" using shared decision-making. With "CK > 5 ULN ± rhabdomyolysis", the directive is "Discontinue statin". If "statin rechallenge fails or LDL-C not at goal", proceed based on "Clinical judgment".

### Lovastatin [^1163YsDK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis

Lovastatin, like other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of myopathy is increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma.

The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is dose related. In a clinical study (EXCEL) in which patients were carefully monitored and some interacting drugs were excluded, there was one case of myopathy among 4933 patients randomized to lovastatin 20 to 40 mg daily for 48 weeks, and 4 among 1649 patients randomized to 80 mg daily.

All patients starting therapy with lovastatin, or whose dose of lovastatin is being increased, should be advised of the risk of myopathy and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing Lovastatin. Lovastatin therapy should be discontinued immediately if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. Periodic CK determinations may be considered in patients starting therapy with lovastatin or whose dose is being increased, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent myopathy.

Many of the patients who have developed rhabdomyolysis on therapy with lovastatin have had complicated medical histories, including renal insufficiency usually as a consequence of long-standing diabetes mellitus. Such patients merit closer monitoring. Lovastatin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Lovatsatin therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient experiencing an acute or serious condition predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis; hypotension; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy.

The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant use of lovastatin with the following:

Patients with muscle symptoms and elevated serum creatine kinase levels (> 4× upper limit of normal)

For patients at low CVD risk who have symptoms with CK > 4× ULN, the statin should be stopped and the need for statin reassessed. If considered important, a lower dose of an alternative statin should be tried and CK monitored. For patients at high CVD risk with muscle symptoms and a CK of > 4× ULN (but < 10× ULN), statin therapy can be continued with concomitant monitoring of CK, but stopped (at least temporarily) if the levels exceed 10× ULN. In this case, that particular statin regimen should not be restarted. If CK levels decrease after stopping the statin, restarting at a lower statin dose with CK monitoring should be tried. If, however, CK elevation persists, there may be an underlying myopathy (e.g. hypothyroidism or a metabolic muscle disorder), and referral to a neuromuscular specialist should be considered.

In patients with a CK > 10× ULN for which no secondary cause (e.g. exercise) can be found, statin therapy should be stopped because of the potential risk of rhabdomyolysis. If the CK level subsequently returns to normal, re-challenge with a lower dose of an alternative statin and careful monitoring of symptoms and CK may be considered. If rhabdomyolysis is suspected, statin should not be reintroduced. Rhabdomyolysis should be considered if there is severe muscular pain, general weakness and signs of myoglobinaemia or myoglobinuria. These patients, and those with very high CK levels (e.g. > 40× ULN), should be referred for evaluation of renal damage (urinalysis, serum creatinine levels). Intravenous hydration and urine alkalinisation are recommended for the treatment of rhabdomyolyis depending on severity and the presence of kidney injury. If indicated, non-statin LDL-C lowering agents should be used (see below).

The utility of muscle biopsy in patients with modest elevations of serum creatine kinase (CK) level but normal neurological examinations and nondiagnostic electrodiagnostic studies is uncertain. We performed systematic, extensive studies on muscle biopsies of 20 such patients. A definitive diagnosis was arrived at in only 1 by histochemical studies, although 4 others demonstrated minor myopathic changes. Biochemical evaluation led to a diagnosis in an additional 5. Muscle biopsy is useful for evaluating such patients, but extensive studies of the muscle are necessary.

Serum creatine kinase concentrations were persistently elevated, ranging from 682 to 1464 U/L (reference range, 26–192). Full blood count, serum electrolytes, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, thyroid-stimulating hormone, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation, hepatitis B and C serology, and myositis-specific antibody panel were all normal or negative. She had already undergone electromyography and a muscle biopsy of right gastrocnemius muscle before our initial evaluation. That electromyography had shown abnormal spontaneous activity in the form of positive sharp waves and fibrillation potentials in right thoracic paraspinal and right medial gastrocnemius muscles, without any apparent abnormality in motor unit morphology or recruitment. The muscle biopsy of right gastrocnemius muscle was normal. Also, a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal.

### Serum creatine kinase: requesting and interpreting results [^116m285X]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Creatine kinase is an intracellular enzyme found abundantly in skeletal muscle, myocardium and brain. It is well known as a biomarker that increases following skeletal muscle damage and doctors instinctively associate it with myopathies. Serum creatine kinase is undoubtedly often raised in many myopathies and the extent of increase may provide a clue to the myopathic culprit. However, in other myopathies, it may be normal or only marginally raised, and rarely it is normal when the underlying pathology suggests that it should be very raised. Creatine kinase can also be raised in neurogenic disorders, and it can help in the investigation of some neurological disorders that are unrelated to neuromuscular disease. Finally, it may be discovered to be mysteriously elevated without a clear clinical correlate. Here, we examine each of these conundrums, beginning with the clinical problem at hand.

CK elevation

The presence of elevated serum myoglobin was once used routinely to diagnose rhabdomyolysis; however, this parameter is not widely available for diagnostic testing and unreliable because myoglobin is rapidly cleared from the blood. Laboratory testing in urine (a positive dipstick for blood with absence of red blood cells on microscopic urinalysis serves as an indirect marker of urinary myoglobin) offers a fast screening tool if serum myoglobin testing is not readily available. Serum CK is the most reliable diagnostic marker of rhabdomyolysis. It usually peaks 24–36 hours after exertion and then decreases back to baseline at a rate of about 40% per day (figure 2).

Figure 2
Rise and fall of myoglobin and creatine kinase (CK) during the course of rhabdomyolysis. Myoglobin is the first enzyme that increases, but returns to normal levels within the first 24 hours after onset of symptoms. CK increases a few hours later, reaches its peak value within the first 24 hours, and remains at these levels for 3 days. Even though the presence of myoglobin in serum is the key feature of rhabdomyolysis, CK is considered to be a more useful marker for the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of muscular injury due to its delayed clearance from the plasma and the wide availability for diagnostic testing. (Reprinted from Giannoglou et al Copyright 2007, with permission from Elsevier).

There is no consensus in the literature concerning the exact level of CK increases required to fulfil the definition of ERM, with suggested CK levels ranging from > 5, > 10, > 20 or even > 50 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). There is, however, some agreement that the limit of a CK value of > 5 times the ULN is very conservative, as it does not take into account documented baseline differences as a function of gender, ethnicity and training levels. These ULN levels vary considerably: 217 and 414 IU/L in Caucasian women and men, and 336 and 801 IU/L in African women and men, respectively.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^114EkSSe]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Investigating exertional rhabdomyolysis

In general, patients with a clear history of a preceding heat-related illness do not require further investigations; this group is statistically the largest. Further investigations should be considered in patients with no history of heat exposure, or who have recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis. Patients may not have sought medical attention for previous milder episodes; ask about previous episodes of postexertional muscle pain, weakness or dark urine. Almost all patients with metabolic myopathies will have had symptoms since teenage years. Other features requiring further investigation include persistently raised serum CK after 8 weeks, family history of rhabdomyolysis (including after exercise, fasting or illness), exertional muscle cramps or exercise intolerance. The acronym (retronym?) RHABDO has been suggested as an aide-mémoire (box 2).

Box 2
Features suggesting need for further investigation

R — Recurrent episodes of exertional rhabdomyolysis

H — HyperCKaemia more than 8 weeks after event

A — Accustomed to exercise

B — Blood creatine kinase (CK) concentration above 50× upper limit of normal

D — Drug ingestion insufficient to explain exertional rhabdomyolysis

O — Other family members affected or Other exertional symptoms

Clinicians should take a general myopathy history, including exercise intolerance, exertional rhabdomyolysis tempo (eg, duration between exercise and onset) and family history. Family history is sometimes forgotten: case 2 had little contact with his sister but recalled she had been diagnosed with something which stopped her exercising; renewed contact revealed her McArdle's disease. Examination for myopathic weakness and electromyography should be delayed until the patient has fully recovered. Further investigations for underlying causes, including exercise testing, muscle biopsy and muscle MRI, depend on the clinical phenotype but are often non-diagnostic until the exertional rhabdomyolysis has resolved. Figure 1 summarises the approach to a new presentation of exertional rhabdomyolysis.

### Fluvastatin sodium (Lescol) [^114TdxPN]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

LESCOL XL may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including LESCOL XL.

Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in CK, values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was < 0.1% in fluvastatin clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Avoid concomitant use of LESCOL XL with gemfibrozil, cyclosporin, and fluconazole. When used concomitantly with LESCOL XL, lipid modifying doses (≥ 1 g/day) of niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Discontinue LESCOL XL if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if LESCOL XL is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue LESCOL XL in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis, shock, severe hypovolemia, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled epilepsy.

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting LESCOL XL. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum CK, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody, muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy, and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue LESCOL XL if IMNM is suspected.

### Pregabalin [^11518BJp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Prospectively planned ophthalmologic testing, including visual acuity testing, formal visual field testing and dilated funduscopic examination, was performed in over 3600 patients. In these patients, visual acuity was reduced in 7% of patients treated with pregabalin and 5% of placebo- treated patients. Visual field changes were detected in 13% of pregabalin-treated, and 12% of placebo-treated patients. Funduscopic changes were observed in 2% of pregabalin-treated and 2% of placebo-treated patients.

Although the clinical significance of the ophthalmologic findings is unknown, inform patients to notify their physician if changes in vision occur. If visual disturbance persists, consider further assessment. Consider more frequent assessment for patients who are already routinely monitored for ocular conditions [SEE PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17)].

5.11 Creatine Kinase Elevations

Pregabalin treatment was associated with creatine kinase elevations. Mean changes in creatine kinase from baseline to the maximum value were 60 U/L for pregabalin-treated patients and 28 U/L for the placebo patients. In all controlled trials in adult patients across multiple patient populations, 1.5% of patients on pregabalin and 0.7% of placebo patients had a value of creatine kinase at least three times the upper limit of normal. Three pregabalin-treated subjects had events reported as rhabdomyolysis in premarketing clinical trials. The relationship between these myopathy events and pregabalin is not completely understood because the cases had documented factors that may have caused or contributed to these events. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if these muscle symptoms are accompanied by malaise or fever. Discontinue treatment with pregabalin if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected or if markedly elevated creatine kinase levels occur.

### Intolerance to statins: mechanisms and management [^117ShN5b]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Statins are considered very effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients. However, although adherence to statins improves morbidity and mortality, it remains suboptimal. One of the most important causes of nonadherence is the so-called statin intolerance, mainly because of muscle-related symptoms. These symptoms most often consist of myalgia unaccompanied by significant creatine kinase (CK) elevations. Less often, myositis (elevated CK > 10 times the upper limit of normal) or rhabdomyolysis (CK level > 10,000 IU/L or accompanied by significant elevation in creatinine level) develops.

In randomized controlled trials, the incidence of statin myopathy is ~1.5–5.0%. However, this low incidence may be misleading for several reasons. First, in most studies patients with a history of statin intolerance were excluded. Other studies had a single-blinded statin run-in phase, and patients experiencing muscle-related symptoms or CK elevations during this phase were excluded. Patients who tend to be at risk for developing muscle-related symptoms, such as women, elderly patients, and patients with significant comorbidity, who comprise a large proportion of statin-treated patients in real-life settings, are underrepresented in randomized controlled trials. Some studies have defined muscle-related effects by elevated CK levels only, disregarding myalgia. Last but not least, patients enrolled in studies might be motivated and so minimize reporting of mild myalgias, thus leading to underestimation of the magnitude of the problem.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and laboratory monitoring — adverse effects and testing guidance are as follows: Available evidence, however, does not support the use of coenzyme Q10 supplementation for routine use in patients treated with statins or for the treatment of SAMS. The majority of SAMS are subjective myalgia in the absence of other findings, and an asymptomatic increase in transaminases (> 3 times upper limit of normal) is an infrequent statin-associated side effect. Therefore, CK and transaminase levels should not be routinely measured given the unlikely impact on clinical outcomes, and the lack of established cost effectiveness.

### Sonidegib (Odomzo) [^11288siA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Obtain baseline serum CK and creatinine levels prior to initiating ODOMZO, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated (e.g., if muscle symptoms are reported). Obtain serum creatinine and CK levels at least weekly in patients with musculoskeletal adverse reactions with concurrent serum CK elevation greater than 2.5 times ULN until resolution of clinical signs and symptoms. Depending on the severity of symptoms, temporary dose interruption or discontinuation may be required for musculoskeletal adverse reactions or serum CK elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Advise patients starting therapy with ODOMZO of the risk of muscle-related adverse reactions. Advise patients to report promptly any new unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness occurring during treatment or that persists after discontinuing ODOMZO.

### Simvastatin (floLipid) [^114hzSgZ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis

Simvastatin occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of myopathy is increased by high levels of statin activity in plasma. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥ 65 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment.

The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, is dose related. In a clinical trial database in which 41,413 patients were treated with simvastatin, 24,747 (approximately 60%) of whom were enrolled in studies with a median follow-up of at least 4 years, the incidence of myopathy was approximately 0.03% and 0.08% at 20 and 40 mg/day, respectively. The incidence of myopathy with 80 mg (0.61%) was disproportionately higher than that observed at the lower doses. In these trials, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded.

In a clinical trial in which 12,064 patients with a history of myocardial infarction were treated with simvastatin (mean follow-up 6.7 years), the incidence of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a serum creatine kinase [CK] > 10 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.9% compared with 0.02% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK > 40 times ULN) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.4% compared with 0% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, was highest during the first year and then notably decreased during the subsequent years of treatment. In this trial, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded.

5.11 Creatine Kinase Elevations

LYRICA treatment was associated with creatine kinase elevations. Mean changes in creatine kinase from baseline to the maximum value were 60 U/L for LYRICA‑treated patients and 28 U/L for the placebo patients. In all controlled trials across multiple patient populations, 1.5% of patients on LYRICA and 0.7% of placebo patients had a value of creatine kinase at least 3 times the upper limit of normal. Three LYRICA‑treated subjects had events reported as rhabdomyolysis in premarketing clinical trials. The relationship between these myopathy events and LYRICA is not completely understood because the cases had documented factors that may have caused or contributed to these events. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if these muscle symptoms are accompanied by malaise or fever. Discontinue treatment with LYRICA CR if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected or if markedly elevated creatine kinase levels occur.

5.12 Decreased Platelet Count

Both LYRICA CR and LYRICA treatment were associated with a decrease in platelet count. In the double‑blind phase of controlled studies for pain indication, LYRICA CR‑treated patients experienced a median change from baseline in platelet count of 11 × 10³/mm³(for the PHN population) and 14 × 10³/mm³(for the FM population) as compared to 1 × 10³/mm³in placebo‑treated patients (for both populations). LYRICA‑treated patients experienced a mean maximal decrease in platelet count of 20 × 10³/µL, compared to 11 × 10³/µL in placebo patients. In the overall database of controlled trials, 2% of placebo patients and 3% of LYRICA patients experienced a potentially clinically significant decrease in platelets, defined as 20% below baseline value and less than 150 × 10³/µL. A single LYRICA‑treated subject developed severe thrombocytopenia with a platelet count less than 20 × 103/µL. In randomized controlled trials, LYRICA or LYRICA CR were not associated with an increase in bleeding‑related adverse reactions.

### Effect of newly proposed CK reference limits on neuromuscular diagnosis [^113Vufxw]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

The objective was to determine the effect of a proposed increase in the upper reference limits of serum creatine kinase (CK) on neuromuscular disease diagnosis. This was a retrospective study of 94 Caucasian subjects (49 women and 45 men) in whom a neuromuscular physician ordered a CK as part of their evaluation. The patients were divided into two groups: those with diagnoses that either should or could elevate serum CK, and those with diagnoses that should not elevate serum CK. Sensitivities and specificities of the manufacturer's and the newly proposed upper reference limits were determined. For women, raising the upper reference limit of CK from 140 IU/L to 201 IU/L reduced the sensitivity of the test from 50% to 29%, while increasing the specificity from 67% to 80%. For men, raising the upper reference limit of CK from 174 IU/L to 322 IU/L reduced the sensitivity from 80% to 60%, while increasing the specificity from 63% to 80%. The newly proposed upper reference limits resulted in a false-negative CK of clinical significance in 7 of 94 subjects. Increasing the upper reference limit for CK reduced the sensitivity and increased the specificity of serum CK for neuromuscular disease diagnosis. Such a change will reduce unnecessary referrals and invasive diagnostic testing in patients with asymptomatic CK elevations. The clinical impact of the loss in sensitivity is small. If these new upper reference limits are adopted, neuromuscular physicians should be aware that a normal CK level does not exclude a diagnosis of myopathy.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^111AHmcL]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Exertional rhabdomyolysis is characterised by muscle breakdown associated with strenuous exercise or normal exercise under extreme circumstances. Key features are severe muscle pain and sudden transient elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels with or without associated myoglobinuria. Mild cases may remain unnoticed or undiagnosed. Exertional rhabdomyolysis is well described among athletes and military personnel, but may occur in anybody exposed to unaccustomed exercise. In contrast, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the first manifestation of a genetic muscle disease that lowers the exercise threshold for developing muscle breakdown. Repeated episodes of exertional rhabdomyolysis should raise the suspicion of such an underlying disorder, in particular in individuals in whom the severity of the rhabdomyolysis episodes exceeds the expected response to the exercise performed. The present review aims to provide a practical guideline for the acute management and postepisode counselling of patients with exertional rhabdomyolysis, with a particular emphasis on when to suspect an underlying genetic disorder. The pathophysiology and its clinical features are reviewed, emphasising four main stepwise approaches: (1) the clinical significance of an acute episode, (2) risks of renal impairment, (3) clinical indicators of an underlying genetic disorders and (4) when and how to recommence sport activity following an acute episode of rhabdomyolysis. Genetic backgrounds that appear to be associated with both enhanced athletic performance and increased rhabdomyolysis risk are briefly reviewed.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^114cBxBa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis

Simvastatin occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of myopathy is increased elevated plasma levels of simvastatin and simvastatin acid. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥ 65 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Chinese patients may be at increased risk for myopathy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8)]

The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, is dose related. In a clinical trial database in which 41,413 patients were treated with simvastatin, 24,747 (approximately 60%) of whom were enrolled in studies with a median follow-up of at least 4 years, the incidence of myopathy was approximately 0.03% and 0.08% at 20 and 40 mg/day, respectively. The incidence of myopathy with 80 mg (0.61%) was disproportionately higher than that observed at the lower doses. In these trials, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded.

The incidence of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK > 40 times ULN) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.4% compared with 0% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, was highest during the first year and then notably decreased during the subsequent years of treatment. In this trial, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded.

Asymptomatic serum CK elevations (SRM 0) and muscle pain without an increase in CK (SRM 1) have been the two most commonly (occurring in up to 33% of patients) described features of statin-induced toxicity. With the increasing use of electronic medical records, it may be possible to use CK elevations to identify patients with statin myotoxicity. However, because the use of CK as a screening test for muscle injury is not recommended, the identification of an isolated CK elevation in an electronic (or paper-based) record may indicate suspicion of the clinician of muscle toxicity, even if symptoms are variably recorded. CK levels are often used as a crude estimate of severity, but the correlation between muscle symptoms and CK levels is imperfect, and the clinical interpretation of CK levels is complex. There is considerable variability in the inclusion criteria and CK levels in the literature, particularly in genetic susceptibility studies. Some authors investigate patients with self-reported myalgia and CK levels from 1 to 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) (SRM 2), whereas others apply more stringent criteria with CK elevations > 4× (ref.) (SRM 3) or > 10× the ULN (SRM 4) for myopathy and ≥ 50× the ULN for rhabdomyolysis (SRM 5), which are the criteria used in some recent industry-funded studies. To prevent inclusion of patients with CK elevations from causes other than statin myotoxicity, we have adopted the > 4× the ULN for myopathy (SRM 3) and > 10× the ULN for severe myopathy (SRM 4). Although these cutoff points have been commonly used in clinical trials and in several guidelines, they are somewhat arbitrary. However, future analyses based on these cutoff points (< 4× the ULN, 4–10× the ULN, and > 10× the ULN) will help in defining the sensitivity and specificity of different genetic markers, and provide a first step in future refinement of cutoff levels. Some investigators have also used alanine aminotransferase elevation to identify muscle injury; this may be of use when measured in combination with CK. Isolated elevation of alanine aminotransferase, in the absence of an increase in CK levels, should raise the suspicion of liver injury, which can also rarely occur with statins.

### Severe proximal muscle weakness with normal CK as a presenting feature of ANCA-associated vasculitis [^114XXkA3]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Background

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is predominantly a small vessel vasculitis. The patients usually present with non-specific symptoms such as fever, weight loss, headache, respiratory symptoms and joint pains. Muscle weakness with or without raised creatine kinase (CK) is not commonly listed as a presenting feature of AAV in the medical literature. When a patient presents with non-specific symptoms with muscle weakness, a normal CK or normal imaging cannot rule out myositis or vasculitis. A muscle biopsy should be considered even in the presence of a normal CK or negative vasculitis screening. Also, a normal MRI or positron-emission tomography (PET) scan cannot convincingly rule out myositis or vasculitis.

### Fenofibrate (fenoglide) [^111fDNrs]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

5.4 Skeletal Muscle

Treatment with fenofibrate increases risk of myopathy. Treatment with fenofibrate increases risk of rhabdomyolysis, usually in patients with impaired renal function. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels.

Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. CPK levels should be assessed in patients reporting these symptoms, and fenofibrate therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed.

5.5 Serum Creatinine

Elevations in serum creatinine have been reported in patients on fenofibrate. These elevations tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of fenofibrate. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown.

### Approach to the patient who is intolerant of statin therapy [^114nQ5Aa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Myopathy occurs in approximately 10% of statin-treated patients and is most commonly manifested by myalgias with or without plasma creatine kinase (CK) elevations. Predisposition exists in patients treated with high doses of potent statins and those who are older, female, have a genetic predisposition, and when statins are coadministered with drugs that compete with or inhibit drug metabolism. In symptomatic patients, CK levels may assist in guiding management. If less than five times the upper limit of normal, the existing statin should be titrated to achieve cholesterol goals and the CK repeated when symptoms appear or worsen. In patients with moderate to severe symptoms and any patient with CK elevated to more than 5-fold the upper limit of normal, the statin should be stopped. Once asymptomatic and CK is reduced (if elevated previously), cholesterol goals can be approached by: 1) a different statin (e.g. fluvastatin or pravastatin), starting with a low dose and titrating up; 2) an alternate daily or weekly more potent statin (e.g. rosuvastatin or atorvastatin); or 3) the combination of the lowest tolerated statin with a cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe) and/or bile acid sequestrant. Over-the-counter preparations, e.g. red yeast rice, containing natural statin-like agents, or plant sterols can also lower cholesterol. These, however, have limited efficacy to achieve targeted cholesterol levels for most patients. In patients without CK elevations and symptoms, progress can be followed clinically, but in patients who show CK elevations, CK should be monitored. At present, the superiority of one approach has not been demonstrated, and the need for clinical trials in well-characterized patients with statin intolerance cannot be dismissed.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^116S7YG6]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

In the Laboratory

Q: What laboratory tests help to confirm a diagnosis of statin intolerance?

Dr. Sperling: There is no test that typically confirms a diagnosis of statin intolerance, and this is one of the reasons that it is such a difficult clinical entity to address.

Dr. Wong: Obtaining adequate baseline information on current muscle and other symptoms before a patient begins a statin is important, as symptoms are often erroneously attributed to the statin when they were actually present beforehand.

Some papers in the literature suggest that measurement of creatine kinase (CK) is most appropriate for a patient workup, after symptoms of intolerance have emerged.

Some physicians prefer to obtain a baseline CK for comfort, whereas others claim that with a baseline CK, you may end up pursuing the enzyme forever.

Changes in CK levels can occur daily, and CK is not a diagnostic tool. Although there is a general tendency not to look at CK levels in the absence of a specific complaint, a CK measurement 1 to 2 days following intense exercise may be appropriate to see what the highest values might be.

Myositis (defined as muscle inflammation) seems to be associated with exercise, and almost without exception with CK elevations; myalgia (defined as muscle pain) can be relatively nondescript and is seldom associated with CK elevation.

Patients are interested in their liver enzymes. It is recommended that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) measurements be done at baseline and then be repeated, but there is little need for ongoing monitoring of liver enzymes unless warranted.

The ALT and AST levels are measured to determine if a patient is developing liver damage, or even liver failure, which may occur idiosyncratically in 1 in a million patients. This is the same incidence that is seen in patients who are not on statins, so a physician might ask what is really being accomplished by obtaining these measurements. It should be noted that ALT and AST will often increase transiently and harmlessly during the first few weeks of statin therapy.

It should also be noted that some patients may be heavy drinkers, and this may confuse the issue with regard to liver function testing.

### Elevated creatine kinase and myalgia in a patient taking rosiglitazone [^115rEmFN]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of rosiglitazone-associated elevation in creatine kinase (CK) and coexisting myalgias and review other cases identified in the literature.

Case Summary

A 42-year-old man originally from Sri Lanka developed an elevated CK, with peak concentrations of 1671 U/L (normal < 160) and myalgias following 5 months of therapy with rosiglitazone. Signs and symptoms recurred upon rechallenge 3 years later. Other potential medical and medication causes were ruled out. Independent assessment by 2 raters using the Naranjo probability scale suggested a probable relationship with rosiglitazone.

Discussion

Only 5 previous reports of elevated CK, myalgias, myopathy, or rhabdomolysis in patients taking rosiglitazone or other thiazolidinediones were identified in the literature. Potential risk factors identified from previously published reports included concomitant therapy with fibrates, excessive use of ethanol, and asymptomatic mild CK elevation prior to starting therapy. Based on this case report, it seems reasonable to monitor CK levels in patients on rosiglitazone who are experiencing muscle symptoms or who have a history of myopathy.

Conclusions

Marked elevations of CK and muscle pain may be a possible adverse reaction of rosiglitazone therapy.

### Serum creatine kinase after exercise: drawing the line between physiological response and exertional rhabdomyolysis [^115pe2cJ]. Muscle & Nerve (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

In this investigation we assessed the spectrum of creatine kinase (CK) responses in military recruits undergoing basic training.

Methods

Musculoskeletal examination data, questionnaire findings, and CK levels were obtained from 499 recruits at days 0, 3, 7, and 14 of training. Correlations of CK with ethnicity, age, body mass index, exercise, muscle pain, and climate were obtained.

Results

None of the subjects developed clinical exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER). The mean/median serum CK values were 223/157, 734/478, 1226/567, and 667/486 IU/L at days 0, 3, 7, and 14, respectively, with a wide overall range (34–35,056 IU/L). African-American subjects had higher mean CK levels.

Conclusions

CK elevations and muscle pain are common during basic training. Widely accepted laboratory diagnostic values for ER are routinely exceeded in this military recruits, suggesting that CK levels > 50 times the upper limit of normal are more specific. The findings support using CK as a marker for ER. Normal laboratory reference ranges for CK should be published by ethnicity.

### Repotrectinib (Augtyro) [^113AZ5cq]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

AUGTYRO can cause hepatotoxicity.

Among the 426 patients treated with AUGTYRO, increased alanine transaminase (ALT) occurred in 38%, increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 41%, including Grade 3 or 4 increased ALT in 3.3% and increased AST in 2.9%. The median time to onset of increased ALT or AST was 15 days (range: 1 day to 1.9 years). Increased ALT or AST leading to dose interruptions or reductions occurred in 2.8% and 1.2% of patients, respectively. Hyperbilirubinemia leading to dose interruptions occurred in 0.5%.

Monitor liver function tests, including ALT, AST and bilirubin, every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment, then monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Withhold and then resume at the same or reduced dose upon improvement, or permanently discontinue AUGTYRO based on the severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

5.4 Myalgia with Creatine Phosphokinase Elevation

AUGTYRO can cause myalgia with or without creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation.

Among the 426 patients treated with AUGTYRO, myalgia occurred in 13% of patients, with Grade 3 in 0.7%. Median time to onset of myalgia was 19 days (range: 1 day to 2 years). Concurrent increased CPK within a 7-day window was observed in 3.7% of patients. AUGTYRO was interrupted in one patient with myalgia and concurrent CPK elevation.

Advise patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness.

Monitor serum CPK levels during AUGTYRO treatment and monitor CPK levels every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment and as needed in patients reporting unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Initiate supportive care as clinically indicated. Based on severity, withhold and then resume AUGTYRO at the same or reduced dose upon improvement [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^113BKeJ3]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Myoglobin, the haemprotein that functions as an oxygen carrier in skeletal muscle, is normally bound to plasma globulins. In case of rhabdomyolysis, myoglobin leaks from the myocyte and immediately peaks to levels that may exceed the plasma protein-binding capacity. As a result, myoglobin precipitates in the glomerular filtrate and obstructs renal tubules, an important factor in the pathogenesis of ARF. Other factors contributing to ARF include vasoconstriction, hypovolaemia and a direct renal toxic effect of myoglobin.

In our experience, rhabdomyolysis mainly occurs in the muscles that are most frequently used. The type of exercise performed also plays an important role in ERM. In particular, eccentric training, for example, squats, lunges, push-ups, plyometrics or running downhill, carries a risk of causing ERM. Repetitive eccentric contractions, a process where the muscle is lengthening while trying to contract, cause excess tension in the sarcomere, leading to membrane disruption and, subsequently, structural protein hydrolysis, myofibril deformation and permanent muscle injury. Eccentric exercise has also been associated with core formation on muscle biopsy, usually a histopathological hallmark of congenital myopathies.

Definition of ERM

What is generally agreed on are the following four key features of rhabdomyolysis:
A CK elevation 12–36 hours after exercise, with a maximum at 3–4 days, followed by normalisation within several weeks of rest;
The CK increase is preceded by exercise, usually beyond the limits of fatigue, also referred to as ' unaccustomed physical exertion' or 'involuntary exertion ';
The CK increase is symptomatic with any of the following features: myalgia (muscle soreness or tenderness; in general, rhabdomyolysis is very painful), swelling and/or weakness;
The presence of myoglobinaemia and/or myoglobinuria: either by inspection (pigmenturia) or by laboratory testing. Since myoglobin testing in blood or urine is not widely available, many experts consider the combination of the first three features diagnostic for ERM.

Case presentation

Initial presentation

A 16 year old African American female with a past medical history of obesity, depression, irregular menses, presumed idiopathic rhabdomyolysis, currently taken no medications presented to the emergency department (ED) with one week history of myalgia and muscle weakness in bilateral upper arms, thighs, and buttocks. Patient also endorsed dark urine starting the morning of presentation. This was reminiscent of a prior rhabdomyolysis hospitalization prompting the patient and her mother to immediately go to the ED.

Patient arrived hemodynamically stable with physical exam rather unremarkable aside from diffuse myalgias and muscle weakness. The patient exhibited normal range of motion with pain with passive movement of the bilateral upper and lower extremities (UE/LE). Initially she had 4/5 strength in bilateral UE and LE with improvement to 5/5 strength in bilateral UE and LE by hospital discharge. Cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact with bilateral knee deep tendon reflexes 2/4. Her cerebellar tests were unremarkable. Serum creatine kinase (CK) was measured at 153,000 IU/L (Fig. 1 a) with urinalysis showing large "blood" and protein (100 m/dL). No other serum electrolyte abnormality was noted. Ionized calcium was 4.4 mg/dL with serum calcium 7.2 mg/dL and albumin 2.7 g/dL. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with QTc of 443 ms.

Fig. 1
a - b Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels versus time during both rhabdomyolysis hospitalizations. Standard reported upper limit of detection for our laboratory testing was 200,000 IU/L thus samples were further diluted to achieve accurate value. These values are not reported here, however in both hospitalizations there were instances of CK well above 200,000 IU/L

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms and metabolic effects — frequency and risk factors: Statin therapy is usually well tolerated and safe, but statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) usually are subjective myalgia, reported observationally in 5% to 20% of patients. Myalgias with normal creatine kinase (CK) are infrequent (1% to 5%) in randomized controlled trials and frequent (5% to 10%) in observational settings, while rhabdomyolysis defined by CK > 10x ULN plus renal injury is rare. New-onset diabetes mellitus depends on population and is more frequent when risk factors are present, such as body mass index ≥ 30, fasting blood glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL, metabolic syndrome, or A1c ≥ 6%. SAMS often result in nonadherence and can adversely impact ASCVD outcomes, and although statins modestly increase risk of incident diabetes mellitus in susceptible individuals, this should not be cause for discontinuation.

A 6-year-old boy was evaluated for a 6-week history of low back pain. Initially, the pain was exacerbated by movements, eventually showing a milder and fluctuating trend. History was unremarkable for previous traumatic events, fever or nocturnal pain. Physical examination revealed localised pain at palpation of the spinous processes at the lumbosacral level. Blood tests showed a normal blood count, negative C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, normal lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase. A posterior-anterior radiograph of the lumbar spine resulted normal. An MRI scan revealed a lumbosacral transitional vertebra with bone oedema of the posterior arch until the spinous process. For better bone definition, a CT scan was performed (figure 1).

### European Federation of Neurological Societies cutoff values significantly reduce creatine kinase sensitivity for diagnosing neuromuscular disorders [^113ZbKdf]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Elevated creatine kinase (CK) level was redefined by the European Federation of Neurological Societies)EFNS(as 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. In the current study we sought to determine the sensitivity and specificity of CK testing for the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders.

Methods

Demographics and CK levels were retrospectively extracted from an electronic database for 234 patients with neuromuscular disorders. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios and the area under curve were determined for each diagnosis and different cutoff CK values.

Results

Using the EFNS cutoff values significantly reduced CK test sensitivity. Creatine kinase values > 1000IU/L showed a high likelihood (11.04) for myopathies and a low likelihood for polyneuropathies (0).

Discussion

European Federation of Neurological Societies cutoff values significantly reduce CK sensitivity for diagnosing neuromuscular disorders. While low CK values cannot exclude a neuromuscular disease, values > 1000IU/L are associated with a high likelihood of myopathy.

### PHKA1-associated phosphorylase kinase deficiency: a monogenic disorder of exercise intolerance and myalgia [^111RS6nz]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Additional research is needed to better define genotype-phenotype relationships in this disease. In our clinically identified cohort, the majority of patients with a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in PHKA1 harbored a nonsense null variant, while the remaining patients had a deletion or insertion variant creating a frameshift in the genetic code and a termination in transcription. The variants fell along the length of the gene (Fig. 3). Patients 1 and 3 shared the same pathogenic variant PHKA1 (c.2806C > T, p. Arg936Ter) in exon 25; patient 3 suffered from exercise intolerance and myalgia in childhood in the setting of a normal CK level while patient 1 presented with delayed developmental milestones, myalgia, and dysphagia in childhood with CK levels 1.2× the upper limit of normal. Additionally, patient 2, patient 5, and L14 shared the same pathogenic variant (c.3334G > T, p. Glu1112Ter); patient 2 presented in early childhood with exercise intolerance, myalgia, and fatigue, whereas patient 5 presented with myalgia, cramps, and weakness in early adulthood with CK levels 17.8× the upper limit of normal, and L14 exhibited gait disturbance in middle adulthood with CK levels 2× the upper limit of normal. These findings underscore the need for more comprehensive investigations and genetic testing for individuals exhibiting exercise intolerance and myalgia that cannot be explained by other diagnoses and where a clinician has a high index of suspicion for a diagnosis of GSD IXα1.

### Acute myopathy in a patient with oesophageal stricture [^116a5Erw]. Age and Ageing (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Muscle injury may be caused by any one of a number of factors, including trauma, drugs, hyperthermia and metabolic derangement. Symptoms and signs are often non-specific, and myopathy may be easily overlooked.

Case

An elderly woman was referred to hospital for investigation of rapidly declining mobility in the setting of anorexia and vomiting due to benign oesophageal stricture. The patient had generalised muscle weakness and tenderness. Investigations showed severe metabolic alkalosis and hypokalaemia, and creatinine kinase (CK) activity was grossly elevated at 40,000 U/l.

Outcome

CK activity remained elevated for several days, and a diagnosis of polymyositis was considered. However, muscle tenderness resolved and CK activity declined after correction of the underlying metabolic disturbances. Acute myopathy was attributed to hypokalaemia.

Conclusions

Hypokalaemia is an important cause of acute myopathy, and older patients may present with non-specific symptoms. A high degree of clinical suspicion is needed to establish the diagnosis. The clinical features and the pathogenes of hypokalaemia-induced myopathy are reviewed.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^113vW8Xu]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

What laboratory findings aid in the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis?

Recommendation

The most commonly implicated variables include elevated serum concentrations of CK (> 5× the upper limit of normal or > 1000 IU/L), myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), potassium, creatinine, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Elevated urine myoglobin provides additional evidence. A low threshold of suspicion in the proper clinical context is warranted to initiate appropriate therapy. A strategy for disease monitoring with serial CK measurement should be additionally undertaken. Interval CK values should be followed until a peak concentration is identified (typically at 24–72 hours), discontinued once the CK is reliably downtrending.

Discussion

Traumatic or non-traumatic injury to the skeletal muscle cellular membrane leads to an influx of calcium into the cytoplasm, disrupting cellular homeostasis and leading to cell death. Injury may be exacerbated by the generation of reactive oxygen species after restoration of blood flood to the affected tissue (reperfusion injury). The resulting effect is the accumulation of CK, myoglobin, LDH, and potassium in the circulation. In a recent systematic review, the laboratory definition of rhabdomyolysis varied to include an elevated CK level > 5× the upper limit of normal or > 1000 IU/L, with the CK-MM subtype being the most reflective of skeletal muscle injury.CK values may become elevated within 12 hours of injury, peak at 24 to 72 hours, and return to normal in roughly 5 days, depending on the degree of injury and appropriate therapy.

Myoglobin becomes elevated in the circulation once intrinsic binding proteins are overwhelmed. Given a shorter half-life (1–3 hours) versus CK, myoglobin may elevate and resolve prior to CK depreciating its clinical utility. Myoglobin may also be evident in the urine and, although the sensitivity has been reported up to 100%, the specificity varies widely from 15% to 88%. Although a causal relationship may exist between rhabdomyolysis and elevations in hepatic aminotransferases (AST, ALT: alanine transaminase), this is of unclear value as both enzymes exist within skeletal muscle and may become elevated as a result of primary muscle injury.

### Serum creatine kinase elevation associated with olanzapine treatment [^112S1aHr]. BMJ Case Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

On 2 May 2008, a 25-year-old male patient on olanzapine 15 mg developed mild central chest pain, and blood tests revealed a high creatine kinase (CK) value at 1016 iu/l. Troponin, CK-MB, CK:MB ratio, full blood count (FBC), urea and electrolytes (U&E), C reactive protein (CRP) and glucose were all normal. Liver enzymes were marginally raised: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 91 iu/l, γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 46 iu/l, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 137 iu/l. The ECG was normal and the chest pain later resolved and was thought likely to be due to costochondritis. A repeat blood test on 7 May revealed further elevation of CK at 1391 iu/l and olanzapine was stopped. CK continued to rise: 19 May 2857 iu/l, 20 May 3285 iu/l, and 22 May 3646 iu/l. On 30 May CK dropped to 708 iu/l, on 20 June it was 593 iu/l, and on 30 June CK was 343 iu/l. The patient was started on amisulpiride on 15 July and CK began to rise again: on 18 July it was 445 iu/l and on 31 July CK was 480 iu/l, at which time the medication was stopped. The patient did not have any signs or symptoms of physical disorder on this occasion. We have never seen a patient develop such high CK values in the absence of any clinical or other significant laboratory abnormalities. We can rule out exercise as the cause as he attends an inpatient unit and we are aware that his exercise has been light to moderate at most; also, he stopped exercising at our request on 7 May 2008, yet CK continued to rise. There is no clinical indication of other causes of elevated CK such as myositis, and CK-MB and CK-MB:CK ratio were normal throughout, so it was not cardiac in origin. We believe olanzapine caused the elevated CK value. When the patient was rechallenged with amisulpiride on 15 May his CK again rose and the medication therefore had to be stopped. There are three similar cases that have been reported in the past when patients on second generation antipsychotics developed CK elevation in the absence of other clinical or laboratory abnormalities. We therefore believe this is an important finding to report.

### Emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy [^115MG2Pk]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

10 DIAGNOSTIC TESTING

Due to its rarity and the phenotypic overlap with other forms of muscular dystrophy such as congenital muscular dystrophy and LGMD, diagnosing EDMD may be challenging. 97 Clinical clues include neck extensor weakness, the classic pattern of contractures, a cardiomyopathy, bradyarrhythmias, and tachyarrhythmias. 97

10.1 Creatine kinase levels

In patients with skeletal muscle involvement, creatine kinase (CK) levels can range from normal to 15 times the upper limit of normal. In those with exclusive cardiac involvement, CK levels are generally normal. 10 Thus, elevated CK levels may be helpful in the diagnostic evaluation but normal CK levels do not exclude the diagnosis of EDMD.

10.2 Electrodiagnosis

Overall, electromyography (EMG) findings in EDMD are similar to those seen in other myopathies, including low amplitude, short duration motor unit action potentials and early recruitment patterns. 98 However, the needle examination may also reveal "irregular" motor unit action potentials consisting of high amplitudes, increased polyphasia, and normal or long durations; this can cause confusion as these are generally regarded to be neurogenic features. 98 This range of EMG findings likely reflects the muscle fiber changes (such as hypertrophy and splitting) and overall fiber size variability (with both hypertrophy and atrophy) that can occur in a slowly progressive myopathy. 98, 99, 100 Abnormal spontaneous activity tends to be abundant 101, 102 with myotonic discharges reported in one case, 102 although abnormal spontaneous activity is not universally present 103 or may be present only in selected muscles. 104

No systematic studies have been published regarding the use of electrical impedance myography in the diagnostic evaluation of EDMD.

The document notes "The literature on the impact that statins have on CK has been mixed". It also states "Most patients with SAMS do not have elevated CK", and that "CK can be increased in asymptomatic individuals on statin therapy or can be elevated for other reasons (i.e., increased physical activity or exercise".

### Exercise responses in patients with chronically high creatine kinase levels [^115qMS7c]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) is often taken to reflect muscle disease, but many individuals have elevated CK without a specific diagnosis. How elevated CK reflects muscle metabolism during exercise is not known.

Methods

Participants (46 men, 48 women) underwent incremental exercise testing to assess aerobic performance, cardiovascular response, and ventilatory response. Serum lactate, ammonia, and CK were measured at rest, 4 minutes into exercise, and 2 minutes into recovery.

Results

High-CK and control subjects demonstrated similar aerobic capacities and cardiovascular responses to incremental exercise. Those with CK ≥ 300 U/L exhibited significantly higher lactate and ammonia levels after maximal exercise, together with increased ventilatory responses, whereas those with CK ≥ 200 U/L but ≤ 300 U/L did not.

Conclusions

We recommend measurement of lactate and ammonia profiles during a maximal incremental exercise protocol to help identify patients who warrant muscle biopsy to rule out myopathy. Muscle Nerve 56: 264–270, 2017.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^117UHuFY]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and myopathy criteria — The most common symptoms that result in statin intolerance or statin discontinuation are muscle-related; SAMS refers to all muscle symptoms temporally related to statin use but without regard to causality, while pharmacologic SAMS refers specifically to muscle symptoms that are caused by the statin. In statin clinical trials, an alternative myopathy definition requires adverse muscle symptoms with creatine kinase (CK) elevations ≥ 10 X upper limit of normal (ULN), under which statin-induced myopathy occurs with a frequency of 1/1000 in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

5.1	Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

LIVALO may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including LIVALO.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher LIVALO dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Dosages of LIVALO greater than 4 mg once daily were associated with an increased risk for severe myopathy in premarketing clinical studies. The maximum recommended dose of LIVALO is 4 mg once daily.

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

LIVALO is contraindicated in patients taking cyclosporine and not recommended in patients taking gemfibrozil [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. There are LIVALO dosage restrictions for patients taking erythromycin or rifampin [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The following drugs when used concomitantly with LIVALO may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis: lipid-modifying dosages of niacin (> 1grams/day), fibrates, and colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinue LIVALO if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if LIVALO is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue LIVALO in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the LIVALO dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112H5kji]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Statin safety — myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are key considerations, with myopathy (incidence < 0.1%) defined as unexplained muscle symptoms with creatine kinase (CK) elevation > 10 times the upper limits of normal (ULN); when CK is above 10 000 IU/L or greater than 40 times ULN, rhabdomyolysis should be considered. Myopathy is rare, with incidence < 0.1% for most statins and 1% for simvastatin 80 mg, a dose no longer used, and the incidence of rhabdomyolysis is even lower at < 0.01%. In patients with myopathy, discontinuation of the statin usually results in resolution of muscle symptoms within days and CK returns to normal within 2 to 3 weeks, and if rhabdomyolysis is suspected, intensive hydration is usually effective in preventing renal failure. Possible risk factors include older age, female sex, diabetes, Chinese ancestry, renal insufficiency, pre-existing muscle disease, hypothyroidism, and drug interactions; in a patient with unexplained muscle symptoms, CK levels will distinguish nonserious muscle symptoms from myopathy. About 10% to 20% of statin-treated subjects in clinical trials report muscle symptoms that are usually not accompanied by CK increases, yet statin-associated muscle symptoms are caused by the statin in < 1% of patients. In a 2016 meta-analysis of 12 cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcome studies in 97 000 subjects, myalgia or muscle ache occurred in 5162 (11.7%) on statins versus 5051 (11.4%) on placebo (P = 0.10), and in 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials specifically querying muscle symptoms, none found a statistically significant difference between statin and placebo groups. Re-challenge data show 90% of statin-intolerant patients tolerated the same or a different statin, and in 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) labeled statin intolerant, the vast majority could tolerate a statin under double-blind conditions.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Risks Associated with Combination Treatment with a Statin, Fenofibrate, or Other LDL-C Lowering Therapies: Refer to the Prescribing Information of these products for a description of their risks including, but not limited to, the warnings and precautions. (5.1)
Liver Enzyme Abnormalities and Monitoring: Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of ezetimibe tablets. Perform liver enzyme testing as clinically indicated and consider withdrawal of ezetimibe tablets if increases in ALT or AST ≥ 3 X ULN persist. (5.2)
Skeletal Muscle Effects (e.g. Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis): ezetimibe tablets may cause myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. In post-marketing reports, most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin or other agents known to be associated with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibrates. If myopathy is suspected, discontinue ezetimibe tablets and other concomitant medications, as appropriate. (5.3)

5.1 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment with a Statin, Fenofibrate, or Other LDL-C Lowering Therapies

If ezetimibe tablets is administered with a statin, fenofibrate, or other LDL-C lowering therapies, refer to the Prescribing Information of these products for a description of their risks including, but not limited to, the warnings and precautions [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Liver Enzymes

Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of ezetimibe tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In controlled clinical combination studies of ezetimibe tablets initiated concurrently with a statin, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3 X ULN) in hepatic transaminase levels was 1.3% for patients treated with ezetimibe tablets administered with statins and 0.4% for patients treated with statins alone. Perform liver enzyme testing as clinically indicated and consider withdrawal of ezetimibe tablets if increases in ALT or AST ≥ 3 X ULN persist.

5.3 Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis

Ezetimibe tablets may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In post-marketing reports, most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin or other agents known to be associated with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibrates. If myopathy is suspected, discontinue ezetimibe tablets and other concomitant medications, as appropriate.

### Identifying inherited metabolic disorders in children: the role of elevated creatine kinase [^112jYcsh]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Creatine kinase (CK) is an essential enzyme predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain tissue, where it facilitates energy homeostasis by catalyzing the conversion of creatine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). CK elevation is a key biochemical marker for muscle integrity and is widely used in diagnosing neuromuscular disorders, particularly in pediatric patients. However, the underlying causes of CK elevation vary, encompassing both inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) and primary myopathies. The differential diagnosis of these conditions requires a systematic approach integrating clinical, biochemical, and genetic assessments.

Among IMDs, disorders such as glycogen storage diseases (GSDs), fatty acid oxidation defects (FAODs), and mitochondrial disorders frequently present with CK elevation, often accompanied by additional biochemical abnormalities such as elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In addition, neuromuscular diseases, including muscular dystrophies and inflammatory myopathies, also manifest with increased CK levels, necessitating careful differentiation. Moreover, non-metabolic factors such as trauma, viral myositis, exercise-induced muscle damage, and drug-induced myopathies (e.g. statins, corticosteroids) further complicate the diagnostic process.

Despite the widespread use of CK as a screening tool, there is no universal consensus on CK cut-off values that reliably distinguish metabolic from neuromuscular conditions. CK thresholds used in clinical practice may differ based on laboratory-specific reference values, and there is variability in reference ranges across different populations and age groups. In our institution, a CK level exceeding 171 U/L is considered elevated based on laboratory-defined upper limits. Previous studies, such as Schumann and Klauke, have also defined the upper normal CK limit as 171 U/L based on the 97.5th percentile of reference samples, which aligns with our institutional threshold. While some sources suggest that CK levels exceeding 1000 U/L warrant investigation for muscle disorders, there is still a lack of standardized reference values specific to pediatric metabolic diseases, underscoring the need for further research in this area.

### An open label, adaptive, phase 1 trial of high-dose oral nitazoxanide in healthy volunteers: an antiviral candidate for SARS-CoV-2 [^111X8sYg]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study establishes the safety and acceptable tolerance of high‐dose nitazoxanide with food in healthy adult participants. A nitazoxanide dose of 1,500 mg twice‐daily for 7 days is safe and the plasma concentrations attained are expected to be sufficient to achieve the in vitro ‐defined EC 90 against SARS‐CoV‐2 in over 90% of the population. As expected, GI effects were common (predominantly nausea, abdominal discomfort, bloating, and loose stools) and at most, of moderate intensity (grade 2 discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities). Participants also reported yellow discoloration of sclera and bodily fluids in line with the Summary of Product Characteristics and previous reports, and these fully resolved upon discontinuation of the drug.

Minor elevation in CK, predominantly in the second half of the cohort, was noted in 5 of 14 participants. This was also self‐resolving and not associated with muscle tenderness on physical examination. We believe increased self‐reported physical activity of participants, coinciding with COVID‐19 lockdown restrictions easing, may explain the mild CK elevations observed but ongoing monitoring of CK will be undertaken as part of phase Ib in patients with COVID‐19.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Monitoring for statin-associated side effects — CK and liver enzymes: "it is recommended that CK be measured in the case of severe SAMS and in the presence of objective muscle weakness", and "the FDA recommends measuring transaminases… if there are signs or symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity". An "asymptomatic increase in transaminases (> 3 times upper limit of normal) is an infrequent statin-associated side effect" that often resolves with dose adjustment, while "Severe statin-associated hepatotoxicity is rare, and the incidence is not impacted by routine monitoring of transaminases", and evaluation for nonstatin causes "is warranted" if elevations persist. "Statins are not contraindicated in patients with increased ASCVD risk with chronic, stable liver disease", and, overall, "CK and transaminase levels should not be routinely measured".

### Hypothyroid myopathy with a strikingly elevated serum creatine kinase level [^116BjiRP]. Muscle & Nerve (2002). Low credibility.

Although serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are frequently modestly elevated in patients with hypothyroid myopathy, elevations in serum CK to the levels usually seen in inflammatory myopathies or dystrophies are rare. We report a patient with progressive proximal weakness and a serum CK level of over 29,000 IU/L, in whom subsequent laboratory evaluation identified profound hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy resulted in resolution of clinical symptoms and a marked reduction in the serum CK level. Such a high serum CK level in a patient with hypothyroidism underscores the importance of assessing thyroid function in patients with weakness, regardless of serum CK levels, even when systemic symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism are minimal or absent.

### Severe proximal muscle weakness with normal CK as a presenting feature of ANCA-associated vasculitis [^113ZVdyx]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Investigations

Biochemical parameters are shown in table 1. He had an elevated white cell count and neutrophils on presentation, and this has slightly improved after the course of antibiotics for a probable chest infection. C-reactive protein (CRP) remained elevated on the second presentation. Since he had progressive muscle weakness, he underwent further investigations for secondary causes for muscle weakness.

Table 1
Laboratory parameters for the current case

CK was within normal limits on repeated testing. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was normal. Screening for infectious illnesses including cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and HIV was negative. Connective tissue disease screening was also undertaken. The antinuclear antibody was weakly positive. The ANCA testing showed that he had a moderately positive myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody titre. This was originally considered as a non-significant result due to a low titre, and the positive result was attributed to the infective illness.

As this man had progressive and debilitating muscle weakness, further testing was undertaken. The clinicians were reluctant to consider a muscle biopsy given that he had a repeatedly normal CK. PET scan did not show any uptake in any muscle group.

A search for malignancy screening including CT scan of the abdomen, pelvis and the chest was normal, making a paraneoplastic process less likely. Finally, a muscle biopsy of the left vastus lateralis was performed, and it revealed marked fibrinoid necrosis of the medium-sized arterial walls with an intense transmural mixed inflammatory infiltrate (figure 1).

### Muscle pain associated with daptomycin [^115ki9i6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of muscle pain without pronounced creatine kinase (CK) elevation in a patient receiving daptomycin.

Case Summary

A 26-year-old African American woman had antibiotic intolerance to vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. She presented with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis that was treated with intravenous daptomycin 6 mg/kg daily for 14 days. The patient developed muscle aches and pains with only a minor elevation (492 U/L) of CK; both resolved after daptomycin was discontinued.

Discussion

Daptomycin is a newly approved lipopeptide antibiotic derived from Streptomyces roseosporus with rapid bactericidal activity. Daptomycin has excellent coverage against gram-positive bacteria. The adverse effect profile has included rare reports of myopathy and elevated CK levels. Daptomycin is a promising agent with many potential applications. Once-daily dosing has diminished the preclinical incidence of myopathy. The current package labeling recommends discontinuation of daptomycin with significant myopathy symptoms in association with a CK elevation > 1000 U/L or in patients without muscle pain and a CK > 10 times normal.

Conclusions

An objective causality assessment revealed that the myopathy was possibly related to daptomycin. Clinicians should recognize that significant myopathy with daptomycin can occur without pronounced CK elevation.

Table 1
Definitions of statin-associated muscle symptoms proposed by the EAS Consensus Panel

In the vast majority of cases, SAMS are not accompanied by marked CK elevation. For SAMS with CK elevations > 10× ULN, usually referred to as myopathy, the incidence is approximately 1 per 10 000 per year with a standard statin dose (e.g. simvastatin 40 mg daily). The risk varies, however, among different statins, and increases not only with the dose of statin, but also with factors associated with increased statin blood concentrations (e.g. genetic factors, ethnicity, interacting drugs, and patient characteristics) (see Box 1). Rhabdomyolysis is a severe form of muscle damage associated with very high CK levels with myoglobinaemia and/or myoglobinuria with a concomitantly increased risk of renal failure. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis in association with statin therapy is ∼1 in 100 000 per year. In view of the rarity of CK elevations during statin therapy, it is not recommended to routinely monitor CK. Even if an asymptomatic elevation of CK is detected, the clinical significance is unclear.

Box 1
Risk factors for statin-associated muscle symptoms. Adapted from Mancini et al.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms are more likely to be caused by statins when elevated CK levels decrease after cessation of either the statin or the interacting drug, or when symptoms regress markedly within a few weeks of cessation of the statin and/or reappear within a month of drug re-challenge. Time to reappearance of symptoms is also influenced by the dose of statin and the duration of the re-challenge. Individual patient drug–placebo clinical trials have been suggested as an approach to confirming diagnosis of SAMS, but are not feasible in the routine outpatient setting.

### Beyond muscle destruction: a systematic review of rhabdomyolysis for clinical practice [^114HiURS]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Data synthesis

Definition

The clinical studies were very heterogeneous with regard to the definition of rhabdomyolysis; although most authors diagnosed rhabdomyolysis based on CK levels five times the upper limit of normal levels (> 1000 U/L), others used alternative criteria for diagnosis (Table 1). In the clinical setting, symptoms were not usually taken into consideration when defining rhabdomyolsysis; however, the most commonly included ones were muscle pain and muscle weakness while the presence of dark urine was not used to define this entity in most studies. When rhabdomyolysis is associated with the use of lipid-lowering drugs (statins, fibrates, or a combination of both), the CK level cutoff is considered ten times the upper limit of normal. The definition of severity of rhabdomyolysis varied among studies, some defining "severe rhabdomyolysis" based on different CK cutoff values (> 5000 U/L up to > 15,000 U/L).

Chest pain symptom characterization and terminology — For myocardial ischemia, the sensation is described as "characteristically deep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse", and "Point tenderness renders ischemia less likely". "It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation.17" Although "A patient's history is the most important basis for considering presence or absence of myocardial ischemia", "The diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone", and "In some patients, what appears to be noncardiac chest pain may be ischemic in origin". Features more consistent with ischemia are summarized as "Chest pain that is more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin". Terminology guidance states "Atypical chest pain is a problematic term" and "we discourage the use of atypical chest pain"; to reduce ambiguity, "To diminish ambiguity, use "cardiac", "possible cardiac", and "noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged", and "chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen".

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

ZYPITAMAG may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including pitavastatin.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher ZYPITAMAG dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

Dosages of pitavastatin greater than 4 mg once daily were associated with an increased risk for severe myopathy in premarketing clinical studies. The maximum recommended dose of ZYPITAMAG is 4 mg once daily.

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

ZYPITAMAG is contraindicated in patients taking cyclosporine and not recommended in patients taking gemfibrozil [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis — top take-home messages include that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

### Focal myositis: new insights on diagnosis and pathology [^113BSe7P]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To better define in a cohort study the clinical and pathologic features of focal myositis (FM).

Methods

With the use of the usual clinicopathologic definition, each confirmed case of FM in the Lyon University Hospital's myopathologic database between 2000 and 2016 was retrieved. Clinical, pathologic, imaging, serologic, and therapeutic data were collected. When data were missing but feasible, appropriate pathologic analyses were performed.

Results

Of the 924 patients included in the database, 37 (4%) had confirmed FM (14 female, 23 male patients). The main symptoms were pain (n = 30, 81%), muscular mass (n = 16, 43%), erythema at the site of FM (n = 12, 32%), and fever (n = 9, 24%). Serum creatine kinase was normal in most patients (81%); serum immune abnormalities were frequent (inflammatory syndrome in sera [39%], dysglobulinemia [52%], and anti-nuclear antibody positivity [29%]). In addition to confirming previously reported findings, pathologic analyses found significant rates of vasculitis (68%) and fasciitis (73%). Here, FM appeared frequently to be associated with other diseases such as immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID; 32%), neoplasia (24%), and radiculopathy (11%). Regarding outcomes, 64% of the cases had received immunosuppressive drugs, and the relapse rate was 41%.

Conclusion

The present study suggests that FM is not as innocuous as previously believed, particularly considering the associated disorders. Notably, patients with FM should receive careful IMID and neoplasia screening.

### Pain symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a literature review [^1154usrU]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Myalgia is closely related to SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and can be used as one of the strongest predictors. General myalgia is very common in patients with COVID-19, but focal myalgia should alert the doctor that the patient may have rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially fatal syndrome, and its important indices are the concentration of serum CK or appearance of myoglobinuria. The CK level may indicate the severity of rhabdomyolysis. In comparison with non-severely infected patients, patients with severe infection have higher levels of CK and LDH. Therefore, the severity of myalgia may predict the severity of COVID-19 infection. Arthralgia is not a common symptom, and approximately 2.5% of patients with COVID-19 presented joint pain in Thailand up to 28 February 2020. Doctors should not ignore arthralgia when diagnosing COVID-19 to avoid misdiagnosis.

### Myositis: the first description of subclinical disease and a proposed distinctive triad to evoke clinical suspicion [^112cHh1M]. BMJ Neurology Open (2022). High credibility.

Case 2

A woman in her late 20s in her first trimester of pregnancy presented to the neurologist with a 3-year history of progressive symmetrical muscle weakness. The patient was premorbidly active and physically fit, her new progressive weakness causing her to withdraw from Muay Thai combat. The patient had no other significant medical history apart from long-standing hepatic dysfunction dating back a decade with a stagnant transaminitis; AST 50–80 (normal range 10–40 U/L) and ALT 45–95 (normal range 5–40 U/L). She had undergone previous extensive gastrointestinal investigations including hepatic biopsy, which failed to yield a diagnosis. The patient was noted by the treating neurologist to have a raised CK level of 3162 (normal range 45–250 U/L), along with an eosinophilia of 1.9 (normal range 0–0.6 × 10⁹/L), which dated back to 2012. There was a history of 5 kg unintentional weight loss over the preceding 6 months with no other constitutional symptoms. There was no history of bush meat consumption or wildlife exposures. The patient had lived in North Queensland for most of their life with a few years spent in Brisbane and no interstate travel; the only overseas destination was Thailand 3 years ago. Clinical examination revealed normal cranial nerve function with neck flexion weakness and symmetrical proximal upper limb weakness and distal lower limb weakness. The neurological assessment was otherwise normal with no fatiguability nor evidence of bulbar dysfunction. Repeat review with serological testing confirmed a persistently raised CK level and eosinophilia. Myositis antibody panel was negative, along with genetic testing for facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, acid maltase testing and a second-generation neuromuscular genetic screening panel. Electrodiagnostic testing, neuroimaging and muscle biopsy were pursued with a conscious decision to avoid steroid use, common practice for empirical treatment of inflammatory myositis. Neurophysiological testing demonstrated evidence of myopathy with diffuse spontaneous activity on needle electromyography (EMG). There were no MRI features of myositis on imaging of the neck and upper limb girdle. Muscle biopsy of the quadriceps was undertaken and the diagnosis of H. perplexum myositis was confirmed with visualisation of the nematode on microscopy and evidence of an eosinophilic predominant inflammatory myositis (figure 2). The patient has been commenced on albendazole therapy, which has been deemed safe in her first trimester of pregnancy and at the point of this report's submission remains stable with no adverse effects to therapy.

### Statin-associated myopathy with normal creatine kinase levels [^116WijLD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Muscle symptoms in patients who are treated with statins and have normal creatine kinase levels are not well understood.

Objective

To report biopsy-confirmed myopathy and normal creatine kinase levels associated with statin use.

Design

Case reports from preliminary analysis of an ongoing clinical trial.

Setting

Clinical research center in a community hospital.

Patients

Four patients with muscle symptoms that developed during statin therapy and reversed during placebo use.

Measurements

1) Patients' ability to identify blinded statin therapy and 2) standard measures of functional capacity and muscle strength.

Results

All four patients repeatedly distinguished blinded statin therapy from placebo. Strength testing confirmed weakness during statin therapy that reversed during placebo use. Muscle biopsies showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, including abnormally increased lipid stores, fibers that did not stain for cytochrome oxidase activity, and ragged red fibers. These findings reversed in the three patients who had repeated biopsy when they were not receiving statins. Creatine kinase levels were normal in all four patients despite the presence of significant myopathy.

Conclusion

Some patients who develop muscle symptoms while receiving statin therapy have demonstrable weakness and histopathologic findings of myopathy despite normal serum creatine kinase levels.

### Statin-associated myalgias and muscle injury-recognizing and managing both while still lowering the low-density lipoprotein [^112a2neE]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Although statins are generally safe and well tolerated, some patients experience muscle complaints that can be attributed to their use. Those with muscle discomfort but no demonstrable muscle weakness or creatine kinase (CK) elevations may have statin-associated muscle symptoms. Individuals with elevated CK levels, with or without muscle discomfort or weakness, may have statin-associated myotoxicity. Rare patients have statin-associated autoimmune myopathy, a disease characterized by proximal muscle weakness, elevated CK levels, and autoantibodies recognizing hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase. In this review, the author provides the clinician with a practical approach to diagnosing and managing patients with each of these statin side effects.

### Serum creatine kinase levels in spinobulbar muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^115keWkr]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

We compared serum creatine kinase (CK) levels between spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and reviewed available histochemical studies of frozen sections of muscle biopsies. CK levels and the frequency of patients with elevated CK levels were significantly higher in the SBMA group when compared with the ALS group. CK levels occasionally approached values up to 8 times the upper limit of normal in the SBMA group. In addition to the chronic neurogenic changes in the muscle biopsy, all SBMA patients showed one or more myopathic changes. Increased numbers of markedly hypertrophic fibers were consistently seen in all patients. It is not clear whether the elevated CK level is directly related to the increased number of hypertrophic fibers or to other myopathic features. Based on these findings, we recommend genetic testing for SBMA in cases of male patients with motor neuron disease who present with a significantly elevated serum creatine kinase level, even when other characteristic clinical features of SBMA are absent.

5.3 Reduced Level of Consciousness

Patients have become unresponsive or stuporous while receiving PRIALT. The incidence of unresponsiveness or stupor in clinical trials was 2% in PRIALT-treated patients. During these episodes, patients sometimes appear to be conscious and breathing is not depressed. If reduced levels of consciousness occur, discontinue PRIALT until the event resolves, and other etiologies (e.g., meningitis) must be considered. There is no known pharmacologic antagonist for this effect. Patients taking concomitant antiepileptics, neuroleptics, sedatives, or diuretics may be at higher risk of depressed levels of consciousness. If altered consciousness occurs, discontinue other CNS-depressant drugs as clinically appropriate.

5.4 Elevation of Serum Creatine Kinase

In clinical studies, 40% of PRIALT-treated patients had serum creatine kinase (CK) levels above the upper limit of normal (ULN), and 11% had CK levels that were greater than three times the ULN. In cases where CK was fractionated, only the muscle isoenzyme (MM) was elevated. The time to occurrence was sporadic, but the greatest incidence of CK elevation was during the first two months of treatment. One case of symptomatic myopathy with EMG findings, and two cases of acute renal failure associated with rhabdomyolysis and extreme CK elevations (17,000–27,000 IU/L) have been reported in PRIALT-treated patients.

Therefore, monitor serum CK in patients undergoing treatment with PRIALT periodically (e.g., every other week for the first month and monthly as appropriate thereafter). Evaluate patients clinically and obtain CK measurements in the setting of new neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., myalgias, myasthenia, muscle cramps, asthenia) or a reduction in physical activity. If these symptoms continue and CK levels remain elevated or continue to rise, reduce the dose or discontinue the use of PRIALT.

5.5 Withdrawal From Opiates

PRIALT is not an opiate and cannot prevent or relieve the symptoms associated with the withdrawal of opiates.

To avoid withdrawal syndrome when opiate withdrawal is necessary, do not abruptly reduce or withdraw opioid medications.

For patients being withdrawn from intrathecal opiates or intrathecal opiate infusion, gradually taper over a few weeks and replace with a pharmacologically equivalent dose of oral opiates.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^1123igWJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In postmarketing experience with ezetimibe, cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin prior to initiating ezetimibe. However, rhabdomyolysis has been reported with ezetimibe monotherapy and with the addition of ezetimibe to agents known to be associated with increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibric acid derivatives. Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets and a fenofibrate, if taking concomitantly, should both be immediately discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.

All patients starting therapy with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets or whose dose of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets is being increased should be advised of the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets. Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet therapy should be discontinued immediately if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when simvastatin treatment was promptly discontinued. Periodic CK determinations may be considered in patients starting therapy with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets or whose dose is being increased, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent myopathy.

### Muscle weakness with a hidden cause [^1157cM6m]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) represent a diverse group of systemic autoimmune disorders characterised by skeletal muscle weakness with variable clinical manifestations. Dermatomyositis (DM) is a heterogeneous IIM and is associated with progressive muscle weakness, with characteristic skin features, and with an increased risk of malignancy. Here, we report a previously healthy man in his early 40s who presented to the emergency department with a 14-day history of symmetric progressive proximal muscle weakness. Both upper arms were painful and swollen, and they displayed marked weakness in arm elevation. Climbing stairs was no longer possible due to muscle weakness and pain. A facial and truncal rash as well as periungual erythema were noted. Laboratory analysis revealed highly elevated creatine kinase. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of DM was confirmed. A comprehensive search for malignancy revealed a non-palpable pure seminoma. While DM as a paraneoplastic phenomenon of seminoma is extremely rare, our case underlines the importance of a thorough tumour search.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^113Seobx]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Statins (Hydroxymethylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase Inhibitors) — initiation, dosing, and safety in children and adolescents are summarized as follows: Statin therapy is recommended as the initial medication of choice for treating patients with sufficiently elevated LDL–C or non–HDL–C levels. Statin dose should begin with the lowest available dose given once daily, and if LDL–C target levels are not achieved with at least 3 months of compliant use, then the dose may be increased by one increment; pediatric trials of dose escalation reported no additional safety issues. Adverse effects from statins are rare at standard doses but include myopathy and hepatic enzyme elevation, and in the meta-analysis of statin use in children, evidence of hepatic enzyme elevation and muscle toxicity did not differ between statin and placebo groups. Myopathy — muscle pain and weakness with creatine kinase elevations more than 10 times the upper limits of normal range — typically occurs in fewer than 1 in 10,000 adult patients. Rhabdomyolysis, a very rare occurrence in adults on statin therapy reported at 3 per 100,000 person-years, did not occur in any of the pediatric trials.

### Expert perspective: diagnostic approach to differentiating juvenile dermatomyositis from muscular dystrophy [^1162BwK1]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A 4‐year‐old boy had 2 months of persistent fatigue, leg pain, inability to keep up with peers, and difficulty going up stairs. He exhibited an uncoordinated gait and inability to squat or rise from the ground but no joint swelling, tenderness, or rashes. His creatine kinase (CK) level was 1,681 units/L (upper limit of normal 257 units/L). He was referred to the Pediatric Neurology department to consider a muscular dystrophy (MD) diagnosis. Genetic testing for neuromuscular disorders revealed two variants of unknown significance. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the left pelvis and thigh demonstrated patchy T2 hyperintensity and enhancement with mild diffusion restriction and no atrophy or fatty replacement. His weakness progressed, and 6 months after symptom onset he was referred to the Pediatric Rheumatology department. Examination revealed a faint bilateral heliotrope rash and marked drop out, dilation, and hemorrhage of nailfold capillaries. His CK level remained elevated at 618 units/L, as did the aspartate aminotransferase, aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, von Willebrand factor antigen, and neopterin levels. Muscle biopsy showed perifascicular atrophy, increased major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC‐I) and myxovirus resistance A (MxA) expression, complement deposition in capillaries, and acute myopathic changes, including degeneration/regeneration, consistent with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). Myositis‐specific antibody testing was positive for anti–nuclear matrix protein 2 (NXP2). The patient was initiated on intravenous and oral corticosteroids, subcutaneous methotrexate, intravenous Ig, and physical therapy, leading to a recovery of muscle strength nearly 1 year after symptom onset.

### Severe proximal muscle weakness with normal CK as a presenting feature of ANCA-associated vasculitis [^113oyHng]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

The reason for the above clinicopathological discrepancy in muscle biopsy is unclear. Some suggest that muscle ischaemia is not seen in systemic vasculitis, possibly due to vascular compensation as opposed to patients with inflammatory myositis where there is complement-mediated lysis of endomysial capillaries, causing muscle necrosis.

Once the muscle weakness from systemic vasculitis is suspected, appropriate testing should be considered. Raised inflammatory markers is a universal feature. If the diagnosis is unclear after the initial work-up including a connective tissue screening, further testing including targeted MRI and muscle biopsies should be considered. An MRI scan earlier in the course of the disease is very useful for diagnosis, as well for targeting muscle biopsy when required. The T1-weighted sequence with gadolinium will show enhancement.T2-weighted hyperintensities will usually indicate increased muscle fluid content implying muscle oedema. However, these changes in MRI are non-specific as they can also be seen in myopathies from trauma, metabolic and degenerative diseases. Muscle pain and stiffness had been the predominant clinical feature in the PAN case series. In the reported PAN cases, CK levels are often normal or only slightly increased. MRI scans had a very high sensitivity in detecting muscle involvement in most of these cases.MRI scans can also be used for targeting muscle biopsy to an affected area of the muscle and also possibly to monitor disease activity. In patients with dermatomyositis and polymyositis, MRI scans have been shown to be a useful tool to assess the disease activity, guide muscle biopsy as well as to, follow-up patients with serial imaging to assess response to treatment. However, this needs further confirmation, especially in patients with ANCA vasculitis.

The use of PET-CT scans to assess disease activity is used widely in large vessel vasculitis. Several large studies have shown sensitivity and specificity up to 90% in patients with large-vessel vasculitis. The use of PET in small to medium vessel vasculitis (AAV) is controversial. Most of the available literature is focused on patients with GPA, where suggestive PET findings help make a diagnosis, but their use in other AAV is unknown. In a few studies, PET-CT was highly sensitive in detecting the active focus of inflammation even in patients without CRP rise or detectable ANCA levels. Although PET-CT scans are used in the diagnosis of inflammatory myositis, their use has not been studied in skeletal muscle vasculitis associated with AAV, possibly because muscle involvement from AAV is not widely recognised. In our patient PET uptake was not seen despite having florid vasculitis in the muscle biopsy.

### A rare form of dermatomyositis associated with muscle weakness and normal creatine kinase level [^114PAAMa]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Background

There is currently limited evidence on the mode of presentation, serological investigation and optimal treatment of newly described forms of clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM), which is associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD). This case study outlines the presentation, diagnosis and subsequent management of a patient admitted under the Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Epidemiology at Princess Alexandra Hospital.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1136KvSZ]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasize that chest pain means more than pain in the chest, and that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, whereas "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, structured risk assessment should be used and risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

### Myeloperoxidase-positive ANCA-associated vasculitis presenting as myalgia, proximal weakness and a normal CK [^114TYGph]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

We describe an unusual presentation of myeloperoxidase positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis managed by a multidisciplinary approach. A 75-year-old man gave a 3-week history of proximal lower limb weakness and exertional myalgia. His serum creatine kinase was normal and many of his non-specific symptoms suggested small vessel vasculitis. His investigations for common causes of muscle weakness were normal, and renal biopsy was normal despite haemoproteinuria. CT scan of the chest identified a pulmonary nodule of uncertain significance, not amenable to biopsy. MR scan of the thighs showed muscle oedema, and muscle biopsy confirmed typical features of vasculitis. Following high-dose corticosteroids his exertional myalgia quickly resolved and his normal mobility returned. Early immunosuppression is essential to improving clinical outcomes in ANCA-associated vasculitis, but diagnostic investigations often lack sensitivity.

### A rare form of dermatomyositis associated with muscle weakness and normal creatine kinase level [^111PzRuk]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

The patient's prognosis and level of functioning remain poor due to ongoing weakness, wasting and pain, which have proven refractory to current immunosuppressive treatment, despite some improvement in her skin disease. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) had been considered; however, the patient declined. Other treatment options such as rituximab and cyclophosphamide were not considered appropriate given her rapid deterioration, stable ILD and the development of infectious complications, including osteomyelitis in her right elbow, left distal third metacarpal and base of proximal phalanx of left middle finger related to infected skin ulcers.

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^113YLCmL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Concomitant intake of large quantities, more than 1.2 liters daily, of grapefruit juice is not recommended in patients taking amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

Discontinue amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets are discontinued. Temporarily discontinue amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the Amlodipine and atorvastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin ws administered. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, that persists despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets if IMNM is suspected.

### Mild creatine kinase elevations Do not necessarily reflect… [^111oin4n]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Having hyperCKemia, which is the elevation of creatine kinase found in the patients in the case series, does not necessarily reflect rhabdomyolysis in the absence of muscle symptoms. Only three out of 10 patients had myalgias, and only one presented with weakness; it is unclear if it was muscle weakness or generalized fatigue. Nine patients presented with coughing; therefore, it is more likely that the hyperCKemia resulted from overactivity of respiratory muscles than from myositis. HyperCKemia was mild, with maximal CK values of less than 10, 000 U per L in eight patients. Helpful information that would suggest that hyperCKemia originated from skeletal muscles includes the presence of dark urine and myoglobinuria. One patient presented with confusion, and it is crucial to exclude a cerebral cause of hyperCKemia for that patient.

COVID-19 can also be complicated by myocarditis, myocardial damage, including myocardial infarction and takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which may have been a source of hyperCKemia. In Reply: We appreciate the comments by Drs. Finsterer and Scorza. The classic triad of rhabdomyolysis symptoms is nonspecific and experienced by less than 10% of patients. More than 50% of patients do not complain of muscle pain or weakness. 1, 2 Plasma myoglobin is not as sensitive as CK for diagnosis because of a short half-life. Rhabdomyolysis does not always lead to visible myoglobinuria or may resolve early in the course of rhabdomyolysis. 1, 2 A systematic review found that in most studies, patients were diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis based on CK levels five times the upper limit of normal.

In all the patients, CK level was obtained at presentation to the hospital, suggesting a temporal relationship between COVID-19 and rhabdomyolysis. None of the patients had a history of or presented with alcohol or substance misuse, trauma, or exertion. Case 4 had a known history of seizures and was taking antiseizure medications.

### Signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis… [^114ij2Pr]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The main rhabdomyolysis symptoms are muscle pain, dark urine, and feeling weak or tired.
- Seek medical attention immediately if you experience any symptoms.
- Rhabdo symptoms can mimic other conditions like heat cramps and dehydration.
- A healthcare provider can perform a specific blood test to determine if you have rhabdo. Signs and symptoms It's important to learn the signs and symptoms of rhabdo that may be present. Learning the symptoms can help you figure out if you or someone else needs to seek medical attention. If you develop rhabdo, you might have one or more of these symptoms: Muscle cramps, aches, or painsthat are more severe than expected Dark urine Feeling weak or tired, unable to complete tasks or finish a workout you were able to do previously. When will symptoms appear. Symptoms of rhabdo may not begin until hours or days after the initial muscle injury.

For some people, symptoms might not start to appear until several days after the initial injury. Seek medical care immediately If you have any of these symptoms at any time, do not ignore them. Seek medical treatment right away. Earlier diagnosis means an earlier start to treatment and a greater chance of recovery without permanent health effects. Blood tests for rhabdo Repeated blood tests for the muscle protein creatine kinase are the only accurate test for rhabdo. If you suspect that you may have rhabdo, ask a healthcare provider to check your CK levels with a blood test.
- CK enters the bloodstream when muscle tissue is damaged.
- When rhabdo is present, CK levels will rise. You will need repeat blood tests to determine if CK levels are going up or down:

- Like symptoms, the rise in CK may not appear right away.
- Test CK levels until 2 consecutive tests show levels lowering.

Urine tests are not accurate Urine dipstick tests are not a good way to diagnose rhabdo.
- These tests check for myoglobin indirectly.
- Myoglobin quickly clears from the body so it may not show up in urine.
- High CK levels in the blood may persist for days.

### The diagnostic value of serum creatine kinase in neuromuscular and muscular disease… [^1111EWVX]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Serum creatine kinase activity in 200 patients was studied in order to check whether this determination might be of help in differential diagnosis between primary and secondary myopathies. Elevated CK values are found physiologically in children, pregnant women, and after exercise. In pathological states increased serum enzyme concentrations are constantly present in the Duchenne type of progressive muscular dystrophy. More variable values are encountered in other types of muscular dystrophy and in metabolic disorders like Refsum's syndrome, coproporphyria, and hypothyroidism. In states of necrosis or injury to muscle cells like in polymyositis, dermatomyositis, after burns or trauma, serum CK concentrations vary according partly to the amount of muscle mass involved. Enzyme concentrations can be markedly increased after tetany or epileptic seizures.

Normal values or occasionally slightly increased values are found in neurogenic myopathies. High CK values in patients with muscular atrophies should permit the clinician to exclude the differential diagnostic group of neurogenic myopathies. As a diagnostic tool CK proved to be more reliable than transaminases or lactic dehydrogenase because of its higher muscle specificity and a slightly greater sensitivity. Comments.
