## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which counseling statement is correct for a 43-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis who wants to become pregnant, specifically regarding symptom remission during pregnancy, the need to avoid methotrexate, and the safety of prednisone use in pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the evidence on how often RA improves during pregnancy. Then, I should verify the teratogenicity of methotrexate and the recommended preconception washout period. Next, I will check whether prednisone is safe in pregnancy and at what doses. Finally, I will synthesize which option is accurate and consistent with current guidelines, noting any nuances that could change the answer if the question were phrased differently.

> Let me first confirm the disease activity question. The traditional teaching that RA remits in most pregnancies has been refined by prospective data. A systematic review and meta-analysis using objective measures found improvement in about 60% of patients during pregnancy, with a substantial postpartum flare rate, which is notably lower than the 70% figure often cited from older, retrospective series, so I should be cautious about overestimating remission rates here [^113WgkYu] [^116H9YmG] [^1129hxQ5].

> Wait, let me verify the methotrexate point. Methotrexate is teratogenic and contraindicated in pregnancy. Authoritative guidance recommends stopping methotrexate for at least 3 months before conception and using folic acid supplementation during the washout, with some gastroenterology guidance extending to 6 months, so advising avoidance of pregnancy while taking methotrexate is appropriate and aligns with best practice for preconception planning [^114YVp5F] [^117QUva4] [^114R4DfY].

> Hold on, I should verify the prednisone statement. Prednisone and other nonfluorinated glucocorticoids are not absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy; in fact, low-dose prednisone (generally ≤ 10 mg/day) can be continued when clinically indicated, with guidelines recommending tapering higher doses to below 20 mg/day and substituting steroid-sparing agents if prolonged higher-dose therapy is needed, so saying prednisone cannot be taken during pregnancy is incorrect [^111w7qrK] [^114T1Xv8].

> I will now examine the answer choices against this. Option A claims 70% remission, which overstates the best prospective estimate of about 60% improvement, so A is too high. Option B correctly advises avoiding pregnancy while taking methotrexate, consistent with guideline-directed preconception management. Option C incorrectly asserts prednisone cannot be used in pregnancy, contradicting current guidance that allows low-dose use with appropriate monitoring. Option D combines A and B; since A is overstated, D cannot be correct even though B is right [^113WgkYu] [^114YVp5F] [^111w7qrK].

> But wait, what if the question intended to reflect older retrospective data suggesting 70% improvement? Even then, contemporary prospective evidence using validated disease activity tools shows improvement closer to 60%, so choosing the most current, guideline-aligned figure is the safer clinical answer, and it still leaves B as the only fully accurate statement among the options provided [^113WgkYu] [^116H9YmG].

> Final answer: B. She should avoid pregnancy while taking methotrexate, because methotrexate is teratogenic and should be stopped for at least 3 months before conception with folic acid supplementation during the washout period, whereas prednisone can be used at low doses in pregnancy when indicated and the best estimate of pregnancy-related improvement is about 60%, not 70% [^114YVp5F] [^117QUva4] [^111w7qrK] [^113WgkYu].

---

The correct answer is **B. She should avoid pregnancy while taking methotrexate** [^114YVp5F] because methotrexate is teratogenic and must be stopped at least 3 months before conception [^114R4DfY]. Option A is incorrect; while RA often improves in pregnancy, **only about 60% improve** [^113WgkYu], not 70%. Option C is incorrect; prednisone is compatible with pregnancy at low doses (≤ 10 mg/day) [^111w7qrK] when clinically indicated. Therefore, the correct counseling is that methotrexate should be stopped before conception, and prednisone can be continued if needed.

---

## Disease activity during pregnancy

Regarding disease activity during pregnancy, **improvement during pregnancy** occurs in about 60% of women with RA, with a mean reduction in DAS28-CRP of 0.5–1.0, whereas 40% have stable or worsening disease [^113WgkYu]. Postpartum flare is common, with **postpartum flare** occurring in about 47% of women, typically within 3–6 months after delivery [^113WgkYu].

---

## Medication safety during pregnancy

### Methotrexate

For methotrexate, **teratogenicity** is well established; it is contraindicated in pregnancy due to risks of spontaneous abortion, congenital anomalies, and neurodevelopmental delay [^114YVp5F]. Preconception counseling should include stopping methotrexate at least 3 months before conception and using reliable contraception during therapy [^114YVp5F].

---

### Prednisone

For prednisone, **safety at low doses** (≤ 10 mg/day) is supported; it is considered compatible with pregnancy when clinically indicated [^111w7qrK]. Risks at higher doses include increased risks of gestational diabetes, hypertension, and infection; taper to the lowest effective dose when possible [^114T1Xv8].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Medication** | **Pregnancy compatibility** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Methotrexate | Contraindicated | Stop ≥ 3 months before conception [^114R4DfY] |
| Prednisone | Compatible at low doses | Continue ≤ 10 mg/day if clinically indicated [^111w7qrK] |

---

## Clinical implications and counseling

Preconception planning should prioritize achieving **low disease activity** before conception to improve maternal and fetal outcomes [^113svaL5]. Multidisciplinary care involving rheumatology, obstetrics, and maternal-fetal medicine is recommended for optimal management [^113svaL5].

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **B. She should avoid pregnancy while taking methotrexate** because methotrexate is teratogenic and must be stopped at least 3 months before conception. Prednisone can be continued at low doses if clinically indicated, and RA symptoms improve in about 60% of pregnancies — not 70%.

Overview of studies describing improvement of RA symptoms during pregnancy and relapse after delivery

These high remission or improvement rates need to be interpreted with caution, as the data mostly come from small retrospective analyses that use various definitions of disease activity and clinical amelioration, often rely on patients' recall of symptoms, and sometimes fail to use validated clinical measurements of disease activity. Pregnancy itself has been shown to influence the measurement of disease activity. In a comparison of different disease activity scoring tools in pregnant women with RA vs healthy controls, 28-joint DAS (DAS-28)-CRP without assessment of global health was the preferred tool for measuring RA disease activity in pregnant patients.

In the UK, a nationwide prospective study of 140 pregnant women with RA, recruited during pregnancy and followed until 6 months post-partum, reported improvement in joint swelling and pain in about two-thirds of patients, although the extent of improvement was limited, with only 16% of women reaching remission during pregnancy. More recent prospective studies using validated clinical tools to measure RA disease activity confirmed the improvement of RA during pregnancy and increased risk of flares post-partum, but the extent of improvement was smaller than in earlier studies. Ostensen et al. reported a decrease in disease activity during pregnancy, measured with several validated clinical tools [swollen joint count, RA disease activity index (RADAI) score and HAQ] in a small group of 10 RA patients. The Dutch Pregnancy-induced Amelioration of Rheumatoid Arthritis (PARA) study prospectively evaluated disease activity using DAS-28-CRP-3 in RA patients fulfilling the ACR criteria for RA and recruited between 2002 and 2006. Mean disease activity scores significantly decreased during pregnancy and increased post-partum. Overall, 39% of patients improved during pregnancy, mirrored by flares observed in 38% of patients from 12 to 26 weeks post-partum. The highest impact on disease activity was observed in patients with moderate or high disease activity in the first trimester. Improvement of RA was observed despite the concomitant reduction of drug therapy: MTX, LEF and biologicals were not used at all during pregnancy in this study.

### Clinical updates in women's health care summary: arthritis [^111T366x]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Arthritis is a commonly encountered problem in daily clinical practice, and with an aging population it will be as prevalent as any other chronic illness, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Obstetrician-gynecologists often encounter patients with arthritic symptoms in their practices. They may find it challenging to identify the underlying cause of arthritis and provide recommendations, as well as provide obstetric care to patients with known arthritis. The monograph will discuss common forms of arthritis, diagnostic testing and appropriate management, and referral of patients who need specialized care. Commonly encountered forms of inflammatory arthritis are discussed in this monograph with special emphasis on diagnosis and management. Management of arthritis in the context of pregnancy and lactation also is discussed.

### Management of pregnancy in autoimmune rheumatic diseases: maternal disease course, gestational and neonatal outcomes and use of medications in the prospectiveItalian P-RHEUM.it study [^113k6dE4]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Over decades, 'Reproductive Rheumatology' has tackled research in a sensitive field. It has been highly challenging to perform randomised clinical trials in pregnant women, because of regulatory issues, difficulty in getting dedicated funding and the need for a multicentre international approach to reach sufficient numbers. As a consequence, there is a lack of unbiased, rigorous studies that can drive clinical decisions. Prospective studies and registries have contributed to filling the gap, showing that pregnancy is possible in women with ARD and discussion about it should be embraced rather than discouraged.

The P-RHEUM.it study has captured the real-world experience in the management of pregnancy in a large cohort of women with different ARD. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were overall good, suggesting that a set of measures can work as a 'toolkit' in the approach to pregnancy. These measures include multidisciplinary preconception counselling and pregnancy monitoring, and individual risk stratification for a tailored approach that aims at inactive disease while on pregnancy-compatible medications. The most sensitive indicator of the effectiveness of these interventions is the alignment of the frequency of most complications and outcomes to that of the GOP. This can be an important reassuring message to women with ARD, as well as a strong incentive to comply with treatment and monitoring plan in order to minimise the impact of the disease on pregnancy outcomes.

However, there is still much to be addressed to improve the reproductive journey of women with ARD. The P-RHEUM.it study will dissect disease-specific issues to better understand the impact of current rheumatology management and to plan for additional interventions and/or changes in practice. It will also bring the emotional well-being of the patient into the spotlight by analysing the QoL and the risk of mental health distress, along with data about children's conditions in the first 2 years of life, which is a frequently-asked-question by the patients.

Chronic rheumatic disease may interfere with procreation in women of childbearing age. Female patients should have counseling in regard to family planning and parenting. Preconception counseling requires risk assessment of possible maternal or fetal risks, screening for biomarkers with predictive value for adverse pregnancy outcomes, adjustment of therapy, and a schedule for monitoring and follow-up during pregnancy. Delivering comprehensive information and addressing all patient concerns are both essential for enabling patients to engage actively in decision making.

Recommendation strength definitions and good practice statements are described as follows: A strong recommendation suggests that most informed patients would choose the recommended management. While usually reflecting a higher level of evidence, it may also reflect the severity of a potential negative outcome. A conditional recommendation suggests that choice will vary with individual values and preferences. Conditional recommendations generally reflect a lack of data, limited data, or conflicting data that lead to uncertainty. Finally, good practice statements are those for which indirect evidence is sufficiently compelling that a formal vote is unnecessary. They are presented as "suggestions" rather than formal recommendations.

Disease activity during pregnancy

Previous retrospective studies, mainly based on patients' self-reports and conducted in a period of limited treatment options, demonstrated that disease activity improved during pregnancy in the majority of women affected by rheumatoid arthritis. More recently, prospective studies have shown that these patients not only achieve disease remission during pregnancy less frequently, but also have less improvement in disease activity during pregnancy than previously thought. In 2008, de Man et al showed that the proportion of women with at least moderate disease activity (DAS 28 > 3,2) during pregnancy was about 40%. During the third trimester, only 27% were in complete remission (DAS 28 < 2.6) and consequently had a significant reduction in drug prescriptions. During post-partum period, 39% of women had increased disease activity but only 4% had a severe flare. No profound effect of pregnancy on ankylosing spondylitis disease activity was described, even if some prospective studies proved disease worsening during the first and early second trimester of gestation and after delivery. Few papers are published about the course of psoriatic arthritis during gestation. Available reports seem to support an amelioration of disease activity during pregnancy.

Conventional medications — prednisone is guided to "Taper to < 20 mg/day by adding pregnancy-compatible immunosuppressants" before conception and during pregnancy, and for breastfeeding "After a dose of > 20 mg, delay breastfeeding for 4 hours"; cyclosporine and tacrolimus entries advise to "Monitor blood pressure"; for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors not preferred), the table directs "Discontinue if the woman is having difficulty conceiving", to "Continue in first and second trimesters; discontinue in third trimester", and notes "Ibuprofen preferred" for breastfeeding.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of reproductive health in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases [^1117G7fw]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Reproductive planning and medication management in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) emphasizes early involvement, contraception, and medication compatibility. Almost half of pregnancies in the US are unplanned, and in RMD patients unplanned pregnancies carry greater risk than do planned pregnancies in periods of low disease activity treated with compatible medications. Whether considering pregnancy or not, patients should know maternal and fetal risks and their safest and most effective contraception options. New information supports a shift from the paradigm of discontinuing all RMD medications except prednisone, since pregnancy-compatible steroid-sparing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologic agents pose fewer short- and long-term risks to the mother and infant. With adequate planning, treatment, and monitoring, most women with RMD can have successful pregnancies, and recent data indicate compatibility of many rheumatology medications both with lactation and with paternal use.

### Active counselling and well-controlled disease result in a higher percentage of women with rheumatoid arthritis that breast feed: results from the preCARA study [^113WxyFn]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The advantages of breast feeding over formula feeding have been demonstrated in many studies. These benefits of breast feeding are even more pronounced in children with low birth weight.

Previous research has demonstrated that women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are less likely to breast feed. The main reason for discontinuing breast feeding was the restart of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Importantly, in women with RA, high disease activity during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight. Additionally, such women are less likely to breast feed.

The treatment options for RA that are compatible with breast feeding have increased and now include tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. Additionally, the importance of counselling on pregnancy and lactation is recognised.

It is currently unknown if patients with RA who underwent pregnancy counselling and were treated according to a modern treatment approach, with the use of TNF inhibitors, are more likely to breast feed. The primary aim of this study was to investigate breast feeding among women with RA who benefit from these developments.

### Antirheumatic drugs and reproduction in women and men with chronic arthritis [^117FyAyr]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

The impact of rheumatic disease on fertility and reproduction can be remarkable. Many disease-related factors can influence patients' sexual functioning, perturb fertility and limit family planning. Antirheumatic pharmacological treatment can also have a crucial role in this field. Proper counselling, preferably provided by a multidisciplinary team of rheumatologists, obstetricians, gynaecologists and neonatologists, is recommended for patients taking antirheumatic drugs, not only at the beginning, but also during the course of treatment. Paternal exposure to antirheumatic drugs was not found to be specifically associated with congenital malformation and adverse pregnancy outcome, therefore discontinuation of these drugs while planning for conception should be weighed against the risk of disease flare. Drugs in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) category 'X' should be withdrawn in a timely manner in women who desire a pregnancy. Meanwhile, disease control can be achieved with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α agents, which are not teratogenic drugs. If maternal disease control is permissive, they can be stopped as soon as the pregnancy test turns positive and be resumed during pregnancy in case of a flare.

### Contraception and pregnancy counselling in rheumatoid arthritis [^112PfNzW]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this study is to encourage discussion of reproduction issues in all patients of fertile age in order to prevent unplanned and ill-timed pregnancies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Recent Findings

Counselling patients who desire children requires consideration of relevant reproductive health issues, including fertility, interaction of pregnancy and RA, and management during pregnancy and lactation. RA patients have no disease-related restrictions in regard to contraception, but need to be counselled on safe birth control particularly during treatment with potentially teratogenic drugs. In spite of mostly beneficial effects of pregnancy on RA, active disease and aggressive drug treatment can impair pregnancy outcomes. Options for drug therapy, though limited, may help to maintain low disease activity during pregnancy and lactation.

Summary

Careful preconception counselling and risk assessment is important in RA women, with a particular focus on preventing unplanned pregnancy by information on contraception. Antibody status and all medications need to be reviewed before pregnancy. Maintaining low disease activity before and during pregnancy is crucial for good outcomes. Preconceptional counselling shared with all health professionals engaged in the care of a patient helps to ensure healthy pregnancy outcomes for mother and child.

American College of Rheumatology reproductive health — emergency contraception: We strongly recommend discussing use of emergency contraception with all patients, including those with SLE or positive aPL, because risks of emergency contraception are low compared to those of unplanned pregnancy; levonorgestrel, the over-the-counter option, is widely available and has no medical contraindications to use, including thrombophilia.

### Increasing contraception use among women receiving teratogenic medications in a rheumatology clinic [^114HRa51]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

It is estimated that 5.8% of all pregnancies in the USA are exposed to category D or X medications, although the specific rate for rheumatology patients is unknown. An estimated half of all pregnancies in are unplanned, meaning that many women are at risk for pregnancy even when they are not trying to conceive. Unfortunately, women with SLE and RA have been shown to be less likely to use contraception compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, rheumatology patients reporting contraception use have been found to practice methods with a high failure rate, such as natural family planning or barrier methods alone. Inadequate or ineffective contraception places women who are on teratogenic medications at higher risk for both pregnancy loss and offspring with birth defects.

Given the risk for fetal harm, experts have identified contraception counselling as crucial to the management of patients receiving teratogenic medications. Gillis et al published the quality indicator statement related to the care of patients with SLE: 'IF a woman between 18 and 45 years of age is started on a medication for SLE (eg, methotrexate (MTX), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), leflunomide (LEF) or cyclophosphamide (CYC)), THEN a discussion with the patient about the potential teratogenic risks of therapy and about contraception should be documented prior to drug initiation, unless the patient is unable to conceive (eg, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, tubal ligation or postmenopausal), BECAUSE these drugs either have teratogenic potential or pose an unknown risk to the developing fetus'. A similar quality measure statement was published by the Arthritis Foundation in 2004 for women with RA. Studies in patients with SLE reveal that one-third to one-half of patients do not report or do not have documented discussions regarding potential pregnancy risks with initiation of teratogenic medications. Lack of adherence to suggested quality measures places our patients at increased risk of harm, but also presents an opportunity for QI.

Pregnancy medication management — nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and calcineurin inhibitors: We conditionally recommend calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine) and NSAIDs as compatible for use during pregnancy. We conditionally recommend discontinuation of NSAIDs pre-conception if the patient is having difficulty conceiving (and if disease control would not be compromised). We strongly recommend against use of NSAIDs in the third trimester because of the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. We conditionally recommend nonselective NSAIDs over cyclooxygenase 2–specific inhibitors in the first 2 trimesters, due to lack of data on cyclooxygenase 2–specific inhibitors.

### Pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatoid arthritis: an 11-year French nationwide study [^111sWuEN]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This large-scale population-based study shows that in the era of targeted therapies, pregnancies in women with RA remain associated with more adverse outcomes than pregnancies in women without RA, especially if the disease is active during but also before pregnancy. These findings highlight the importance of preconception counselling and pregnancy planning in these women and should encourage physicians to optimise the monitoring of RA activity throughout pregnancy.

### Disease activity or remission of rheumatoid arthritis before, during and following pregnancy [^113v3P5w]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can ameliorate spontaneously during pregnancy; however, adequate measurement of disease activity during pregnancy is a challenge, as is quantifying disease improvement during pregnancy and disease flare postpartum. Adverse pregnancy outcomes may be related to high disease activity during pregnancy, the full extent of which remains to be fully defined.

Recent Findings

Disease activity might best be measured during pregnancy with DAS28-CRP without visual analogue scale (VAS) general health. Pregnancy outcome seems to be worse in patients with RA compared with healthy controls. High disease activity of RA may contribute importantly both to the longer time to conceive and worse pregnancy outcome.

Summary

Low disease activity of RA before, during and after pregnancy may be best for both mother and child. Counselling of patients on reproductive health and preconception treat-to-target management may help to achieve lower disease activity. This may result in better pregnancy outcomes.

Non–TNF biologics and rituximab — periconception and pregnancy: There are limited data on the compatibility of other biologics with pregnancy; given likely placental transfer timing, the panel conditionally recommends that non–TNF inhibitor IgG-based molecules are compatible in the periconception period but should be discontinued during pregnancy (i.e. at the time of the first positive pregnancy test result). We conditionally recommend continuing treatment with anakinra, belimumab, abatacept, tocilizumab, secukinumab, and ustekinumab while a woman is trying to conceive, but discontinuing once she is found to be pregnant. We conditionally recommend continuing treatment with rituximab while a woman is trying to conceive, and we conditionally recommend continuing rituximab during pregnancy if severe life- or organ-threatening maternal disease so warrants; dosing in the second half of pregnancy puts the fetus at high risk of having minimal B cells at delivery.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of reproductive health in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases [^1118shSQ]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop an evidence-based guideline on contraception, assisted reproductive technologies (ART), fertility preservation with gonadotoxic therapy, use of menopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT), pregnancy assessment and management, and medication use in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease (RMD).

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of evidence relating to contraception, ART, fertility preservation, HRT, pregnancy and lactation, and medication use in RMD populations, using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology to rate the quality of evidence and a group consensus process to determine final recommendations and grade their strength (conditional or strong). Good practice statements were agreed upon when indirect evidence was sufficiently compelling that a formal vote was unnecessary.

Results

This American College of Rheumatology guideline provides 12 ungraded good practice statements and 131 graded recommendations for reproductive health care in RMD patients. These recommendations are intended to guide care for all patients with RMD, except where indicated as being specific for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, those positive for antiphospholipid antibody, and/or those positive for anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB antibodies. Recommendations and good practice statements support several guiding principles: use of safe and effective contraception to prevent unplanned pregnancy, pre-pregnancy counseling to encourage conception during periods of disease quiescence and while receiving pregnancy-compatible medications, and ongoing physician-patient discussion with obstetrics/gynecology collaboration for all reproductive health issues, given the overall low level of available evidence that relates specifically to RMD.

Conclusion

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations developed and reviewed by panels of experts and RMD patients. Many recommendations are conditional, reflecting a lack of data or low-level data. We intend that this guideline be used to inform a shared decision-making process between patients and their physicians on issues related to reproductive health that incorporates patients' values, preferences, and comorbidities.

### Medication decision making under uncertainty: considering chronic disease and pregnancy potential [^115WKbwv]. Seminars in Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

People with chronic illness who are (or could become) pregnant and their clinicians may face difficult decisions about the use of medications that can affect fetal health and development. In these situations, people must make the choice whether to use a drug with limited information about teratogenicity to treat their illness, putting an existing or potential pregnancy at risk. This manuscript serves as a call to action for all clinicians whose patients face such treatment choices regarding teratogenic medications or medications with unknown fetal safety. It offers an approach to guiding patient-provider conversations on medication management for individuals who are or might become pregnant, grounded in a review of the existing literature on medication decision making for drugs with known or potential teratogenic properties and informed by the current tools available for offering decision support. As a case study for highlighting current challenges and potential solutions around safe prescribing, we focus on two systemic autoimmune and rheumatic diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, which disproportionately affect females compared to males (with incidence ratios of 9:1 and 3:1, respectively). We address how recent reproductive policy changes that restrict abortion access may affect both a provider and a patient's decision calculus. Finally, we highlight several gaps that could be addressed by future research and the implementation of new data collection practices by federal bodies, while offering an approach to optimize patient-provider communication under conditions of ongoing uncertainty around the safety of drugs for those who may become pregnant while using them.

Medication use during breastfeeding: The benefits of breastfeeding are numerous; the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months and continued breastfeeding until 1 year. Because women with RMD may experience disease flare post partum and require treatment, it is important to balance benefits of disease control with risk of infant exposure through breast milk, and infant serum levels of drugs ingested by the mother depend on drug concentration in breast milk, quantity of breast milk ingested, and drug absorption through the infant's gastrointestinal tract.

### Subfertility in women with rheumatoid arthritis and the outcome of fertility assessments [^116pgw8Z]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). Low credibility.

Reproductive history

Of the participants, 170 women (96%) had ended their efforts to establish a pregnancy. Reasons to stop trying to conceive were (multiple answers per subject possible): a complete family (72%), advanced age (20%), increase of RA symptoms or the need for antirheumatic drugs incompatible with pregnancy (together 19%), other health problems that complicated conception, or taking care of a child (3%). In 9 women (5%) there were no more fertility treatments available or their gynecologist advised against a new pregnancy. In 3% the mental burden of the wish to conceive was a reason to end their attempts at pregnancy, and in 1% relational problems played a role. In total, 28% ended their efforts before they felt their family was complete. Fifty‐nine women (33%) put their efforts to conceive on hold for 1 or more intervals, and in 32% this was due to RA symptoms or the need for antirheumatic drugs incompatible with pregnancy.

The participants had a total of 412 pregnancies, with a median of 2 pregnancies (interquartile range [IQR] 2–3, mean ± SD 2.3 ± 1.0) per woman. Of all reported pregnancies, 354 pregnancies (86%) were conceived after a diagnosis of RA. Thirty‐three percent of the women had 1 or more miscarriages (median 0, IQR 0–1, mean ± SD 0.42 ± 0.69). The total number of miscarriages was 75. There were 334 live‐born children in the study population (median 2, IQR 1–2, mean ± SD 1.9 ± 0.78 per woman), with a maximum of 4 children per woman. Nine women (5%) remained nulliparous, of whom 6 (3% of participants) had never been pregnant, and 3 women (2%) had only had pregnancies resulting in a miscarriage.

### Antirheumatic drugs and reproduction in women and men with chronic arthritis [^113iMGEq]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

The impact of rheumatic disease on fertility and reproduction can be remarkable. Many disease-related factors can influence patients' sexual functioning, perturb fertility and limit family planning. Antirheumatic pharmacological treatment can also have a crucial role in this field. Proper counselling, preferably provided by a multidisciplinary team of rheumatologists, obstetricians, gynaecologists and neonatologists, is recommended for patients taking antirheumatic drugs, not only at the beginning, but also during the course of treatment. Paternal exposure to antirheumatic drugs was not found to be specifically associated with congenital malformation and adverse pregnancy outcome, therefore discontinuation of these drugs while planning for conception should be weighed against the risk of disease flare. Drugs in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) category 'X' should be withdrawn in a timely manner in women who desire a pregnancy. Meanwhile, disease control can be achieved with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α agents, which are not teratogenic drugs. If maternal disease control is permissive, they can be stopped as soon as the pregnancy test turns positive and be resumed during pregnancy in case of a flare.

### Rheumatologic manifestations of pregnancy [^114QPgKT]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Pregnancy, whether normal or complicated, induces change in nearly every system of the body. Because most rheumatologic disorders are multisystemic and often affect young women, it may be difficult to differentiate pregnancy-related change from new onset or exacerbation of rheumatic disease. Familiarity with common manifestations of pregnancy is important in evaluating young women of childbearing age, whether or not they have known rheumatologic disease. Presentation of new connective tissue disease during pregnancy is often associated with poorer prognosis, so it is especially important to distinguish between pregnancy-induced change and true autoimmune inflammation requiring prompt and aggressive therapy.

### Use of biologics during pregnancy among patients with autoimmune conditions [^1137PQcF]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does use of biologics for 7 diverse autoimmune conditions change during pregnancy?

Findings

In this cohort study of 6131 individuals with an autoimmune condition and prepregnancy (prior 6 months) biologic use, 71.6% continued use at least once during pregnancy. Individuals with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis were more likely to continue use during pregnancy compared with individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, while patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis were less likely to continue.

Meaning

The use of biologics during pregnancy is associated with the underlying autoimmune condition, suggesting perceived or true variability in risks and benefits.

### Rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy: evolution of disease activity and pathophysiological considerations for drug use [^112kZEuE]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Apart from the VACTERL controversy, accumulating data on anti-TNF treatment in RA during pregnancy has not yielded any indications of teratogenicity or adverse outcomes. Although the indications that anti-TNF therapy is not teratogenic are growing as the number of pregnancies exposed to anti-TNF during preconception and early pregnancy increases, experience with anti-TNF therapy in pregnant arthritis patients is still quite limited.

Probably rheumatologists can learn from the more extensive experience with anti-TNF treatment during pregnancy that exists already for IBD. In the latter disease context, the need for effective treatment during pregnancy is higher than in RA, because IBD disease activity is less suppressed by pregnancy. Additionally, the abdominal location of the disease raises the stakes of maintaining disease remission during pregnancy in IBD, as IBD disease flares during pregnancy carry a high risk of adverse birth outcomes, including prematurity, low birthweight and congenital abnormalities. These considerations have prompted gastroenterologists to build more extensive experience with anti-TNF treatment during pregnancy. A number of studies report intentional use of anti-TNF treatment during pregnancy, and the 2010 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines state that 'medical treatment for Crohn's disease (except methotrexate) should generally continue during pregnancy, because the benefits outweigh the risk of medication'.

Although experience is still limited, the fact that anti-TNF antibodies do not cross the placenta in the first trimester of pregnancy together with the overall unremarkable outcome of pregnancies in women treated with TNF inhibitors lead us to the opinion that TNF blockers can be useful in RA patients to keep disease activity under control in the preconception period after withdrawal of teratogenic DMARDs and in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Abatacept

Abatacept is a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) human immunoglobulin fusion protein that selectively blocks T-cell co-stimulation through the CD80/CD86 pathway. Abatacept crosses the placenta, but animal studies with abatacept have revealed no congenital abnormalities. Human pregnancy data are still lacking. Hence this drug received an FDA Category C classification and it is advised to discontinue therapy for 10 weeks before conception. Since no data are available currently on the secretion of abatacept into milk, breastfeeding is contraindicated during abatacept treatment.

### Rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy: impediments to optimal management of both biologic use before, during and after pregnancy [^117EkwP5]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) and other biologic response modifiers are being increasingly used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) among women of childbearing age, raising concerns regarding the potential safety of inadvertent or intentional exposure of these agents to the developing fetus.

Recent Findings

TNFi and other biologics whose constructs contain a functional IgGFc piece are actively transported across the placenta during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Very little drug passively diffuses to the fetal circulation during the first trimester, when organogenesis occurs. Cumulative data from both the rheumatology and gastroenterology literature suggest that the rate of birth defects following antenatal TNFi exposure does not appear to be higher than that seen in the general population. There are very little data available on pregnancy outcomes following antenatal exposure to other biologic medications for RA.

Summary

Cumulative evidence suggests that TNFi use during pregnancy carries low risk for teratogenicity. A single case of fatal BCG infection in an exposed neonate following live virus vaccination highlights the potential need to defer live virus vaccines for at least 6 months in exposed neonates until more data of risk factors for infection susceptibility are available.

### Rheumatologic medication use during pregnancy [^115jPE9W]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic rheumatic diseases often occur in women of reproductive age, and the effect rheumatic disease has on pregnancy varies depending on the condition. Medical management of rheumatic diseases during pregnancy may prevent joint or organ damage and minimize the adverse effects of the disease itself on pregnancy outcomes. Each patient requires individual assessment to control disease activity while minimizing or avoiding medications with potential maternal or fetal toxicity. An open discussion with shared decision making between patients, obstetricians, rheumatologists, and pharmacists is imperative to create an individualized treatment plan that meets patients' goals. This article will review the current literature for use of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics during pregnancy and lactation, providing health care professionals with the most up-to-date information available.

### Preconceptional counselling in active rheumatoid arthritis… [^1137XgHL]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

The PARA-study reconfirmed previous data that RA improved during pregnancy. However, it also showed that this improvement was less pronounced than previously thought since > 50% of RA-patients still had active disease during third trimester of pregnancy. It also demonstrated that active RA was associated with lower birth weight and that children of mothers with active RA demonstrated rapid catch up growth in weight. Lower birth weight as well as rapid catch up growth in weight have been shown to be associated with a less favorable cardiovascular profile in early adulthood. Finally, it showed that time to pregnancy is prolonged in RA-patients with active disease. Also the use of prednisone > 7, 5 mg daily or the use of NSAIDs were associated with a prolonged time to pregnancy. These latter associations were independent of disease activity.

The findings of the PARA-study implicate that one should strive for low disease activity in women with RA and a pregnancy wish, but that in the meantime NSAIDs and doses of prednisone exceeding 7. 5 mg daily should be avoided. Since common drugs to treat RA, like methotrexate, are incompatible with pregnancy, lowering disease activity in pregnant RA-patients or with a pregnancy wish becomes a real challenge for the patient and the treating physician. This all underscores the importance of new treatment modalities for RA-patients with a pregnancy wish. Animal reproduction studies fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, and adequate, but well-controlled, studies of pregnant women have not been conducted). Registry studies show that anti-TNF use seems to be safe during pregnancy in humans also. Furthermore, anti-TNF therapy has been used intentionally preconceptionally to improve the chance of pregnancies in women with recurrent spontaneous abortions.

Since no randomized controlled trials can be done during pregnancy, circumstantial evidence has led to decision making in daily practice. In case of high disease activity use of anti-TNF to control disease activity outweighs the risk of potential harm to the foetus. The treatment strategy is based on deliberate treatment decisions to lower disease activity, including the continuation or start of biological treatment, based on a standard care protocol in the Erasmus MC. The second objective is to evaluate the safety of the use of anti-TNF during in women with any chronic arthritide who require the use of this medication preconceptionally and/or during pregnancy.

### Rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy: evolution of disease activity and pathophysiological considerations for drug use [^114WXWyj]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Apart from the use of more objective disease activity measurements and elimination of recall bias, the fact that treatment options for RA have substantially improved over the past decade offers an additional explanation why recent prospective studies yield lower improvement rates than older retrospective studies. Better disease control before conception obviously leaves less room for pregnancy-associated amelioration.

Pregnancy not only mitigates disease activity in RA patients, but also decreases the risk for RA onset. According to Lansink et al. this protective effect lasts until the first 3 months post-partum, whereas other studies observed a higher risk to develop RA in the first 6 months or the first year post-partum. A Norwegian registry study found a peak RA incidence in the first 2 years after delivery. Women who have ever been pregnant have an almost 2-fold lower risk of getting RA, and a better outcome if they do get RA. Additionally, multiple pregnancies may have a slightly beneficial effect on the long-term disease outcome of RA, with slightly fewer erosions and better functional level.

Except for a slight decrease in fecundity and a modest risk of prematurity and low birthweight in patients with highly active disease, the course and outcome of pregnancy in RA patients are generally favourable. In the Dutch PARA study, lower birthweight of babies born to RA patients was independently associated with active disease in the third trimester of pregnancy, and indirectly with prednisone use, which was associated with shorter gestational age.

### Management of RA medications in pregnant patients [^115MXnPG]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

A desire for children or the presence of pregnancy limits the drug therapy options for a woman with rheumatoid arthritis. Combination therapies that include methotrexate or new drugs that have not been studied or used in pregnant patients must be excluded, even though they might be highly efficacious. With few exceptions, the reason for this exclusion is not the proven teratogenicity of the drugs, but the absence of proven safety for the fetus. Whereas methotrexate, leflunomide, abatacept and rituximab must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and bisphosphonates can be continued until conception. Antimalarial agents, sulfasalazine, azathioprine and ciclosporin are compatible with pregnancy, and so can be administered until birth. Corticosteroids and analgesics such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) can also be used throughout pregnancy. NSAIDs can be safely administered until gestational week 32. The most important consideration when managing rheumatoid arthritis medications during pregnancy is that therapy must be tailored for the individual patient according to disease activity.

### Medication utilisation trends during pregnancy and factors influencing adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^117L3ELv]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is more common in female patients, with a female-to-male ratio ranging from approximately 2:1 to 4:1, while the prevalence of RA among women of childbearing age reaches approximately 0.5%–1.0%. Therefore, pregnancy and childbirth naturally require attention during treatment for female patients with RA.

Compared with healthy controls, patients with RA have been reported to experience difficulty in conceiving and a lower number of births. Factors associated with prolonged time to pregnancy include older age, nulliparity, high RA disease activity, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and daily use of prednisone > 7.5 mg. Prostaglandins play a crucial role in ovulation and blastocyst implantation, both of which may be disrupted by NSAIDs through inhibition of prostaglandin production. Glucocorticoids are known to suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis and affect ovarian physiology and periconceptual uterine growth.

Patients with RA who are planning for pregnancy or lactation have limited treatment options. Methotrexate (MTX) is teratogenic in humans, and MTX treatment in the 3 months prior to conception is associated with a high risk of pregnancy loss. According to the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology recommendations and the British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) and British Health Professionals in Rheumatology (BHPR) guidelines, MTX should be stopped 3 months before conception. Leflunomide (LEF) should also be avoided during pregnancy, and cholestyramine washout is recommended. Other conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), sulfasalazine (SSZ), and tacrolimus (TAC), are not inhibited throughout pregnancy. Glucocorticoids can also be continued at the lowest effective dose throughout pregnancy. However, the use of NSAIDs is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy. Regarding biological DMARDs, the recommended timing of drug discontinuation varies across the literature. According to BSR and BHPR guidelines, infliximab should be stopped at 16 weeks, and etanercept and adalimumab should be stopped before the third trimester, while certolizumab can be administered throughout the entire pregnancy. According to the recently published American College of Rheumatology Guideline in 2020, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapy with infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab or golimumab prior to and during pregnancy is conditionally recommended. Currently, there are insufficient data regarding the safety of abatacept, tocilizumab and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors during pregnancy.

### Rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy: evolution of disease activity and pathophysiological considerations for drug use [^114mUP28]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

It has long been known that pregnancy and childbirth have a profound effect on the disease activity of rheumatic diseases. For clinicians, the management of patients with RA wishing to become pregnant involves the challenge of keeping disease activity under control and adequately adapting drug therapy during pregnancy and post-partum. This article aims to summarize the current evidence on the evolution of RA disease activity during and after pregnancy and the use of anti-rheumatic drugs around this period. Of recent interest is the potential use of anti-TNF compounds in the preconception period and during pregnancy. Accumulating experience with anti-TNF therapy in other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease, provides useful insights for the use of TNF blockade in pregnant women with RA, or RA patients wishing to become pregnant.

Applicability and utility

Implementation

Awareness of these guidelines will aid clinical practitioners and patients in decision making. No barriers to implementation of these guidelines are anticipated.

Key standards of care

Patients with rheumatic disease should receive pre-pregnancy counselling and regular review during pregnancy and for 6 months post-partum by clinical practitioners with expertise in the management of rheumatic disease in pregnancy. They should have access to information on relevant medications in pregnancy and breastfeeding, enabling them to make informed decisions on drug use in pregnancy.

Future research agenda

Research questions include: should biologic DMARDs with known placental transfer be stopped or switched before/during pregnancy; are targeted synthetic DMARDs compatible with pregnancy; is it safe to give certain live vaccines to infants ≤ 6 months of age after third trimester exposure to biologic DMARDs with high placental transfer?

Mechanism for audit of the guideline

An audit tool to assess compliance with these guidelines is shown in Supplementary Data S5, available at Rheumatology online.

### Antirheumatic drugs and reproduction in women and men with chronic arthritis [^1174EsYT]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Pregnancy outcome

Several studies have demonstrated a slight increase in obstetric complications in women affected by chronic arthritis. While a high frequency of miscarriages is not observed, some reports revealed an increased prevalence of small for gestational age infants, preterm delivery and caesarean sections in these patients. In some studies conducted in rheumatoid arthritis patients, an increased rate of pre-eclampsia was observed. Adverse pregnancy outcomes, in particular low birth weight, seem to be directly related to a higher level of disease activity, even if birth weight could also be indirectly influenced by the use of prednisone, through the promotion of a lower gestational age.

Patient participants expressed a strong desire that their physicians discuss family planning early and often, including before planning or pregnancy, and discussion should include information on medications and the impact of disease activity, autoantibodies, and organ system abnormalities on maternal and fetal health. In rare situations with significant disease‑related damage, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension, renal dysfunction, heart failure, or other severe organ damage, pregnancy may be contraindicated due to high risk of maternal morbidity and mortality.

Preconception counselling and shared-decision making are the key elements when taking care of women living with ARD who wish for a pregnancy. In our cohort, this approach was reflected by the condition of remission or low disease activity for most of the patients, as described by patient-reported and physician-reported outcomes. Only one-fifth of patients had a disease flare during the year prior to conception, supporting the fact that most of the patients have planned their pregnancy while on stable inactive disease, as also suggested by a median disease duration of 6.4 years prior to conception. Along with this, disease flares during pregnancy occurred in a minority of patients (15%), showing that good disease control prior to conception and during the first trimester is a protective factor against flares later in pregnancy, as already described in RAand SLE.

Conclusion

The approach to reproductive problems and pregnancy management in rheumatic patients represents a great challenge. The turning point is represented by preconception counselling. Optimising pregnancy outcomes is based on informing male and female patients about potential risks related to the disease, planning for pregnancy during a period of clinical remission or, at least, low disease activity, and ensuring that ongoing treatments are both effective and compatible with pregnancy. TNF-α inhibitors can be considered safe while seeking for conception and in the first part of gestation, representing a possible therapeutic choice in patients affected by aggressive forms of chronic arthritis and desiring to have a baby. An interdisciplinary approach with the cooperation of rheumatologists, obstetricians, gynaecologists and neonatologists is crucial before and during pregnancy, and more effective physician-patient communication about family planning and desire for pregnancy should be reached. A prospective collection of additional exposures and new multicentric follow-up studies investigating perinatal infections, vaccination responses and global development of children is obviously needed to confirm the safety of antenatal exposure to antirheumatic biological drugs.

### British society of rheumatology guideline working group response to European medicines agency safety update on hydroxychloroquine [^116Qz2oh]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The Huybrechts study on HCQ was included in the systematic literature review that informed the 2022 BSR pregnancy guideline based on 43 studies of 4701 pregnancy exposures to HCQ. There were no appreciable adverse effects overall of HCQ on pregnancy duration or birth weight, no increased risk of first trimester miscarriages and no specific patterns of congenital malformations in association with HCQ exposure.

We would like to reassure healthcare professionals and patients that the evidence under-pinning the EMA safety alert on use of HCQ in pregnancy was considered and does not alter the BSR 2022 pregnancy recommendations. Other examples of regulatory bodies drawing different conclusions from the same data exist within the BSR guideline. The MHRA and EMA have issued guidance for infants exposed to infliximab (a TNF inhibitor) in utero. They recommend that infants exposed to infliximab in utero should not receive live vaccinations until 12 months of age and that live vaccinations should be avoided in infants exposed to infliximab through breast milk. The systematic review of the same body of evidence led the multi-disciplinary authors of the updated BSR pregnancy guidelines to recommend avoidance of live vaccine use in infants exposed to all TNF inhibitor and non-TNF inhibitor biologic DMARDs with high rates of placental passage, in third trimester of pregnancy until they are 6 months of age. Other, experts have cautioned against a one size fits all approach and suggest that obstetric teams continue to provide well-considered and evidence-based advice on effects of maternal biologic DMARDs on suitability of childhood vaccinations.

Our multidisciplinary working group is concerned that a statement emphasizing a possible small risk of harm over established benefit may encourage healthcare professionals and patients to stop HCQ in pregnancy and risk disease relapse to the detriment of mother and fetus. A more supportive wording would acknowledge the potential for a small increased risk of major congenital malformations at doses higher than those normally used in rheumatological conditions and state 'the benefits and risks of HCQ during pregnancy should be considered with your specialist before conception'. It would therefore encourage consultations with specialists to balance the benefits of HCQ to prevent maternal disease flare and harm to the baby that may occur if this drug is stopped in pregnancy against potential small risks of congenital malformations at high dose.

Generic recommendations on prescribing immunomodulatory drugs and/or corticosteroids in rheumatic disease in pregnancy

Pre-conception counselling should be addressed by all healthcare professionals, with referral to professionals with relevant expertise as appropriate, to optimize disease control before pregnancy; with advice on the timing of pregnancy, and drug therapy before, during and after pregnancy, including contraception (GRADE 1A, SOA 99.5%).
If a woman is planning pregnancy, avoid pregnancy-incompatible drugs (GRADE 1A, SOA 100%).
The risks and benefits to the mother and foetus of drug treatment to control maternal disease should be discussed and clearly documented by all healthcare professionals involved in the patient's care (GRADE 1A, SOA 99.5%).
Immunomodulatory drugs that are contraindicated in pregnancy should be switched to a pregnancy-compatible alternative in advance of conception to ensure maintenance of disease control on the new medication (GRADE 1A, SOA 100%).
When no pregnancy-compatible drugs are suitable, control of severe/life-threatening maternal disease should take priority over concerns for potential foetal outcomes (GRADE 1B, SOA 99.0%).
All biologic DMARDs may be continued throughout pregnancy if required to control active/severe maternal disease (GRADE 1B, SOA 98.5%).
Immunisation schedules in infants after in-utero exposure to biologic DMARDs will depend on timing of exposure, bioavailability and persistence of the drug, mechanism of action of the drug, and live vaccines (GRADE 1C, SOA 99.5%).
Where possible, the minimum effective dose of immunomodulatory drug or corticosteroid should be used to maintain maternal disease suppression, and stopping the drug during pregnancy may be considered in women at low risk of disease flare on withdrawal of therapy (GRADE 1B, SOA 100%).
Some drugs may reduce male fertility, but paternal drug exposure in humans has not convincingly been associated with adverse foetal development or pregnancy outcome. Although the evidence is weak, men who take rheumatological medicines should be reassured about the safety of conceiving (GRADE 2C, SOA 98.4%).

### Intentional etanercept use during pregnancy for maintenance of remission in rheumatoid arthritis [^1155xva7]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. TNF inhibitors are effective in the treatment of signs and symptoms of the disease although their safety during pregnancy is debated.

Methods

Two cases of women with rheumatoid arthritis in complete remission of the disease with etanercept who decided to continue the therapy throughout their pregnancy are presented. A longitudinal evaluation of the disease activity showed a satisfactory control and good pregnancy outcomes were obtained. A flare of the disease after delivery was not observed.

Conclusions

Etanercept seems to be safe during pregnancy and lactation. A good control of the activity of the disease was reported throughout the pregnancy and during puerperium, when a reactivation of rheumatoid arthritis is often observed.

Fertility is impaired in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whereas less is known about male fertility problems. Pregnancy outcome in patients with RA is slightly less favorable compared with the general population, especially in patients with active disease. Disease activity usually improves during pregnancy, but less than previously thought. Although several antirheumatic drugs are contraindicated in pregnancy, more treatment options are available. There is evidence on the safety of TNF inhibitors in pregnancy. Given the impact of active disease on fertility and pregnancy outcome, a treat-to-target strategy is recommended for patients who are pregnant or have a wish to conceive.

Counseling should address efficacy, safety, and patient values, recognizing that RMD patients typically underutilize effective contraception.

Drug treatment of RA during preconception, pregnancy and lactation

Counselling RA patients wishing to become pregnant and treating RA during pregnancy and post-partum can be quite a challenge to the clinician, since several RA medications are contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation, leaving only a limited number of therapeutic options. Ethical constraints prevent the evaluation of the safety of drugs for use in pregnancy during pre-marketing clinical trials, and post-marketing assessment of teratogenicity poses a number of methodological difficulties. Therefore, drug safety information for use in pregnant patients heavily relies on safety classification systems such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) categories for drug use in pregnancy (Table 2). This latter classification system places a lot of potentially harmless drugs in Category C due to a lack of sufficient data from controlled studies in humans.

T2
US Food and Drug Administration categories for drug safety during pregnancy

Additional drug safety data often come from voluntary reports of adverse events during post-marketing surveillance or from uncontrolled observational studies or clinical experience. These data are obviously poor sources for evidence-based clinical decision making, since they are mostly retrospective, are subject to recall and publication bias, do not include accurate exposure data, are limited with respect to follow-up of patients or do not include a comparator population. So the clinical management of pregnant RA patients suffers from the wide gap between formal safety data and the need to make therapeutic decisions for adequate disease control in daily clinical practice.

Since RA disease activity is likely to improve during pregnancy in a majority of patients, with a subset of patients even achieving remission, the most critical period is the preconception period in the case of planned pregnancy. In this period, conventional DMARDs with teratogenic properties must be stopped, while low disease activity needs to be preserved. Table 3 gives an overview of the FDA categories of drugs commonly used in RA treatment and summarizes the current recommendations for their use in pregnant patients or patients wishing to become pregnant.

### Pregnancy and management in women with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome [^113WYiaG]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) during pregnancy presents unique clinical challenges. Women with both RA and SLE can have disease flares during pregnancy, leading to pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia, small-for-gestational-age infants, and preterm delivery. Disease should be under control prior to conception. Women with obstetric APS need to be anticoagulated during pregnancy. Many but not all antirheumatic medications can be used during pregnancy and lactation.

Antiphospholipid antibody–positive patients — contraception choices and venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk are addressed as follows: Presence of aPL, with or without history of clinical complications, is a contraindication to use of estrogen-containing contraceptives due to the potential further increase in thrombosis risk. We strongly recommend against combined estrogen–progestin contraceptives in women with positive aPL because estrogen increases risk of thromboembolism, and we strongly recommend IUDs (levonorgestrel or copper) or the progestin-only pill in women with positive aPL; in aPL-positive patients, we do not recommend DMPA due to concern regarding thrombogenicity. Supporting risk data indicate that the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in healthy women taking combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives is 36 times higher than the baseline annual risk of 1/10,000 women, with VTE risk odds ratios range from 2.2 to 6.2 across estrogen–progestin pills varying by progestin; in contrast, VTE risk in healthy women using either the progestin-only pill or the progestin IUD is not increased, with relative risks (RRs) of 0.9 (95% CI 0.57–1.45) and 0.61 (95% CI 0.24–1.53), respectively, while injectable DMPA shows higher VTE risk (RR 2.67 [95% CI 1.29–5.53]). For method selection, The copper IUD is a highly effective alternative that does not increase risk of VTE, but it may increase menstrual bleeding and cramping for several months after insertion, and Progestin IUDs may decrease these symptoms (30); We suggest the progestin-only pill (which is an effective, but not highly effective, contraceptive) as a low-risk alternative for patients who are unable or unwilling to use an IUD. Given pregnancy risks, The lack of data specific to aPL-positive patients using the progestin-only pill or IUD must be weighed against the risk of pregnancy-related VTE in the general population, which is > 10 times that seen with estrogen-progestin contraceptive use, with VTE risk of 197/10,000 women-years for pregnant patients with a single prothrombotic mutation and 776/10,000 women-years if there are multiple prothrombotic mutations.

### High-risk pregnancy and the rheumatologist [^113Yixyr]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Rheumatologists are increasingly involved in the care of young women who, in the age of biologic therapy, are now gaining control of their rheumatic diseases and attempting pregnancy. With careful planning, most women with rheumatic diseases have successful pregnancies. This article focuses specifically on the highest-risk pregnancies and controversial areas. We discuss the women at risk of complications, the types of maternal and fetal complications, the treatments that can be used in pregnancy (and breastfeeding) and longer-term outcomes that could affect the mother. SLE, RA, ANCA-associated vasculitides, large vessel vasculitis (e.g. Takayasu's) and other CTDs (e.g. scleroderma) are among the conditions covered. The evidence and controversies regarding the recommendations for the use of biologics in pregnancy are discussed. The role of the rheumatologist in pregnancy planning and caring for the pregnant and post-partum woman as part of the multidisciplinary team is discussed.

### Women's health and fertility, family planning and pregnancy in immune-mediated rheumatic diseases: a report from a south-eastern European expert meeting [^111pJfpu]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

With current advances in medical treatment, reproductive issues have become more important for women with chronic immune-mediated diseases. Most, if not all, patients report that their disease affects their personal relationships, their decision to have children, and the size of their family. These decisions are multi-factorial, influenced mainly by concerns over the effect of pregnancy on the rheumatic disease, the impact of disease activity during pregnancy on foetal health, the patient's ability to care for the child, and the possible harmful effects medication could have on the child, both pre- and post-natally during breastfeeding. Apart from that, women's health issues tend to be overlooked in favour of the management of the underlying rheumatic disease. To this end, we convened an expert panel to review the published literature on women's health and reproductive issues and provide evidence- and eminence-based points to consider for the treating physicians. We conclude that there is a need for a change in mind-set from one which 'cautions against pregnancy' to one which 'embraces pregnancy' through the practice of individualised, pre- and post-conceptual, multi-disciplinary care.

This paper presents a critical appraisal of the current evidence and recommendations regarding the use of pharmaceuticals and biologicals in pregnancy. Clinical experience is often at variance with published recommendations as studies have not taken into account the differences in physiology in the various stages of gestation and between animal and human pregnancies. Physicians should bear in mind that pregnancy causes disruption in several organ systems; the effects of an intervention may depend on the stage of gestation; and some effects of interventions in pregnancy may not manifest until adulthood.

### The time of equipoise on the use of biological DMARDs in for inflammatory arthritis during pregnancy is finally over: a reappraisal of evidence to optimise pregnancy management [^111Zqa85]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Active inflammatory arthritis in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Treatment of active inflammation and maintenance of low disease activity with medication reduces these risks. Therapeutic decisions on disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in pregnancy are complicated by safety concerns, which have led to inappropriate withdrawal of treatment and consequential harm to mother and fetus. Studies of inflammatory arthritis in pregnancy have consistently shown minimal safety concerns with the use of biological DMARDs and an increased risk of disease flare with discontinuation of biological DMARDs. It is our opinion that during pregnancy, the benefits of disease control with biological DMARDs, when required in addition to conventional synthetic DMARDs, outweigh the risks. In this Series paper, we review the reasons for reconsideration of equipoise and propose an agenda for future research to optimise the use of biological DMARDs in inflammatory arthritis during pregnancy.

Pain decreased across the course of the pregnancy. Melhado et al.evaluated the presence of headache in 1,101 pregnant women with a history of headache, conducting interviews with women during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy and immediately after delivery. They found that most of the headaches improved or disappeared during the second and third trimesters. Likewise, Granella et al.studied 1,300 women who suffered from migraine headaches without aura. Of the 943 patients who became pregnant, 17.4% had complete remission from headaches, and a significant improvement was seen in 49.9% of the pregnant patients.

T cells are implicated in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a painful autoimmune disease, so it is not surprising that pregnancy affects RA. A review by Østensen and Villigerreported that about 75% of patients with RA experience improvement or even remission of arthritis during pregnancy. In terms of RA pain, Barrett et al.found that 66% of pregnant women with RA had decreased pain and 64% had less swelling by the third trimester. de Man et al.found a similar remission of RA symptoms, including the metrics of pain, but to a lesser extent than Barrett et al.

### Association between disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis and maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115iiTb8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Our systematic review and meta-analysis further compare the pregnancy outcomes in women with RA and without RA, and also quantitively analyzes the association between disease activity and the risk of pregnancy outcomes in women with RA. There are some limitations in this study. First, heterogeneity may be caused by the different ages, onset time, and disease duration in included population, while data reported in the included studies are not enough to support us to conduct subgroup analysis for further exploration. Second, maternal smoking and drinking habits, family history, and rheumatoid treatment during pregnancy also affect maternal and infant outcomes. Since above information is not stated in all original studies, these data cannot be included in this meta-analysis. Third, disease activity is assessed using DAS28, HAQ-DI, PS, and PGS. Due to the limited number of studies, DAS28 and HAQ-DI are used for quantitative analysis. In the future, more studies are needed to further verify our findings.

### Treatment with biologics of pregnant patients with rheumatic diseases [^115RzrZb]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Due to limited human pregnancy experience safety issues in regard to children exposed antenatally to biological drugs are still under debate. A survey of new published experience on biological agents during pregnancy is necessary to assist clinicians with adequate counseling and management of patients who desire children.

Recent Findings

No controlled study has been published on use of TNFα inhibitors, rituximab, abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy during the years 2009–2010. New case reports confirm that all monoclonal antibodies expose the child to the full adult dose when administered in late pregnancy with a risk for adverse effects in the newborn and perinatally. Data from a drug registry show that preconceptional and early first-trimester use of rituximab appears to confer no serious side effect to the child. Case reports on abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy are not conclusive.

Summary

Differences in molecular structure of TNFα inhibitors may turn out to favor the use of agents that are not complete monoclonal antibodies in women who consider pregnancy. The very limited experience with abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy allows no statement as to their compatibility with pregnancy. At present use of biological agents throughout pregnancy cannot be recommended.

Generic recommendations on prescribing immunomodulatory drugs and/or corticosteroids in rheumatic disease in pregnancy

Pre-conception counselling should be addressed by all healthcare professionals, with referral to professionals with relevant expertise as appropriate, to optimize disease control before pregnancy; with advice on the timing of pregnancy, and drug therapy before, during and after pregnancy, including contraception (GRADE 1A, SOA 99.5%).
If a woman is planning pregnancy, avoid pregnancy-incompatible drugs (GRADE 1A, SOA 100%).
The risks and benefits to the mother and foetus of drug treatment to control maternal disease should be discussed and clearly documented by all healthcare professionals involved in the patient's care (GRADE 1A, SOA 99.5%).
Immunomodulatory drugs that are contraindicated in pregnancy should be switched to a pregnancy-compatible alternative in advance of conception to ensure maintenance of disease control on the new medication (GRADE 1A, SOA 100%).
When no pregnancy-compatible drugs are suitable, control of severe/life-threatening maternal disease should take priority over concerns for potential foetal outcomes (GRADE 1B, SOA 99.0%).
All biologic DMARDs may be continued throughout pregnancy if required to control active/severe maternal disease (GRADE 1B, SOA 98.5%).
Immunization schedules in infants after in-utero exposure to biologic DMARDs will depend on timing of exposure, bioavailability and persistence of the drug, mechanism of action of the drug, and live vaccines (GRADE 1C, SOA 99.5%).
Where possible, the minimum effective dose of immunomodulatory drug or corticosteroid should be used to maintain maternal disease suppression, and stopping the drug during pregnancy may be considered in women at low risk of disease flare on withdrawal of therapy (GRADE 1B, SOA 100%).
Some drugs may reduce male fertility, but paternal drug exposure in humans has not convincingly been associated with adverse foetal development or pregnancy outcome. Although the evidence is weak, men who take rheumatological medicines should be reassured about the safety of conceiving (GRADE 2C, SOA 98.4%).

Prospects

It will be difficult to close the information gaps in the future because, fortunately, not many women unintentionally conceive while taking MTX. Before prescribing low-dose MTX to women with RA in their reproductive age, the physician should address the issue of pregnancy and contraception. In this context, it is important to know that about 40% of pregnancies are unintended worldwide. If MTX was discontinued within the 3 months preconception, the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes do not seem to be increased. Therefore, preconception counselling should not advise or encourage TOP due to prepregnancy MTX.

### Stopping or continuing in pregnancy (MAMA) trial… [^111iMpi3]. isrctn.com (2025). Medium credibility.

Ongoing Condition category Pregnancy and Childbirth Plain English summary of protocol Background and study aims 1–2% of women are affected by inflammatory arthritis. Many are treated with medications known as 'biologics'. More women with inflammatory arthritis are considering starting a family, because biologics mean they are more able to manage their arthritis. They may face difficult. decisions around treatments during pregnancy. Uncontrolled arthritis can lead to worse outcomes in pregnancy, so managing arthritis well is important. Biologics are often avoided during pregnancy because of limited understanding of how these drugs impact pregnancy or arthritis activity. There are concerns about the possible effects of these drugs on babies'. immune systems, and some baby vaccinations are routinely delayed.

Until recently, most women were advised to stop their biologics during pregnancy; however, due to mounting evidence of their safety, national guidance now states that women can stay on biologics throughout pregnancy. It is unknown whether there is any benefit to this in terms of arthritis control. Certain. other medicines used to treat arthritis flares in pregnancy can pose potential harm. MAMA aims to find out the effects of stopping or continuing biologics during pregnancy. It will compare whether women who continue their biologics have better arthritis control than those who stop, and assess the impact on their pregnancy, their baby, and the costs associated with this decision.

### Rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy: evolution of disease activity and pathophysiological considerations for drug use [^113RFa7t]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Anti-malarial agents

Use of HCQ during pregnancy at the low doses used for malaria prophylaxis does not increase the risk of congenital abnormalities or pregnancy loss. When used as a DMARD at much higher doses, the continuation of this drug during pregnancy has long been controversial and the FDA classifies HCQ in Category C. This controversy was mainly due to reports on retinal toxicity and ototoxicity observed after treatment with chloroquine.

HCQ use during pregnancy has been reported in more than 250 pregnancies in SLE patients, with no indications for increased congenital malformations or hearing or vision impairment. A more limited number of children exposed to HCQ have been assessed for retinal toxicity or cardiac conductivity disturbances, again with no indications of adverse effects of the drug. HCQ is secreted into milk at low concentrations, but in view of the transplacental crossing of the drug and the relatively long tissue half-life, it is not deemed necessary to advise against lactation of children exposed to the drug during pregnancy.

AZA

AZA and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are designated as FDA Category D drugs (Table 2), indicating that increased risk for the fetus exists, but the risk must be weighed against the possible benefits of the drug. Although AZA is teratogenic in animals, inducing skeletal and visceral malformations in rabbits and mice at doses equivalent to the human dose, multiple case series and cohort studies in human pregnancy, mostly in transplant recipients and IBD patients, have not revealed increased incidence of congenital anomalies or recurrent patterns of malformations.

A recent cohort study in Denmark, including birth outcomes of 76 exposed pregnancies, showed an increased risk of preterm delivery and low birthweight in women exposed to AZA or 6-MP during pregnancy, but no significant increase in congenital malformations. However, the data suggest that adverse birth outcomes are caused by the underlying disease rather than by use of AZA or MP.

Thiopurines undergo a complex metabolization process and the placenta forms a partial barrier to their metabolites. Indeed, the active metabolites 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) are detectable in fetal red blood cells, whereas 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) is not. Dosing 6-TGN at least once during pregnancy is recommended to avoid excessively high levels, which may cause myelosuppresson in mother and child. Traditionally, breastfeeding is believed to be contraindicated under thiopurine treatment, but several recent studies have shown that 6-MP levels in breast milk are low, and conclude that breastfeeding during treatment with AZA seems safe.

### Rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy: evolution of disease activity and pathophysiological considerations for drug use [^116gvqXS]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The first observation that the symptoms of RA often ameliorate during pregnancy dates back to the landmark publication of Hench in 1938 and has been confirmed many times since then. The mechanisms responsible for decreased disease activity during pregnancy and post-partum flare of RA, however, have remained elusive, although the potential role of a number of immunological and hormonal factors has been described. In AS, disease activity does not seem to be influenced by pregnancy, whereas in SLE an increased risk of disease flares has been described both during pregnancy and the post-partum period, especially in patients with active disease at conception.

For rheumatologists, the management of RA patients wishing to become pregnant involves adaptation of the therapeutic regimen, thereby balancing the need to withdraw teratogenic drugs, such as MTX and LEF, while keeping disease activity under control. In the rheumatological setting, little data are available on the use of anti-TNF therapy in the preconception period or during pregnancy in RA women.

This article reviews the effect of pregnancy on disease activity in RA, discusses the effects of disease activity on pregnancy outcome and gives an overview of drug use before and during pregnancy and lactation. In particular, literature data on the use of anti-TNF therapy during pregnancy in immune-mediated diseases are summarized in order to provide guidance on whether anti-TNF therapy is safe and useful to treat pregnant RA patients or RA patients wishing to become pregnant.

### Is pregnancy a risk factor for rheumatic autoimmune diseases? [^111cVJWV]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the association of pregnancy with the risk of subsequent development of rheumatic autoimmune diseases in women, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus, and scleroderma.

Recent Findings

There is a small but growing literature related to the risk of autoimmune rheumatic disease in association with pregnancy history. However, results conflict both in terms of the direction and magnitude of risk of disease in relationship to prior pregnancy history. Although anecdotal evidence tends to favor the premise that pregnancy is protective against certain diseases, such as RA, the heterogeneity of results precludes the ability to confirm an association in either direction. There is indication that time elapsed since pregnancy may influence risk, with the postpartum year being of particular relevance.

Summary

To date, a clear pattern has not emerged regarding pregnancy and the future risk of autoimmune rheumatic diseases. This topic requires greater study, and given the strong female preponderance of these diseases, future research efforts should seek to resolve this important issue.

### Pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatoid arthritis: an 11-year French nationwide study [^1133vzdu]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease. It is characterised by painful and swollen joints and is a major public health problem. Data on the prevalence of RA in adults vary considerably between studies and countries, ranging from 0.00% to 2.70%. In France, its prevalence was recently estimated at 0.47%. There is a clear female predominance, with women being 2.6 times more affected than men. Although the peak age of onset is around 50 years, RA can also affect women of childbearing age.

Pregnancy is a particular period, which may be associated with a spontaneous but transient improvement in rheumatic activity despite reduced rates of medication use compared with before conception. A recent meta-analysis showed that disease activity improved in 60% of patients with RA in pregnancy and flared in 47% post partum. On the other hand, RA can have a negative influence on pregnancy and may lead to adverse birth outcomes, such as prematurity, caesarean sections and low birth weight. This would appear to be particularly significant in active RA.

The management of these patients has evolved over the last decade, especially with the development of new therapeutic molecules. Recent European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology recommendations on the use of antirheumatic drugs during pregnancy emphasise the need to adjust treatment in patients planning a pregnancy to promote disease control in the mother while limiting risks to the fetus. Indeed, only a limited number of drugs available in the RA therapeutic arsenal meet these conditions. Compatibility with pregnancy has been found for sulfasalazine and glucocorticoids, but not for methotrexate, which should be discontinued before conception because of its proven teratogenicity. Among biologics, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are best studied and appear reasonably safe during pregnancy. Insufficient documentation regarding fetal safety implies the discontinuation of other therapeutic classes (interleukin-6 inhibitors (IL-6i), cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 immunoglobulin (CTLA4-Ig), anti-cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) antibody, Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi)) before a planned pregnancy.

### Risk of pre-eclampsia and impact of disease activity and antirheumatic treatment in women with rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondylarthritis and psoriatic arthritis: a collaborative matched cohort study from Sweden and Denmark [^112Hgki9]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Risk in relation to functional status and disease activity during pregnancy

We had information on one or more measures of either HAQ, CRP or DAS28-CRP during pregnancy in 43% (n = 756) of all RA pregnancies. The risk of pre-eclampsia was approximately doubled in RA pregnancies with high DAS28-CRP, compared with controls (aOR 1.95; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.49), and the results were similar for HAQ and CRP (table 5). When assessing functional status and disease activity variables as disease load, the signal was even stronger (aOR 1.96; 95% CI 1.26 to 3.04). The internal comparison (untreated group constituting the reference) further indicated an increased risk in RA pregnancies with high versus low disease load, but the estimates did not reach statistical significance (table 5). RA pregnancies lacking information on all three variables had no increased risk compared with controls.

Table 5
Risk of pre-eclampsia in RA, AxSpA and PSA pregnancies in relation to functional status and disease activity any time during pregnancy versus control pregnancies.

In AxSpA and PsA the level of missing data was high on disease load was high, and although we found no association between pre-eclampsia and high disease load, the number of events was few (table 5).

Overall, the estimates did not substantially change when we restricted the analyses to only include disease activity measurements in the first and second trimester (online supplemental table S10).

Recommendations. Cyclophosphamide is generally contraindicated for treatment of rheumatic diseases during pregnancy and lactation. It should be withdrawn at least 3 months before the patient tries to conceive. For the woman who may desire pregnancy at a later time, consideration should be given to preserving ovarian follicle reserve by the timing of intravenous cyclophosphamide administration, use of oral contraceptives, use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, and/or cryopreservation of oocytes. 36 For the patient with life-threatening rheumatic disease, the use of cyclophosphamide may be considered after the first trimester. Women who wish to become pregnant should discontinue treatment with the drug for at least 3 months prior to attempting conception. Because folate may be depleted during methotrexate use, and folate deficiency is associated with neural tube defects, it is especially important to supplement this vitamin.

In a report of 10 pregnancies in women who received low-dose methotrexate for various rheumatic diseases, there were 5 abortions. However, no congenital anomalies were present in the 5 babies who were born at term, and their long-term follow-up also revealed no apparent growth, developmental, or intellectual problems. 61 The authors61 suggested that the lack of congenital abnormalities in that group of patients could be due to a combination of the low doses of methotrexate used and the folic acid supplementation. Recommendations. During treatment with methotrexate, patients should receive supplemental folic acid. Strict attention to contraception is advised. Should the patient desire pregnancy, both she and the potential father should discontinue treatment with the drug at least 3 months before conception because of its prolonged retention in the tissues after discontinuation.

Despite reports of some successful outcomes after exposure to methotrexate during early pregnancy, the numbers are too small to draw significant conclusions on the safe use of this drug. Further, the abnormalities that are seen are difficult to detect antenatally. Therefore, methotrexate is contraindicated in a patient who desires to conceive as well as during pregnancy and breastfeeding. This antimalarial drug is used either alone or in combination with other DMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis. It is also used to prevent flares in patients with SLE. 71 Fertility and Conception. There are no reports of adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine on fertility.

LEF

LEF blocks de novo pyrimidine synthesis by inhibiting dihydroorotate-dehydrogenase, and additionally inhibits protein tyrosine kinase activity. Animal reproduction studies indicate that LEF is both embryotoxic and teratogenic, mainly leading to craniofacial, skeletal and cardiovascular malformations, which caused the FDA to classify this drug in pregnancy Category X. Due to the long half-life of its metabolites, LEF should be discontinued for 2 years before pregnancy. Alternatively, a washout procedure with cholestyramine should be used until plasma levels are < 0.02 µg/ml on two separate measurements at least 2 weeks apart.

A recent prospective study compared pregnancy outcomes in 64 RA patients exposed to LEF during pregnancy (61 of which underwent a cholestyramine washout procedure), 108 RA patients not exposed to LEF and 78 healthy controls. In this study, the overall rate of major structural defects between the studied groups was not significantly different, nor did prenatal LEF exposure give rise to a specific pattern of major or minor anomalies. LEF is secreted into breast milk and therefore continues to be contraindicated during breastfeeding.

### Recommendations for the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in pregnancy and reproductive health for patients with rheumatic disease: a scoping review [^117Lfm2y]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, the newest agents, tsDMARDs, had very limited recommendations due to a lack of evidence. Notably, tsDMARDs are used in other autoimmune conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and there is emerging registry data on tsDMARD exposure during pregnancy in this group of patients, with recent Pregnancy in IBD and Neonatal Outcomes consensus statements favoring the use of JAK inhibitors if "no viable alternatives to maintain maternal health".

Although there was overall uniformity among drug recommendations in the preconception state, guidelines differed in duration that a medication needed to be held before pregnancy. Whereas timing of drug cessation before conception was specified, only one guideline clearly stated this was in relation to drug half‐life. There were scant recommendations pertaining to DMARD use in male fertility, and, interestingly, there was general agreement among guidelines on bDMARD use but different recommendations for csDMARD use in this setting, with overall very limited data available. The preliminary updated EULAR points to consider provides a broader list of DMARDs that have not demonstrated a clinically relevant impact on fertility or pregnancy outcome, including sulfasalazine and methotrexate, highlighting the value of ongoing research on the impact of these drugs on sperm.

Only two guidelines discussed newborn health guidelines with maternal bDMARD use, and only one guideline provided recommendations on alteration of vaccination schedules in newborns. Although it is necessary to exercise caution in use of any new medication in the context of pregnancy and potential implications on fetal developmental outcomes, initial studies suggest that there is no interference of bDMARD use up to infancy; however, more literature is required to strengthen recommendations in this area.

The process of formulating recommendations was similar among guidelines; however, only five guidelines included consumers on their voting panel. Notably, women with autoimmune disease are particularly vulnerable during pregnancy, with high rates of ambivalence and depression, and a retrospective study in women with AIRD revealed several unmet needs in knowledge about reproductive issues, with concerns that both active disease and medications required to control disease may harm the newborn. This is supported by a study by Birru Talabi et althat found up to 80% of women chose to discontinue DMARDs, including nonfetotoxic agents, and risked enduring inflammatory arthritis due to concerns of safety during pregnancy, despite emerging literature that there is minimal safety concerns with use of bDMARDs in pregnancy but higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes with uncontrolled inflammatory disease. This highlights the need for consumer representation and integration of the patient perspective in formulation of these guidelines to support personalized discussions between clinicians and patients, as counseling and a multidisciplinary approach appears to herald a positive effect on family planning and confidence in decision‐making.

### Association between disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis and maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Tsp9Y]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis showed that high disease activity of RA was associated with the increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. RA women preparing for pregnancy should pay more attention to control the disease activity. It is essential to strengthen communications between patients, obstetricians, and rheumatologists to develop individualized treatment plans for women with high disease activity of RA who are preparing for pregnancy.

High-risk pregnancy scenarios and pregnancy termination in RMD focus on maternal risk and expert counseling. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is associated with a particularly high risk of maternal mortality, estimated at up to 20% even with aggressive therapy, and other high-risk scenarios include severe renal insufficiency, cardiomyopathy, or valvular dysfunction as well as severe autoimmune disease flare during pregnancy including diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, active nephritis or vasculitis, or central nervous system inflammation. In these and other high-risk situations, the option of therapeutic termination of pregnancy may be lifesaving and should be discussed with the patient, and counseling by maternal-fetal medicine or genetics specialists is suggested in cases of teratogenic medication exposure based on the specific medication and timing.

### Pregnancy and reproduction in autoimmune rheumatic diseases [^115d39rD]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Despite evidence for the important role of oestrogens in the aetiology and pathophysiology of chronic immune/inflammatory diseases, the previous view of an unequivocal beneficial effect of oestrogens on RA compared with a detrimental effect on SLE has to be reconsidered. Likewise, the long-held belief that RA remits in the majority of pregnant patients has been challenged, and shows that only half of the patients experience significant improvement when objective disease activity measurements are applied. Pregnancies in patients with SLE are mostly successful when well planned and monitored interdisciplinarily, whereas a small proportion of women with APS still have adverse pregnancy outcomes in spite of the standard treatment. New prospective studies indicate better outcomes for pregnancies in women with rare diseases such as SSc and vasculitis. Fertility problems are not uncommon in patients with rheumatic disease and need to be considered in both genders. Necessary therapy, shortly before or during the pregnancy, demands taking into account the health of both mother and fetus. Long-term effects of drugs on offspring exposed in utero or during lactation is a new area under study as well as late effects of maternal rheumatic disease on children.

Pregnancy — glucocorticoid use and dosing: Nonfluorinated glucocorticoids should be used when needed, but substitution of steroid-sparing pregnancy-compatible immunosuppressive therapy is desirable when high-dose or prolonged use is required. We conditionally recommend continuing low-dose glucocorticoid treatment (≤ 10 mg daily of prednisone or nonfluorinated equivalent) during pregnancy if clinically indicated. We strongly recommend tapering higher doses of nonfluorinated glucocorticoids to < 20 mg daily of prednisone, adding a pregnancy-compatible glucocorticoid-sparing agent if necessary. Although there are only minimal data regarding prolonged treatment with low-dose glucocorticoids during pregnancy, we conditionally recommend against routine administration of stress-dose glucocorticoids at the time of vaginal delivery, but conditionally do recommend such treatment for surgical (cesarean) delivery.

### Is disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis during pregnancy and after delivery predictive for disease activity in a subsequent pregnancy? [^111J5zhR]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether disease activity in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 1 pregnancy is predictive for disease activity in a subsequent pregnancy.

Methods

In the Pregnancy-induced Amelioration of Rheumatoid Arthritis study, there are prospective data on 27 patients who participated twice. Improvement and deterioration is determined by changes in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints.

Results

Only 4 patients (14.8%) had comparable disease courses in both pregnancies, whereas treatment remained mostly similar. In contrast, a flare postpartum after the first pregnancy was predictive for a flare after the second pregnancy (p = 0.003).

Conclusion

RA disease course in following pregnancies cannot be predicted based upon previous pregnancies. However, a flare postpartum seems to predict subsequent flares.

Regarding the use of azathioprine IV (also known as Imuran, Azasan) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Do not use azathioprine for rheumatoid arthritis during pregnancy. The ACR guidelines recommend that azathioprine is compatible for use throughout pregnancy. The drug azathioprine IV (also known as Imuran, Azasan) is classified under category D in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has caused, is suspected to have caused, or may be expected to cause, an increased incidence of human fetal malformations or irreversible damage.

5.2.3.1 Methotrexate and pregnancy

Statement 90. We recommend that, due to teratogenic and embryotoxic effects of methotrexate, prior to conception women should discontinue methotrexate for 6 months (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). If patients become pregnant on methotrexate then the drug should be discontinued and high dose folic acid (15 mg daily) provided for at least 6 weeks. We suggest that men taking methotrexate may not need to discontinue treatment prior to conception (GRADE: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 92.7%).

Methotrexate is teratogenic and should not be given to women of childbearing age without detailed discussion and agreement about the importance of assured contraception during therapy, and for 6 months after stopping the drug. If there are concerns about reliability of adherence to effective contraception, then alternative therapy should be used. Information on 63 pregnancy outcomes of women exposed to low-dose methotrexate in the first trimester reported that 30% underwent termination of pregnancy, and of the remaining women, 25% had miscarriage and 12% of those going to term had a baby with congenital abnormality (including one child with multiple skeletal abnormalities).

There is no firm evidence to support the recommendation that men should discontinue methotrexate pre-conception. Two cohort studies of men receiving the drug for rheumatoid arthritis are reassuring regarding risk of preterm birth and fetal malformation. In a study of men with immunosuppressive and biological drug therapy for rheumatic diseases (of whom 100 were taking methotrexate), there was no evidence of an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. A further study of 113 pregnancies where the male partner had taken low-dose methotrexate for rheumatological disorders also showed no increase in risk. A Danish nationwide cohort study showed no adverse birth outcomes in children born to 193 men taking methotrexate.

Active RMD in pregnancy and autoantibody testing — In women with RMD who are currently pregnant and have active disease that requires medical therapy, we strongly recommend initiating or continuing a pregnancy-compatible steroid-sparing medication, as both active RMD and continuous high-dose glucocorticoid treatment have potential for maternal and fetal harm. Pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy laboratory testing for relevant autoantibodies is recommended, and ascertaining anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, and aPL status improves counseling regarding pregnancy and fetal risk. We strongly recommend testing for anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB once before or early in pregnancy in women with SLE or SLE-like disorders, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, and we strongly recommend against repeating the test during pregnancy.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of reproductive health in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases [^112kcypu]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology reproductive health guideline — introduction emphasizes that management of reproductive health in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) differs from healthy persons and requires clinician counseling on contraception, pregnancy and lactation, assisted reproductive technology (ART), fertility preservation, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), with collaboration across obstetrics-gynecology, maternal-fetal medicine, and reproductive endocrinology and infertility. Pregnancy in women with RMD may lead to serious maternal or fetal adverse outcomes, and contraception tailored to the individual patient with emphasis on safety and efficacy should be discussed and encouraged; risk for pregnancy complications depends on diagnosis, disease activity and damage, medications, and the presence of anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, and antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies. Not all medications are safe for preconception use by men and women or during pregnancy and lactation, but uncontrolled systemic inflammatory disease is itself associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, and patients are vulnerable to disease flare postpartum; the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants be exclusively breastfed for 6 months. Medication safety is often uncertain because most data are from case reports, small series, and observational studies, and randomized controlled trial data are scarce, making appropriate screening and management (including medication use) challenging; some patients also seek advice about oocyte preservation and in vitro fertilization (IVF). Conclusion statements note that the guideline provides evidence-based recommendations, many recommendations are conditional, and it is intended to inform a shared decision-making process that incorporates patients' values, preferences, and comorbidities.

Effect of pregnancy on disease activity

Since the publication by Hench, several studies have confirmed the spontaneous improvement of RA during pregnancy and an increased risk of flare after delivery (Table 1). Hench reported improvement in 33 of 34 pregnancies recalled by 20 patients, while Oka observed symptomatic improvement, mostly starting in the first trimester, in 77% of patients, and post-partum flare within 4 months after delivery in 81%. In a study by Ostensen et al. pregnancy-associated remission of RA was reported in 75% of patients, with post-partum exacerbation in 62%. Klipple and Cecere reported ∼70% of patients improving during pregnancy, with > 90% of them experiencing a disease relapse in the first year post-partum. A study of 57 pregnancies in 41 women by Nelson et al. found remission in 22 (39%) and improvement of the disease in 12 (21%) pregnancies.

### Does rheumatoid arthritis really improve during pregnancy? A systematic review and metaanalysis [^113WgkYu]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

We performed a systematic review and metaanalysis to assess rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity during pregnancy using objective disease activity scoring systems.

Methods

A systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE/Medline, Cochrane, and LactMed databases was performed. Our inclusion criteria for analysis were prospective studies, more than 5 patients per study, and data on RA using an objective scoring system conducted by a clinician/health professional.

Results

Ten studies were eligible for final analysis, which included 237 patients, of which prepartum data were available for 204 patients. Postpartum disease activity was recorded in 135 pregnancies.

Conclusion

Disease activity improved in 60% of patients with RA in pregnancy and flared in 46.7% postpartum.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on prescribing drugs in pregnancy and breastfeeding: immunomodulatory anti-rheumatic drugs and corticosteroids [^116NDAUD]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Need for guideline

There has been an appreciable increase in the number of published pregnancy exposures to biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs), and two of these drugs are now licensed for use in pregnancy. In addition, therapeutic advances in management of various inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRDs) have led to an expansion of bDMARDs and biosimilars with different modes of action, as well as a new class of targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs).

The continuing expansion of existing and novel DMARDs means that uncertainty remains around the use of many of these drugs in pregnancy. This uncertainty may still lead to withdrawal of treatment from pregnant women unnecessarily. Discontinuation of treatment in preparation for or during early pregnancy can increase the risk of disease activity and flares during pregnancy, and are reported following discontinuation of biologics in patients with IRDs. The compatibility of various immunosuppressive and disease-modifying medications relevant to rheumatic disease will be covered in this update. This updated information will provide advice for healthcare professionals and patients, to ensure more confident prescribing in these scenarios, and will highlight any medications that should be stopped and/or avoided in the reproductive age group unless highly effective contraception is used, in line with guidance issued by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare.

Objectives of guideline

To update the previous BSR guidelines on prescribing in pregnancy in rheumatic disease of the following drug categories: antimalarials; corticosteroids; conventional synthetic (cs)DMARDs and immunosuppressive therapies; bDMARDs; and tsDMARDs. The full list of medications is shown in Supplementary Data S1, available at Rheumatology online. This revised guideline was produced by systematically reviewing all evidence published since the previous guideline, to answer specific questions in relation to each drug, as follows: Should it be stopped pre-conception? Is it compatible with pregnancy? Is it compatible with breastmilk exposure? Where possible, recommendations are made regarding compatibility with paternal exposure.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 776: immune modulating therapies in pregnancy and lactation [^116qY94T]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Because autoimmune conditions occur more often among women of childbearing age, continuation of these medications during pregnancy is often considered to optimize disease management in the woman and pregnancy outcomes, without placing the fetus at undue risk. Many commonly prescribed drugs can be used safely during pregnancy, without risk of teratogenicity or pregnancy complications, whereas a few are strictly contraindicated. The decision to use any agent during pregnancy should be based on the clinical context, risks associated with individual medications, and gestational age. For immunomodulators considered appropriate to use during pregnancy, the common clinical practice of stopping use at approximately 32 weeks of gestation because of theoretic concerns regarding the immune system of the fetus is not supported by currently available data. Low-risk medications typically are continued in pregnancy, or initiated during pregnancy as needed, because the benefits of therapy and disease control far outweigh any theoretic risks associated with the medication. Use or initiation of medications with intermediate risk or little or no data during pregnancy or lactation (or both) should be individualized. High-risk medications are typically not continued or initiated in pregnancy. However, it is critical that counseling occur, ideally in the prepregnancy and interpregnancy periods, to review the individual risks and benefits as they relate to disease management and pregnancy-associated risks with high-risk medication. There may be select circumstances when continued treatment is the safest option. In general, immunomodulating drugs that are not contraindicated in pregnancy are compatible with breastfeeding.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors during pregnancy: We conditionally recommend continuing tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy with infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, or golimumab prior to and during pregnancy. We strongly recommend continuation of certolizumab therapy prior to and during pregnancy, and the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor certolizumab does not contain an Fc chain and thus has minimal placental transfer. The Voting Panel agreed that if the patient's disease is under good control, these medications may be discontinued in the third trimester, while continuing TNF inhibitors through delivery if the patient's disease is active can be considered, with the understanding that the neonate will have significant serum levels of drug for a period of time. Use of the TNF inhibitors that include an IgG1 Fc construct during the third trimester results in high levels of placental transfer and significant drug levels in the neonate.
