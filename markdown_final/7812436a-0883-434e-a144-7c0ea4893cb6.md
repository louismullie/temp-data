## Question

Role of A1c in Gestational diabetes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of A1c in gestational diabetes, including its use in screening, diagnosis, glycemic targets, monitoring, and postpartum follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiological changes in pregnancy that alter A1c interpretation. Then, I should verify where A1c fits in screening and diagnosis versus where it does not. Next, I will review A1c-based thresholds for early dysglycemia and overt diabetes, followed by glycemic targets during pregnancy. After that, I need to check how often to monitor A1c and how to integrate it with glucose monitoring. Finally, I will examine postpartum testing strategy and long-term surveillance, and close with practical clinical takeaways and caveats about assay limitations and discordance.

> Let me first confirm the physiological context, because I need to ensure I'm not overinterpreting A1c in pregnancy. Pregnancy shortens red cell lifespan and increases erythropoiesis, which lowers A1c relative to nonpregnant states, so a "normal" A1c in pregnancy may actually reflect higher mean glucose than the same A1c outside pregnancy, and this is precisely why A1c thresholds and interpretation must be adjusted in pregnancy, not extrapolated from nonpregnant criteria [^114P5vpJ] [^114VmJfC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using A1c to diagnose GDM itself. I should double-check guideline positions: A1c is not recommended to diagnose GDM at 24–28 weeks; diagnosis still relies on a 75-g OGTT using IADPSG thresholds or a two-step approach, because A1c lacks adequate sensitivity and specificity for GDM in this window and can miss cases with clinically meaningful hyperglycemia [^112E5eWY] [^111opape] [^112hpZMS].

> Wait, let me verify where A1c does fit in early pregnancy. A1c is used to screen for undiagnosed preexisting diabetes at the first prenatal visit using standard nonpregnant diagnostic thresholds, and to identify early abnormal glucose metabolism that portends higher risk of adverse outcomes and later GDM; thresholds of A1c 5.9–6.4% indicate high risk, whereas 5.7% has not been linked to adverse perinatal outcomes in pregnancy-specific analyses, so I should be cautious not to overcall at 5.7% in this context [^11485EeF] [^113kbS4Z] [^116wB592] [^113i4rmt].

> I need to check the preconception and early-pregnancy A1c targets for people with preexisting diabetes, because this directly affects congenital anomaly risk. Preconception A1c should be optimized to less than 6.5% if safely achievable, and observational data show the lowest rates of adverse fetal outcomes when early pregnancy A1c is under 6.0–6.5%, reinforcing the need for tight but safe control before organogenesis [^115USq8t] [^112R8uCq] [^111FF83E].

> Next, I should review in-pregnancy A1c targets and monitoring cadence. During pregnancy, an A1c goal of less than 6.0% is optimal if it can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, with a relaxed target of less than 7.0% if needed to avoid hypoglycemia. Because of altered red cell kinetics, A1c may need more frequent checks, for example monthly, and should be interpreted alongside capillary glucose monitoring rather than as a standalone measure [^114P5vpJ] [^114VmJfC] [^111kkd1h].

> Let me consider how to integrate A1c with glucose monitoring, because I should confirm that A1c is a secondary metric. Capillary glucose targets for GDM are fasting or preprandial 95 mg/dL or less, and either 1-hour postprandial 140 mg/dL or less or 2-hour postprandial 120 mg/dL or less; CGM can help achieve these targets and the A1c goal in type 1 diabetes and may be beneficial in other diabetes in pregnancy, but estimated A1c or glucose management indicator calculations should not be used in pregnancy to estimate A1c [^114U7ejB] [^116ARv8B] [^116Dsgod].

> I should confirm the postpartum testing strategy, because this is where misapplication of A1c is common. At 4–12 weeks postpartum, a 75-g OGTT using nonpregnant criteria is preferred over A1c to detect persistent diabetes or prediabetes, given higher sensitivity and the potential for misleading A1c soon after delivery; thereafter, lifelong screening every 1–3 years is advised, and for those planning another pregnancy, preconception screening for dysglycemia is recommended [^111mmFWr] [^117GTBnc] [^114qfqmH] [^112ZF21A].

> But wait, what if A1c and glucose values disagree during or after pregnancy. I need to ensure assay quality and consider interferences: in settings of altered red cell turnover, hemoglobinopathies, recent blood loss or transfusion, or when there is substantial discordance between A1c and glucose, plasma glucose criteria should be used for diagnosis and management decisions, and point-of-care A1c for diagnosis should be restricted to FDA-cleared, NGSP-certified methods in CLIA-certified settings [^115MFVh2] [^114mu8U3].

> Let me synthesize the clinical role to avoid overgeneralization. A1c is not for diagnosing GDM at 24–28 weeks. It is for detecting preexisting diabetes early, for risk stratification of early dysglycemia, for setting and monitoring stringent but safe glycemic targets in pregnancy, and for longitudinal risk assessment postpartum, always interpreted in the context of pregnancy physiology and alongside glucose monitoring rather than in isolation [^11485EeF] [^114P5vpJ] [^114VmJfC].

> Finally, I should double-check practical takeaways. Use A1c early to find overt diabetes and flag high-risk dysglycemia, aim for A1c less than 6.0% during pregnancy when feasible, monitor A1c more frequently and pair it with structured glucose monitoring, avoid relying on A1c alone to diagnose GDM, and prioritize OGTT for postpartum testing. These steps align with ADA 2025, AACE 2022, and related guidance and help balance maternal–fetal benefits with hypoglycemia risk [^114P5vpJ] [^114U7ejB] [^111mmFWr].

A1c is **not recommended for diagnosing GDM** because pregnancy alters red cell turnover and lowers A1c, reducing accuracy and causing false negatives [^115MFVh2] [^114VmJfC]. A1c may be used in early pregnancy (**before 15 weeks**) to detect overt diabetes or high-risk dysglycemia (A1C 5.9–6.4% or FPG 110–125 mg/dL) [^1154N5yn] [^113kbS4Z], but it cannot replace the 24–28 week OGTT for GDM diagnosis [^112hpZMS]. During pregnancy, A1c is a secondary measure for monitoring glycemic control, with an optimal target of < 6% if achievable without hypoglycemia [^114P5vpJ] [^114VmJfC]. Postpartum, use a 75-g OGTT at 4–12 weeks — not A1c — to detect persistent diabetes or prediabetes [^111mmFWr] [^114qfqmH].

---

## Physiological changes in pregnancy affecting A1c accuracy

Pregnancy shortens red cell lifespan and increases turnover, which **lowers A1c** and can cause falsely low results, limiting diagnostic accuracy [^114P5vpJ] [^115MFVh2].

---

## A1c in screening and diagnosis of GDM

- **Early pregnancy screening**: A1c can help detect overt diabetes or high-risk dysglycemia before 15 weeks (A1C 5.9–6.4% or FPG 110–125 mg/dL) [^113kbS4Z] [^112g9nBc].

- **Standard screening**: Universal GDM screening at 24–28 weeks uses a 75-g OGTT; A1c is not recommended for GDM diagnosis due to limited accuracy [^113k8xAV] [^112E5eWY].

- **Postpartum screening**: A 75-g OGTT at 4–12 weeks is preferred to detect persistent diabetes or prediabetes; A1c is less sensitive in this period [^111mmFWr] [^114qfqmH].

---

## A1c targets during pregnancy

Optimal target is **A1c < 6%** if achievable without significant hypoglycemia [^114P5vpJ] [^114VmJfC]; a relaxed target of **< 7%** may be used if needed to avoid hypoglycemia [^114VmJfC].

---

## Limitations and challenges of A1c in GDM

- **Physiological changes**: Altered red cell turnover in pregnancy reduces A1c accuracy [^114VmJfC] [^115MFVh2].

- **Assay variability**: Hemoglobin variants and assay differences can affect results [^115MFVh2] [^114mu8U3].

- **Clinical discordance**: A1c may not reflect short-term glycemic fluctuations, limiting utility for acute management [^111kkd1h] [^114mu8U3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Organization** | **Recommendation regarding A1c in GDM** |
|-|-|
| ADA 2025 | - Not for GDM diagnosis <br/> - Use OGTT at 24–28 weeks <br/> - Early A1c for overt diabetes/high-risk dysglycemia <br/> - Postpartum OGTT preferred [^11485EeF] [^111mmFWr] |
| AACE 2022 | - Not for GDM diagnosis <br/> - Use OGTT <br/> - Early A1c for overt diabetes <br/> - Postpartum OGTT preferred [^117EHimW] [^113mprgg] |
| IADPSG | - Not for GDM diagnosis <br/> - Use OGTT <br/> - Early A1c for overt diabetes [^113k8xAV] |

---

## Clinical implications and outcomes

A1c is best used as a secondary measure to support glucose monitoring during pregnancy, not as a primary diagnostic tool [^114P5vpJ] [^115MFVh2]. Maintaining **A1c < 6%** is associated with reduced adverse perinatal outcomes, including lower risks of macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycemia [^112R8uCq] [^1136mPp5].

---

## Future research directions

Research should define **A1c thresholds** for early GDM risk and clarify its role in early pregnancy screening [^113k8xAV]. Studies comparing A1c with **OGTT and CGM** will help refine diagnostic strategies [^112hpZMS]. Work is also needed to understand how **hemoglobin variants** and assay differences affect A1c in pregnancy [^115MFVh2].

---

A1c is **not recommended for diagnosing GDM** because of pregnancy-related changes that reduce accuracy; it may be used early to detect overt diabetes or high-risk dysglycemia, and as a secondary measure for monitoring with a target of < 6% when feasible. Postpartum screening should rely on OGTT, not A1c.

Background

We aimed to assess the utility of HbA1c in the early detection of gestational diabetes (GDM) in the first trimester.

Methods

This prospective study was performed on 700 pregnant women in the perinatology clinic at a tertiary university hospital from March 2018 to March 2020. For all pregnant women, HbA1c and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were examined during the first trimester. Then, a GDM screening test was done within 24–28weeks of pregnancy using a 100g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as the gold standard test. The GDM diagnosis was made according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of HbA1c and FBG were calculated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

Results

Of 700 participants, one hundred and fifteen (16.4%) women had GDM. The GDM patients were significantly older and had a higher pre-gestational body mass index and pregnancy weight gain compared to the non-GDM participants. The sensitivity and specificity for ruling out GDM at an HbA1c cut-off value of 4.85% was 92.2 and 32.8%, respectively, with a 95.5% NPV and a 21.2% PPV. Furthermore, sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing GDM at an HbA1c cut-off value of 5.45% was 54.8 and 96.8%, respectively, with a 91.5% NPV and a 76.8% PPV. Using HbA1c could decline OGTT in 40.4% of the pregnant women (28.7% with HbA1c < 4.85 and 11.7% with HbA1c ≥ 5.45%).

Conclusion

It seems that the first-trimester HbA1c cannot replace OGTT for the diagnosis of GDM because of its insufficient sensitivity and specificity. However, women with higher first-trimester HbA1c had a high risk for GDM incidence.

### Utility of maternal A1c measurement in the second trimester for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus [^115vuPtR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common medical complications during pregnancy. GDM is a condition characterized by carbohydrate intolerance that either begins or is diagnosed during pregnancy. It is known that complications involving any type of diabetes mellitus occur in 7% of pregnancies, with 86% of these cases being attributed to GDM. Poor obstetric outcomes in GDM can be both poor maternal and poor fetal outcomes. Screening for GDM is typically recommended between the 24th and 28th weeks of gestation. In the United States, a two-step approach is commonly used for screening purposes, involving the consumption of 50 g of glucose followed by venous glucose measurement one hour later. In 2017, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) included HbA1c levels ≥ 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) in early screening strategies for gestational diabetes, but it currently does not recommend the use of HbA1c for the diagnosis of GDM in its guidelines. Numerous health organizations, including the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG), World Health Organization (WHO), American Diabetes Association (ADA), and National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), advocate for the 75-g single-stage o OGTT to identify gestational diabetes during pregnancy, whereas the American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (ACOG) endorses the 50-g GCT succeeded by a 100 g OGTT. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, actively incorporated and utilized HbA1c in their guidelines in second trimester to expedite hospital stays.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^114mu8U3]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Limitations of A1C as the recommended means of diagnosing diabetes

The A1C assay is the test of choice for the chronic management of diabetes and is now being recommended for its diagnosis; however, there are parts of the world where the costs of providing the assay preclude its routine use. In such circumstances, clinicians should continue to use the previously recommended approaches to diagnose diabetes based on glucose measurements. The International Expert Committee encourages clinicians worldwide to move as quickly as possible to A1C testing using standardized methods and instrumentation. However, the decision to change to A1C assays as the means of diagnosing diabetes should take into account the performance of local A1C assays and the local prevalence of conditions that may interfere with the assay. (See below.)

Although the discussion above argues for using the A1C assay for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals, there are patient conditions that either will require a specific A1C assay method or will preclude A1C testing. First, some hemoglobin traits, such as HbS, HbC, HbF, and HbE, interfere with some A1C assay methods. Currently, many assay methods can correct for the presence of the most common hemoglobin traits, and affinity assays that are unaffected by hemoglobin traits may be used. Second, any condition that changes red cell turnover, such as hemolytic anemia, chronic malaria, major blood loss, or blood transfusions, will lead to spurious A1C results. Clinicians must be aware of these conditions, particularly in populations in which they are more prevalent. As in the setting where A1C assays are unavailable, the traditional diagnostic tests (e.g. FPG, 2HPG) must be used in individuals in whom interpreting the A1C is problematic. Third, A1C levels appear to increase with age, but the extent of the change, whether it relates to factors other than glucose metabolism, and the effect of the age-related increases on the development of complications are not sufficiently clear to adopt age-specific values in a diagnostic scheme. Similarly, racial disparities in A1C, based on putative differences in the relationship between glucose levels and A1C, have been suggested; however, here too, their etiology and significance are unclear, and it is premature to establish race-specific diagnostic values. Finally, there are rare clinical settings, such as rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes, where the A1C level will not have had time to "catch up" with the acute elevations in glucose levels; however, in these very rare cases, diabetes should be diagnosable with typical symptoms and casual glucose levels > 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) despite a nondiagnostic A1C level.

### International association of diabetes and pregnancy study groups recommendations on the diagnosis and classification of hyperglycemia in pregnancy [^113k8xAV]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Immediate implications

These recommendations have widespread implications. The strategy outlined in Table 2 will finally lead to using a 75-g glucose dose for an OGTT in all clinical settings in or outside of pregnancy. In some regions and/or countries, this represents a substantial change in long-established practices. Glucose testing early in pregnancy to detect overt diabetes and again with a 75-g OGTT at 24–28 weeks' of gestation in all pregnancies not already diagnosed with overt diabetes or GDM by early testing represents fundamental changes in strategies for detection and diagnosis of hyperglycemia in pregnancy. In most areas, using the outcome-linked diagnostic criteria in Table 1 and the detection strategy in Table 2 will substantially increase the frequency of hyperglycemic disorders in pregnancy. However, this is consistent with the high prevalence of obesity and disorders of glucose metabolism in the general population of young adults and with recent reports of a rising prevalence of GDM and preexisting overt diabetes in pregnant women.

Future considerations

In future clinical practice, simpler and more cost-effective strategies that do not require performing an OGTT on most pregnant women may be developed. In the HAPO study, risks of some adverse outcomes were low when FPG was ≤ 4.4 mmol/l (80 mg/dl). However, it was thought that using FPG to potentially identify pregnancies at very low risk for GDM and for adverse outcomes requires further evaluation. Similarly, further evaluation of A1C results from the HAPO study, results from other populations, or new integrated tests of glycemia with a shorter timeframe than A1C might serve this purpose.

The HAPO study was a basic epidemiological investigation that for the first time conclusively identified strong continuous associations of maternal glucose levels below those diagnostic of diabetes with several perinatal outcomes. It was not a clinical trial, but two randomized controlled trials of treatment of mild GDM have been carried out successfully in participants with glucose values that overlap with the thresholds recommended in this report. However, it is likely that additional well-designed randomized controlled trials and other clinical studies will be needed to determine 1) cost-effective therapeutic strategies for treatment of GDM diagnosed by the IADPSG Consensus Panel–recommended criteria; 2) optimal glycemic treatment targets; 3) appropriate follow-up of mothers to determine risks for later development of diabetes, other metabolic disorders, or CVD risk factors; and 4) follow-up of children to assess potential associations of maternal glycemia with long-term risks of obesity, altered glucose metabolism, and CVD risk factors.

Although it has been accepted for decades that women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at high risk for future development of type 2 diabetes, vigorous debate regarding the value of detecting and treating GDM has persisted into the twenty-first century. Although results from 2 randomized trials provide strong evidence that treating GDM reduces adverse perinatal outcomes, it remains to be determined whether treatment impacts long-term offspring outcomes. Insulin is the first-line pharmacologic treatment and is added when glycemic goals are not met with nutritional modifications. Oral agent use is controversial, as data on long-term offspring outcomes are lacking.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a major public health problem, affecting about one in every six pregnancies globally. The field of GDM diagnosis continues to be marred by controversy, and a need to develop consensus has often been highlighted. While recommendations by major professional organizations provide consensus opinion and better our understanding on a given subject, the existence of nearly 30 different guidelines on the subject of GDM, each with a different perspective, does bring in an element of confusion.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) "Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes" developed by ADA's multidisciplinary Professional Practice Committee is updated and published annually. The standards provide clinicians and researchers with evidence-based guidelines on a broad range of topics including classification and diagnosis of diabetes, targets for glycemic control, use of technology to improve diabetes care, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of hyperglycemia, management of in-patient hyperglycemia, recognition and management of microvascular and macrovascular complications, and management of diabetes in special groups.

The guidelines provided by American Diabetes Association (ADA) on diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia in pregnancy are widely followed. Herein, we provide a critical appraisal of the recently published document, highlighting its strength and limitations with regard to the diagnosis of GDM. Finally, we provide a brief personal perspective on the subject.

### Periconception hemoglobin A1c and pregnancy outcomes in women with diabetes… [^111FF83E]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Question Among women with prepregnancy diabetes, is improved glycemic control, from preconception to early pregnancy to midpregnancy, associated with reduced risk of adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes. Findings In this population-based cohort study of 3459 births among women with prepregnancy diabetes, a reduced risk was found for congenital anomalies, preterm birth, perinatal mortality, and severe maternal morbidity per 0. 5% net absolute decline in serum glycated hemoglobin A1c from preconception up to early pregnancy to midpregnancy. Meaning These findings suggest that women with prepregnancy diabetes who achieve a reduction in glycated hemoglobin A1c from preconception up to early pregnancy to midpregnancy may have improved perinatal and maternal outcomes. Importance Prepregnancy diabetes is associated with higher perinatal and maternal morbidity, especially if periconception glycemic control is suboptimal.

It is not known whether improved glycemic control from preconception to early pregnancy and midpregnancy periods can reduce the risk of adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes. Objective To determine whether a net decline in glycated hemoglobin A1c from preconception to the first half of pregnancy is associated with a lower risk of adverse outcomes for mother and child. Design, Setting, and Participants. Among women with prepregnancy diabetes, serum glycated hemoglobin A1c provides a measure of mean blood glucose control over the preceding 90 days. 1 Women with diabetes and an elevated preconception HbA1c are at higher risk of severe maternal morbidity, 2 and their infants are more prone to congenital anomalies, 3, 4 especially cardiac malformations, 5 as well as preterm birth and death.
6.

Among women with insulin resistance who are overweight or obese, a recent Italian randomized clinical trial found that a lifestyle intervention beginning at 9 to 12 weeks' gestation improved neonatal outcomes. 24 Ongoing HbA1c control in the third trimester of pregnancy is also associated with a lower risk of perinatal mortality. 6 An additional clinically relevant finding is affirmation of the recommended periconceptional HbA1c of less than 6. 5%.
22. Our findings suggest that improved periconception HbA1c in women with prepregnancy diabetes is associated with a reduced risk of several adverse outcomes.

Testing to detect type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people, previously controversial, is now recommended for those at risk of developing the disease. The ADA proposes that all asymptomatic people ≥ 45 years of age be screened in a healthcare setting. An HbA 1c, FPG, or 2-h OGTT evaluation is appropriate for screening. The IDF recommends that the health service in each country decide whether to implement screening for diabetes. FPG is the suggested test. In contrast, the International Expert Committee and the ADA have recommended that HbA 1c can be used for screening for diabetes (see section on HbA 1c below). If an FPG result is < 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and/or a 2-h plasma glucose concentration is < 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL), testing should be repeated at 3-year intervals. Screening should be considered at a younger age or be carried out more frequently in individuals who are overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) or obese and who have a least one additional risk factor for diabetes [see for conditions associated with increased risk]. Because of the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children, screening of children is now advocated. Starting at age 10 years (or at the onset of puberty if puberty occurs at a younger age), testing should be performed every 3 years in overweight individuals who have two other risk factors — namely, family history, a race/ethnicity recognized to increase risk, signs of insulin resistance, and a maternal history of diabetes or GDM during the child's gestation. Despite these recommendations and the demonstration that interventions can delay and sometimes prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, there is as yet no published evidence that treatment based on screening has an effect on long-term complications. In addition, the published literature lacks consensus as to which screening procedure (FPG, OGTT, and/or HbA 1c) is the most appropriate (,–). On the basis of an evaluation of NHANES III data, a strategy has been proposed to use FPG to screen whites ≥ 40 years and other populations ≥ 30 years of age. The cost-effectiveness of screening for type 2 diabetes has been estimated. The incremental cost of screening all persons ≥ 25 years of age has been estimated to be $236,449 per life-year gained and $56,649 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Interestingly, screening was more cost-effective at ages younger than the 45 years currently recommended. In contrast, screening targeted to individuals with hypertension reduces the QALY from $360,966 to $34,375, with ages between 55 and 75 years being the most cost-effective. Modeling run on 1 × 10⁶ individuals suggests considerable uncertainty as to whether screening for diabetes would be cost-effective. By contrast, the results of a more recent modeling study imply that screening commencing at 30 or 45 years is highly cost-effective (< $11,000 per QALY gained). Long-term outcome studies are necessary to provide evidence to resolve the question of the efficacy of diabetes screening.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) screening and diagnosis — two-step approach recommendations — describe that a consensus panel "recommended continuing a two-step approach to screening that used a 1-h 50-g glucose loading test (GLT) followed by a 3-h 100-g OGTT for those who screened positive", and that "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends any of the commonly used thresholds of 130, 135, or 140 mg/dL for the 1-h 50-g GLT". ACOG "currently supports the two-step approach, but notes that the one-step approach, as opposed to two, may be used for the diagnosis of GDM" and "recommends either of two sets of diagnostic thresholds for the 3-h 100-g OGTT: Carpenter-Coustan or National Diabetes Data Group"; "If the two-step approach is used, it would appear advantageous to use the Carpenter-Coustan lower diagnostic thresholds, as shown in step 2 in Table 2.8". Additionally, "The use of A1C at 24–28 weeks of gestation as a screening test for GDM does not function as well as the GLT".

### Screening, diagnosis, and management of gestational diabetes mellitus [^111FUAaz]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects approximately 6% of pregnancies in the United States, and it is increasing in prevalence. Pregnant women without known diabetes mellitus should be screened for GDM after 24 weeks of gestation. Treatment of GDM results in a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of preeclampsia, shoulder dystocia, and macrosomia. Initial management includes glucose monitoring and lifestyle modifications. If glucose levels remain above target values, pharmacologic therapy with metformin, glyburide, or insulin should begin. Antenatal testing is customary for women requiring medications. Induction of labor should not occur before 39 weeks in women with GDM, unless glycemic control is poor or another indication for delivery is present. Unless otherwise indicated, scheduled cesarean delivery should be considered only in women with an estimated fetal weight greater than 4,500 g. Women with a history of GDM are at high risk of subsequently developing diabetes. These patients should be screened six to 12 weeks postpartum for persistently abnormal glucose metabolism, and should undergo screening for diabetes every three years thereafter.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112G4jps]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to formulate a clinical practice guideline for the management of the pregnant woman with diabetes.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, 5 additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and innumerable e-mail communications enabled consensus for all recommendations save one with a majority decision being employed for this single exception.

Conclusions

Using an evidence-based approach, this Diabetes and Pregnancy Clinical Practice Guideline addresses important clinical issues in the contemporary management of women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes preconceptionally, during pregnancy, and in the postpartum setting and in the diagnosis and management of women with gestational diabetes during and after pregnancy.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus: challenges in diagnosis and management [^113hSsgV]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Despite GDM being one of the most common conditions during pregnancy, the lack of data from well-designed studies leaves some uncertainty surrounding the need for screening and management of this condition. Because the condition is associated with both maternal and fetal complications, screening and managing women at appropriate gestational age is important to minimize adverse outcomes. Glycaemic control can safely be achieved with a combination of nutritional and pharmaceutical interventions. Metformin and Glyburide have been shown to be as effective as insulin in management of GDM. Effective communication between physician, patient and primary care provider is essential, as patients experience increased rates of GDM in subsequent pregnancies and a higher lifetime risk of developing non-gestational diabetes. Further studies are required to clarify the remaining controversies surrounding diagnosis and nuanced management practices.

Health care delivery for type 2 diabetes

John Buse (Chapel Hill, NC) delivered the ADA presidential lecture and reviewed evidence showing that diabetes treatment has improved over time, with lower levels of A1C, blood pressure, and cholesterol. In 1999, just 37% of diabetic patients had A1C < 7%; however, in 2003–2004 this was seen in 56% of patients with a 0.5% reduction in mean A1C over the 4-year period, although some of the apparent benefit might be explained by changes in diabetes diagnosis patterns. End-stage renal disease rates among diabetic patients increased by 86% from 1984 to 1995 but then decreased by 25% to 2002. CVD rates in the Framingham studies decreased in diabetic as well as in nondiabetic subjects over the past 50 years, Buse noted, concluding that "the face of diabetes is being transformed".

He contrasted the roles of evidence and marketing in health care delivery. Evidence-based medicine refers, he said, to a "set of principals and methods intended to ensure that to the greatest extent possible population-based policies and individual medical decisions are consistent with evidence of effectiveness and benefit". Perfect evidence is not, however, always available. Furthermore, there often are differences between population-based and individual-based outcomes, and no clinical trial can address all the complex potential interactions of conditions, so that clinical judgment is required. Effectiveness and benefit of various strategies should be taken into account to incorporate ideas of cost and value in decision making of evidence-based medicine. There are multiple potential benefits and potential adverse effects of various treatment approaches for different clinical states, so that "evidence-based" treatment does not imply use of a single cookbook approach.

1. Use

RECOMMENDATION: HbA 1c SHOULD BE MEASURED ROUTINELY IN ALL PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MELLITUS TO DOCUMENT THEIR DEGREE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL A (moderate).

Measurement of glycated proteins, primarily HbA 1c, is widely used for routine monitoring of long-term glycemic status in patients with diabetes. [The terms "glycated hemoglobin", "glycohemoglobin", "glycosylated" (which should not be used), "glucosylated hemoglobin", "HbA 1", and "HbA 1c " have all been used to refer to hemoglobin that has been modified by the nonenzymatic addition of glucose. These terms are not interchangeable, however. The current acceptable term for glycation of hemoglobin in general is "glycated hemoglobin" (GHb). HbA 1c is the specific glycated species that is modified by glucose on the N terminus of the hemoglobin β chain. "HbA 1c " is also the internationally accepted term for reporting all GHb results. Assay methods that measure total GHbs (e.g. boronate affinity methods) should be calibrated to report an equivalent HbA 1c and be reported as HbA 1c for purposes of harmonization of results. HbA 1 is composed of HbA 1a, HbA 1b, and HbA 1c and should not be measured or reported. The term "A1C test" is used by the ADA in place of HbA 1c to facilitate communication with patients. As described in the text, most of the clinical-outcome data that are available for the effects of metabolic control on complications (at least for the DCCT and UKPDS) involved the use of assay methods that quantified HbA 1c. In this report, we use the abbreviation GHb to include all forms of glycated hemoglobin.] HbA 1c is used both as an index of mean glycemia and as a measure of risk for the development of diabetes complications. HbA 1c testing and maintenance of specified concentrations during pregnancy in patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes are important for maximizing the health of the newborn and decreasing perinatal risks for the mother. Specifically, stringent control of HbA 1c values during pregnancy decreases the risk of congenital malformations, large-for-date infants, and the complications of pregnancy and delivery that can otherwise occur when glycemic control is not carefully managed. A recent consensus statement recommends an HbA 1c value of < 6% (42 mmol/mol) in these patients if it can be achieved without excessive hypoglycemia. HbA 1c is also being used increasingly by quality-assurance programs to assess the quality of diabetes care (e.g. requiring that healthcare providers document the frequency of HbA 1c testing in patients with diabetes and the proportion of patients with HbA 1c values below a specified value).

### Utility of maternal A1c measurement in the second trimester for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus [^112hpZMS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The research indicates the challenges associated with detecting gestational diabetes mellitus by HbA1c measurement. Conditions including newborn hypoglycemia and oligohydramnios diminish the efficacy of the HbA1c test for identifying GDM, hence heightening the risk of certain GDM cases being missed.

HbA1c testing may exhibit reduced accuracy compared to OGTT in identifying GDM, potentially overlooking diagnoses in some populations. This deficit may present further health hazards and treatment challenges, particularly in high-risk populations. The study's findings indicate significant considerations when utilizing HbA1c as an option for diagnosing GDM. Given the potential for overlooking women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and the associated additional hazards, HbA1c testing may be a less dependable alternative to the OGTT.

### American diabetes association "Standards of medical care-2020 for gestational diabetes mellitus": a critical appraisal [^112oJA82]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a major public health problem, affecting about one in every six pregnancies globally. The guidelines provided by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) on diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia in pregnancy are widely followed. We aim to provide a critical appraisal of the recently published ADA guidance document, highlighting its strength and limitations with regard to the diagnosis of GDM.

Methods and Results

We reviewed the recent ADA recommendations for the diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia in pregnancy. A periodic update in keeping with the emerging evidence, an inclusive diagnostic approach which increases generalizability, and a clear proposed approach for prenatal testing and postpartum follow-up are strengths of the ADA guidance document. On the other hand, its limitations are a lack of clarity on the applicability of diagnosis of GDM during early pregnancy, use of scientifically inaccurate terms such as "prediabetes" in the context of pregnancy and "overt diabetes prior to gestation" in the definition of GDM, and inconsistent use of terminology between successive publications. Certain issues which merit attention in future publications include a need for uniform global definition of GDM, demarcation of overt diabetes in pregnancy as a distinct entity, clarity on the diagnosis of GDM during early pregnancy, and clear delineation of timelines and appropriate testing strategy for the first prenatal visit.

Conclusions

This article provides a critical appraisal of the recently published ADA guidance document with regard to the diagnosis of GDM. We also share our perspective on issues warranting attention in the future publications. Experts from various professional organizations should aim for a consensus document which can resolve existing controversies in this field, and help clinicians and researchers achieve better health for women in their care.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in pregnancy — Continuous glucose monitoring can help to achieve glycemic goals (e.g., time in range, time above range) and A1C goal in type 1 diabetes and pregnancy and may be beneficial for other types of diabetes in pregnancy. Recommend CGM to pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes. In conjunction with aims to achieve traditional pre- and postprandial glycemic goals, real-time CGM can reduce the risk for large-for-gestational-age infants and neonatal hypoglycemia in pregnancy complicated by type 1 diabetes. CGM metrics may be used in combination with blood glucose monitoring to achieve optimal pre- and postprandial glycemic goals. Commonly used estimated A1C and glucose management indicator calculations should not be used in pregnancy as estimates of A1C.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a well-characterized disease affecting a significant population of pregnant women worldwide. It has been widely linked to undue weight gain associated with factors such as diet, obesity, family history, and ethnicity. Poorly controlled GDM results in maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Improved outcomes therefore rely on early diagnosis and tight glycaemic control. While straightforward protocols exist for screening and management of diabetes mellitus in the general population, management of GDM remains controversial with conflicting guidelines and treatment protocols.

### Approach to the patient with gestational diabetes after delivery [^111anDJJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) identifies patients with a pancreatic β-cell defect. In some patients, the defect is transient or stable, but in most it is progressive, imparting a high risk of diabetes for at least a decade after the index pregnancy. The β-cell defects in GDM can result from many causes, including genetic variants typical of monogenic forms of diabetes and autoimmunity typical of evolving type 1 diabetes. No specific disease-modifying therapies are available for those patients. The majority of women with GDM have clinical characteristics indicating a risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Available evidence indicates that T2D can be prevented or delayed by intensive lifestyle modification and by medications, particularly those that ameliorate insulin resistance. Clinical management should include assessment of glucose tolerance in the postpartum period to detect diabetes or assess diabetes risk. Women who don't have diabetes should be advised about their risk and participate in family planning to prevent subsequent pregnancies with undiagnosed hyperglycemia. All patients should be monitored for rising glycemia indicative of progressive β-cell deterioration. We suggest a combination of fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin measurements for this purpose. Monitoring should be initiated at least annually and should be intensified if glycemia is rising and/or impaired. Lifestyle modification is advised to reduce the risk for T2D. Like monitoring, lifestyle modification should be intensified for rising glycemia and/or development of impaired glucose levels. At present, there is insufficient evidence to recommend medications to prevent T2D. Close follow-up and monitoring will allow initiation of pharmacological treatment as soon as diabetes develops. Children of women with GDM are at increased risk for obesity and diabetes. They should receive education, monitoring, and lifestyle advice to minimize obesity and diabetes risk.

Treatment BENEFITS In the largest single trial of GDM treatment, investigators randomized 1, 000 women with GDM to no treatment or to intervention with lifestyle modifications, blood glucose self-monitoring, and insulin therapy, if needed. Adverse perinatal outcomes — defined as infant death, shoulder dystocia, bone fracture, and/or nerve palsy — were 4% in the no treatment group compared with 1% in the intervention group. 19 A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis that included five randomized controlled trials and six cohort studies found that treating GDM results in a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of preeclampsia, shoulder dystocia, and macrosomia.
20. 2, 46 Limited evidence suggests that induction of women with GDM at 39 weeks, compared with further expectant management, is associated with a lower risk of macrosomia and shoulder dystocia, 47 without increasing the risk of cesarean delivery.

48 Expectant management beyond 39 weeks is also associated with an increased risk of stillbirth, although the absolute risk remains low. 51 Women with diet-controlled GDM rarely require intrapartum insulin. 52 A variety of protocols exist to guide intrapartum management of blood glucose among women receiving insulin, but in general, glucose levels should be monitored every one to two hours during active labor, and 5% dextrose or insulin infused as needed to maintain glucose levels between 70 and 110 mg per dL. 51 It may be reasonable to have women with GDM use only one-half of their usual dose of long-acting insulin the day of delivery. Clinicians should prepare to manage shoulder dystocia at the time of delivery and exercise caution when considering an operative vaginal delivery. Women with GDM rarely need oral agents or insulin immediately after delivery.

Before discharge, it is reasonable to confirm that fasting glucose values are normal. However, short- and long-term follow-up is critical. Women with GDM should undergo screening at six to 12 weeks postpartum with a fasting glucose measurement or 75-g two-hour glucose tolerance test; up to 36% of women with GDM may have persistently abnormal glucose tolerance.

Our Perspective

As clinicians and researchers, we find the ADA guidance document to be crisp, informative, and clear. A periodic update keeps readers abreast with latest developments, and is praiseworthy. In this section, we briefly discuss certain issues that we feel merit attention in future publications.
Need for a uniform global definition of GDM Regardless of the criteria used for the diagnosis of GDM, it is imperative that this milder form of hyperglycemia in pregnancy be viewed as a distinct entity. GDM is different from its more severe counterpart "overt diabetes in pregnancy". Both entities have different diagnostic criteria, natural history, therapeutic strategies, and outcomes. We also need to resolve the controversy regarding the time of pregnancy when a diagnosis of GDM should be made. In our opinion, the definition of GDM could be reframed as "hyperglycemia diagnosed during pregnancy that is not overt diabetes".
Definition of intermediate hyperglycemia The usage of term "prediabetes" for intermediate hyperglycemia detected at the first prenatal visit should be strictly avoided because of lack of scientific evidence. Besides, it is not appropriate to use terms "prediabetes" and "GDM" interchangeably for the following reasons: (a) Diagnostic thresholds for these two conditions on a 75-g OGTT are entirely different — fasting and 2-h plasma glucose of ≥ 5.1 mmol/L and ≥ 8.5 mmol/L for GDM, and ≥ 5.6 mmol/L and ≥ 7.8 mmol/L for prediabetes. Moreover, while HbA1c can be used for diagnosis of prediabetes according to ADA criteria, the same is not true for GDM. (b) Prediabetes has only been defined outside the pregnancy and is largely managed with dietary and lifestyle modifications. On the other hand, the implications for even milder forms of hyperglycemia during pregnancy are significant and a sizeable proportion (around 20%) of women with GDM warrant pharmacotherapy. We, therefore, agree with the WHO classification which avoids the use of such confusing terminology and identifies hyperglycemia during pregnancy into two broad categories — gestational diabetes and diabetes in pregnancy.
Consistent use of terminologies While we appreciate that ADA recommendations are revised in accordance with the new evidence, the use of terminologies and their meanings should be consistent between successive documents. Wherever possible, the new term should relate to a term(s) used in the previous editions.
Clear delineation of the first prenatal visit timelines The guidelines aptly recommend testing for undiagnosed type 2 diabetes at the first prenatal visit. However, since the first prenatal visit may occur well beyond the first trimester in some women, the testing strategy may need to be individualized. For example, HbA1c may still be reliable to diagnose diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy but is likely to be affected by the physiological changes of pregnancy and provide false results subsequently. Thus, a clear mention of different timelines in the first prenatal visit with appropriate testing strategies for each would be helpful.

### Diabetes complicating pregnancy [^116XASsg]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Despite the well-documented relationship between morbidity in pregnancy and pregestational maternal diabetes, the corrected perinatal outcome is, in most series, equal to or better than that of the general reference obstetric population. No single aspect or element of contemporary management is responsible for this improvement; rather, a combination of interventions seems responsible. Targeting delivery early in term, improved compliance, better glycemic control during pregnancy, improved control at conception, improved neonatal care, family planning, and early screening for fetal abnormalities all likely contribute to improved outcome. The currently observed rates of perinatal mortality suggest that an irreducible minimum mortality rate may be reached; however, large disparities in access to care and treatment continue to result in a wide range in rates of morbidity and mortality, a fact that pertains to outcomes in general as well as to pregnancies complicated by diabetes. The identification of women with lesser degrees of hyperglycemia as diabetic by lowering the thresholds for glucose tolerance test abnormality suggests an importance of the diagnosis that is not supported by evidence of either related morbidity or therapeutic benefit. The extrapolation of risk to women with lesser degrees of hyperglycemia seems to have little basis, and the management of women with mild glucose intolerance as if they had overt diabetes is unwarranted. The excess of resources dedicated to the identification and monitoring of an increasing number of women with mild abnormalities of glucose metabolism should prompt a reevaluation of these practices. Perinatal benefits of this expenditure are difficult to document or nonexistent, and there is a predictable increase in iatrogenic morbidities associated with the diagnosis. The exception in the most recent recommendations is the addition of a random glucose measure to screen for the rare women with overt undiagnosed diabetes who presents for prenatal care, because these women are at increased risk of morbidities related to diabetes. A curious statement was made in the summary and recommendations of the fourth International Congress on Gestational Diabetes: "There remains a compelling need to develop diagnostic criteria for GDM [gestational diabetes mellitus] that are based on the specific relationships between hyperglycemia and risk of adverse outcome". If these relationships are undefined, what is the import of the diagnosis? At the author's center, application of the new diagnostic thresholds for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus has increased the incidence to over 6%. Without a clear expectation of benefit, this increase represents an unsupportable investment of resources. What are the prospects for improving understanding of the relationships between glucose intolerance and pregnancy risks? The direction of new guidelines and recommendations seems to be moving away from resolution of the relationships. The new criteria result in the diagnosis of gestational diabetes in an increasing number of women who were previously normal. It is easier to differentiate women at an extreme of hyperglycemia from normal. Investigations will be even less able to identify attributable effects of glucose intolerance in pregnancy with the inclusion of women with lesser degrees of hyperglycemia. As evidenced in O'Sullivan's original series, women with fasting hyperglycemia in pregnancy are still presumed to be at increased risk of fetal death. This risk factor remains important in clinical management if insulin treatment, fetal surveillance, and early term delivery can reduce the risk of fetal loss. At the author's center, the relationships among outpatient measures of fasting glycemia, glucose tolerance testing results, and perinatal outcomes are evaluated. Preliminary results suggest that fasting glycemia measured at the time of a 50-g glucose tolerance test is significantly correlated with and as sensitive and predictive of morbidity as the glucose tolerance test diagnosis of gestational diabetes. If these results are confirmed, it will be difficult to rationalize continued glucose tolerance testing.

### Screening for gestational diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111m2ZkP]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force — gestational diabetes screening recommendations state that pregnant persons at 24 weeks of gestation or after should undergo screening for gestational diabetes (Screen for gestational diabetes. Grade: B), whereas for pregnant persons before 24 weeks of gestation the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms for screening for gestational diabetes (Grade: I statement). This applies to pregnant persons who have not been previously diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Implementation options, if the person is pregnant and is at least 24 weeks of gestation, include a 2-step process with an oral glucose challenge test followed by an oral glucose tolerance test, or a 1-step process in which the diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test is administered to all patients. One-time screening should be performed at or after 24 weeks of gestation, and typically in the US screening occurs prior to 28 weeks of gestation; however, it can occur later in persons who enter prenatal care after 28 weeks of gestation.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus [^116ak7pp]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) represents a heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders, which result in varying degrees of maternal hyperglycemia and pregnancy-associated risk. The frequency of GDM is rising globally and may also increase further as less-stringent criteria for the diagnosis are potentially adopted. The additional burden placed on the health care system by increasing cases of GDM requires consideration of diagnostic approaches and currently used treatment strategies. Debate continues to surround both the diagnosis and treatment of GDM despite several recent large-scale studies addressing these controversial issues. As many now have come to reassess their approach to the management of GDM, we provide information in this review to help guide this process. The goal for each health care practitioner should continue to be to provide optimum care for women discovered to have carbohydrate intolerance during pregnancy.

### Pathophysiology from preconception, during pregnancy, and beyond [^117TxZAZ]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Gestational diabetes is the most common medical complication in pregnancy. Historically, gestational diabetes was considered a pregnancy complication involving treatment of rising glycaemia late in the second trimester. However, recent evidence challenges this view. Pre-pregnancy and pregnancy-specific factors influence gestational glycaemia, with open questions regarding roles of non-glycaemic factors in the aetiology and consequences of gestational diabetes. Varying patterns of insulin secretion and resistance in early and late pregnancy underlie a heterogeneity of gestational diabetes in the timing and pathophysiological subtypes with clinical implications: early gestational diabetes and insulin resistant gestational diabetes subtypes are associated with a higher risk of pregnancy complications. Metabolic perturbations of early gestational diabetes can affect early placental development, affecting maternal metabolism and fetal development. Fetal hyperinsulinaemia can affect the development of multiple fetal tissues, with short-term and long-term consequences. Pregnancy complications are prevented by managing glycaemia in early and late pregnancy in some, but not all women with gestational diabetes. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and heterogeneity of gestational diabetes will help to develop novel management approaches with focus on improved prevention of maternal and offspring short-term and long-term complications, from pre-conception, throughout pregnancy, and beyond.

### Diagnosis and management of gestational diabetes mellitus [^111Jzsgk]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Gestational diabetes occurs in 5 to 9 percent of pregnancies in the United States and is growing in prevalence. It is a controversial entity, with conflicting guidelines and treatment protocols. Recent studies show that diagnosis and management of this disorder have beneficial effects on maternal and neonatal outcomes, including reduced rates of shoulder dystocia, fractures, nerve palsies, and neonatal hypoglycemia. Diagnosis is made using a sequential model of universal screening with a 50-g one-hour glucose challenge test, followed by a diagnostic 100-g three-hour oral glucose tolerance test for women with a positive screening test. Treatment consists of glucose monitoring, dietary modification, exercise, and, when necessary, pharmacotherapy to maintain euglycemia. Insulin therapy is the mainstay of treatment, although glyburide and metformin may become more widely used. In women receiving pharmacotherapy, antenatal testing with nonstress tests and amniotic fluid indices beginning in the third trimester is generally used to monitor fetal well-being. The method and timing of delivery are controversial. Women with gestational diabetes are at high risk of subsequent development of type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle modification should therefore be encouraged, along with regular screening for diabetes.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115MFVh2]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Standards of Care in Diabetes-2025 — A1C testing for screening/diagnosis, discordance management, and assay requirements specifies that "Point-of-care A1C testing for diabetes screening and diagnosis should be restricted to devices approved for diagnosis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified laboratories that perform testing of moderate complexity or higher by trained personnel", and instructs to "Evaluate for the possibility of a problem or interference with either test when there is consistent and substantial discordance between blood glucose values and A1C test results". In conditions with an altered A1C–glycemia relationship (e.g., some hemoglobin variants; pregnancy [second and third trimesters and the postpartum period]; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; HIV; hemodialysis; recent blood loss or transfusion; hemolysis; erythropoietin therapy), "plasma glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes". Methodologically, "The A1C test should be performed using a method that is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP)… and standardized or traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reference assay". For point-of-care use, "A1C assays may be NGSP certified and cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in monitoring glycemic management" and "FDA-approved point-of-care A1C testing can be used in laboratories or sites that are CLIA certified, are inspected, and meet the CLIA quality standards", which "include… participation three times per year in an approved proficiency testing program".

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114VmJfC]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to glycemic targets, during pregnancy, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that HbA1c is slightly lower during pregnancy in individuals with or without diabetes due to increased RBC turnover. Set an HbA1c goal in pregnancy of < 6% (< 42 mmol/mol) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia. Consider relaxing the goal to < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) if necessary to prevent hypoglycemia.

### Utility of maternal A1c measurement in the second trimester for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus [^112UeiTv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Our objective was to classify HbA1c ranges and various degrees of glycemic regulation. It also facilitated a more thorough assessment of the adverse consequences linked to gestational diabetes, including preeclampsia and neonatal hypoglycemia.

No significant difference was observed in the subgroup comparison of neonatal hypoglycemia. The absence of a notable distinction among neonatal hypoglycemia subgroups may result from various factors, including the multifaceted nature of neonatal hypoglycemia, the insignificant variation in HbA1c levels, limited sample sizes within the subgroups, constraints of the study design, or other unaccounted confounding variables in the analysis. Although HbA1c serves as a measure of long-term glucose regulation, it may not accurately represent glucose variability throughout pregnancy. Consequently, HbA1c may not serve as a robust predictor of newborn hypoglycemia, particularly in instances of gestational diabetes.

Other studies have found that elevated HbA1c levels may be associated with large-for-gestational-age (LGA) and preterm labor. In second trimester McIntyre et al. evaluated cases diagnosed with GDM using the routine two-step 75-g OGTT accepted in the UK and considered non-diagnosed cases according to modified GDM (HbA1c ≥ 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) and/or fasting plasma glucose ≥ 5.6 mmol/L as "missed GDM cases". Statistically significant higher rates of preterm birth, LGA infants, neonatal hypoglycemia, increased neonatal adipose tissue, and hypertension during pregnancy were observed in these cases. This finding in the present study can be interpreted as follows. This may indicate that the follow-up and treatment of patients diagnosed with GDM are well managed. Falavigna et al. conducted a systematic study at different locations to estimate the effectiveness of treating GDM, encompassing various adverse outcomes associated with GDM. In a systematic review incorporating 7 randomized controlled trials conducted in different countries, a decrease in relative risks for macrosomia, LGA, and shoulder dystocia was observed following GDM treatment. The prognostic value of HbA1c for adverse obstetric outcomes of GDM needs to be further evaluated through prospective studies.

1. Use

RECOMMENDATION: ALL PREGNANT WOMEN NOT PREVIOUSLY KNOWN TO HAVE DIABETES SHOULD UNDERGO TESTING FOR GDM At 24–28 WEEKS OF GESTATION A (high).

GDM has been defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition occurring during pregnancy. After recent discussions, the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) recommended that high-risk women who have diabetes established according to standard criteria (Table 4) at their initial prenatal visit receive a diagnosis of overt, not gestational, diabetes. The IADPSG recommendations are not identical to the criteria for nonpregnant individuals, in that an OGTT result with an FPG value < 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) and 2-h value > 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) is not called "overt diabetes". As the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes has increased, the number of women with undiagnosed diabetes has risen. Therefore, the ADA now recommends that women with risk factors for type 2 diabetes be screened for diabetes according to standard diagnostic criteria (Table 4) at the first prenatal visit. Women with diabetes diagnosed with this approach should receive a diagnosis of overt diabetes.

Two randomized clinical trials have now demonstrated a benefit from the treatment of "mild" GDM. Both studies found that treatment of GDM can reduce both serious adverse outcomes and the frequency of large babies (macrosomia).

### Early screening and treatment of women with prediabetes: a randomized controlled trial [^1174EJor]. American Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether women with prediabetes benefit from early treatment for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

Study Design

Women with a glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (A1C) of 5.7 to 6.4% at < 14 weeks were recruited. Participants were randomized to usual care or treatment for GDM with diet, blood glucose monitoring, and insulin as needed. The primary outcome was a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test at 26 to 28 weeks. Secondary outcomes included cesarean delivery, birthweight, weight gain, and A1C change.

Results

Between May 2012 and June 2014, 95 women were enrolled and 83 had data for analysis; 42 were randomized to treatment and 41 to usual care. The groups were similar in baseline characteristics with 40% obese. There was no difference in the primary outcome (treatment 45.2% vs. control 56.1%; relative risk [RR] 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53–1.24) except that women in the treatment group had a significantly lower A1C over time than women in the control group (p = 0.04). Nonobese women (n = 50) treated for GDM experienced a 50% reduction in GDM compared with controls (29.6 vs. 60.9%; RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.25–0.95).

Conclusion

Early treatment for women with a first-trimester A1C of 5.7 to 6.4% did not significantly reduce the risk of GDM except in nonobese women.

Strengths of ADA Standards of Medical Care in the Context of GDM

Periodic update Guidelines are formulated on the basis of available evidence that keeps changing with time. This means that guidelines should be updated at periodic intervals. Glyburide (glibenclamide) is a good example of this need. While glyburide was initially preferred over metformin as an alternative to insulin, a 2015 meta-analysis and systematic review suggested that it was associated with a higher rate of neonatal hypoglycemia and macrosomia than insulin or metformin. On the basis of the new data, its role in management of GDM was downplayed in the subsequent ADA guidelines. On the other hand, the Endocrine Society guidelines, which have not been updated since 2013, continue to refer glyburide as the preferred agent. Thus, a regular update of the ADA guidance document in a time-bound manner (released every January as a special supplement) is one of its main strengths.
Flexibility in approach to reflect prevailing practices In the USA, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) still recommend the use of a two-step strategy for screening and diagnosis of GDM. This involves an initial screening with 50-g glucose challenge followed by a 3-h 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) interpreted according to Carpenter and Coustan criteria in those who are screen positive. In 2011, ADA modified its recommendation to one-step diagnosis of GDM using International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) criteria instead of the two-step strategy proposed earlier. However, in 2014, ADA amended its viewpoint and recommended the use of either strategy for diagnosis of GDM, while stating that different strategies will identify different degrees of hyperglycemia severity and maternal and fetal risks. In a similar vein, Diabetes Canada Clinical Practice Guidelines identify a preferred (two-step) and an alternate (one-step) screening strategy for GDM. Such an inclusive approach increases generalizability, avoids conflicts, and respects varied viewpoints, especially when the evidence is equivocal.
Clear approach for prenatal testing and postpartum follow-up ADA guidelines clearly highlight the timing and nature of tests to be performed during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. There is an emphasis on testing for hyperglycemia at the first prenatal visit in high-risk women using standard diagnostic criteria [fasting plasma glucose and/or 2-h plasma glucose post 75-g glucose load and/or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)]. This is in response to the increasing burden of undiagnosed diabetes in women of reproductive age worldwide. Screening for GDM at 24–28 weeks is appropriately recommended for women found to have normoglycemia on the initial visit and in those who missed the test in earlier visit. There are data on the increased risk of adverse glycemic outcomes among women with GDM and the guidelines aptly bring about the need for testing these high-risk women at 4–12 weeks postpartum using a 75-g OGTT. The preference for OGTT over HbA1c is based upon the increased sensitivity of the former and possibility of misleading results with the latter within 3 months after the delivery. Considering an increase in the lifetime risk for developing diabetes among women with GDM, further testing is recommended in those with normal postpartum OGTT every 1–3 years. The assessment may be performed using annual fasting plasma glucose, annual HbA1c, or three-yearly 75-g OGTT. Finally, there is a clear emphasis on the importance of breastfeeding, contraception, and preconceptional evaluation in women with a history of GDM.

### Frequent monitoring of A1c during pregnancy as a treatment tool to guide therapy [^111kkd1h]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

A1C is routinely measured approximately every 3 months in individuals with diabetes to assess the mean glucose concentration. The erythrocyte life span is ∼120 days. Thus, the 3-month interval between tests of A1C reflects the mean blood glucose over the preceding weeks to months. There are no clear guidelines for the frequency of testing A1C during pregnancy. In pregnancies complicated by type 1 or type 2 diabetes, most studies report the relationship between the first trimester A1C and the risk of spontaneous abortion and/or congenital malformations. The goal for therapy in pregestational diabetes is to sustain the A1C at < 6.0%, although this level of A1C assumes that the measurement is performed only once each trimester. In addition, A1C is not recommended routinely in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The life span of the erythrocyte during pregnancy is shortened to ∼90 days, and thus the test measures the mean glucose over a shorter time interval than in the nonpregnant state. Hence, the rate of change of A1C in pregnancy reflects the glycemic control over the past few weeks. Therefore, the measurement of A1C more frequently during pregnancy may be used to guide therapeutic decisions in all pregnancies complicated by diabetes including GDM. The aim of this study was to document the rate of A1C decline during the first 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment in women with GDM.

### Definition, size of the problem, screening and diagnostic criteria: who should be screened, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility of screening [^115VvJcD]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2009). Low credibility.

The epidemic of obesity and increased prevalence of diabetes necessitates reconsideration of its definition and screening by separating type 2 diabetic women from women with gestational diabetes to provide a better model of care. The unique problems concerning an undiagnosed type 2 diabetic woman are not major issues in the gestational diabetic woman. This review underscores the need for a unique diagnosis for women with moderate to severe hyperglycemia and/or other evidence of long-standing diabetes complications, and the urgent need for more intensive surveillance and treatment than is otherwise available for gestational diabetic women.

The two-step approach uses a nonfasting 1-h 50-g glucose challenge test with 1-h PG screening threshold of 130 or 140 mg/dL; for women with a positive screening test, the 3-h 100-g OGTT is diagnostic when 2 or more thresholds are met: FPG ≥ 95 mg/dL, 1-h ≥ 180 mg/dL, 2-h ≥ 155 mg/dL, 3-h ≥ 140 mg/dL.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus: risks and management during and after pregnancy [^1156M3jR]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2012). Medium credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) carries a small but potentially important risk of adverse perinatal outcomes and a long-term risk of obesity and glucose intolerance in offspring. Mothers with GDM have an excess of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and a high risk of developing diabetes mellitus thereafter. Diagnosing and treating GDM can reduce perinatal complications, but only a small fraction of pregnancies benefit. Nutritional management is the cornerstone of treatment; insulin, glyburide and metformin can be used to intensify treatment. Fetal measurements complement maternal glucose monitoring in the identification of pregnancies that require such intensification. Glucose testing shortly after delivery can stratify the short-term diabetes risk in mothers. Thereafter, annual glucose and HbA(1c) testing can detect deteriorating glycaemic control, a harbinger of future diabetes mellitus, usually type 2 diabetes mellitus. Interventions that mitigate obesity or its metabolic effects are most potent in preventing or delaying diabetes mellitus. Lifestyle modification is the primary approach; use of medications for diabetes prevention after GDM remains controversial. Family planning enables optimization of health in subsequent pregnancies. Breastfeeding may reduce obesity in children and is recommended. Families should be encouraged to help children adopt lifestyles that reduce the risk of obesity.

In respect to gestational diabetes management, in spite of updated diagnostic criteria based on evidence-based outcome indicators, there appears to be continuing non-conformity of the diagnostic criteria to diagnose GDM, with less than 20% relying on the currently recommended IADPSG criteria. About 40% are still relying on past criteria. The adoption of standard uniform criteria is essential to ensure conformity with evidence-based guidelines and to enable comparisons of management outcomes between communities and countries. While the current guidelines still promote the use of insulin in managing GDM because of concerns regarding potential long-term effects of oral hypoglycaemic agents on the foetus, there is still a role for these agents especially in environments where close monitoring or where patient compliance may be an issue. Only about a quarter of respondents actually reported incorporating oral hypoglycaemic agents as part of their therapeutic armamentarium in the management of GDM. In contrast about 60% of respondents were willing to use insulin analogues in the management of GDM.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes confers mother and offspring to perinatal and postnatal consequences that are primarily related to degree of maternal hyperglycemia. Actually, routine diagnostic testing by glucose challenge or tolerance tests is broadly applied during 24th–28th gestational weeks (GW). However, maternal dysglycemia develops earlier to diagnosis and by crossing the placenta in greater quantities, glucose as a substrate induces fetal overgrowth. Considering the delay of first clinical contact after laboratory testing as well as time for instruction of self-glucose measurements and implementation of dietary measures considerable time passes where the fetus is exposed to excess intrauterine hyperglycemia. In more severe cases of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) this could have detrimental consequences because time for intensive interventions gets limited.

Various organizations recommend an early screening for glucometabolic disorders during pregnancy but there is no consistent GDM strategy. This condition is already emphasized as it was recently outlined that controversies will remain as long as profound scientific evidence is lacking. A universal implementation of a strategy would require a simple but effective tool for risk stratification that identifies relevant glucose intolerance with imminent threat for fetal and pregnancy outcome as early as possible — but without elevating associated costs and this is quite challenging. The actual pandemic situation due to the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrates impressively the relevance of fast, reliable and simple parameters that enable appropriate adaptations of diagnostic strategies when access to healthcare services is limited. In this context hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) gains interest as for its practicability and convenience in clinical practice. Further HbA1c gives an estimate of average glucose over the prior 3 months, why guidelines recommend to set an HbA1c of 6.5% during first trimester as a threshold for unrecognized pre-existing diabetes. However, risk for perinatal complications increases in proportion to elevation in maternal HbA1c. Thus, an HbA1c range below 6.5% but corresponding to pre-diabetes in non-pregnant state might also have some merit in identifying women with enhanced risk for perinatal complications related to maternal glucose deterioration already during early pregnancy. Against expectation only a few studies focused on HbA1c for evaluation of baseline glycemic situation before regular screening period in second/third trimester. Most recently, data from a case–control study showed a linear association of HbA1c level and GDM development such that women with 5.7% HbA1c had an almost three times elevated GDM risk. Moreover, longitudinal measurements throughout pregnancy remained different between women with GDM and controls. But before arguing about clinical reliability it is indicated to further characterize the contribution of HbA1c to prediction of GDM by a more detailed evaluation of pathophysiological associations. In this matter, it could be of interest how well HbA1c reflects glucose deterioration and correlates to severity of insulin resistance or beta-cell dysfunction during early gestation.

Conclusion

It seems that the first-trimester HbA1c, because of its insufficient sensitivity or specificity, cannot replace OGTT for the diagnosis of GDM. However, women with higher first-trimester HbA1c have a high risk for GDM.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, SOGC 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain screening for diabetes in all pregnant individuals between 24–28 weeks of gestation, using a standardized non-fasting 50-g glucose challenge screening test with plasma glucose measured 1 hour later. Do not obtain further testing if the value is < 7.8 mmol/L. Obtain a 2-hour 75-g OGTT with fasting plasma glucose, 1-hour plasma glucose, and 2-hour plasma glucose if the value of the glucose challenge screening is 7.8–11.0.

3.2 Diagnosis of diabetes

At symptomatic stages, diabetes diagnosis is traditionally made based on measurements of dysglycaemia. This includes elevated haemoglobin A1c levels, as well as elevated fasting or random plasma glucose levels (Table 2). The haemoglobin A1c is a measure of glycated haemoglobin, an indirect measure of glucose exposure, that can estimate the average glucose level over the preceding 2–3 months. Although convenient as a screening tool, it has lower sensitivity than other methods and limited utility in individuals with certain hemoglobinopathies or increased red blood cell turnover, such as pregnant women or those with anaemia. It can also be affected by liver or kidney disease and certain medications. Diagnosis can also be made based on plasma glucose levels measured fasting, as part of an oral glucose tolerance test, or with elevated random levels in the setting of symptomatic hyperglycaemia. Given that fasting and random glucose levels can also be influenced by transient factors such as physical activity levels, illness, or acute stress response, oral glucose tolerance testing may be required to identify individuals with mild or moderate hyperglycaemia.

TABLE 2
Clinical tools used for the diagnosis and classification of diabetes.

The oral glucose tolerance test is typically performed by measuring plasma glucose levels 2 hours after administering a 75‐gram glucose load to a fasting patient. The increased sensitivity makes the oral glucose tolerance test preferable for screening certain individuals, including those at risk for cystic fibrosis‐related diabetes and post‐transplant diabetes. It is also the recommended diagnostic tool for gestational diabetes, although the glucose loads, timing, and diagnostic criteria differ for gestational diabetes. Oral glucose tolerance testing is also now being used to screen individuals with positive islet autoantibodies for dysglycaemia, aiming to identify individuals with Stage 2 type 1 diabetes who may benefit from teplizumab therapy to delay the onset of symptomatic diabetes. Multiple strategies have been suggested to implement screening programmes to identify high‐risk individuals who would benefit from ongoing autoantibody and oral glucose tolerance test screening for early‐stage type 1 diabetes and dysglycaemia. Although continuous glucose monitors are now widely used in the management of diabetes, they are not currently recommended for use in diagnosis. However, there is increasing evidence that because they provide more longitudinal data, the use of continuous glucose monitors may be more effective, even than oral glucose tolerance testing, in detecting early dysglycaemia in early stages of type 2 diabetes and in other high‐risk populations.
