## Question

Can bupropion cure thyrotoxic periodic paralysis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether bupropion cures thyrotoxic periodic paralysis and, more broadly, whether it has any role in treating TPP and what the evidence shows. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and standard of care for TPP. Then, I should review what bupropion actually does pharmacologically. Next, I will examine whether there is any mechanistic or clinical evidence linking bupropion to improvement in TPP. After that, I should assess potential risks and drug–drug interactions in the TPP context. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, guideline‑aligned conclusion and practical implications, verifying consistency with authoritative sources as I go [^1115L9wk] [^112rgMD2] [^115jGJ5n] [^11175Daw] [^116qTvFT].

> Let me first confirm what TPP is and why it happens, because if I miss the core mechanism, I might misjudge which therapies make sense. TPP presents with acute, painless flaccid weakness and hypokalemia driven by a transcellular shift of potassium into skeletal muscle caused by thyroid hormone–sensitized Na⁺/K⁺‑ATPase, further stimulated by catecholamines and insulin, with classic triggers such as carbohydrate loading and rest after exertion, and attacks cease once the hyperthyroidism is controlled [^1115L9wk] [^114qsEFs] [^1157fz3a].

> I should confirm evidence‑based acute and definitive management, because that frames what "works" in TPP. The mainstays are cautious potassium repletion with cardiac monitoring to avoid rebound hyperkalemia, nonselective β‑blockade (e.g., propranolol) to blunt adrenergic stimulation and rapidly reverse weakness and hypokalemia, and definitive treatment of the thyrotoxicosis with antithyroid therapy or radioiodine; in contrast to familial HypoPP, acetazolamide can precipitate attacks and should be avoided in TPP [^112rgMD2] [^111baf2B] [^114M38tp] [^111nAaKe] [^115jGJ5n].

> Now, I need to check what bupropion actually does, because if its pharmacology doesn't intersect with TPP biology, it's unlikely to help. Bupropion is a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor indicated for depression and smoking cessation, it does not reduce thyroid hormone synthesis or action, and it is a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor that can raise levels of drugs like metoprolol; importantly, it carries hypertension warnings and lowers the seizure threshold [^11175Daw] [^116qTvFT] [^113ag92W] [^112Vh7mB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could there be a mechanistic angle I'm missing. TPP pathophysiology hinges on thyroid‑hormone–upregulated Na⁺/K⁺‑ATPase and catecholamine/insulin surges that drive intracellular potassium shift; bupropion does not inhibit Na⁺/K⁺‑ATPase, does not attenuate thyroid hormone effects, and its noradrenergic activity is associated with blood pressure elevation, so if anything, it could theoretically worsen adrenergic drive rather than mitigate it in TPP [^1115L9wk] [^11175Daw] [^112gjDtB].

> Wait, let me verify whether any guideline, review, or case series even mentions bupropion for TPP, because an outlier report could change the calculus. The American Thyroid Association guidelines and multiple reviews and case series outline potassium repletion, nonselective β‑blockers, and antithyroid therapy as the acute and definitive treatments, and none mention bupropion as a therapy or adjunct for TPP, nor do they suggest any role for norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibition in this condition [^115jGJ5n] [^112rgMD2] [^1115L9wk] [^114szdpf].

> I should double-check safety concerns in the TPP setting, because a neutral drug mechanistically could still be harmful clinically. Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and is flagged for hypertension; those risks are concerning in patients with severe electrolyte shifts and catecholamine excess in TPP, and its strong CYP2D6 inhibition can raise metoprolol levels if a cardioselective β‑blocker is used, complicating rate control and hypotension risk, with no offsetting TPP benefit [^11175Daw] [^113kVXrS] [^116qTvFT] [^113ag92W].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could there be any indirect benefit via mood or smoking cessation that impacts TPP episodes. I should confirm that such indirect effects are speculative at best and not a basis for TPP treatment, as no data link bupropion use to reduced frequency or severity of TPP attacks, and standard triggers and prevention hinge on thyroid control, β‑blockade, and avoiding carbohydrate surges, not on catecholamine reuptake modulation [^112rgMD2] [^114qsEFs].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the conclusion aligns with mechanism, evidence, and safety. Bupropion does not cure TPP, is not an established or plausible treatment for reversing the intracellular potassium shift or thyrotoxicosis, and introduces avoidable risks; the correct approach remains cautious potassium repletion, nonselective β‑blockade for rapid reversal, and prompt definitive therapy of hyperthyroidism per guidelines [^112rgMD2] [^111baf2B] [^115jGJ5n].

---

Bupropion is **not indicated** for thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) and **lacks evidence of benefit** [^111mp7Z8] [^114qsEFs]. TPP is managed with **potassium repletion** [^1115L9wk], **non-selective beta-blockers** [^111baf2B], and **definitive control of hyperthyroidism** [^111mp7Z8]. Bupropion's noradrenergic effects **may worsen TPP** by increasing Na+/K+-ATPase activity [^1115L9wk] [^114qsEFs], and it carries risks of hypertension [^11175Daw] and seizures [^113kVXrS], which can complicate TPP management. There are **no clinical trials or case reports** supporting bupropion for TPP, and its use is **not recommended** [^111mp7Z8].

---

## Pathophysiology of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis

TPP is characterized by **acute, reversible muscle weakness** due to hypokalemia from an intracellular shift of potassium, rather than total body potassium loss [^114qsEFs]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity**: Thyroid hormones upregulate Na+/K+-ATPase [^1115L9wk], driving potassium into cells and causing hypokalemia [^114qsEFs].

- **Adrenergic stimulation**: Hyperthyroidism increases catecholamines [^114qsEFs], further stimulating Na+/K+-ATPase [^1115L9wk].

- **Insulin sensitivity**: Hyperinsulinemia after high-carb meals or strenuous exercise can precipitate attacks by enhancing potassium shift [^115CC5dg] [^1115L9wk].

---

## Current standard treatment for TPP

The standard treatment for TPP comprises **three main strategies** [^111mp7Z8]:

- **Acute management**: Careful potassium supplementation to correct hypokalemia and reverse paralysis, with close monitoring to avoid rebound hyperkalemia [^1115L9wk] [^114M38tp].

- **Beta-blockers**: Non-selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) rapidly reverse paralysis [^111baf2B] and prevent recurrence by blocking adrenergic stimulation of Na+/K+-ATPase [^111mp7Z8].

- **Definitive therapy**: Antithyroid drugs (methimazole, propylthiouracil), radioactive iodine, or thyroidectomy to achieve euthyroidism and prevent future attacks [^1115L9wk] [^111mp7Z8].

---

## Pharmacological profile of bupropion

Bupropion is a **norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI)** used for depression [^115bBEFP] and smoking cessation [^113T1yPM]; it increases norepinephrine and dopamine, potentially raising sympathetic tone. It carries a dose-related seizure risk, especially in predisposed patients [^113kVXrS], and can elevate blood pressure, particularly with other sympathomimetics [^11175Daw].

---

## Potential interaction between bupropion and TPP pathophysiology

Bupropion's noradrenergic activation may increase sympathetic activity and stimulate Na+/K+-ATPase, promoting an intracellular shift of potassium and **worsening hypokalemia** [^1115L9wk] [^114qsEFs]. Because hypokalemia lowers the seizure threshold, bupropion's pro-convulsant potential may increase seizure risk during TPP attacks [^113kVXrS]. Bupropion-induced hypertension may also complicate TPP management [^11175Daw].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding bupropion in TPP

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting bupropion for TPP — no randomized or observational studies evaluate it, no published case reports document benefit or use, and no professional guidelines recommend it [^111mp7Z8] [^114qsEFs].

---

## Risks and contraindications of bupropion in TPP patients

Bupropion carries **significant risks** and contraindications relevant to TPP:

- **Seizure risk**: Contraindicated in patients with conditions that lower seizure threshold, including metabolic disturbances like hypokalemia.

- **Hypertension**: Can cause or worsen hypertension, complicating TPP management [^11175Daw] [^112gjDtB].

- **Drug interactions**: CYP2D6 inhibition may interact with other medications used in TPP management [^113ag92W] [^116qTvFT].

---

## Comparison with standard TPP treatments

Bupropion **does not address the underlying pathophysiology** of TPP, unlike standard treatments:

| **Attribute** | **Potassium supplementation** | **Non-selective beta-blockers** | **Antithyroid drugs** | **Bupropion** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Mechanism of action | Corrects hypokalemia | Blocks adrenergic stimulation of Na+/K+-ATPase | Achieves euthyroidism | Noradrenergic/dopaminergic activity |
| Clinical evidence | Strong evidence | Strong evidence | Strong evidence | No evidence |
| Guideline recommendation | Recommended [^1115L9wk] [^114M38tp] | Recommended [^111baf2B] [^111mp7Z8] | Recommended [^1115L9wk] [^111mp7Z8] | Not recommended [^111mp7Z8] [^114qsEFs] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Bupropion is **not indicated** for TPP and may theoretically worsen attacks due to its noradrenergic effects [^114qsEFs]. There is **no clinical evidence** supporting its use, and it carries risks of seizures and hypertension, which can complicate TPP management [^113kVXrS] [^11175Daw]. Clinicians should use **established therapies** — potassium repletion, non-selective beta-blockers, and definitive control of hyperthyroidism — to manage TPP effectively [^1115L9wk] [^111mp7Z8].

### Contraveextended-release [^113kVXrS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Bupropion, a component of CONTRAVE, can cause seizures. The risk of seizures is dose-related. The incidence of seizures in patients receiving CONTRAVE in clinical trials was approximately 0.1% compared to 0% with placebo. CONTRAVE should be discontinued and not restarted in patients who experience a seizure while being treated with CONTRAVE.

The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. Consider these risks before initiating treatment with CONTRAVE. CONTRAVE is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder, or prior diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or those undergoing abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs. Caution should be used when prescribing CONTRAVE to patients with predisposing factors that may increase the risk of seizures, including:

- **History or conditions**: History of head trauma or prior seizure, severe stroke, arteriovenous malformation, central nervous system tumor or infection, or metabolic disorders (e.g. hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia).
- **Substance use or withdrawal**: Excessive use of alcohol or sedatives, addiction to cocaine or stimulants, or withdrawal from sedatives.
- **Diabetes management**: Patients with diabetes treated with insulin and/or oral diabetic medications (sulfonylureas and meglitinides) that may cause hypoglycemia.
- **Concomitant medications**: Concomitant administration of medications that may lower the seizure threshold, including other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic steroids.

### Clinical review: Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: a diagnostic challenge [^1115L9wk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this article was to review the clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP).

- **Evidence acquisition**: A MEDLINE search was conducted for articles published during the last 40 years based on the keywords thyrotoxic periodic paralysis and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. A total of 281 primary articles and 168 references of the retrieved articles were also reviewed.

- **Evidence synthesis**: TPP is a common complication of hyperthyroidism in Asian men but is increasingly seen in Western countries. Hypokalemia and muscle paralysis result from a sudden intracellular shift of potassium and is not due to potassium deficiency. Clinical features of hyperthyroidism in patients with TPP may be subtle. Immediate potassium supplementation prevents serious cardiopulmonary complications and may hasten the recovery of muscle weakness. Nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers can ameliorate and prevent recurrence of the paralytic attacks. This episodic paralysis will remit with definitive control of hyperthyroidism. Increased sodium-potassium ATPase pump activity and enhanced insulin response in patients with TPP is postulated to contribute to the hypokalemia. The genetic predisposition for TPP is not entirely clear. Association of polymorphisms of the calcium channel alpha1-subunit gene with TPP has been noted.

- **Conclusions**: Due to population mobility, TPP is increasingly common in Western countries. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment prevent life-threatening complications associated with hypokalemia and muscle weakness.

### Propranolol rapidly reverses paralysis, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia in thyrotoxic periodic paralysis [^111baf2B]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia are commonly encountered during paralysis in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) and may contribute to neuromuscular manifestations. Potassium and phosphate supplements have been recommended to hasten recovery and prevent cardiopulmonary complications; however, this recommendation has not yet proven efficacious. Hyperadrenergic activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of TPP. We tested whether nonselective beta-blockers could terminate neuromuscular symptoms rapidly while reducing an intracellular shift of potassium and phosphate.

- **Patient case study**: We describe two patients who had an acute attack of TPP with characteristic hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia associated with low urinary potassium and phosphate excretion. After oral propranolol, 3 mg/kg, serum potassium and phosphate concentrations increased promptly in 2 hours in both patients, resulting in complete amelioration of paralysis. No rebound hyperkalemia or hyperphosphatemia was detected.

Given their efficacy in this pilot study, propranolol should be considered as a first-line therapy for TPP.

### Bupropion hydrochloride [^11175Daw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets can result in elevated blood pressure and hypertension. It is essential to assess blood pressure before initiating treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets and to monitor blood pressure periodically during treatment. The risk of hypertension is increased if bupropion hydrochloride tablets are used concomitantly with MAOIs or other drugs that increase dopaminergic or noradrenergic activity [see Contraindications (4)].

Data from a comparative trial involving the sustained-release formulation of bupropion HCl, nicotine transdermal system (NTS), the combination of sustained-release bupropion plus NTS, and placebo as an aid to smoking cessation, suggest a higher incidence of treatment-emergent hypertension in patients treated with the combination of sustained-release bupropion and NTS. In this trial, 6.1% of subjects treated with the combination of sustained-release bupropion and NTS experienced treatment-emergent hypertension, compared with 2.5%, 1.6%, and 3.1% of subjects treated with sustained-release bupropion, NTS, and placebo, respectively. The majority of these subjects showed evidence of pre-existing hypertension. Three subjects (1.2%) treated with the combination of sustained-release bupropion and NTS, and one subject (0.4%) treated with NTS, required discontinuation of study medication due to hypertension; this was not the case for any of the subjects treated with sustained-release bupropion or placebo. Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended in patients who receive the combination of bupropion and nicotine replacement.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: A spine consultation [^1157fz3a]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

The acute presentation of extremity weakness is a potentially emergent situation, which may result in consultation of the spine service. Although there are many pathologies of spinal etiology (including compression due to hemorrhage, infection, neoplasm, or disk herniation) that may result in the sudden onset of weakness without inciting trauma, the examining orthopaedic surgeon or neurosurgeon should consider other non-spinal etiologies in their differential diagnosis. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is one such condition that, while rare, can result in notable sequelae if unrecognized and untreated.

TPP is a condition characterized by thyrotoxicosis, hypokalemia, and paralysis, most often occurring in men of Asian or Hispanic descent. Although uncommon, it is increasingly reported in the United States because of the rising immigrant population. The paralysis associated with this condition most often affects the lower extremities. The hypokalemia results from an intracellular shift of potassium induced by thyroid hormone sensitization of Na+/K+ ATPase.

It is important for clinicians to be aware of the pathology and presentation of TPP because it often manifests similarly to another condition, familial periodic paralysis. Misdiagnosis can result in a delay of appropriate treatment. Although both conditions may present with paralysis and hypokalemia, subtle differences, such as no family history of paralysis, hyperthyroid symptoms, male sex, and presentation between second and fourth decades of life, can aid in the diagnosis of TPP. Prompt diagnosis allows for definitive treatment.

### Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis secondary to subclinical hyperthyroidism: an uncommon cause of acute muscle paralysis [^117AWvRd]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

As a result of difficulty walking due to lower limb weakness, I faced a challenging time, especially as I live alone in a third-story apartment and my work primarily involves traveling. My family and I feel relieved that my condition improved.

- **Learning points**: Although hypokalaemic periodic paralysis is more common in hyperthyroidism, this case report demonstrates that it can also occur in subclinical hyperthyroidism. A very high index of suspicion is needed among treating physicians to diagnose this condition. This is because even in patients with hyperthyroidism, thyrotoxic symptoms can be absent during a hypokalaemic periodic paralysis attack in 10%–25% of cases, making the diagnosis extremely challenging.

Treatment of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis secondary to hyperthyroidism involves prompt potassium replacement, either orally or intravenously, depending on the potassium deficit and the severity of weakness. It is crucial to remember that rebound hyperkalaemia can occur during the replacement period, and fatal cardiac arrhythmias have been reported. Therefore, serum potassium must be closely monitored during treatment.

Apart from potassium replacement, it is necessary to initiate treatment with non-selective beta-blockers and anti-thyroid medication in this condition to prevent further episodes of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis, even in subclinical hyperthyroidism.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis in a Hispanic man after the administration of prednisone [^114GdS7p]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

To present a case of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) in a Hispanic man and to discuss the potential precipitating mechanisms, we reviewed the clinical and laboratory findings relative to the occurrence of TPP in a 34-year-old Hispanic man who had been diagnosed with Graves' disease.

TPP is a rare complication of thyrotoxicosis. The two known triggers of TPP are high carbohydrate intake and rest after strenuous physical activity. Other precipitating factors include ingestion of alcohol, infection, trauma, emotional stress, and exposure to cold. Nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agents are used as prophylaxis for the paralytic attacks. Glucocorticoids have been used to treat nonresponsive episodes. Nevertheless, our patient, a 34-year-old Hispanic man, had received propranolol for 7 days and a single dose of prednisone 2 hours before the onset of the paralysis.

In patients with TPP, the Na+/K+-adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) pump activity is considerably increased by excess thyroid hormones, resulting in an increased intracellular potassium shift. Insulin activates the Na+/K+-ATPase pump as well; thus, the precipitating effect of a high carbohydrate diet is explained. Glucocorticoids have been shown to increase the number of Na+/K+-ATPase molecules in skeletal muscle. They also increase insulin secretion in the basal state and the first-phase insulin release following a glucose load.

In our patient with TPP, the onset of the attack was not prevented by the use of propranolol and was likely triggered by the administration of prednisone.

### Fatality after cardiac arrest in thyrotoxic periodic paralysis due to profound hypokalemia resulting from intravenous glucose administration and inadequate potassium replacement [^112VWmr2]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is a variant of periodic paralysis (PP) that occurs in patients with underlying mutations in genes for cation channels if they develop thyrotoxicosis. It is disabling, and fatalities sometimes occur. Here, we present a patient with TPP who developed hypokalemic paralysis that was probably aggravated by the administration of a carbohydrate, likely contributing to, if not causing, a fatal outcome.

- **Summary**: A 30-year-old Chinese patient received (131)I treatment for Graves' disease (GD) in our hospital. Three days later, in the middle of the night, he developed worsening paralytic symptoms following a heavy evening meal. The next morning, he was seen in a small clinic and treated with 1250mL 5% glucose containing 25mL 10% potassium chloride (KCl). By early afternoon, he had not improved and was transferred to a city hospital, arriving with grade I muscle strength and severe facial and bulbar paralysis, which was shortly followed by cardiac arrest and failure of resuscitation. Shortly before he died, his serum K(+) was 1.15mEq/L (normal = 3.5–5).

- **Conclusions**: We postulate that severe hypokalemia developed in our patient, in part, in response to the high intravenous glucose load that he received. We advocate caution against using intravenous glucose solutions for potassium administration in patients with TPP and recommend a review of guidelines suggesting this form of treatment. In rural settings with limited resources, we favor oral potassium, not to exceed 100mEq per day, and transfer to a modern medical facility in settings where resources are more abundant.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: A spine consultation [^113rDaZL]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2019). High credibility.

As a consultant, the orthopedic spine surgeon is often asked to evaluate patients with acute-onset extremity weakness. In some cases, a patient's deficits can be attributed to nonspinal pathology; therefore, it is important to be aware of nonorthopedic diagnoses when evaluating these patients. We report a case of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis that was initially confused by the consulting service with spinal pathology. A 32-year-old Hispanic man presented to our emergency department with rapid onset of lower extremity weakness. The consulting team ordered a CT of the cervical and lumbar spine, as well as an MRI of the lumbar spine, which was aborted due to the patient's worsening tachycardia and chest pain. The spine service was subsequently consulted to evaluate the patient. Review of the metabolic panel revealed low potassium, and additional testing led to the eventual diagnosis of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. After correction of the patient's potassium, his weakness rapidly resolved, and no additional spinal workup was pursued. We describe this patient's presentation and outline the differential diagnosis for acute, nontraumatic extremity weakness, including both orthopedic and other medical causes, that the spine surgeon should be aware of when evaluating patients with extremity weakness.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: A spine consultation [^112CC5Wc]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

When evaluating a patient with acute extremity weakness, the spine surgeon's differential diagnoses should not be limited to compressive spinal pathology but should also include other etiologies, such as inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and metabolic conditions. Although spine surgeons may be confident in diagnosing some causes of weakness, mostly compressive in nature, they may not feel comfortable diagnosing less commonly encountered conditions that may present without obvious compression on imaging. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is one such metabolic condition that presents with acute extremity weakness. Other conditions to be considered are myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and botulism.

Certain findings can help differentiate TPP from other conditions presenting with acute-onset weakness. In contrast to compressive causes of weakness, imaging studies in patients with TPP are normal. In TPP, proximal muscles are typically more severely affected than distal muscles. Mentation remains intact in patients with TPP, the respiratory muscles are spared, and the cranial nerves are not affected. Another important finding is that sensation is unaffected in TPP. Guillain-Barré syndrome is another cause of weakness that can be differentiated from TPP by its classic presentation of ascending paralysis and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid findings. Botulism is a toxin-mediated condition that presents as descending flaccid paralysis, where the muscles of the head and neck are initially affected. In contrast to TPP, both Guillain-Barré syndrome and botulism can affect the respiratory system and lead to respiratory distress.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperthyroidism, and more specifically with respect to patients with thyrotoxicosis due to destructive thyroiditis, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend treating patients with mild symptomatic subacute thyroiditis initially with ß-adrenergic-blocking drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Use corticosteroids instead of NSAIDs when patients fail to respond or present initially with moderate-to-severe pain and/or thyrotoxic symptoms.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis as an initial presentation of Graves' disease in a Saudi patient [^1127x3vH]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is a well-known complication of hyperthyroidism, characterized by flaccid paralysis with hypokalemia. At the time of writing, only five cases of this rare disorder have been reported in Saudi Arabia. Here, we report an additional case involving a 25-year-old Saudi man who presented with lower limb paralysis and severe hypokalemia. Clinically, he exhibited symptoms and signs suggestive of Graves' disease, which was confirmed by laboratory investigations. Treatments including carbimazole, a beta-blocker, and potassium replacement were administered, resulting in a dramatic improvement of the TPP. This case emphasizes the importance of considering TPP in patients with acute muscle weakness and the importance of promptly initiating treatment to prevent relapse of TPP.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: correct hypokalemia with caution [^112rgMD2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is rare in Caucasian populations but affects approximately 2% of East Asians with thyrotoxicosis (13% of males, 0.17% of females). The presentation is characterized by abrupt-onset hypokalemia and profound proximal muscular weakness, and commonly occurs after carbohydrate loading or exercise.

- **Objectives**: To raise awareness of this condition through the description of a typical case of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis; to remind readers that, despite intravascular hypokalemia, total body potassium is normal and that correction must be done with caution; to highlight the differences in treatment compared to familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis.

- **Case report**: We describe the presentation of a 36-year-old Filipino man with a background history of Graves disease. Over-administration of intravenous potassium was narrowly averted in this case.

- **Conclusion**: It may be important to check thyroid function in patients presenting with acute paralysis, especially those of Asian origin. In patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, administration of potassium, with cardiac monitoring and a total dose of < 50 mmol, limits the dysrhythmia risk. Patients are likely to benefit from the prescription of non-selective beta-blockers until they become euthyroid. In contrast to familial periodic paralysis, regular oral potassium supplementation is ineffective in thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, and acetazolamide precipitates, rather than prevents, attacks.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: A spine consultation [^115CZ6mJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

This was a case of a 32-year-old Hispanic man who presented with acute-onset lower extremity weakness. The orthopaedic service was consulted for evaluation of the spine; however, imaging obtained before consultation demonstrated no evidence of acute spinal pathology. Laboratory studies demonstrated hypokalemia and elevated thyroid hormone, suggesting that the cause of the patient's weakness was not spinal in nature. The constellation of symptoms, as well as laboratory and imaging studies, eventually led to the diagnosis of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP). The patient was treated with methimazole, propranolol, and dexamethasone, after which his presenting symptoms were completely resolved at the time of discharge.

TPP is a condition that occurs in 0.1% to 0.2% of the hyperthyroid population in North America. It occurs more often in men than in women and is more common in Asian and Hispanic individuals. The characteristic triad of findings associated with TPP includes hypokalemia, hyperthyroidism, and proximal muscle paralysis. Additional laboratory abnormalities that may be present in patients with TPP are hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia, which, along with hypokalemia, may also contribute to muscle weakness. The paralytic attacks associated with TPP occur mostly at night and are precipitated by alcohol, a high carbohydrate diet, and heavy exercise. These characteristics can be considered when differentiating TPP from other causes of acute-onset extremity weakness.

The patient in this case was also found to have wide complex tachycardia at the time of presentation. ECG changes related to el…

### SPL drug information for bupropion hydrochloride SR [^114P7eec]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of bupropion hydrochloride SR PO (also known as Wellbutrin SR, Zyban) in patients with intermittent hemodialysis, it is recommended to use with caution and reduce the dose. The maximal dose should be 150 mg with a maximal frequency of daily administration. It is important to titrate the medication slowly.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis and complicated thyrotoxicosis, two presentations of hyperthyroidism with notable differences in their clinical manifestations: An experience from a tertiary care hospital in the United States [^116415wg]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is a muscular disorder characterized by sudden episodes of muscle weakness and hypokalemia in the setting of thyrotoxicosis. We aimed to report our experience with TPP in West Texas and compare its clinical presentation to that of patients admitted for complicated thyrotoxicosis.

- **Methods**: Retrospective review of records of adult patients with admission diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, thyrotoxicosis, and/or discharge diagnosis of periodic paralysis seen at our institution over a 6-year period.

- **Results**: Patients admitted for complicated thyrotoxicosis were more commonly females with a mean age of 44 years. Patients with TPP were more commonly Hispanic males with a mean age of 27 years. Despite no significantly different thyroid hormone levels, patients with TPP presented with less severe signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism. This was reflected by a lower Burch-Wartofsky score on admission (19 vs. 35; p < 0.001) and a lower occurrence of atrial fibrillation in the TPP group (0% vs. 36%; p < 0.001). Moreover, 89% of TPP patients presented with corrected QT (QTc) prolongation, whereas only 19% of thyrotoxic patients presented with a prolonged QTc.

- **Conclusion**: Hispanic patients with TPP seem to have relative resistance to the actions of thyroid hormones and commonly present with QTc prolongation, a risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias.

### Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis: six cases in non-Asian patients [^111nAaKe]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

To describe six cases of thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis (THPP) in non-Asian men, we present six cases detailing clinical and laboratory findings, treatment, and outcomes, and review related literature.

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is relatively common in Asian men with thyrotoxicosis; however, it is unusual in non-Asian patients. Among our six patients — four Caucasians, one African-American, and one Hispanic — the precipitating factors, initial manifestations, and clinical course varied. In general, treatment with ¹³¹I or potassium eliminated the paralytic episodes.

THPP needs to be distinguished from nonthyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Although THPP is unusual in non-Asian men, recognition is crucial due to the severe and potentially fatal complications, which are reversible with potassium replacement and antithyroid therapy.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis complicated by carbimazole-associated myositis [^113ML5xG]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Management of TPP is characterized by the identification of overt hyperthyroidism and hypokalemia during an episode of paralysis. Potassium replacement is the cornerstone of initial management; however, there is a risk of rebound hyperkalemia with rapid supplementation, as hypokalemia is due to transcellular potassium shift rather than total body depletion of potassium.

A retrospective analysis of 40 cases of TPP in Turkey by Cesur et al. showed that patients treated with intravenous potassium had a significantly shorter recovery time compared to those treated with oral potassium. Due to the high risk of rebound hyperkalemia, patients should have cardiac monitoring and have their serum potassium measured regularly while being replaced and after their potassium has normalized. Our patient's potassium was monitored every 3 hours for the first 9 hours (potassium normalized after 5 hours), and he was on cardiac monitoring during this time. A total of 70 mmol of potassium chloride was administered over 8 hours with no rebound hyperkalemia. The frequency at which potassium levels need to be measured is not established in the literature.

Non-selective ß-blockade can also play a role in the management of TPP by counteracting the catecholamine-mediated upregulation of the Na+/K+-ATPase that occurs in TPP. Lin and Lin describe two cases of TPP managed with 3 mg/kg oral propranolol alone. Both patients showed the amelioration of paralysis and rapid normalization of potassium and phosphate levels without rebound hyperkalemia.

### Wellbutrin XL [^116qTvFT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Potential for Wellbutrin XL to affect other drugs**:

- **Drugs metabolized by CYP2D6**: Bupropion and its metabolites (erythrohydrobupropion, threohydrobupropion, hydroxybupropion) are CYP2D6 inhibitors. Therefore, coadministration of Wellbutrin XL with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase the exposures of drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6, such as certain antidepressants (e.g. venlafaxine, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, risperidone, and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g. metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g. propafenone and flecainide). When used concomitantly with Wellbutrin XL, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of these CYP2D6 substrates, particularly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Drugs that require metabolic activation by CYP2D6 to be effective (e.g. tamoxifen) theoretically could have reduced efficacy when administered concomitantly with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as bupropion. Patients treated concomitantly with Wellbutrin XL and such drugs may require increased doses of the drug [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Drugs that lower seizure threshold**: Use extreme caution when coadministering Wellbutrin XL with other drugs that lower the seizure threshold (e.g. other bupropion products, antipsychotics, antidepressants, theophylline, or systemic corticosteroids). Use low initial doses of Wellbutrin XL and increase the dose gradually [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis complicated by carbimazole-associated myositis [^112tkXjT]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

In patients, especially Asian men, who present with sudden onset muscle weakness and hypokalaemia, it is important to check thyroid function to assess whether thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is the underlying cause. For those with TPP, management in the acute setting includes potassium replacement with monitoring for rebound hyperkalaemia; ideally, less than 90 mmol should be replaced within 24 hours. Additionally, treatment with antithyroid medication and education about common triggers for periodic paralysis are recommended.

Patients should be treated for the underlying cause of their hyperthyroidism to prevent further episodes of TPP. Furthermore, patients who complain of muscle aches and pains, or muscle weakness after having commenced antithyroid drugs, should be assessed promptly. Carbimazole- or PTU-associated myositis is a rare but documented side effect.

### Bupropion hydrochloride [^117AQFgr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To minimize the risk of seizure, increase the dose gradually [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Increases in dosage should not exceed 100 mg per day over a 3-day period. Bupropion hydrochloride tablets should be swallowed whole; they should not be crushed, divided, or chewed. The tablets may be taken with or without food.

The recommended starting dose is 200 mg per day, administered as 100 mg twice daily. After 3 days of dosing, the dose may be increased to 300 mg per day, given as 100 mg three times daily, with at least 6 hours between successive doses. Dosing above 300 mg per day may be achieved using the 75- or 100-mg tablets.

A maximum of 450 mg per day, in divided doses of not more than 150 mg each, may be considered for patients who show no clinical improvement after several weeks of treatment at 300 mg per day. Administer the 100-mg tablet four times daily to ensure the limit of 150 mg in a single dose is not exceeded.

- **Maintenance treatment**: Acute episodes of depression generally require several months or longer of antidepressant treatment beyond the response seen in the acute episode. It is unknown whether the dose of bupropion hydrochloride tablets needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose that provided an initial response. Periodically reassess the need for maintenance treatment and determine the appropriate dose for such treatment.

- **Dose adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment**: In patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 7 to 15), the maximum dose of bupropion hydrochloride tablets is 75 mg per day.

### Insulin resistance in subjects with a history of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) [^115CC5dg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Hyperinsulinaemia has been suggested as an important factor for developing hypokalaemic paralysis in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP). Since hyperinsulinaemia is a common feature of insulin resistance, there may be a causal relationship between insulin resistance and TPP.

- **Objective**: To compare insulin sensitivity between subjects with a history of TPP and others with a history of thyrotoxicosis without periodic paralysis.

- **Methods**: Insulin sensitivity, measured by euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp and 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), was performed nonselectively in 10 subjects with a history of TPP (TPP group) and 10 age- and sex-matched subjects with a history of simple thyrotoxicosis (control group). All participants had euthyroidism and fasting plasma glucose of < 5.55 mmol/l at the time of the study.

- **Results**: Body mass index and waist circumference of the TPP group were higher than those of the control group. One of 10 (10%) subjects in the TPP group and 6 of 10 (60%) in the control group had a BMI of < 23 kg/m². Areas under the curve (AUC) of plasma glucose after OGTT were comparable, while the AUC of serum insulin of the TPP group was higher than in the control group. The TPP group had lower insulin sensitivity than the control group.

- **Conclusion**: The subjects with a history of TPP were more obese and had lower insulin sensitivity than those with a history of simple thyrotoxicosis. Insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinaemia may be a key feature of the pathogenesis of TPP.

### Effects of potassium supplementation on the recovery of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis [^114M38tp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Potassium supplements have been recommended to hasten recovery and prevent cardiopulmonary complications in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP). However, this recommendation has not yet been proven efficacious. Thirty-two patients with acute attacks of TPP over a 3-year period were divided into two groups.

- **Study groups and treatment**:
	- Group A (n = 12) was a control group treated with normal saline infusion at 125 mL/hr only.
	- Group B (n = 20) received intravenous KCl administration at a rate of 10 mmol/hr in normal saline 125 mL/hr.

During the attack and for six hours after muscle recovery, hemodynamics were continuously recorded, and muscle strength and plasma K(+) concentration were measured hourly. The sex, age, muscle strength, thyroid function, biochemical values including plasma K(+) levels, and the time from attack to therapy (3.6 ± 1.6 vs. 3.3 ± 1.0 hours) were not significantly different between the two groups. However, recovery time was significantly shorter in the KCl group than in the control group (6.3 ± 3.8 vs. 13.5 ± 7.5 hours, P < .01). Rebound hyperkalemia greater than 5.5 mmol/L occurred in 40% of patients receiving KCl. The dose of KCl administered and peak K(+) concentration were positively correlated (r = 0.85, P < .001).

In conclusion, KCl therapy proves to help the recovery of paralysis in TPP associated with rebound hyperkalemia. KCl supplementation should be administered in doses as small as possible (< 10 mmol/hr) to avoid rebound hyperkalemia, unless there are cardiopulmonary complications.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis presenting with quadriparesis and hyperreflexia [^114szdpf]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is a rare complication of hyperthyroidism that manifests as painless flaccid paralysis. An East Asian man in his late 20s presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of quadriparesis associated with hypertonia and hyperreflexia. His initial symptoms and signs suggested involvement of the brain and spinal cord; however, MRI of the neuroaxis was normal. His serum potassium concentration was low, and thyroid test results were consistent with hyperthyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with TPP associated with Graves' disease and was treated with potassium supplementation, propranolol, and methimazole. Motor strength improved to his baseline level of power; bulk was normal, and tone was increased. Although flaccid paralysis is a typical presentation of TPP, brisk reflexes and muscle spasticity cannot rule out this condition. This case highlights the importance of considering TPP as a possible diagnosis in patients presenting with acute quadriparesis.

### Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis secondary to subclinical hyperthyroidism: an uncommon cause of acute muscle paralysis [^115q5mtb]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis secondary to subclinical hyperthyroidism is an uncommon clinical phenomenon characterized by lower limb paralysis due to hypokalaemia in the background of subclinical hyperthyroidism. In this article, we report a patient who presented with progressive lower limb muscle weakness secondary to hypokalaemia that was refractory to potassium replacement therapy. He had no diarrhea, no reduced appetite, and was not taking any medication that could cause potassium wasting. Although he was clinically euthyroid, his thyroid function test revealed subclinical hyperthyroidism. His 24-hour urine potassium level was normal, which suggests a rapid transcellular shift of potassium secondary to subclinical hyperthyroidism as the possible cause. He was successfully treated with potassium supplements, non-selective beta-blockers, and anti-thyroid medication. This case report aims to share an uncommon case of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis secondary to subclinical hyperthyroidism, of which, to our knowledge, only a few cases have been reported in the literature.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis complicated by carbimazole-associated myositis [^115d3HpA]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

As far as we are aware, this is the first documented case of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) followed by a presumed diagnosis of carbimazole-induced myositis. This discussion will summarize the literature on TPP, including pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, management, and carbimazole-induced myositis.

- **Pathophysiology**: Hypokalaemia in TPP is caused by a dysregulation in the transcellular distribution of potassium rather than total body depletion of potassium. Although the mechanism is not completely understood, it is thought to relate to the stimulating effects of thyroxine on sodium–potassium adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) within skeletal muscle tissue. Thyroid hormone upregulates the transcription of the gene encoding for the Na⁺-K⁺ ATPase pump within skeletal tissue and promotes the membrane insertion of the pump within skeletal tissue. These actions ultimately promote potassium ions (K⁺) to be driven intracellularly, depleting extracellular potassium and leading to muscle paralysis by interfering with cell membrane depolarization. Recent studies have also revealed the role of Kir2.6 gene mutations in the pathophysiology of TPP. Patients with TPP are more likely to have mutations in the Kir2.6 gene, which encodes for inward rectifying K⁺ channels, resulting in decreased K⁺ efflux from cells and exacerbating extracellular hypokalaemia.

- **Clinical manifestations**: Consistent with the clinical presentation of this case, patients with TPP most commonly present with acute onset muscle weakness, which is more prevalent in the lower limbs.

### Auvelity [^112gjDtB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Auvelity contains bupropion, which can cause elevated blood pressure and hypertension. The risk of hypertension is increased if Auvelity is used concomitantly with MAOIs or other drugs that increase dopaminergic or noradrenergic activity [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Data from a comparative trial of a sustained-release tablet formulation of bupropion HCl, nicotine transdermal system (NTS), the combination of sustained-release bupropion plus NTS, and placebo as an aid to smoking cessation suggest a higher incidence of hypertension in patients treated with the combination of sustained-release bupropion and NTS. In this trial, 6.1% of subjects treated with the combination of sustained-release bupropion and NTS had hypertension compared with 2.5%, 1.6%, and 3.1% of subjects treated with sustained-release bupropion, NTS, and placebo, respectively. The majority of these subjects had evidence of pre-existing hypertension.

Three subjects (1.2%) treated with the combination of sustained-release bupropion and NTS and one subject (0.4%) treated with NTS had study medication discontinued due to hypertension compared with none of the subjects treated with sustained-release bupropion or placebo. Monitor blood pressure in patients who receive the combination of bupropion and nicotine replacement.

In a clinical trial of an immediate-release bupropion tablet formulation in MDD subjects with stable congestive heart failure (N = 36), bupropion was associated with an exacerbation of pre-existing hypertension in two subjects.

### Complete heart block during potassium therapy in thyrotoxic periodic paralysis [^115pfNQ2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Although cardiac dysrhythmia is common in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP), high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block complicated by cardiogenic shock, even under KCl supplementation, is rarely described.

- **Objectives**: To present a case of TPP in a patient who developed complete AV block with severe consequences due to paradoxical hypokalemia during KCl therapy. In addition, the management of acute hypokalemia in TPP is reviewed.

- **Case report**: A 41-year-old Chinese man with TPP presented to the Emergency Department with a 2-day history of paralysis in the extremities. He developed complete AV block with cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure, necessitating ventilatory support when plasma K(+) level decreased from 1.7 mmol/L to 1.3 mmol/L during KCl replacement of 30 mmol in 2 hours. The administration of another 60 mmol KCl over 3 hours achieved a plasma K(+) level of 2.1 mmol/L, resulting in the resolution of AV block and successful weaning. However, rebound hyperkalemia (K(+) 5.6 mmol/L) upon recovery was evident and uneventfully corrected.

- **Conclusion**: A paradoxical fall in serum K(+) concentration with potentially life-threatening complication is still underappreciated in patients with TPP on KCl supplementation. Early recognition and prompt therapy prevent untoward consequences.

### An atypical presentation of high potassium renal secretion rate in a patient with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: A case report [^1129bp7w]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is one of the most common clinical electrolyte imbalance problems, and thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is a leading cause of presentation to the emergency department. Low renal potassium secretion rates, a normal acid–base balance in the blood, and hyperthyroidism are the hallmarks of suspected TPP.

- **Case presentation**: Here we report the case of a 36-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of acute muscle weakness 5 hours prior to admission. Biochemistry tests revealed hypokalemia with hyperthyroidism and renal potassium wasting. TPP was initially not favored due to the presence of renal potassium wasting. However, his serum potassium level rebounded rapidly within several hours after potassium supplementation, indicating that the intracellular shifting of potassium ions was the main etiology for his hypokalemia. The early stage of TPP development may have contributed to this paradox.

- **Conclusion**: Therefore, it is premature to rule out TPP based on the presentation of high renal potassium secretion rates alone. This finding may result in an incorrect impression being made in the early stage of TTP and may consequently lead to an inappropriate potassium supplementation policy.

### Familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis: A case induced by concurrent hyperthyroidism [^112ZJFp6]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Management of acute paralytic episodes involves maintaining proper control of serum potassium levels, necessitating vigilant monitoring for post-treatment hyperkalemia. Lifestyle and dietary modifications to avoid triggering factors are integral to treatment. Although the precise mechanism is not fully elucidated, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in reducing the frequency of familial HypoPP episodes. There is variability in the response to carbonic anhydrase inhibitors based on genotype; individuals with CACNA1S variants tend to exhibit a more favorable response compared to SCN4A variants. Additionally, the incorporation of a potassium-sparing diuretic, either in conjunction with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors or as a standalone treatment, may offer advantages for specific patients.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis complicated by carbimazole-associated myositis [^117RASXB]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Six months after his initial presentation, the patient reported ongoing occasional episodes of muscle cramps, but he no longer had any myalgia after the switch to propylthiouracil. His serum creatine kinase (CK) and potassium levels remained within reference limits. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) had now normalized, and the free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (FT3) levels remained normal. Propylthiouracil (PTU) was reduced to 50 mg in the morning and 25 mg in the evening. Neurological examination was remarkable for mild bilateral proximal upper and lower limb weakness, with 4+/5 power on shoulder abduction, hip flexion, and hip abduction testing, and 5/5 power elsewhere.

Given concerns for ongoing mild myopathy, the patient was referred to neurology for further assessment. There was normal motor and sensory nerve conduction but subtle myopathic features on electromyography of the left deltoid and gluteus muscle. A myositis antibody panel was negative. A muscle biopsy showed mild myopathic changes, evidenced by a mild increase in internal nuclei and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, which is predominantly in the perimysium. There were no features of immune-mediated inflammatory or necrotizing myopathy. The findings were nonspecific and could reflect regeneration following the previous episodes of rhabdomyolysis or myositis, such as from prior carbimazole use. Chronic thyrotoxic myopathy can also cause similar changes, but this was considered to be less likely, given the patient's hyperthyroidism had resolved with antithyroid drugs at the first follow-up appointment. The patient underwent genetic testing using a panel for skeletal muscle channelopathy.

Therefore, coadministration of Aplenzin with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase the exposures of drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6. Such drugs include certain antidepressants (e.g. venlafaxine, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, risperidone, and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g. metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g. propafenone and flecainide). When used concomitantly with Aplenzin, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of these CYP2D6 substrates, particularly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index.

- **Drugs requiring metabolic activation by CYP2D6**: Drugs that require metabolic activation by CYP2D6 to be effective (e.g. tamoxifen) theoretically could have reduced efficacy when administered concomitantly with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as bupropion.

- **10 Overdosage**:

- **Human overdose experience**:
	- Overdoses of up to 30 grams or more of bupropion have been reported, with seizures occurring in approximately one-third of these cases. Other serious reactions associated with bupropion overdoses include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, mental status changes, sinus tachycardia, and ECG changes such as conduction disturbances (including QRS prolongation) or arrhythmias, clonus, myoclonus, and hyperreflexia. Moreover, fever, muscle rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported, mainly when bupropion was part of multiple drug overdoses. Although most patients recovered without sequelae, deaths have been reported in patients ingesting large doses of bupropion alone, with multiple uncontrolled seizures, bradycardia, cardiac failure, and cardiac arrest occurring prior to death.

- **Overdosage management**:
	- In cases of overdose, consult a Certified Poison Control Center for up-to-date guidance and advice. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers are listed in the Physician's Desk Reference (PDR) or can be found by calling 1–800–222–1222 or visiting www.poison.org. There are no known antidotes for bupropion; hence, provide supportive care including close medical supervision and monitoring. Consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses and ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. The induction of emesis is not recommended.

### Decreased muscular radionuclide uptake in Tc-99m MIBI scintigraphy during paralytic phase of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis [^115gEBNv]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The underlying pathophysiology of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) remains obscure. Histologic surveys have disclosed vacuole formation and abundant mitochondrial abnormalities, ranging from swelling, matrical pallor, pleomorphism, and reduced cristae, often in the muscle fibers during paralytic periods. In a 47-year-old man experiencing two episodes of transient paralysis, hyperthyroidism with TPP was diagnosed. During the acute paralytic phase, a significant reduction of radionuclide uptake in the quadriceps on Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy was found. These findings, coupled with previous morphological observations, further suggest impaired mitochondrial integrity and cellular viability in TPP.

### Thyrotoxic hypokalaemic periodic paralysis: a rare presentation of Graves' disease in a Hispanic patient [^116za83o]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A 26-year-old Hispanic man with no significant medical history presented to our emergency room with a gradual onset of weakness in his lower extremities. He was hemodynamically stable, and examination revealed a loss of motor function in his lower limbs up to the level of his hips. Laboratory data revealed hypokalemia. The patient was started on potassium supplementation and subsequently recovered his muscle strength. The differential diagnosis included familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis and thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP). Further investigations revealed low thyroid-stimulating hormone and high free thyroxine levels. A radio iodine 123 scan revealed enhanced homogeneous uptake in the thyroid, suggesting Graves' disease. Thyroid-stimulating antibodies were also found to be elevated. The patient was started on methimazole and propranolol, and he never experienced another attack of TPP, even at a 1-year follow-up.

### Familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis: A case induced by concurrent hyperthyroidism [^115VdV1u]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is an uncommon genetic disorder characterized by episodes of muscle weakness and hypokalemia, typically starting in early adulthood. The coexistence of hyperthyroidism in the presence of HypoPP is more strongly associated with a diagnosis of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP), with most cases occurring in Asian males with pathogenic KCNJ2 or KCNJ18 variants and without a family history of the condition. This case is novel due to the combination of familial HypoPP and hyperthyroidism induced by Graves' disease, a rare occurrence especially in non-Asian populations.

- **Case presentation**: A 40-year-old African American man presented with profound muscle weakness after consuming a high-salt meal. He had a significant family history of hyperthyroidism and hypokalemia. On examination, he showed profound weakness in all extremities. Laboratory tests confirmed hypokalemia and hyperthyroidism, and genetic testing identified a pathogenic variant in the CACNA1S gene (c.1583 G > A, p. R528H), with normal SCN4A, KCNJ2, and KCNJ18 sequencing. He was diagnosed with familial HypoPP and hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease. He was started on PO methimazole 10 mg three times a day and PO acetazolamide 250 mg twice a day. He was advised to follow a low carbohydrate and low salt diet.

- **Conclusions**: This case highlights the importance of considering a genetic basis for HypoPP in patients with a family history of the condition, even when hyperthyroidism is present. The combination of familial HypoPP and Graves' disease is rare.

### Lower-extremity weakness in a teenager due to thyrotoxic periodic paralysis [^117VgNRR]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxic hypokalemic paralysis is the hallmark of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP). TPP is a potentially deadly complication of hyperthyroidism that occurs because of a rapid and dramatic intracellular shift of potassium. This transference results in severe hypokalemia and clinically manifests as muscle weakness or paralysis. This condition predominantly affects males of Asian descent, and its presentation can range from mild to severe, as seen in our case.

- **Case report**: We present the case of a 15-year-old Asian-American male who presented to a tertiary-care pediatric emergency department complaining of generalized weakness and flaccid paralysis of his lower extremities. The differential for such a complaint is extremely broad, and the symptoms can result from etiologies arising from the cerebral cortex, the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, the neuromuscular junction, or even the muscles themselves. Our patient was found to have an extremely low serum potassium concentration, as well as an electrocardiogram that revealed a prolonged QT interval and right bundle branch block. The etiology of these abnormalities and the patient's symptoms was found to be undiagnosed and uncontrolled hyperthyroidism from Grave's disease, which resulted in this dramatic presentation of thyrotoxic hypokalemic paralysis.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: This entity is common in Asia but still somewhat rare in the United States and other Western countries. Our case illustrates that careful history taking and a focused diagnostic evaluation, in conjunction…

### Familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis: A case induced by concurrent hyperthyroidism [^113S5jcJ]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Periodic paralysis (PP) is a rare channelopathy marked by episodes of flaccid skeletal muscle paralysis. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is categorized into familial or acquired forms. Familial HypoPP is an uncommon genetic channelopathy marked by episodes of flaccid skeletal muscle paralysis accompanied by hypokalemia. The onset typically occurs in the first to third decade of life. Timely diagnosis and preventive treatment are crucial to mitigate morbidity associated with this condition.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis and anesthesia report of a case and literature review [^1141axch]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is a disease characterized by recurrent episodes of paralysis and hypokalemia during a thyrotoxic state. The disease primarily affects people of Asian descent but can affect other ethnic groups. In Asians, the symptoms of thyrotoxicosis are distinct and usually precede the first paralytic episode, whereas in non-Asian populations, paralysis is often the presenting symptom.

If TPP is not diagnosed and the patient undergoes a surgical procedure during general or regional anesthesia, symptoms of the disease may be confused with other adverse perioperative events such as delayed recovery from neuromuscular paralysis. No specific anesthetic regimen is superior. TPP treatment recommendations involve treating the underlying hyperthyroid state. Other modalities, such as beta-blockade and potassium replacement, are also important in the acute paralytic state. Future diagnostic and treatment innovations may lie in the genetic and molecular understanding of this disease.

We present a case of an Asian male with known TPP undergoing general anesthesia, a brief case series involving five patients, and a review of the literature.

### Inderalla [^111iUqEk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In cases of overdose or exaggerated response to propranolol, several measures should be employed due to its non-dialyzable nature:

- **General**: If ingestion is recent or suspected, it is essential to evacuate gastric contents with care to prevent pulmonary aspiration.

- **Supportive therapy**: Treatment should address hypotension and bradycardia, frequently reported after propranolol overdose. Glucagon can provide potent inotropic and chronotropic effects, making it particularly useful for treating hypotension or depressed myocardial function. Administer glucagon intravenously at 50 to 150 mcg/kg, followed by a continuous drip of 1 to 5 mg/hour for a positive chronotropic effect. Other useful agents may include isoproterenol, dopamine, or phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Note that epinephrine could provoke uncontrolled hypertension. Bradycardia can be treated with atropine or isoproterenol, while serious cases may require temporary cardiac pacing.

- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse, blood pressure, neurobehavioral status, and fluid balance is crucial. Isoproterenol and aminophylline may be administered for bronchospasm management.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of bupropion hydrochloride SR PO (also known as Wellbutrin SR, Zyban):

- **Acute angle-closure glaucoma**: Use caution in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.

- **Delusions, hallucinations, psychosis, paranoid ideation**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as bupropion has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.

- **Hypertension**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as bupropion has been associated with an increased risk of hypertension, especially when used with drugs increasing dopaminergic or noradrenergic activity. Assess blood pressure before initiating treatment and monitor periodically during treatment. Recognize that the combination of bupropion with nicotine replacement therapy has not been associated with an increase in blood pressure and is safe to use.

- **Manic or mixed episodes**: Use caution in patients with bipolar disorder or risk factors for bipolar disorder, such as a family history of bipolar disorder, depression, or suicidal thoughts.

- **Seizure**: Use extreme caution in patients with metabolic disorders or those using illicit drugs, medications lowering the seizure threshold, or misusing or abusing prescription medications. Discontinue if seizures occur.

### An atypical presentation of high potassium renal secretion rate in a patient with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: a case report [^116MHLRx]. BMC nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is one of the most common clinical electrolyte imbalance problems, and thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is a leading cause of presentation to the emergency department. Low renal potassium secretion rates, a normal acid-base balance in the blood, and hyperthyroidism are the hallmarks of suspected TPP.

- **Case presentation**: Here we report the case of a 36-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of acute muscle weakness 5 hours prior to admission. Biochemistry tests revealed hypokalemia with hyperthyroidism and renal potassium wasting. TPP was initially not favored due to the presence of renal potassium wasting. However, his serum potassium level rebounded rapidly within several hours after potassium supplementation, indicating that the intracellular shifting of potassium ions was the main etiology for his hypokalemia. The early stage of TPP development may have contributed to this paradox.

- **Conclusion**: Therefore, it is premature to rule out TPP based on the presentation of high renal potassium secretion rates alone. This finding may result in an incorrect impression being made in the early stage of TPP and may consequently lead to an inappropriate potassium supplementation policy.

### Novel etiopathophysiological aspects of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis [^114qsEFs]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis can lead to thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP), an endocrine channelopathy, and is the most common cause of acquired periodic paralysis. Typically, paralytic attacks cease when hyperthyroidism is abolished and recur if hyperthyroidism returns. TPP is often underdiagnosed, as it has diverse periodicity, duration, and intensity. The age at which patients develop TPP closely follows the age at which thyrotoxicosis occurs. Although all ethnicities can be affected, TPP is most prevalent in people of Asian and, secondly, Latin American descent.

TPP is characterized by hypokalemia, suppressed TSH levels, and increased levels of thyroid hormones. Nonselective β-adrenergic blockers, such as propranolol, are an efficient adjuvant to antithyroid drugs to prevent paralysis; however, early and definitive treatment should always be pursued. Evidence indicates that TPP results from the combination of genetic susceptibility, thyrotoxicosis, and environmental factors (such as a high-carbohydrate diet).

Research suggests that excess T(3) modifies the insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle and pancreatic β cells and thus alters potassium homeostasis. This only results in depolarization-induced acute loss of muscle excitability in patients with inherited ion channel mutations. An integrated etiopathophysiological model is proposed based on molecular findings and knowledge gained from long-term follow-up of patients with TPP.

In regard to specific circumstances of hyperthyroidism, particularly for patients with other causes of thyrotoxicosis, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend monitoring patients taking medications known to cause thyrotoxicosis. These medications include interferon-a, IL-2, TKIs, and lithium. Patients should be monitored both clinically and biochemically at six-month intervals to detect the development of thyroid dysfunction. Furthermore, it is advised to evaluate patients who develop thyrotoxicosis in order to determine the etiology and to treat them accordingly.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: An unusual presentation of weakness [^112nTx7f]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is a rare endocrine disorder seen predominantly in men of Asian origin. A case is reported of a patient who presented to the accident and emergency department with the sudden onset of weakness in his lower limbs. Hypokalaemia was identified and treated, leading to the resolution of symptoms. Additional tests identified the patient as being thyrotoxic, and he was treated with oral antithyroid drugs. It is important to consider the diagnosis of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis in patients presenting with an acute onset of weakness. The report discusses the epidemiology, presentation, treatment, and complications of this condition.

### Paralysis that easily reverses: a case of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis [^114cnvDx]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with episodes of muscle weakness and hypokalaemia due to hyperthyroidism. Diagnosis is often delayed or misdiagnosed due to its rarity in the Western world and subtle features of hyperthyroidism on initial presentation. Here, we present the case of a 25-year-old man who presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset weakness of bilateral upper and lower extremities. His labs revealed hypokalaemia with elevated T4 and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, and he was diagnosed with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.

He was treated with potassium repletion, atenolol, and methimazole, resulting in complete reversal of his paralysis within the next day. Unfortunately, he failed to keep the follow-up appointment after discharge, ran out of his methimazole, and was readmitted to the ED.

### More, less or both [^1135FLr1]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 67-year-old Caucasian woman with no prior medical history was admitted to our hospital with complaints of generalized weakness, nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss. The patient suffered from tachycardia and hypotension. Blood tests revealed Graves' thyrotoxicosis, and the patient was treated accordingly. However, the patient's health continued to decline rapidly, and further tests revealed a concomitant Addisonian crisis. Additional treatment with corticosteroids led to a full recovery.

It is well known that autoimmune endocrine disorders tend to cluster; however, the presentation is usually sequential in time. This case reports the highly rare simultaneous presentation of Addison's disease and Graves' thyrotoxicosis. It also provides several suggestions to help establish the diagnoses.

- **Corticosteroids and hormonal treatments**: Corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone, dexamethasone), oral and other hormonal contraceptives, testosterone
- **Immunosuppressants and cancer treatments**: Albendazole, cyclosporine, everolimus, imatinib, sirolimus
- **Antibiotics and antifungals**: Doxycycline, itraconazole
- **Other therapeutic categories**:
	- **Tricyclic antidepressants**: Imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline
	- **Calcium channel blockers**: Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g. felodipine)
	- **Other medications**: Aprepitant, dicumarol, eslicarbazepine, ethosuximide, levothyroxine, methadone, midazolam, praziquantel, protease inhibitors, tadalafil, theophylline, warfarin

Other drug interactions:

Cyclophosphamide is an inactive prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite in part by CYP3A. The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of cyclophosphamide are reportedly increased by chronic coadministration of CYP3A4 inducers. There is a potential for increased cyclophosphamide toxicity when coadministered with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects. Concomitant use of carbamazepine with olanzapine, dantrolene, or ibuprofen may increase plasma carbamazepine levels.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis complicated by acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and ventricular tachycardia [^113ZJxX8]. Thyroid (2008). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis, in combination with an acute episode of general flaccid paralysis and hypokalemia, is common in young Asian men with hyperthyroidism. We report the very rare complications of involvement of the respiratory muscles and ventricular tachycardia in this disorder.

A 29-year-old man exhibited profound paralysis after prolonged fasting. Severe hypokalemia was noted (K(+): 1.4 mmol/L). Although the patient was treated with potassium chloride, he suffered from respiratory distress and chest tightness. Arterial blood gas indicated acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (pCO(2): 118.9 mmHg), and ventricular tachycardia was documented by electrocardiogram. The patient was intubated for ventilatory support and treated with intravenous potassium, after which paralysis gradually resolved. Thyroid function tests showed elevated free thyroxine and low thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations, even though the patient did not have goiter or typical symptoms of thyrotoxicosis.

Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis usually involves the proximal muscles of the limbs, but on rare occasions, it can affect the respiratory muscles with the potential for severe and even fatal complications.

### Audit of long-term treatment outcomes of thyrotoxicosis in a single-centre virtual clinic: The utility of long-term antithyroid drugs [^115w4FB7]. Clinical endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Remission and relapse rates**: We identified 1398 post-ATD remission phases, with 831 remission phases following the first course of ATD. The mean interval from the start of this post-ATD phase to the date of the latest TFTs was 9.0 years. Overall, 57.2% of these phases ended in relapse (55.5% after the first course, 59.6% after subsequent courses); in the 1257 phases where the length of the preceding course of ATD was at least 180 days, the equivalent relapse rates were 56.2% (54.9% and 58.2%).

The detailed outcomes of these 1257 phases are summarized in Table 4. In autoimmune aetiology, the relapse rate was 52.7% after the first course of ATD, occurring at a mean of 542 days. The relapse rate was higher in nodular disease (79.1% following a first course); however, a significant minority of cases remained in remission off treatment at prolonged follow-up (20.9% at a mean follow-up of 7.8 years).

Table 4 summarizes crude rates of remission, relapse, and hypothyroidism after first and subsequent ATD treatment courses in different aetiologies. Over 60% of relapses occurred within the first year and over 90% within 4 years, with relapse occurring slightly earlier in patients with nodular disease and after repeat courses of ATD in autoimmune disease.

Overall, in patients who relapsed, the median time to diagnosis was 213 days, with a range from 0 (i.e. relapse identified on the first posttreatment blood) to 20.6 years. The median time to the first low TSH was 203 days. Spontaneous hypothyroidism occurred in 5% of autoimmune cases during remission.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: A spine consultation [^113eaPjS]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

In conclusion, although not a disorder of spinal etiology, it is imperative that spine surgeons are aware of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) as it is a life-threatening condition associated with acute-onset extremity weakness for which they may be consulted. Key findings in the history, examination, and laboratory evaluation can aid in prompt diagnosis, obviating the need for expensive imaging. Prompt diagnosis reduces time to appropriate treatment, which includes nonselective beta-blockers, potassium repletion, and addressing the thyrotoxicosis. As the immigrant population in the United States continues to rise, so does the incidence of this uncommon disorder, compelling spine specialists to be informed of TPP and to include it in their differential diagnosis.

### Bupropion hydrochloride [^113ag92W]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Potential for bupropion hydrochloride tablets to affect other drugs**: Bupropion and its metabolites (erythrohydrobupropion, threohydrobupropion, hydroxybupropion) are CYP2D6 inhibitors. Therefore, coadministration of bupropion hydrochloride tablets with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase the exposures of drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6. Such drugs include certain antidepressants (e.g. venlafaxine, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g. metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g. propafenone and flecainide). When used concomitantly with bupropion hydrochloride tablets, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of these CYP2D6 substrates, particularly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index.

- **Drugs that require metabolic activation by CYP2D6 to be effective**: Drugs such as tamoxifen, which require CYP2D6 for activation, could theoretically have reduced efficacy when administered with inhibitors like bupropion hydrochloride tablets. Patients treated with both bupropion and such drugs may require increased doses of the drug [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Digoxin**: Coadministration of bupropion with digoxin may decrease plasma digoxin levels. It is advised to monitor plasma digoxin levels in patients treated concomitantly with bupropion and digoxin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Drugs that lower seizure threshold**: Exercise extreme caution when coadministering bupropion hydrochloride tablets with other drugs that lower the seizure threshold.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: A spine consultation [^113DTCnZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

**Management and post–emergency department course**: The patient was diagnosed with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP), and an endocrinology consultation was obtained. As per the recommendations of the endocrinology team, the patient was placed on methimazole (10 mg every 8 hours) and propranolol (40 mg every 6 hours). Methimazole was then changed to 20 mg twice daily. The patient was also started on dexamethasone (2 mg intravenously every 8 hours) because of its role in inhibiting peripheral conversion of thyroid hormone from T4 to the more active T3 form. On final evaluation before discharge, the patient had fully recovered all deficits.

### An atypical presentation of high potassium renal secretion rate in a patient with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: A case report [^111y7ntg]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

When encountering a hypokalemic patient with hyperthyroidism and renal potassium wasting, the possibility of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) should be considered. This is due to the observation that high renal potassium secretion may occur in the early stages of TPP. Therefore, caution is advised when prescribing potassium replacement to prevent rebound hyperkalemia in such circumstances.

### SPL drug information for bupropion hydrochloride XL [^111jreUS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of bupropion hydrochloride XL PO (also known as Forfivo XL, Wellbutrin XL) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. Consider safer alternatives. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Enroll patients in a dedicated pregnancy outcome monitoring registry. A pregnancy exposure registry is available. Neonates exposed to this drug late in the third trimester may require respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or prolonged hospitalization. Exposed neonates should be monitored after delivery for direct toxic effects of this drug, drug discontinuation syndrome, and serotonin syndrome (e.g. respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypo/hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, constant crying).

The drug bupropion hydrochloride XL PO (also known as Forfivo XL, Wellbutrin XL) is classified under category B2 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals are inadequate or may be lacking, but available data show no evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### Concurrent Graves disease thyrotoxicosis and myasthenia gravis: The treatment of the former may dangerously reveal the latter [^114Yg9TR]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Autoimmune thyroxicosis and myasthenia gravis are often associated. In both diseases, clinical features may include neuromuscular weakness, making their distinction challenging. We report a patient with known Graves disease who presented with generalized fatigue, initially attributed solely to thyrotoxicosis, and who experienced severe respiratory failure linked to associated myasthenia gravis that was unmasked by medication used in the perioperative management of his thyrotoxicosis. Anaesthetists should always consider myasthenia gravis in cases of hyperthyroidism presenting with neuromuscular features.
