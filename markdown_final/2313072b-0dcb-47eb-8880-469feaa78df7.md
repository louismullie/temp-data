## Question

FOr a 16 year old girl with thick nasal discharge and facial swelling following a course of amoxicillin for URI, would internasal fluticasone or mometasone be helpful?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether intranasal corticosteroids would help a 16-year-old with thick nasal discharge and facial swelling after a course of amoxicillin for an upper respiratory infection, and if so, which agent and dose to choose, with attention to efficacy and safety in adolescents. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the working diagnosis and whether this looks like acute bacterial rhinosinusitis versus a protracted viral/inflammatory episode. Then, I should review the evidence for intranasal corticosteroids in acute rhinosinusitis, including magnitude and timing of benefit. Next, I need to check pediatric safety data and systemic bioavailability. After that, I will compare mometasone and fluticasone, but wait, I should verify pharmacologic selectivity before drawing a conclusion. Finally, I will outline a practical, evidence-informed dosing plan and integrate it with antibiotic stewardship and follow-up precautions [^111Nbh4u] [^114RCeCn] [^115izRZV].

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture and pathophysiology. Thick purulent discharge plus facial swelling after a recent URI is compatible with acute rhinosinusitis, and given persistence despite amoxicillin, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis or ongoing mucosal inflammation with ostial obstruction remains likely; mucosal edema leading to retained secretions and pressure is the target for local anti-inflammatory therapy, but hold on, I should verify that intranasal corticosteroids actually improve outcomes in acute disease rather than only in chronic phenotypes [^111Nbh4u].

> Next, I should review the efficacy data. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials found intranasal corticosteroids confer a small but significant increase in symptom resolution or improvement at 14–21 days, with the clearest gains by day 21 and for facial pain and congestion, which maps to this patient's complaints, suggesting a gradual anti-inflammatory effect rather than immediate relief [^111Nbh4u] [^1114LYnv]. In two large trials of mometasone furoate nasal spray for acute, uncomplicated rhinosinusitis in patients aged 12 years and older, 200 mcg twice daily improved major symptom scores, increased minimal-symptom days, and shortened time to sustained improvement versus placebo, and in one trial even outperformed amoxicillin on symptom metrics, which supports using an intranasal steroid as monotherapy or adjunct in this setting, although I need to acknowledge the absolute benefit is modest and accrues over 1–3 weeks [^1141oJX9] [^115dFxVw].

> I need to check safety and systemic exposure in adolescents. Modern intranasal corticosteroids have extremely low systemic bioavailability (for example, mometasone < 0.1% and fluticasone propionate < 1%), which makes clinically meaningful hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis effects unlikely at therapeutic doses, and pediatric systematic review data show no persistent HPA-axis suppression or clinically important growth effects, with local adverse events like mild epistaxis comparable to placebo in pooled analyses, which reassures me for a 16-year-old, though I should still counsel on proper spray technique to minimize nosebleeds [^116Xuqhq] [^113JnYdb]. In pediatric randomized studies of fluticasone furoate for allergic rhinitis, epistaxis was infrequent and generally mild, further supporting tolerability in youth, although those trials address allergic rather than infectious rhinosinusitis physiology, so I should not over-extrapolate efficacy while still relying on the safety signal [^111JATmB].

> Now, fluticasone versus mometasone — let me think about relative advantages. At first glance, I was going to say mometasone is the more selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist with higher receptor affinity and thus the obvious choice, but wait, I should verify that assumption; pharmacologic comparisons suggest overall glucocorticoid potency is similar across modern agents, and in fact mometasone shows more off-target activity at progesterone and mineralocorticoid receptors than fluticasone propionate, making it less specific, not more, even though both are highly potent at the glucocorticoid receptor, so I need to correct my initial impression about selectivity [^114oJ5RG] [^116vzuif]. Head-to-head trials in acute rhinosinusitis are lacking, but because mometasone has direct randomized evidence in acute disease (≥ 12 years), while fluticasone's strongest pediatric data are in allergic rhinitis, it is reasonable to prioritize mometasone for ARS efficacy and consider fluticasone as an acceptable alternative when availability, prior response, or formulation preferences favor it, acknowledging the evidence gap for ARS per se with fluticasone [^1141oJX9] [^115dFxVw] [^111rBwmZ].

> I should confirm dosing and duration from trials and labeling. In acute, uncomplicated rhinosinusitis RCTs, mometasone furoate 200 mcg twice daily for 15 days provided the clearest benefit, with once-daily dosing less consistently superior, so for this 16-year-old I would start mometasone 200 mcg per nostril daily divided as 100 mcg per spray for a total of 200 mcg twice daily for about 15–21 days, then reassess; using the adult ABRS label dose of two sprays per nostril daily is on-label only for adults, but adolescents ≥ 12 years were included in the ARS trials supporting the twice-daily regimen, which I should make clear as evidence-based though technically off-label for pediatric ABRS labeling in some regions [^1141oJX9] [^115dFxVw] [^116vfz3u]. If mometasone is not available, fluticasone furoate 110 mcg once daily could be used based on AR experience and pediatric safety, while acknowledging the ARS efficacy evidence is strongest for mometasone, and I would maintain therapy for at least two weeks to allow the anti-inflammatory effect to manifest [^113SWWw2] [^111JATmB].

> Hold on, let me integrate this with antibiotic stewardship and the prior amoxicillin exposure. The modest but real symptom benefit with intranasal steroids supports their use as adjuncts or monotherapy in uncomplicated ARS, while antibiotics should be reserved for classic bacterial patterns or clinical deterioration; after amoxicillin failure, if bacterial features persist or "double-sickening" appears, guidelines favor either watchful waiting with close follow-up or switching to an agent with beta-lactamase coverage, but I should emphasize that intranasal steroids address the inflammatory obstruction pathophysiology irrespective of bacterial status and are appropriate to start now [^115izRZV] [^114RCeCn].

> I should also verify the role of systemic corticosteroids here. Cochrane reviews show that short courses of oral steroids may provide transient symptom relief only when combined with antibiotics in adults, with uncertain sustained benefit and a less favorable risk profile, so routine systemic steroids are not recommended for uncomplicated ARS in adolescents; this reinforces choosing an intranasal route with low systemic exposure for this case [^115ig6Gq] [^112U5ttG].

> Finally, I will now examine practical use and follow-up. Advise proper technique — aim laterally away from the septum, gentle sniff, and consider adding isotonic saline sprays or low-volume rinses for comfort and mucus clearance, while monitoring for mild epistaxis or irritation; if facial swelling progresses, fever spikes, vision changes, or severe frontal headache develop, I need to ensure urgent reassessment for suppurative complications and reconsider imaging or antibiotic escalation, but otherwise I expect gradual improvement over 1–3 weeks with intranasal corticosteroid therapy [^111Nbh4u] [^114RCeCn].

Intranasal fluticasone or mometasone is likely beneficial and would be helpful for a 16-year-old with thick nasal discharge and facial swelling after amoxicillin for a URI. Intranasal corticosteroids reduce nasal inflammation, congestion, and facial pressure in acute rhinosinusitis [^111Nbh4u], with modest symptom relief [^1114LYnv] and low systemic absorption [^114oJ5RG]. They are safe in adolescents, with minimal systemic effects and rare local side effects (mild epistaxis, irritation) [^111Ywu8q] [^113JnYdb]. Use fluticasone propionate 100–200 mcg daily [^113cEJRR] or mometasone furoate 100–200 mcg daily for 2–3 weeks, and reassess if symptoms persist or worsen.

## Clinical evidence supporting intranasal corticosteroids

Intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) reduce nasal inflammation, congestion, and facial pressure in acute rhinosinusitis [^1141oJX9]. A systematic review and meta-analysis found modest symptom relief [^111Nbh4u], particularly for facial pain and congestion, with benefits most pronounced at 21 days [^1114LYnv] — supporting an approximately three-week course.

---

## Pharmacological properties and clinical efficacy

Fluticasone and mometasone are second-generation INCS with high glucocorticoid receptor affinity [^114oJ5RG], potent anti-inflammatory effects, and minimal systemic absorption [^116Xuqhq]. Clinical studies show both agents significantly reduce nasal congestion, discharge, and facial pressure in acute and chronic rhinosinusitis [^115dFxVw] [^111GLs1U].

---

## Safety profile in pediatric and adolescent populations

Intranasal corticosteroids have a favorable safety profile in pediatric and adolescent populations [^111MN9Nr]. A systematic review and meta-analysis found no persistent cortisol abnormalities or intraocular pressure changes with INCS use in children [^113JnYdb]; although a minority of trials reported reduced growth velocity, INCS were overall considered safe at recommended doses [^113JnYdb]. Common local adverse effects include mild epistaxis and nasal irritation, which are generally self-limited and rarely require discontinuation [^111JATmB]. Systemic adverse effects — such as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression or growth retardation — are rare due to minimal systemic absorption [^116Xuqhq] [^113JnYdb].

---

## Recommended dosing and administration

For a 16-year-old, recommended dosing is: fluticasone propionate 100–200 mcg intranasally once daily (maximum 200 mcg/day) [^113cEJRR] or mometasone furoate 100–200 mcg intranasally once daily (maximum 200 mcg/day). Proper administration technique is essential: gently blow the nose before dosing, aim the spray away from the nasal septum, and avoid forceful sniffing after spraying.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) [^114q8wyq] and the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS) [^114cvtFJ] recommend intranasal corticosteroids as first-line therapy for symptomatic relief in acute and chronic rhinosinusitis. They also endorse INCS use in pediatric and adolescent populations given their favorable safety and efficacy profiles [^113mEew1].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Intranasal corticosteroids, such as fluticasone and mometasone, are effective and safe for managing thick nasal discharge and facial swelling in adolescents following a URI [^111Nbh4u]. They provide modest symptom relief — particularly for nasal congestion and facial pressure — with minimal systemic absorption [^114oJ5RG], supporting use in pediatric patients. A course of about three weeks is reasonable [^1114LYnv], with reassessment if symptoms persist or worsen.

### Molecular and clinical pharmacology of intranasal corticosteroids: Clinical and therapeutic implications [^114oJ5RG]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Intranasal corticosteroids (INSs) are effective treatments for allergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, and nasal polyposis. In recent years, increased understanding of corticosteroid and glucocorticoid receptor pharmacology has enabled the development of molecules designed specifically to achieve potent, localized activity with minimal risk of systemic exposure. Pharmacologic potency studies using affinity and other assessments have produced similar rank orders of potency, with the most potent being mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, and its modification, fluticasone furoate. The furoate and propionate ester side chains render these agents highly lipophilic, which may facilitate their absorption through nasal mucosa and uptake across phospholipid cell membranes. These compounds demonstrate negligible systemic absorption. Systemic absorption rates are higher among the older corticosteroids (flunisolide, beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide, and budesonide), which have bioavailabilities in the range of 34–49%.

Studies, including 1-year studies with mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, and budesonide that evaluated potential systemic effects of INSs in children, have generally found no adverse effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function or growth. Clinical data suggest no significant differences in efficacy between the INSs. Theoretically, newer agents with lower systemic availability may be preferable and may come closer to the pharmacokinetic/pharmacologic criteria for the ideal therapeutic choice.

### Intranasal corticosteroid therapy: Systematic review and meta-analysis of reported safety and adverse effects in children [^113JnYdb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The study aimed to address concerns regarding the safety profile of both FDA-approved and non-FDA-approved intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) use in pediatric patients. A systematic review was conducted using the MEDLINE, PubMed, and EMBASE databases, employing a comprehensive search strategy inclusive of all INCS formulations and associated adverse events. The study design adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and additional sources were identified through references from relevant articles.

A structured literature search was performed, and data were extracted on variables such as age, population size, study design, drug dosage, route and frequency, as well as the presence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, ocular symptoms, and growth velocity adverse events.

A total of 33 studies met the inclusion criteria, involving the use of INCS as nasal sprays and drops. No persistent abnormalities were observed in cortisol levels or intraocular pressure changes. A reduction in growth velocity was reported in 3 out of 10 randomized trials. The meta-analysis of epistaxis and headache revealed no significant difference in the incidence of these conditions when FDA-approved INCSs were compared to placebo, with a relative risk of 1.12 (95% CI, 0.77–1.63; p = 0.56) for headaches and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.60–1.18; p = 0.32) for epistaxis. However, meta-analysis was not conducted for growth velocity, HPA axis suppression, and ocular changes.

In conclusion, FDA-approved administration routes of INCSs are generally safe for use in the pediatric population.

### Intranasal corticosteroids in management of acute sinusitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Nbh4u]. Annals of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is a common condition in ambulatory care, where it is frequently treated with antibiotics, despite little evidence of their benefit. Intranasal corticosteroids might relieve symptoms; however, evidence for this benefit is currently unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of intranasal corticosteroids on the symptoms of acute sinusitis.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases until February 2011 for studies comparing intranasal corticosteroids with a placebo in children or adults having clinical symptoms and signs of acute sinusitis or rhinosinusitis in ambulatory settings. We excluded chronic/allergic sinusitis. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the studies' methodological quality.

- **Results**: We included six studies with a total of 2,495 patients. In five studies, antibiotics were prescribed in addition to corticosteroids or a placebo. Intranasal corticosteroids resulted in a significant, small increase in resolution of or improvement in symptoms at days 14 to 21 (risk difference [RD] = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.03–0.13). Analysis of individual symptom scores revealed most consistently significant benefits for facial pain and congestion. Subgroup analysis by the time of reported outcomes showed a significant beneficial effect at 21 days (RD = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06–0.17), but not at 14 to 15 days (RD = 0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.11). Meta-regression analysis of trials using different doses of mometasone furoate showed…

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute sinusitis [^115ig6Gq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). High credibility.

Acute sinusitis is a common reason for patients to seek primary care consultations. The related impairment of daily functioning and quality of life is attributable to symptoms such as facial pain and nasal congestion.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids in relieving symptoms of acute sinusitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 2, 2011, which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Reviews of Effects (DARE), and the NHS Health Economics Database, MEDLINE (1966 to June week 2, 2011), and EMBASE (January 2009 to June 2011).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing systemic corticosteroids to placebo or standard clinical care for patients with acute sinusitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Four RCTs with a total of 1008 adult participants met our inclusion criteria. We judged studies to be of moderate methodological quality. Acute sinusitis was defined clinically in all trials. However, the three trials performed in ear, nose, and throat (ENT) outpatient clinics also used radiological assessment as part of their inclusion criteria. All participants received oral antibiotics and were assigned to either oral corticosteroids (prednisone 24 mg to 80 mg daily or betamethasone 1 mg daily) or the control treatment (placebo in three trials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in one).

### Intranasal fluticasone furoate in pediatric allergic rhinitis: Randomized controlled study [^111rBwmZ]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

Intranasal corticosteroids are the most efficacious anti-inflammatory medications for allergic rhinitis (AR). However, the efficacy and safety of intranasal corticosteroids in children have not yet been subject to specific research in China. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate nasal spray (FFNS) in a Chinese pediatric population.

- **Methods**: In this phase 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, pediatric AR patients aged 2–12 years were randomized 1:1:1, receiving either FFNS 55 µg or 110 µg or placebo. Electronic diary cards were completed to record symptoms, rescue medication use, and treatment compliance. Anterior rhinoscopy and overall response to therapy were evaluated and recorded.

- **Results**: Patients treated with FFNS at either dose experienced a significantly greater reduction in daily reflective total nasal symptom score compared with placebo. This was maintained in a younger subset of patients (2–6 years). Drug-related adverse events occurred in < 20% of patients in all groups. FFNS was well tolerated at both doses.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates favorable efficacy and safety profiles for FFNS 55 µg or 110 µg in Chinese pediatric populations (2–12 years), supporting its use in clinical treatment for AR children, including younger children aged 2–6 years.

- **Impact**: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of intranasal fluticasone furoate in Chinese pediatric allergic rhinitis. This research not only addresses the deficiency in efficacy and safety data.

### Mometasone furoate nasal spray increases the number of minimal-symptom days in patients with acute rhinosinusitis [^115dFxVw]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is triggered by viral or, uncommonly, bacterial infection, causing inflammatory symptoms for ≤ 12 weeks.

- **Objective**: To investigate effects of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) vs. amoxicillin and placebo on minimal-symptom days.

- **Methods**: A double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled 15-day study randomly assigned patients 12 years of age or older to MFNS 200 μg twice daily, MFNS 200 μg once daily, amoxicillin 500 mg 3 times daily, or placebo. Patients had a baseline rhinosinusitis major symptom score (MSS; combined rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, congestion, sinus headache, facial pain) of ≥ 5 and ≤ 12 (maximum: 15) for 7 to 28 days; scores were similar among groups. Minimal-symptom days and minimal-congestion days were defined post hoc by average AM/PM MSS ≤ 4 and average AM/PM congestion ≤ 1.

- **Results**: MFNS twice daily (n = 234) showed more minimal-symptom days vs. placebo (n = 246) (62.69% vs 50.33%; P < .0001) or amoxicillin (n = 248) (54.35%; p = 0.0040). The MFNS QD was associated with numerically more minimal-symptom days than amoxicillin or placebo (54.72%; P ≤ .8982). MFNS was associated with more minimal-congestion days than placebo (72.97%, 67.73%, and 56.67% for twice daily, once daily, and placebo respectively; P < .0001 for each vs. placebo) and MFNS BID with more minimal-congestion days than amoxicillin (72.97% vs. 64.15%; p = 0.0007). Median time to first minimal-symptom day sustained until study end was 8.5 days for MFNS BID vs. 11 for placebo (P = .0085).

- **Conclusion**: MFNS 200 μg twice daily significantly increased minimal-symptom days.

### Long-term safety of mometasone furoate/formoterol combination for treatment of patients with persistent asthma [^115eLLZx]. The Journal of Asthma (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the long-term safety of the mometasone furoate/formoterol (MF/F) combination, administered through a metered-dose inhaler (MDI), for patients with persistent asthma who were previously on medium- to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). This study is based on the recommendation of combining an ICS with a long-acting β2-agonist for patients whose asthma is inadequately controlled with ICS monotherapy.

This 52-week, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, evaluator-blinded study included 404 patients aged over 12 years. They were stratified according to their previous ICS dose, either medium or high, and randomized 2:1 to receive twice-daily treatment of MF/F (200/10 or 400/10 μg) or fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/S; 250/50 or 500/50 μg). The primary endpoint was the number and percentage of patients reporting any adverse event (AE). Additional safety evaluations included plasma cortisol 24-hour area under the curve (AUC 0–24h) and ocular changes. Pulmonary function, asthma symptoms, and the use of rescue medication were monitored throughout the study.

Results: The incidence of patients experiencing more than one treatment-emergent AE was similar across the treatment groups. For those receiving MF/F 200/10 μg, 77.3% (n = 109) reported AEs, while in the FP/S 250/50 μg group, 82.4% (n = 56) reported AEs. In the MF/F 400/10 μg group, 79.2% (n = 103) reported AEs, and in the FP/S 500/50 μg group, 76.9% (n = 50) reported AEs. The rates of treatment-related AEs were also similar across treatment groups: MF/F 200/10 μg, 28.4%; FP/S 250/50 μg, 23.5%; MF/F 400/10 μg, 23.1%; and FP/S 500/50 μg, 20.0%. Headache (3.7%) and dysphonia (2.7%) were identified as the most common treatment-related AEs overall.

### Intranasal steroids versus placebo or no intervention for chronic rhinosinusitis [^111GLs1U]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

This review is one of six examining the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterized by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses, leading to nasal blockage, rhinorrhea, facial pressure/pain, and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. The use of topical (intranasal) corticosteroids has been widely advocated for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis, given the belief that inflammation is a major component of this condition.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of intranasal corticosteroids in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 8), MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 11 August 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing intranasal corticosteroids (e.g. beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide, budesonide) against placebo or no treatment in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity, and the most common adverse event, epistaxis. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL.

### Use of topical nasal therapies in the management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^117TqcWs]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

To determine whether the use of topical nasal therapies with saline alone and in combination with antibiotics, antifungals, or corticosteroids is effective in the treatment of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a systematic literature search was performed. This search utilized the MEDLINE database (1966 to May 2012), the EMBASE database (1980 to May 2012), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.

- **Review methods**: Electronic databases were searched by three otolaryngologists. Studies on five major categories of topical nasal therapies were sought, including saline (hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic), topical antibiotics, topical steroids, and topical antifungals. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of these trials were included.

- **Results**: Sixteen randomized controlled trials were identified examining topical saline (hypertonic or isotonic) in CRS patients. Two randomized controlled trials were found studying the effect of topical antibiotics in patients with CRS. Four randomized controlled trials examined topical antifungal treatment for CRS. Twenty-five randomized controlled trials investigated the use of topical steroids in CRS patients.

- **Conclusion**: A high aggregate quality of evidence supports the effectiveness of saline irrigations in treating CRS. However, there is insufficient evidence to support a clear benefit of topical antibiotics in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Topical antifungal therapies have not been shown to be significantly different in efficacy than saline controls.

### Effect of an intranasal corticosteroid on quality of life and local microbiome in young children with chronic rhinosinusitis: A randomized clinical trial [^111Ywu8q]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Intranasal corticosteroids (INCs) remain the first-line treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in both adults and children, despite the lack of evidence regarding their efficacy in the pediatric population. Similarly, their effect on the sinonasal microbiome has not been well documented.

To assess the clinical, immunological, and microbiological effects of 12 weeks of an INC in young children with CRS, an open-label randomized clinical trial was performed in a pediatric allergy outpatient clinic in 2017 and 2018. Children aged 4 to 8 years with CRS diagnosed by a specialist were included. Data were analyzed from January 2022 to June 2022.

Patients were randomized to receive intranasal mometasone in an atomizer for 12 weeks (1 application per nostril, once per day) and supplemental 3-mL sodium chloride (NaCl), 0.9%, solution in a nasal nebulizer once a day for 12 weeks (INC group) or 3-mL NaCl, 0.9%, solution in a nasal nebulizer once a day for 12 weeks (control group).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Measures taken both before and after treatment included the Sinus and Nasal Quality of Life Survey (SN-5), a nasopharynx swab for microbiome analysis by next-generation sequencing methods, and nasal mucosa sampling for occurrence of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs).

Of the 66 children enrolled, 63 completed the study. The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 6.1 (1.3) years; 38 participants (60.3%) were male and 25 (39.7%) were female. The clinical improvement reflected by reduction in SN-5 score was noted in the INC group compared to controls, suggesting better management of symptoms in the treatment group.

### Intranasal fluticasone furoate in pediatric allergic rhinitis: Randomized controlled study [^112mzYsp]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

This study was conducted from September 2015 to October 2017. Overall, 505 patients were screened, and 358 patients were randomized. Two patients who failed screening and were randomized in error were not included in the study population. All randomized patients received at least one dose of the intended treatment and comprised the ITT population: FFNS 55 µg once daily (n = 119), FFNS 110 µg once daily (n = 119), and placebo group (n = 120). The end of the study was defined as the last patient's last visit at follow-up.

Baseline characteristics were well balanced across treatment arms. The percentage of patients aged 2 and 12 years was the lowest of all the ages within the ITT population (3%). Nocturnal nasal symptoms were higher than daytime symptoms. The overall mean (standard deviation) symptom scores were 8.6 (1.48) at nighttime and 8.3 (1.45) in the daytime. A much higher percentage of patients had PAR (92%) compared to IAR (8%), and there was a greater proportion of males across all groups (n = 246; 69%). All patients were of Asian or East Asian race.

### Corticosteroids for the common cold [^115GAjA5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

The common cold is a frequent illness, which, although benign and self-limiting, results in many consultations to primary care and considerable loss of school or work days. Symptomatic treatments have limited benefit. Corticosteroids are an effective treatment in other upper respiratory tract infections, and their anti-inflammatory effects may also be beneficial in the common cold. This updated review has included one additional study.

- **Objectives**: To compare corticosteroids versus usual care for the common cold on measures of symptom resolution and improvement in children and adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 4), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (2015, Issue 2), NHS Health Economics Database (2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to May week 3, 2015), and EMBASE (January 2010 to May 2015).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, double-blind, controlled trials comparing corticosteroids to placebo or to standard clinical management.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis and instead present a narrative description of the available evidence.

- **Main results**: We included three trials (353 participants). Two trials compared intranasal corticosteroids to placebo, and one trial compared intranasal corticosteroids to usual care; no trials studied oral corticosteroids.

### Mometasone furoate is a less specific glucocorticoid than fluticasone propionate [^116vzuif]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Fluticasone propionate (FP) and mometasone furoate (MF) are potent synthetic corticosteroids widely used as anti-inflammatory agents to treat respiratory diseases. To assess the potential side effects associated with their use, their activities were compared, not only at the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) but also at other members of the steroid nuclear receptor family. Cell-based functional systems were established to measure different aspects of GR function and activity at all other steroid nuclear receptors.

The effects of MF and FP on the GR were potent and indistinguishable. Neither corticosteroid showed any activity at the oestrogen receptor, while both were weak antagonists of the androgen receptor. FP was a relatively weak agonist of the progesterone receptor; in contrast, MF was a very potent agonist of the progesterone receptor, exhibiting activity at similar concentrations to those that stimulate the GR (concentration generating 50% maximal effect (EC50) = 50 pM). Moreover, while FP was a weak antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (concentration generating 50% maximal inhibitory effect = 80 nM), MF displayed potent partial agonist activity (EC50 = 3 nM, 30%).

Mometasone furoate is considerably less specific for the glucocorticoid receptor than fluticasone propionate, showing significant activity at other nuclear steroid receptors.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^1134yktx]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Pass/fail results on sweep audiometry (fail at two or more frequencies at 25 dB hearing level in the better ear) did not differ between the groups: 63% (52/83) of treated children versus 58% (47/81) of those in the placebo group failed at three months, as did 59% (44/74) versus 51% (34/67) at nine months.

We evaluated concealment in children and parents (guardians), and the prediction of the correct group was no better than chance. More than 80% of parents (guardians) in the placebo group thought their children were receiving the active treatment. Reported adherence was very good or excellent in 95/99 (96%) children in the topical steroid group and 93/103 (90%) in the placebo group at one month, and in 79/90 (88%) and 78/89 (88%) at three months. Analysis of adherence by age group showed a non-significant difference for the main outcome at one and three months (Fisher's test 0.04; χ² test for trend P = 0.40).

### Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol [^111mQf91]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Transferring patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy**: Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal (HPA) function. Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn.

- **HPA suppression/adrenal insufficiency**: During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although fluticasone propionate/salmeterol MDPI may improve control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does not provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies. During periods of stress or a severe asthmatic attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physician for further instruction.

### Intranasal fluticasone furoate in pediatric allergic rhinitis: Randomized controlled study [^115uoA47]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

Intranasal corticosteroids are the most efficacious anti-inflammatory medications for allergic rhinitis (AR). However, the efficacy and safety of intranasal corticosteroids in children have not yet been subject to specific research in China. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate nasal spray (FFNS) in a Chinese pediatric population.

- **Methods**: In this phase 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, pediatric AR patients aged 2–12 years were randomized 1:1:1, receiving either FFNS 55 µg or 110 µg or placebo. Electronic diary cards were completed to record symptoms, rescue medication use, and treatment compliance. Anterior rhinoscopy and overall response to therapy were evaluated and recorded.

- **Results**: Patients treated with FFNS at either dose experienced a significantly greater reduction in daily reflective total nasal symptom score compared with placebo. This was maintained in a younger subset of patients (2–6 years). Drug-related adverse events occurred in less than 20% of patients in all groups. FFNS was well tolerated at both doses.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates favorable efficacy and safety profiles for FFNS 55 µg or 110 µg in Chinese pediatric populations (2–12 years), supporting its use in clinical treatment for AR children, including younger children aged 2–6 years.

- **Impact**: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of intranasal fluticasone furoate in Chinese pediatric allergic rhinitis. This research not only addresses the deficiency in efficacy and safety data.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^1155zK4m]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Topical intranasal corticosteroids have demonstrated efficacy in several small clinical trials, providing both empirical and theoretical support for further investigation. Their anti-inflammatory effects on the post-nasal space, peritubal lymphatic tissue, and encroaching adenoids have been highlighted. While oral steroids might offer some benefits in treating otitis media with effusion, their chronic use in children is often avoided due to the risks of severe idiosyncratic reactions and potential growth retardation. Consequently, many physicians opt for intranasal corticosteroids over oral options for safety reasons. Nevertheless, additional research is required to establish their clinical effectiveness when used alongside active monitoring in cohorts of affected children.

### Exhalation delivery systems for application of intranasal corticosteroids [^112iQGmp]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common sinonasal disorder resulting in significant inflammation in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Topical nasal steroids play an important role in the treatment of CRS. The exhalation delivery system with fluticasone (EDS-FLU) utilizes a patient's forced exhalation to power the delivery of topical steroids to deeper areas of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses most affected by CRS. This review focuses on evidence surrounding the safety and efficacy of the EDS-FLU system.

- **Methods**: A literature search was conducted on articles investigating the safety and efficacy of EDS-FLU. Relevant efficacy and safety data were examined and summarized from the studies.

- **Results**: The efficacy and safety of EDS-FLU in CRS, both with and without polyps, have been established in open-label and placebo-controlled phase 3 trials. There was a significant improvement in the cardinal symptoms of CRS and subjective patient-reported outcomes scores. Additionally, there was objective improvement in sinonasal inflammation as measured by polyp grade. Recent studies have also established significant improvement in health status and general quality of life following treatment using EDS-FLU. Emerging data have also examined patients who have previously had endoscopic sinus surgery and appropriate medical therapy, noting improvement in polyp burden and overall Lund-Kennedy scores after using EDS-FLU.

In conclusion, the exhalation delivery system with fluticasone demonstrates significant results in both patient-oriented outcomes and objective measures of sinonasal health.

### A prospective study on the efficacy of mometasone furoate monohydrate aqueous nasal spray on Chinese patients with allergic rhinitis [^115z5ija]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

We undertook a prospective study of the efficacy of a new intranasal steroid, mometasone furoate nasal spray (Nasonex; Schering-Plough Corp, Kenilworth, NJ), on Chinese patients with allergic rhinitis.

- **Study design**: Chinese patients with allergic rhinitis were recruited and assessed via a questionnaire that included demographic data and a Rhinitis Symptoms Score. Objective assessments of the nasal passages were performed using a 2.7-mm 30-degree rigid nasoendoscope, scored according to the modified Lund and Kennedy sinusitis staging and scoring for endoscopic appearances in rhinosinusitis. Assessments were conducted before treatment, after which 200 microg/d MFNS was prescribed. Patients were reevaluated at 8 and 16 weeks after commencing MFNS. A total of 51 patients completed the 16-week study.

- **Results**: There were significant reductions in mean Rhinitis Symptoms Score from 6.19 to 3.8 (P < 0.001) and mean Endoscopic Appearance Score from 4.6 to 3.58 (P = 0.046). Analysis showed reductions in the severity of all three aspects of rhinitis symptoms: rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal obstruction.

- **Conclusion**: Mometasone furoate nasal spray was effective in controlling allergic rhinitis and was well tolerated by patients.

### Should we prescribe antibiotics to this patient with persistent upper respiratory symptoms? Grand rounds discussion from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [^115izRZV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published advice for high-value care on the appropriate use of antibiotics for acute respiratory tract infections. They conducted a narrative literature review of evidence for antibiotic use in this setting that included recent clinical guidelines from professional societies, supplemented by randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews. They concluded that clinicians should reserve antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis in patients with persistent symptoms for more than 10 days, high fever, and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting for at least 3 consecutive days, or worsening symptoms following a typical viral illness that lasted 5 days and had initially improved ("double-sickening").

In this grand rounds, two prominent clinicians debate whether to initiate antibiotic treatment in a 62-year-old man with a history of sinusitis who presents with persistent upper respiratory symptoms. They review the data on which the ACP/CDC recommendations are based and discuss the potential benefits and risks, as well as the challenges and controversies, of prescribing antibiotic therapy in this setting.

### Added relief in the treatment of acute recurrent sinusitis with adjunctive mometasone furoate nasal spray [^117FHvQ1]. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2000). Low credibility.

Intranasal glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. However, their effectiveness as an anti-inflammatory adjunct in the treatment of acute sinusitis has not been adequately established in a controlled clinical study.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that intranasal corticosteroid treatment produces additional relief in the treatment of acute sinusitis when used alongside oral antibiotics.

- **Methods**: Patients aged 12 years and older with a history of recurrent sinusitis were treated during a new episode of acute sinusitis. Diagnosis was confirmed by symptoms and computed tomography scans of the paranasal sinuses. Patients underwent a 21-day treatment with amoxicillin clavulanate potassium and were randomized to receive either mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS; Nasonex [400 microg, twice daily]; n = 200 patients) or placebo spray (twice daily; n = 207 patients). Symptom scores for headache, facial pain, congestion, purulent rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, and cough were recorded at baseline and throughout the treatment period.

- **Results**: Baseline symptom scores indicated a moderate level of symptom severity comparable in both groups. Patient-recorded twice daily symptom scores revealed that adjunctive treatment with MFNS resulted in a significantly greater decrease in total symptom score (the primary efficacy variable) and in individual scores of inflammatory symptoms associated with the obstruction process — such as headache, congestion, and facial pain — compared with placebo. Symptoms associated with the secretory processes were evaluated but the text is incomplete.

### Steroids for acute sinusitis [^114vJmXR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is a common reason for primary care visits, causing significant symptoms and often resulting in time off work and school.

- **Objectives**: We examined whether intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) are effective in relieving symptoms of acute sinusitis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2006), EMBASE (1990 to June 2006), and bibliographies of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered eligible if they compared INCS treatment to placebo treatment of a control group for acute sinusitis. Acute sinusitis was defined by clinical diagnosis and confirmed by radiological evidence or by nasal endoscopy. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with either resolution or improvement of symptoms. Secondary outcomes were any adverse events that required discontinuation of treatment, drop-outs before the end of the study, rates of relapse, complications, and return to school or work.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted the data, assessed trial quality, and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

- **Main results**: Four studies with 1,943 participants met the inclusion criteria. The trials were well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled, where the included participants had acute sinusitis. The treatment assigned was INCS versus control treatment for 15 or 21 days. The rates of loss to follow-up in the studies were 7%, 11%, 41%, and 10%. When the results from the studies were analyzed, they showed…

### Intranasal fluticasone furoate in pediatric allergic rhinitis: Randomized controlled study [^117PCYCB]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

Use of rescue medication was very low across all treatment groups for the ITT population. In the first two weeks, the mean number of days without the use of rescue medication for patients treated with FFNS 55 µg and 110 µg was 13.3 and 13.4, respectively. This was slightly higher than for patients treated with a placebo (12.8 days). When comparing all experimental treatments versus placebo, the LS mean differences were all significant: FFNS 55 µg, P = 0.048; FFNS 110 µg, P = 0.011; FFNS 55/110 µg, P = 0.009. These statistically significant LS mean differences were maintained for all experimental groups over the 4-week study period.

In the primary analysis of the subset of patients aged 2–6 years, while the mean number of days without the use of rescue medication in the first two weeks was slightly higher for treatment groups versus placebo (FFNS 55 µg, 13.3; FFNS 110 µg, 13.5; placebo, 12.9), statistically significant LS mean differences were not observed in this time period. However, over four weeks of treatment, statistically significant LS mean differences were observed for all treatment groups compared with placebo (FFNS 55 µg, P = 0.007; FFNS 110 µg, P < 0.001; FFNS 55/110 µg, P < 0.001).

After the first two weeks of treatment, 33% of patients treated with FFNS 55 µg and 43% of patients treated with FFNS 110 µg rated their overall response to therapy as "significantly improved", compared with only 12% of patients in the placebo group (P < 0.001). A similar trend was observed in the subset of patients.

### Impact of topical nasal steroid therapy on symptoms of nasal polyposis: a meta-analysis [^115ijqPR]. The Laryngoscope (2012). Low credibility.

Topical steroid therapy is an important strategy in the management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyposis. The objective of this study was to determine its impact on nasal symptoms in patients with nasal polyposis.

- **Study design**: The study was a systematic review with meta-analysis, employing standardized methodology.

- **Methods**: Inclusion criteria were randomized, placebo-controlled trials focusing on nasal polyposis and topical steroid therapy. Exclusion criteria were failure to report at least one symptom-based outcome measure, the use of systemic steroids, or mixed CRS cohorts with both polyp and nonpolyp patients. Quantitative analysis was performed using a random effect model, and the PRISMA guidelines for meta-analysis reporting were followed.

- **Results**: A total of 19 studies met the eligibility criteria. Seven were excluded from the meta-analysis due to significant heterogeneity in outcome reporting. Twelve studies were included for quantitative analysis, demonstrating a pooled risk ratio of 1.72 (95% confidence interval, 1.41–2.09), indicating significant improvement in nasal symptoms. All three topical steroid preparations — fluticasone, mometasone, and budesonide — improved symptoms. The seven studies excluded from the meta-analysis qualitatively confirmed the overall findings.

- **Conclusions**: Topical nasal steroid therapy improves nasal symptoms in CRS patients with nasal polyposis. Future studies need to evaluate the impact on quality of life, preferably using validated disease-specific instruments.

### Topical steroids in chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1163yjcS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether topical steroids provide symptomatic relief in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps.

- **Data sources**: The data were obtained from the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases.

- **Review methods**: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed on the articles identified by two independent reviewers. The focus was on all randomized controlled trials that evaluated intranasal corticosteroids in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without polyps. The quality of the included studies was evaluated, and results were synthesized using standard random-effects meta-analytical methods.

- **Results**: Of 424 potential studies, only nine randomized trials involving 657 patients in total were eligible. The quality of design and reporting was suboptimal, with only one trial adhering to accepted standards for reporting. Five trials combined outcome measures and reported on the overall response of CRS without polyps to topical steroids. The summary estimate for the overall response to treatment showed no significant benefit and substantial variability among studies (5 trials: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50–1.10, P = 0.14, chi(2) = 13.78, I(2) = 66.2%). The total symptom score was reported in three trials with a standardized mean difference favoring topical steroids (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.16–1.09, P = 0.009), with no evidence of heterogeneity (chi(2) = 3.03, P = 0.22). Although the data were limited, there were no reports of increased adverse effects with topical steroids.

The conclusion drawn is that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a clear overall benefit for topical steroids in CRS without polyps; however, their use appears to have a favorable safety profile without increased adverse effects.

### Use of off-label nasal steroid irrigations in long-term management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^115ak7es]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses and mucosa. Topical nasal corticosteroids are a mainstay treatment for CRS by reducing sinonasal inflammation and improving mucociliary clearance. However, topical corticosteroids have limited paranasal distribution, and patient response to treatment has been variable in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Thus, there is significant interest in evaluating the efficacy of nasal steroids delivered by nasal irrigation in order to improve penetration and absorption of topical steroids into the sinonasal mucosa. In this review, we discuss the use of off-label nasal steroid irrigations in the management of CRS.

- **Methods**: A review of clinical trials evaluating the use of nasal steroid irrigations for CRS in the PubMed electronic database was performed.

- **Results**: Of the 12 clinical studies identified, 10 evaluated budesonide irrigations while the remaining 2 focused on mometasone. The overwhelming majority of studies for both budesonide and mometasone supported the use of nasal irrigations with corticosteroids over nasal corticosteroid sprays alone. However, the heterogeneity in study design, patient cohort, and volume of steroid irrigation limit the interpretations of these studies.

- **Conclusions**: Nasal irrigation with corticosteroids is beneficial and safe for the treatment of CRS. Future RCTs controlling for type of surgical intervention, CRS pheno- and endo-type, as well as dosing and duration of nasal corticosteroid irrigations, are warranted.

### Intranasal fluticasone furoate in pediatric allergic rhinitis: Randomized controlled study [^114QmKF3]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

The primary comparisons of interest between treatment groups involved FFNS 55 μg or 110 μg versus placebo. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in daily rTNSS over the first two weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints included the overall response to therapy; mean change from baseline in daily rTNSS; reflective total ocular symptom score (rTOSS) over four weeks; intranasal finding score by anterior rhinoscopy; rescue loratadine use; and safety and tolerability. For the post hoc analysis, age (≥ 2 to ≤ 6 or > 6 to ≤ 12 years) and severity (moderate and severe) of nasal and ocular symptoms were utilized as parameters to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two FFNS treatment groups.

- **Statistical analysis**: A sample size of 360 randomized patients (120 per treatment group) was planned to ensure 100 eligible patients per group and at least 50 patients who were 2–6 years of age, assuming that 17% of patients would not be evaluable for the primary analysis. Based on a sample size of 100 patients per arm, the probability of observing a positive trend for the primary endpoint was 95% for patients aged 2–12 years, 90% for patients aged 2–6 years, and 88% for both age groups.

The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was used for efficacy analyses and included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication. A planned subgroup analysis of the ITT population comprising only patients aged 2–6 years was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of FFNS in younger patients.

### The safety of intranasal steroids [^111MN9Nr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The increasing use of intranasal steroids in the management of allergic rhinitis reflects their efficacy, tolerability, and safety. However, issues related to the safety of intranasal steroids continue to generate debate and confusion among clinicians. Consequently, there is often reluctance and uncertainty in prescribing these effective agents for the treatment of perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis.

- **Concerns**: Issues of particular concern are whether intranasal steroids adversely affect various homeostatic systems, influence growth and bone metabolism, and compromise ocular function. Furthermore, the expanding role of intranasal steroids in the pediatric, geriatric, and postmenopausal populations has raised concerns that these agents may result in a steroid burden that more readily causes adverse effects.

An extensive review of the literature overwhelmingly supports the assertion that intranasal steroids are safe in prescribed doses and should allay the misconceptions regarding their appropriate use in the management of allergic rhinitis.

### Safety of intranasal corticosteroids in acute rhinosinusitis [^116Xuqhq]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines for acute rhinosinusitis (RS) recommend the use of intranasal corticosteroids (INSs) as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. However, the adverse event (AE) profiles of oral glucocorticoids, largely resulting from the systemic absorption of those agents, have engendered concerns about the safety of INSs. These concerns persist for INSs despite significant clinical differences between them and systemic corticosteroids in systemic absorption and among the INSs in bioavailability, mechanism of action, and lipophilicity, which may contribute to differences in AEs.

For example, the systemic bioavailability of the INSs as a percentage of the administered drug is less than 0.1% for mometasone furoate, less than 1% for fluticasone propionate, 46% for triamcinolone acetonide, and 44% for beclomethasone dipropionate. A review of the safety profiles of INSs, as reported in clinical trials in acute and chronic RS and allergic rhinitis, shows primarily local AEs (e.g. epistaxis and headache) that are generally classified as mild to moderate, with occurrence rates similar to those with placebo. Studies of the safety of mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, budesonide, and triamcinolone acetonide did not identify any evidence of systemic AEs, such as growth retardation in children due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, bone mineral density loss, or cataracts, which suggests that INSs can be safely administered in patients with acute RS without concern for systemic AEs.

The common cold is a frequent illness, which, although benign and self-limiting, results in many consultations to primary care and considerable loss of school or work days. Symptomatic treatments have limited benefit. Corticosteroids are an effective treatment in other upper respiratory tract infections, and their anti-inflammatory effects may also be beneficial in the common cold.

- **Objectives**: To compare corticosteroids versus usual care for the common cold on clinical response rates in children and adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2012, Issue 5, which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Reviews of Effects (DARE) 2012, Issue 4, and the NHS Health Economics Database 2012, Issue 5; MEDLINE (1948 to May week 2, 2012) and EMBASE (January 2010 to May 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, double-blind, controlled trials comparing corticosteroids to placebo or to standard clinical management.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We were unable to perform meta-analysis, and instead, analysed results using narrative description of the available evidence.

- **Main results**: We included two trials (253 participants). Both compared intranasal corticosteroids to placebo; no trials studied oral corticosteroids. No benefit of intranasal corticosteroids was demonstrated for duration or severity of symptoms. In one trial of 54 participants, the number of symptomatic days was 10.3 in the…

### Intranasal fungal (Alternaria) infection related to nasal steroid spray [^113a8rmX]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

During the past three decades, intranasal corticosteroid sprays have been proven to be efficient and reasonably safe for the treatment of rhinitis, sinusitis, and nasal polyposis. The adverse effects are generally localized and self-limited, and are rarely systemic or significant.

We report an immunocompetent female treated with triamcinolone acetonide nasal spray for chronic rhinitis in whom an intranasal fungal infection with Alternaria species developed three months later. The infection was refractory to topical therapies alone and was resolved with a combination of systemic and topical antifungal therapy.

We also describe the clinical manifestations of this rare infection and our therapeutic experience. In addition, we reviewed previous literature of fungal infections related to nasal corticosteroid sprays and compared them with our report.

### Intranasal fluticasone furoate in pediatric allergic rhinitis: Randomized controlled study [^111JATmB]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

Drug-related adverse events occurred in less than 20% of patients in all treatment groups. The most common drug-related adverse event in all groups was epistaxis. This was also the most common drug-related adverse event in the subset of patients aged 2–6 years, occurring in 15% of patients treated with placebo compared with 5% and 7% of patients treated with FFNS 55 µg and 110 µg, respectively. All epistaxis events were mild in intensity, with the exception of one patient in the placebo group in whom the event was unresolved. A post hoc analysis indicated that the 6–12-year age subset had a lower incidence of drug-related adverse events in the placebo and FFNS 55 µg treatment groups.

Only one serious adverse event of tonsillitis was reported in a 4-year-old patient treated with FFNS 110 µg, but it was not considered to be related to the study drug. The patient was withdrawn from the study due to the event.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute sinusitis [^112U5ttG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is the inflammation and swelling of the nasal and paranasal mucous membranes and is a common reason for patients to seek primary care consultations. The related impairment of daily functioning and quality of life is attributable to symptoms such as facial pain and nasal congestion.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of systemic corticosteroids on clinical response rates and to determine adverse effects and relapse rates of systemic corticosteroids compared to placebo or standard clinical care in children and adults with acute sinusitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February week 1, 2014), and EMBASE (January 2009 to February 2014).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing systemic corticosteroids to placebo or standard clinical care for patients with acute sinusitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Five RCTs with a total of 1,193 adult participants met our inclusion criteria. We judged methodological quality to be moderate in four trials and high in one trial. Acute sinusitis was defined clinically in all trials. However, the three trials performed in ear, nose, and throat (ENT) outpatient clinics also used radiological assessment as part of their inclusion criteria. All participants were assigned to either oral corticosteroids (prednisone 24 mg to 80 mg daily or betamethasone 1 mg daily) or the control treatment (placebo in four trials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents in one trial).

### Clinical practice guideline (update): Adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and three new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, including radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should distinguish…

### Different types of intranasal steroids for chronic rhinosinusitis [^111hi4hx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

This review is one of six examining the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common condition characterized by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses, leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure or pain, and loss of sense of smell. It can occur with or without nasal polyps. Topical (intranasal) corticosteroids are used with the aim of reducing inflammation in the sinonasal mucosa to improve patient symptoms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of different types of intranasal steroids in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7), MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The search was conducted on 11 August 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing first-generation intranasal corticosteroids (e.g. beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide, budesonide) with second-generation intranasal corticosteroids (e.g. ciclesonide, fluticasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, betamethasone sodium phosphate), or sprays versus drops, or low-dose versus high-dose intranasal corticosteroids.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane were employed in the analysis. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health…

### Treating acute rhinosinusitis: comparing efficacy and safety of mometasone furoate nasal spray, amoxicillin, and placebo [^1141oJX9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Intranasal corticosteroids used with antibiotics are known to improve rhinosinusitis symptoms compared with antibiotic therapy alone. However, the efficacy of intranasal corticosteroid monotherapy for acute, uncomplicated rhinosinusitis is not established.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) versus amoxicillin and placebo in patients with acute, uncomplicated rhinosinusitis.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind, double-dummy trial, subjects (≥ 12 years; N = 981) were randomized to MFNS 200 micrograms once daily or twice daily for 15 days, amoxicillin 500 mg 3 times daily for 10 days, or respective placebo. Follow-up was 14 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean am/pm major symptom score over the treatment phase. Secondary efficacy endpoints included total symptom score. Safety assessments included disease recurrence during follow-up and adverse event monitoring.

- **Results**: Mometasone furoate nasal spray 200 micrograms twice daily was significantly superior to placebo (P < .001) and amoxicillin (P = .002) at improving the major symptom score. Starting on day 2, MFNS 200 micrograms twice daily improved total symptom score throughout treatment versus amoxicillin (P = .012) and placebo (P < .001). Global response to treatment was significantly greater with MFNS 200 micrograms twice daily versus amoxicillin (P = .013) and placebo (P = .001). Although significantly superior to placebo, MFNS 200 micrograms once daily was not superior to amoxicillin for the primary or secondary efficacy endpoints. All treatments were well tolerated.

### Efficacy and safety of mometasone furoate dry powder inhaler vs fluticasone propionate metered-dose inhaler in asthma subjects previously using fluticasone propionate [^1165QY5Z]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

To compare the efficacy and safety of mometasone furoate dry powder inhaler (DPI) administered once daily in the evening with fluticasone propionate metered-dose inhaler (MDI) administered twice daily, an 8-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study was conducted.

It compared mometasone furoate DPI, 400 micrograms every evening (1 puff daily), with fluticasone propionate MDI, two 125-microgram puffs twice daily, in 167 adults and adolescents with moderate persistent asthma previously using fluticasone propionate. The primary efficacy variable was the change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from baseline to the end point. Variables such as response to therapy and subject satisfaction with the inhaler devices were also analyzed.

Improvement in FEV1 was noted at the week 2 visit with both treatments and was maintained at the 4- and 8-week visits and at the end point for both groups. The mean percent change in FEV1 from baseline to the end point was 4.58% with mometasone furoate DPI and 6.98% with fluticasone propionate MDI (P = .35). At the end point, physicians rated 62% of the mometasone furoate DPI group as "improved" or "much improved" compared with 47% of the fluticasone propionate MDI group (P = .007). A significantly greater proportion of subjects in the mometasone furoate DPI group "liked the inhaler a lot" compared to subjects in the fluticasone propionate MDI group (46.8% vs. 22.4%; p = 0.01). Both treatments were well tolerated.

Mometasone furoate DPI, 400 micrograms every evening, provided comparable efficacy to fluticasone propionate MDI while being well received by subjects.

### Topical steroid for chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps [^112q7bBo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroid is used as part of a comprehensive medical treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without polyps. Nevertheless, there is insufficient evidence to show a clear overall benefit. Trials studying the efficacy of topical corticosteroids use various delivery methods in patients who have or have not had sinus surgery, which directly impacts topical delivery and distribution.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of topical steroid in patients with CRS without nasal polyps and perform a meta-analysis of symptom improvement data, including subgroup analysis by sinus surgery status and topical delivery methods.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was July 9, 2010.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized trials in which a topically administered corticosteroid was compared with either a placebo, no treatment, or an alternative topically administered corticosteroid for the treatment of CRS without polyps in patients of any age.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors reviewed the search results and selected trials meeting the eligibility criteria, obtaining full texts and contacting authors where necessary. We documented our justification for the exclusion of studies. Two authors extracted data using a pre-determined standardized data form.

### Intranasal fluticasone furoate in pediatric allergic rhinitis: Randomized controlled study [^113Max9D]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

FFNS receptor binding studies showed a higher affinity for glucocorticoid receptors compared with other corticosteroids and, in addition, greater potency in attenuating inflammatory states. In our study, the 110 µg once-daily dose of FFNS consistently demonstrated numerically greater reductions from baseline in patients with severe symptoms compared with the FFNS 55 µg once daily, although this reduction was not statistically significant. Glucocorticoids reduce inflammation through a combination of glucocorticoid receptors. The possible explanation for the similar change in rTNSS seen across both the 55 µg and 110 µg treatment groups may be that the glucocorticoid receptors in the nasal mucosa have reached saturation point at the low dose (≤ 55 µg) according to the dose–response relationship of the glucocorticoid.

The safety findings of the present study show that both doses of FFNS were well tolerated in children aged 2–12 years. The most common drug-related adverse event in all groups was epistaxis, and all epistaxis events were mild in intensity, occurring in 15% of patients treated with placebo compared with 5% and 7% of patients treated with FFNS 55 µg and 110 µg, respectively. Low-dose FFNS has a lower incidence of drug-related adverse events. It is important that AR therapy for pediatric patients should not compound the problems that AR can cause. Considering that children with poorly controlled AR often struggle with diminished alertness, inability to concentrate, and irritability at school, it is highly likely that medications linked to drowsiness could ultimately exacerbate these issues.

### Intranasal steroids for acute sinusitis [^1114LYnv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). High credibility.

Acute sinusitis is a common reason for primary care visits and causes significant symptoms, often resulting in time off from work and school.

- **Objectives**: We examined whether intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) are effective in relieving symptoms of acute sinusitis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2008, Issue 4), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2008), EMBASE (1990 to October 2008), and bibliographies of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered eligible if they compared INCS treatment to placebo in a control group for acute sinusitis. Acute sinusitis was defined by clinical diagnosis and confirmed by radiological evidence or nasal endoscopy. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with either resolution or improvement of symptoms. Secondary outcomes included any adverse events requiring discontinuation of treatment, drop-outs before the end of the study, rates of relapse, complications, and return to school or work.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted the data, assessed trial quality, and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

- **Main results**: Four studies with 1943 participants met the inclusion criteria. The trials were well designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled, in which the included participants had acute sinusitis. The treatment assigned was INCS versus control treatment for 15 or 21 days.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of sinusitis [^114rNTrA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient.

A subcommittee, composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, was selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups, including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics, have reviewed and revised the guideline.

- **Key considerations**: Three specific issues were considered: evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children; evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, nonantibiotic regimens; and the diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration.

It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children ≤ 6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary to…

### Intranasal corticosteroids for non-allergic rhinitis [^115rfotL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Non-allergic rhinitis is defined as dysfunction and non-infectious inflammation of the nasal mucosa caused by provoking agents other than allergens or microbes. It is common, with an estimated prevalence of around 10% to 20%. Patients experience symptoms of nasal obstruction, anterior rhinorrhoea/post-nasal drip, and sneezing. Several subgroups of non-allergic rhinitis can be distinguished depending on the trigger responsible for symptoms; these include occupation, cigarette smoke, hormones, medication, food, and age. On a molecular level, different disease mechanisms can also be identified. People with non-allergic rhinitis often lack effective treatment due to a poor understanding and lack of recognition of the underlying disease mechanism. Intranasal corticosteroids are one of the most common types of medication prescribed for patients with rhinitis or rhinosinusitis symptoms, including those with non-allergic rhinitis. However, it is unclear whether intranasal corticosteroids are truly effective in these patients.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of intranasal corticosteroids in the management of non-allergic rhinitis.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2019, Issue 7); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 July 2019.

### Efficacy of nasal mometasone for the treatment of chronic sinonasal disease in patients with inadequately controlled asthma [^114jEqd4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). High credibility.

Chronic sinonasal disease is common in patients with asthma and is associated with poor asthma control. However, no long-term trials have addressed whether chronic treatment of sinonasal disease improves asthma control.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine whether treatment of chronic sinonasal disease with nasal corticosteroids improves asthma control, as measured by the Childhood Asthma Control Test and the Asthma Control Test in children and adults, respectively.

- **Methods**: A 24-week multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial compared nasal mometasone with a placebo in adults and children with inadequately controlled asthma. Treatments were randomly assigned with concealment of allocation.

- **Results**: Two hundred thirty-seven adults and 151 children were randomized to receive nasal mometasone or placebo, and 319 participants completed the study. There was no significant difference in the Childhood Asthma Control Test score (difference in change with mometasone minus change with placebo [ΔM - ΔP], -0.38; 95% CI, -2.19 to 1.44; p = 0.68; age 6–11 years) or the Asthma Control Test score (ΔM - ΔP, 0.51; 95% CI, -0.46 to 1.48; p = 0.30; age ≥ 12 years) in those assigned to mometasone versus placebo. In children and adolescents (age 6–17 years), there was no difference in asthma or sinus symptoms, but a decrease in episodes of poorly controlled asthma was noted by a decrease in peak flow. In adults, there was a small improvement in asthma symptoms measured by the Asthma Symptom Utility Index (ΔM - ΔP, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.11; P < .01) and in nasal symptoms.
