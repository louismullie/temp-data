## Question

treatment of hyponatremia at 133 when patient has uncontrolled DM at 8% a1c and liver cirrhosis sec to NASH

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a measured sodium of 133 mEq/L in a patient with uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 8%) and cirrhosis from NASH. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the sodium is truly low after correcting for hyperglycemia and excluding pseudohyponatremia. Then, I should assess symptom severity and the tempo of change to determine urgency. Next, I will consider the pathophysiology of hyponatremia in cirrhosis to guide initial therapy, including fluid restriction and diuretic adjustments, while optimizing diabetes management. I should set safe correction limits, plan monitoring to avoid osmotic demyelination, and outline rescue strategies if overcorrection occurs. Finally, I will consider when to escalate to albumin, hypertonic saline, or vaptans, and link the sodium level to prognosis in cirrhosis [^113RUmSC] [^114C7k4P].

> Let me first confirm the true sodium concentration and the tonicity. Hyperglycemia lowers measured sodium via translocational shifts, so I need a contemporaneous serum glucose and to apply a correction, typically adding about 1.6 mEq/L for each 100 mg/dL increase above 100 mg/dL, though higher correction factors may apply at very high glucose levels; HbA1c 8% suggests an average glucose around 183 mg/dL, implying a correction of roughly +1.3 mEq/L, so a measured 133 mEq/L would correct to approximately 134.3 mEq/L, which is borderline normal, but wait, I should verify with the actual current glucose because HbA1c is an average and not a substitute for a point-in-time value. I also need to check measured serum osmolality and exclude pseudohyponatremia from hyperlipidemia or paraproteinemia before labeling this as hypotonic hyponatremia [^113Mdnha] [^113g8d3Y].

> Next, I should review symptoms and risk stratify the urgency. At a sodium of 133 mEq/L, severe symptoms such as seizures, vomiting, or cardiorespiratory distress are unlikely, and most patients are asymptomatic or have only mild cognitive complaints, but I should confirm the absence of acute neurologic findings and the chronicity of hyponatremia. In cirrhosis, even mild reductions are clinically relevant, but correction targets must be conservative because advanced liver disease increases risk for osmotic demyelination; in high-risk patients like those with cirrhosis, many experts limit correction to no more than 8 mEq/L in 24 hours with a daily goal of 4–6 mEq/L, recognizing that symptom-based severity grading still applies [^114hpGSU] [^1164gdyE] [^116JUkNn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the etiology. Initially, one might think uncontrolled diabetes with osmotic diuresis could create hypovolemia and hypovolemic hyponatremia, but in cirrhosis the dominant mechanism is hypervolemic dilutional hyponatremia driven by portal hypertension, splanchnic vasodilation, effective arterial underfilling, and non-osmotic vasopressin release, which impairs free water excretion. I should still confirm the hemodynamic profile and assess urine sodium and osmolality, recognizing that a urine sodium ≤ 30 mmol/L supports low effective arterial volume, while diuretic use can confound interpretation, and urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg indicates impaired water excretion consistent with vasopressin effect in cirrhosis [^117HWaGN] [^115Bfw9m] [^111B44kt].

> I will now implement conservative first-line therapy for mild, likely chronic hypervolemic hyponatremia. My first thought is strict water restriction for everyone, but wait, I should verify guideline nuances; AASLD advises water restriction even for mild asymptomatic hyponatremia in cirrhosis, often to less than 1,000 mL/day, whereas some UK guidance reserves stricter restriction for severe hyponatremia, so I should individualize and start with measured restriction while reinforcing dietary sodium management for ascites. Given Na 133 mEq/L corrected to about 134 mEq/L and absence of severe symptoms, a modest fluid restriction with close monitoring is reasonable, and I should avoid hypotonic fluids and only use isotonic saline if I have compelling evidence of true hypovolemia rather than cirrhotic hypervolemia [^113RUmSC] [^115TnYmq] [^114GuP3y].

> Let me evaluate and adjust diuretic therapy and other medications that worsen hyponatremia. I need to check for thiazides, SSRIs, carbamazepine, and other agents that potentiate vasopressin action or sodium loss and stop them if feasible, and I should reassess loop and aldosterone antagonist dosing used for ascites; if sodium were to trend down toward moderate hyponatremia or if AKI, encephalopathy, or cramps appear, I should reduce or hold diuretics, while recognizing that in severe hyponatremia diuretics are commonly discontinued in cirrhosis guidelines. I should confirm the diuretic-naïve baseline before making large changes to avoid precipitating fluid accumulation [^112uhRxs] [^117Rfm9d] [^111UMUD2].

> I should optimize diabetes management with awareness of sodium dynamics. As glucose normalizes, sodium will rise translocationally, so I need to interpret changes carefully to avoid being misled by apparent correction, and I should target reasonable inpatient glucose goals while avoiding excessive osmotic shifts. Insulin remains safe in compensated cirrhosis with hypoglycemia vigilance, and while SGLT2 inhibitors can increase solute and water excretion and have been shown to raise sodium in SIADH, evidence in cirrhosis is limited; if considered, I need to proceed cautiously and monitor volume status, ketones, and renal function in collaboration with hepatology and endocrinology [^113Mdnha] [^115jUZcd] [^116yw39y].

> I need to set explicit correction limits and monitoring frequency to prevent osmotic demyelination. For this high-risk phenotype, I will aim for a daily rise of 4–6 mEq/L and not exceed 8 mEq/L in any 24-hour period, with serum sodium checks every 6–12 hours during active adjustments and daily when stable, and I must document the timing of any changes in fluids, diuretics, glucose, and solute intake to correlate with sodium shifts. If laboratory imprecision could cause apparent 8 mEq/L changes that actually reflect 10 mEq/L, I should target even a bit below the limit to stay safe [^113tJkYu] [^1164gdyE] [^115yzmgu].

> Hold on, I should have a plan to detect and manage overcorrection early. If sodium is rising too fast due to a sudden water diuresis or reversal of vasopressin effect, I should promptly halt active corrective measures and consider a desmopressin clamp with cautious hypotonic fluids to re-lower into the safe range, especially in cirrhosis where the ODS risk is heightened; I will recheck sodium and urine output frequently during this process. I should also counsel the team that desmopressin itself can provoke hyponatremia in other contexts, highlighting the need for tight monitoring when used therapeutically to control the rate of correction [^111nqQot] [^116VvNY1] [^113UMxRk].

> Advanced therapies should be reserved for specific indications. Hypertonic saline is generally limited to severe or symptomatic hyponatremia or special peri-transplant scenarios, and if used, it should be short-term with strict adherence to correction limits to avoid ODS in cirrhosis, while vaptans can increase sodium but are recommended, if at all, only short term and with great caution in cirrhosis because of risks and the tendency to overcorrect. Albumin can be considered as an adjunct in selected cirrhotic patients with more severe hypervolemic hyponatremia or when large-volume paracentesis or HRS physiology is present, recognizing that our patient's current sodium does not mandate these escalations [^112vKGeP] [^115kY957] [^116SV8Hu] [^112Rw182].

> Let me consider prognosis and why even mild hyponatremia matters in cirrhosis. Sodium below 135 mEq/L correlates with more severe ascites, higher rates of hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome, so I should treat the number with respect even if asymptomatic, while balancing the risk of overcorrection. This also reminds me to reassess broader decompensation markers and to coordinate longitudinal liver care, including transplant evaluation if other criteria are evolving [^117CAZaW].

> Next, I should review key diagnostic labs to solidify the phenotype and guide response expectations. I need a current serum osmolality to confirm hypotonicity, urine osmolality to assess vasopressin activity, and urine sodium to estimate effective arterial volume, bearing in mind diuretic confounding, and I should screen for endocrine mimics if the story deviates from cirrhosis physiology. If urine osmolality is ≤ 100 mOsm/kg, primary polydipsia or low solute intake becomes more likely, but in cirrhosis it is usually higher, indicating impaired free water clearance [^113g8d3Y] [^1121fSgV] [^115Bfw9m] [^111B44kt].

> Putting this together, I should proceed with careful confirmation of true hyponatremia after glucose correction, symptom assessment, modest fluid restriction tailored to cirrhosis practice, medication optimization including diuretic review, prudent diabetes control, explicit correction targets with frequent monitoring, and a clear safety net for overcorrection, while reserving hypertonic saline, albumin, or vaptans for appropriate, more severe scenarios in close specialty coordination. Given the corrected sodium around 134 mEq/L and likely chronicity in cirrhosis, conservative management with vigilant follow-up is appropriate, and I should document the plan and references to align the team around safe, evidence-based care [^113RUmSC] [^1164gdyE].

For a patient with hyponatremia at 133 mmol/L, uncontrolled diabetes (A1c 8%), and NASH cirrhosis, the priority is to **correct for hyperglycemia** [^113Mdnha] and **restrict fluids to 1–1.5 L/day** [^111gVVw6]. This sodium level is mild and often pseudo-hyponatremia from hyperglycemia; after correction, if true hyponatremia persists, manage as hypervolemic hyponatremia with fluid restriction and cautious diuretic use. Avoid **rapid correction** (limit to ≤ 8 mmol/L per 24 h) [^113tJkYu] to prevent osmotic demyelination, and reserve hypertonic saline [^112vKGeP] or vaptans [^116SV8Hu] for severe or symptomatic cases only. Monitor sodium, glucose, and volume status closely, and address underlying liver disease and diabetes control [^117YPJ9F].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical significance

In cirrhosis, hyponatremia is **typically hypervolemic**, driven by splanchnic vasodilation, RAAS/ADH activation, and water retention [^112vKGeP]. Diabetes can cause pseudo-hyponatremia via hyperglycemia-induced water shifts [^113Mdnha]. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [^115XadcF] in cirrhosis, including encephalopathy, ascites, and renal dysfunction [^117CAZaW].

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnostic considerations

- **Corrected sodium calculation**: Correct measured sodium for hyperglycemia [^113Mdnha] to distinguish true from pseudo-hyponatremia.

- **Volume status assessment**: Determine hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic state [^114Mg1Pm] to guide therapy.

- **Laboratory evaluation**: Check serum/urine osmolality [^113g8d3Y], urine sodium [^115Bfw9m], and glucose [^113Mdnha] to clarify etiology.

---

## Management strategies

### General principles

- **Fluid restriction**: First-line for hypervolemic hyponatremia [^111gVVw6]; restrict to 1–1.5 L/day [^114GuP3y].

- **Diuretic management**: Use cautiously; avoid over-diuresis and monitor renal function [^111UMUD2].

- **Sodium correction rate**: Limit to ≤ 8 mmol/L per 24 h [^113tJkYu] to avoid osmotic demyelination.

---

### Specific considerations in cirrhosis

- **Hypertonic saline**: Reserve for severe symptomatic hyponatremia or imminent transplantation [^115kY957]; correct slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L/day) [^112vKGeP].

- **Albumin infusion**: Consider in hypervolemic hyponatremia [^111Sj5ax] to improve effective arterial volume [^112Rw182].

- **Vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans)**: Use cautiously and short-term (≤ 30 days) due to liver toxicity risk [^116SV8Hu].

---

### Specific considerations in diabetes mellitus

In diabetes mellitus, **optimize glycemic control** to reduce hyperglycemia-related pseudo-hyponatremia and osmotic shifts, and **review medications** to avoid thiazide diuretics and sulfonylureas while considering metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, or GLP-1 receptor agonists if liver function allows.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Check serum sodium **every 4–6 hours initially**, then daily once stable [^114mqwBU]. Monitor glucose frequently to prevent rapid osmotic shifts, and assess volume status regularly with daily weights [^117YPJ9F].

---

## Potential complications and risks

Avoid **rapid correction** (> 8 mmol/L/24 h) to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome [^116JUkNn]. Monitor closely for hepatic encephalopathy, as diabetes increases the risk [^114SQ3pV]. Monitor renal function, especially if diuretics are used.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Fluid restriction | 1–1.5 L/day |
| Sodium correction rate | ≤ 8 mmol/L/24 h |

Hyponatremia at 133 mmol/L in a patient with uncontrolled diabetes and NASH cirrhosis is mild and often pseudo-hyponatremia [^113Mdnha]; **prioritize correcting hyperglycemia, fluid restriction [^111gVVw6], and cautious diuretic use**, with close monitoring to prevent complications [^11621z9d].

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

To ensure that entry criteria were met and that the duration of hyponatremia (HN) was evaluable, data from patients who met a prespecified review threshold were subject to review by two members of the study Steering Committee. Discrepancies were resolved by the Steering Committee co-chairmen. Prespecified criteria triggering adjudication are listed in Supplementary Table S4 online. Among those who failed adjudication and were excluded were:

- **Individuals stated to be euvolemic**: Presented with elevated blood urea nitrogen:creatinine ratios and/or low urine [Na+] levels whose HN responded to administration of normal saline (NS) alone, coinciding with a fall in blood urea nitrogen:creatinine ratio.
- **Individuals stated to be euvolemic**: Admission findings included edema or anasarca.
- **Individuals with only a single [Na+] < 130 mEq/L**: Did not receive active treatment for HN.
- **Patients with a qualifying episode of euvolemic or hypervolemic HN**: Also had a separate episode of hypovolemic HN during the same hospitalization that would have interfered with computerized parsing of data.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. Report of the hyponatremia registry [^112F9YvR]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

The rate of Na+ rise with tolvaptan was more rapid than reported in clinical trials, which brought greater efficacy but also greater risk. An increase in Na+ > 12 mEq/l per 24 h or > 18 mEq/l per 48 h predisposes patients to developing osmotic demyelination syndrome, observed more often in patients receiving HS or tolvaptan than in those receiving other treatments.

Pituitary surgery, a situation where SIADH may be transient and resolve suddenly, and the concomitant use of desmopressin for diabetes insipidus appear to pose a particular risk for overly rapid correction when active therapies are used. Although this phenomenon is well described with HS, only one case of osmotic demyelination syndrome has been reported with the use of a vasopressin-receptor antagonist as monotherapy to correct HN. Importantly, no cases of osmotic demyelination syndrome were observed in the 5,028 patients in the HN Registry.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. Report of the hyponatremia registry [^113MJDb8]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Management practices for hyponatremia (HN) are incompletely understood. The HN Registry has recorded diagnostic measures, utilization, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for eu- or hypervolemic HN. To better understand practices, we analyzed data from 3,087 adjudicated adult patients in the registry with serum sodium concentration of 130 mEq/L or less from 225 sites in the United States and European Union.

Common initial monotherapy treatments were fluid restriction (35%), administration of isotonic (15%) or hypertonic saline (2%), and tolvaptan (5%); 17% received no active agent. Median (interquartile range) mEq/L serum sodium increases during the first day were as follows: no treatment, 1.0 (0.0–4.0); fluid restriction, 2.0 (0.0–4.0); isotonic saline, 3.0 (0.0–5.0); hypertonic saline, 5.0 (1.0–9.0); and tolvaptan, 4.0 (2.0–9.0).

Adjusting for initial serum sodium concentration with logistic regression, the relative likelihoods for correction by 5 mEq/L or more (referent, fluid restriction) were 1.60 for hypertonic saline and 2.55 for tolvaptan. At discharge, serum sodium concentration was under 135 mEq/L in 78% of patients and 130 mEq/L or less in 49%. Overly rapid correction occurred in 7.9%. Thus, initial HN treatment often uses maneuvers of limited efficacy. Despite an association with poor outcomes and availability of effective therapy, most patients with HN are discharged from the hospital still hyponatremic. Studies to assess short- and long-term benefits of correction of HN with effective therapies are needed.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^114zYH9K]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH, it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume, both clinically and through laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to alleviate symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of severe or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and the indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear.

Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures such as fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, urea, and demeclocycline, with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline being commonly used. Recently, vasopressin receptor antagonists, known as vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy for SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited, they appear advantageous as they eliminate the need for fluid restriction, allowing hyponatremia to be corrected comfortably and swiftly. Vaptans also offer benefits to physicians and staff due to their efficiency and reliability. However, side effects include thirst, polydipsia, and frequency of urination.

In any therapy of chronic SIADH, it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8–10 mmol/liter, as higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 hours are critical to prevent an overly rapid correction of hyponatremia.

### Hyponatremia in cirrhosis: Results of a patient population survey [^117CAZaW]. Hepatology (2006).

Low serum sodium concentration is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with cirrhosis, but its prevalence and clinical significance are unclear. To evaluate prospectively the prevalence of low serum sodium concentration and the association between serum sodium levels, severity of ascites, and complications of cirrhosis, prospective data were collected on 997 consecutive patients from 28 centers in Europe, North and South America, and Asia for a period of 28 days.

The prevalence of low serum sodium concentration, as defined by a serum sodium concentration ≤ 135 mmol/L, ≤ 130 mmol/L, ≤ 125 mmol/L, and ≤ 120 mmol/L, was 49.4%, 21.6%, 5.7%, and 1.2%, respectively. The prevalence of low serum sodium levels (< 135 mmol/L) was high in both inpatients and outpatients, at 57% and 40%, respectively.

The existence of serum sodium < 135 mmol/L was associated with severe ascites, as indicated by a high prevalence of refractory ascites, large fluid accumulation rate, frequent use of large-volume paracentesis, and impaired renal function compared with normal serum sodium levels. Moreover, low serum sodium levels were also associated with a greater frequency of hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome, but not gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with serum sodium < 130 mmol/L had the greatest frequency of these complications, but the frequency was also increased in patients with mild reductions in serum sodium levels (131–135 mmol/L).

In conclusion, low serum sodium levels in cirrhosis are associated with severe ascites and high complication rates.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^1166gUQF]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

A prospective cohort study from the Netherlands involving nearly 3,000 hospitalized patients with available sodium measurements over a 3-month period found that 30% had a recorded sodium level below 136 mmol/L during their admission. A larger Danish prospective study of more than 250,000 inpatients reported that 15% had serum sodium of less than 135 mmol/L at admission. Larger retrospective database studies from Singapore, the United States, and China support this range, with reported rates of sodium less than 135 mmol/L between 14.5% and 28.2%.

An outlying US study of nearly 200,000 patients reported only 5.5% had hyponatremia; however, this study employed stricter criteria, requiring two sodium concentrations below 135 mmol/L within 24 hours of admission, which would not capture those with transient initial hyponatremia, only a single result, or hyponatremia that developed later during the hospital stay. Rates of profound hyponatremia are lower, with approximately 2% of patients recording sodium concentrations at or below 125 mmol/L.

There are specific patient subgroups with a higher risk of moderate-profound hyponatremia. For example, following pituitary surgery, a meta-analysis showed 5.6% of cases develop symptomatic hyponatremia. Large database studies may fail to account for factors that can influence the accuracy of sodium measurements. Although many studies seek to exclude translocational hyponatremia due to increased serum glucose, causes of pseudohyponatremia such as increased serum lipids or proteins can affect the results.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypernatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with central diabetes insipidus, SE 2018 guidelines recommend correcting serum sodium at a rate of 5 mmol/L in the first hour (or until symptoms improve) and limiting it to 10 mmol/L per 24 hours in symptomatic patients with hypernatremia developed within 48 hours (acute hypernatremia).

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^111VoLwe]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

In five patients (3%), hyponatremia was overcorrected, including three patients in whom plasma sodium rose by 14 ± 1 mmol/L in 24 h and two patients in whom plasma sodium rose 24 ± 6 mmol/L in 48 h. One patient had another cause for the rise in plasma sodium, namely the development of AVP deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) after neurosurgery. Baseline plasma sodium in patients who experienced overcorrection was significantly lower than in those who did not (123 vs. 127 mmol/L, P = .04). The daily oral urea dose in patients who experienced overcorrection was similar to that in those who did not (30 g/day, IQR 30–35 vs. 30 g/day, IQR 21–30, P = .19). In response to overcorrection, oral urea and fluid restriction were discontinued in four and three patients, respectively. Three patients also received plasma sodium relowering therapy (hypotonic fluids n = 3, desmopressin n = 1). No cases of suspected ODS were identified. Regarding tolerability, 20 patients (12%) reported poor palatability, 10 patients (6%) reported gastrointestinal complaints, and 1 patient (1%) reported headache. Side effects led to discontinuation of oral urea in 17 patients (11%). The incidence of side effects was similar between the two oral urea formulations (P = .52).

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^115yzmgu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Analytical limitations of serum sodium measurements must also be considered when setting correction goals and limits. Because of unavoidable imprecision, a laboratory report indicating that the serum sodium has increased by 8 mmol/L might, in reality, reflect an increase of 10 mmol/L. For that reason, when planning therapy, the targeted rate of correction should not be too close to rates that can result in patient harm.

Administration of desmopressin (a synthetic antidiuretic hormone), either after or in anticipation of a water diuresis, has been used to reverse or prevent inadvertent excessive correction of hyponatremia. Both the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and the US/Irish expert panel suggest that relowering of the serum sodium should be considered if correction limits have been exceeded. However, the approach should depend on the relative risks of injury from excessive correction.

- **Risks of excessive correction**: The strongest case for relowering the serum sodium to prevent osmotic demyelination can be made in patients at very high risk of developing the disorder. This includes those with a sodium level of ≤ 105 mmol/L or patients with heavy alcohol use, severe hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease. It would be reasonable to relower the serum sodium in such patients if it has increased by > 8 mmol/L in < 24 hours.

Patients who have rapidly become hyponatremic due to self-induced water intoxication related to psychosis or endurance exercise often develop a spontaneous water diuresis that rapidly brings the serum sodium back to normal, as their risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome is lower.

Regarding the medical management of hyponatremia, particularly for severely symptomatic patients, the 2023 AAFP guidelines recommend considering either bolus or continuous infusions of 3% hypertonic saline for patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq/L and moderate or severe symptoms. It is important to recognize that bolus infusion can improve sodium concentration more quickly, thereby reducing the risk of overcorrection.

In specific circumstances related to hyponatremia in patients with liver disease, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend limiting the use of hypertonic saline to cases with life-threatening complications. Hypertonic saline should be considered for patients with severe hyponatremia who are expected to undergo liver transplantation within a few days. It is crucial to correct the serum sodium concentration slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L per day), once symptoms have attenuated, to prevent irreversible neurological sequelae such as osmotic demyelination.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^1162Mnj7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

What was known: In patients with chronic hyponatremia, plasma sodium should be gradually corrected to prevent osmotic demyelination. Recent observational studies have reported positive experiences with oral urea for the treatment of hyponatremia, but factors associated with the correction rate are unknown.

This study adds: Older age, lower baseline plasma sodium, and a higher cumulative urea dose increase the correction rate of hyponatremia during treatment with oral urea. Combining oral urea with fluid restriction may further increase the correction rate of hyponatremia.

Potential impact: In patients with hyponatremia who are older or have a low initial plasma sodium, oral urea may need to be given for a shorter duration without fluid restriction. Our study also adds to the growing body of evidence that oral urea generally is a safe and effective treatment for hyponatremia.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^112NjGpe]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

In addition to the identification of factors associated with hyponatremia correction, this study also gives a useful impression of how oral urea is currently positioned in the treatment of hyponatremia.

The majority of patients first received fluid restriction, indicating that oral urea is typically started as second-line treatment, which is in line with the guidelines. When oral urea was started, it was usually combined with fluid restriction, and this combination led to a greater rise in plasma sodium during the first two days of treatment. Fluid restriction was likely not identified in the main analysis because it was frequently liberalized during treatment. Garrahy and colleagues also showed that the effect of fluid restriction plateaus following a couple of days. For clinical practice, it would be relevant to know whether oral urea should always be combined with fluid restriction or whether it can also be given as first-line treatment without fluid restriction.

A previous retrospective study analyzed the effects of oral urea as first-line treatment without fluid restriction in cancer patients with SIAD-induced hyponatremia. The correction rate in this previous study was, in fact, higher (5 mmol/L in 24 hours), which may be attributable to the lower baseline plasma sodium (123 mmol/L) or low solute intake in patients with cancer. In another recent study, oral urea was also given without fluid restriction and produced a more modest rise in plasma sodium (2 mmol/L in 7 days). However, this study was performed in an ambulatory setting in which transient causes for AVP re

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^115XadcF]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

A consistent association between hyponatremia and increased mortality is observed. Whether this is because multimorbid patients with serious underlying conditions are prone to develop hyponatremia, or whether hyponatremia itself is an independent risk factor, is not entirely clear and needs to be clarified in properly designed intervention studies.

A 2013 meta-analysis identified 81 studies comparing death rates in patients with or without hyponatremia, including a total of more than 850,000 patients (nearly 148,000 with hyponatremia). Hyponatremia was significantly associated with an increased risk of overall mortality (relative risk [RR] 2.60; 95% CI, 2.31–2.93; P < 0.0001), and this was maintained after adjustment for age, sex, and diabetes mellitus. The association was relatively consistent when analyzed by individual underlying condition (heart failure, cirrhosis, pulmonary infection, myocardial infarction). There was an inverse relationship between serum sodium concentration and mortality — indicating higher risk with lower sodium concentrations. The mean difference in serum sodium between individuals who died compared to survivors was 4.8 mmol/L (pNa 130.1 vs 134.9 mmol/L), so even hyponatremia in the mild range was associated with risk. A causal relationship was not able to be established, by the nature of this analysis. The consistency associated irrespective of the underlying condition suggests that the underlying mechanism, if hyponatremia is indeed causal, is not disease-specific.

A follow-up meta-analysis by the same group in 2015 sought to clarify this relationship.

### Diabetes as a risk factor for hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis patients [^114SQ3pV]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Aims: It remains unclear whether diabetes increases the risk for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in cirrhotic patients. We examined this question using data from three randomized trials of satavaptan, a vasopressin receptor antagonist that does not affect HE risk, in cirrhotic patients with ascites.

Methods: The trials included 1,198 patients. We excluded those with HE before or at randomization and followed the remaining patients for the one-year duration of the trials. They were examined for HE regularly, and we compared rates of first-time overt HE between diabetic and non-diabetic patients using Cox regression.

The analysis adjusted for the following factors:

- **Demographic factors**: gender, age
- **Disease-related factors**: ascites severity, cirrhosis etiology, Child-Pugh class
- **Biochemical markers**: creatinine, bilirubin, INR, sodium, potassium, albumin, platelets
- **Medication use**: lactulose use, benzodiazepine/barbiturate use
- **Diuretic doses**: spironolactone dose, furosemide dose, potassium-sparing diuretic dose
- **Comorbidity score**: CirCom comorbidity score

Results: We included 862 patients, of whom 193 (22%) had diabetes. In total, they experienced 115 first-time episodes of overt HE during the follow-up. Fewer diabetics than non-diabetic patients were in Child-Pugh class C at baseline (13% vs. 23%); yet they had a higher cumulative risk of first-time overt HE (26.0% vs. 15.8% after 1 year). The episodes of first-time overt HE in diabetics were more likely to progress beyond grade 2 (64% vs. 42% of episodes progressed to grade 3 or 4, p = 0.01 for independence between diabetes and highest HE grade). After confounder adjustment, the hazard ratio of first-time overt HE for diabetics vs. non-diabetic patients was 1.86.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^112sQu88]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Oral urea is being used more commonly to treat hyponatremia, but factors contributing to the correction rate are unknown. We hypothesized that clinically relevant factors can be identified to help guide hyponatremia correction with oral urea.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective study in two university hospitals including hospitalized patients with hyponatremia (plasma sodium < 135 mmol/L) treated with oral urea. Linear mixed-effects models were used to identify factors associated with hyponatremia correction. Rates of overcorrection, osmotic demyelination, and treatment discontinuation were also assessed.

- **Results**: We included 161 urea treatment episodes in 140 patients (median age 69 years, 46% females, 93% syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis). Oral urea succeeded fluid restriction in 117 treatment episodes (73%), was combined with fluid restriction in 104 treatment episodes (65%), and was given as the only treatment in 27 treatment episodes (17%). A median dose of 30 g/day of urea for 4 days (interquartile range 2–7 days) increased plasma sodium from 127 to 134 mmol/L and normalized hyponatremia in 47% of treatment episodes. Older age (β 0.09, 95% CI 0.02–0.16), lower baseline plasma sodium (β -0.65, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.62), and higher cumulative urea dose (β 0.03, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.03) were independently associated with a greater rise in plasma sodium. Fluid restriction was associated with a greater rise in plasma sodium only during the first 48 h of treatment (β 1.81, 95% CI 0.40–3.08). Overcorrection occurred in 5 cases (3%), with no cases of osmotic demyelination.

### Oral tolvaptan is safe and effective in chronic hyponatremia [^114dznuh]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Vasopressin antagonists increase serum sodium concentration in patients with euvolemia and hypervolemia with hyponatremia in the short term, which led to discontinuation in one patient at 145 mmol/L. Mean serum sodium increased from 130.8 mmol/L at baseline to above 135 mmol/L throughout the observation period (P < 0.001 versus baseline at most points). Responses were comparable between patients with euvolemia and those with heart failure but were more modest in patients with cirrhosis. In conclusion, prolonged administration of tolvaptan maintains an increased serum sodium with an acceptable margin of safety.

### Prognosis of patients with severe hyponatraemia is related not only to hyponatraemia but also to comorbidities and to medical management: Results of an observational retrospective study [^111LyDnV]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Our study has certain limitations. First, the retrospective nature, which involved the study of handwritten medical records, certainly limited access to certain valuable information, including the final diagnosis. Secondly, plasma sodium was not corrected by plasma glucose as recommended, as it was difficult to retrospectively obtain blood glucose for each value of plasma sodium. Nevertheless, the low threshold value chosen to characterize severe hyponatraemia makes it unlikely that hyperglycemia could have completely distorted the relationship between plasma sodium and osmolality. In addition, two studies found identical mortality rates with and without using correction of osmolality by glucose.

On the other hand, in the present series, the relatively limited number of patients from one single center allowed access to the entire medical records and correlated the prognosis with a wide variety of parameters. Thus, this is, to our knowledge, the first study demonstrating that prognosis is influenced independently by hyponatraemia itself, by comorbidity, and by medical management.

After the 15-day period, continuation of empagliflozin was based on the attending physician's judgment. Patients who continued treatment with 10 mg empagliflozin for 6 months were contacted by telephone and returned to the study center for additional assessments.

Fasting glucose, serum, and urine creatinine were measured on an automatic analyzer (Olympus AU560, Hamburg, Germany). Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured using a latex-immunoagglutination-inhibition method (Bayer HealthCare LLC, Elkhart, IN, USA) with a non-diabetic range of 4.0–6.0% (20–42 mmol/mol). eGFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI Creatinine 2021 equation. The fractional excretion of sodium (FE Na) was calculated according to the standard formula: FE Na = 100x(U Na ×P Cre)/(P Na ×U Cre), where U Na and U Cre, P Na and P Cre, are the urinary and plasma concentrations of sodium and creatinine, respectively.

In patients receiving diuretic treatment, the medication remained stable during the study period. Similarly, the degree of chronic kidney disease, as assessed by eGFR category, remained stable throughout the study period. All patients had a capillary blood ketone test with a stick before drug initiation and at the end of 15 days.

### Hyponatremia in the context of liver disease [^117HWaGN]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common in patients with liver disease and is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and a reduced quality of life. In liver transplantation, the inclusion of hyponatremia in organ allocation scores has reduced waitlist mortality. Portal hypertension and the resulting lowering of the effective arterial blood volume are important pathogenetic factors; however, in most patients with liver disease, hyponatremia is multifactorial.

Treatment requires a multifaceted approach that aims to reduce electrolyte-free water intake, restore urinary dilution, and increase nonelectrolyte solute excretion. Albumin therapy for hyponatremia is a peculiarity of advanced liver disease. Its use appears to be increasing, while vaptans are currently only administered in selected cases. Osmotic demyelination is a particular concern in patients with liver disease. Serial checks of serum sodium concentrations and urine volume monitoring are mandatory.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis: Short of evidence, plenty of potential [^115jUZcd]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Low credibility.

Treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in patients with compensated cirrhosis is challenging due to hypoglycemic risk, altered pharmacokinetics, and the lack of robust evidence on the risk/benefit ratio of various drugs. Suboptimal glycemic control accelerates the progression of cirrhosis, while the frequent coexistence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with T2D highlights the need for a multifactorial therapeutic approach.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed in Medline, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases until July 2023, using relevant keywords to extract studies regarding the management of T2D in patients with compensated cirrhosis.

- **Results**: Metformin, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are promising treatment options for patients with T2D and compensated liver cirrhosis. These drugs offer good glycemic control with minimal risk of hypoglycemia. Their pleiotropic actions confer benefits on NAFLD, body weight, and decrease cardiorenal risk. Sulfonylureas cause hypoglycemia and should be avoided. In specific studies, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors have been correlated with increased risk of decompensation and variceal bleeding. Despite the benefits of thiazolidinediones in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, concerns about edema and weight gain limit their use in compensated cirrhosis. Insulin does not exert hepatotoxic effects and can be administered safely in combination with other drugs; however, the risk of hypoglycemia should be considered.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^115pq4RC]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Several studies confirmed that osmotic demyelination is associated with more rapid rates of correction of chronic hyponatremia. Excluding case series based on patient referrals, studies of patients with a sodium level ≤ 120 mmol/L that include data on correction rates and outcomes are presented in Table 1. The frequency of osmotic demyelination varies widely among studies, depending on pretreatment serum sodium levels, correction rates, and methods for identifying post-therapeutic neurologic sequelae. However, it is evident that in patients with chronic hyponatremia, the lower the serum sodium and the larger the increase in sodium levels, the more likely it is that osmotic demyelination will be identified.

- **Table 1: Post-treatment neurologic sequelae in studies of patients with serum sodium concentrations ≤ 120 mmol/L**

When osmotic demyelination syndrome was first described, it was widely believed that to avoid potentially fatal neurologic complications of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, it was important to rapidly raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level above 120 mmol/L and, according to some experts, to as high as 130 mmol/L. At a sodium level ≤ 105 mmol/L, it becomes impossible to both raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level and avoid correction by > 12 mmol/L per day; a choice must be made between the risks of persistent, severe hyponatremia and the risks of osmotic demyelination. Because a sodium level ≤ 105 mmol/L is uncommon, a letter was sent to all members of the American Society of Nephrology seeking data on patients with a sodium level ≤ 105 mmol/L who had been recently treated.

### Diagnosing and treating the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^114oZizi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is the most common cause of hyponatremia in clinical practice, but the management of hyponatremia and outcomes in patients with this syndrome are not well understood. The objective of the Hyponatremia Registry was to assess the state of management of hyponatremia due to the syndrome in diverse hospital settings. The registry specifically focused on which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently used and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)]). A secondary objective was to determine whether treatment choices and outcomes differ across the United States and the European Union.

- **Methods**: The Hyponatremia Registry recorded selected diagnostic measures and use, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia diagnosed clinically as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in 1,524 adult patients with [Na(+)] ≤ 130 mEq/L (1,034 from 146 US sites and 490 from 79 EU sites). A subgroup of patients with more rigorously defined syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion via measurement of relevant laboratory parameters was also analyzed.

- **Results**: The most common monotherapy treatments for hyponatremia in the syndrome were fluid restriction (48%), isotonic (27%) or hypertonic (6%) saline, and tolvaptan (13%); 11% received no active agent. The mean rate of [Na(+)] change (mEq/L/d) was greater for a

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^116JUkNn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

After weighing the evidence, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended that correction of hyponatremia be limited to 10 mmol/L in the first day of treatment and 8 mmol/L for every subsequent day thereafter. An expert panel that included six physicians from the United States and one from Ireland (referred to as the "US/Irish expert panel") came to similar conclusions, but with some added nuance.

For chronically hyponatremic patients with a sodium level ≤ 120 mmol/L (for example, outpatients drinking conventional volumes of water or those treated with thiazides, as well as hospital-acquired hyponatremia with a known duration > 48 hours) who were at normal risk of developing osmotic demyelination, the panel recommended a correction limit of 10–12 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and 18 mmol/L in any 48-hour period, with a minimum correction of 4–8 mmol/L.

- **Increased vigilance**: The panel recommended increased vigilance for patients with a sodium level ≤ 120 mmol/L who are at heightened risk of osmotic demyelination. Factors associated with a higher risk of osmotic demyelination include sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease. In these high-risk patients, the US/Irish expert panel recommended that correction should not exceed 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period, with a minimum daily correction goal of 4–6 mmol/L.

In patients without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, the panel noted that correction by 8–12 mmol/L in the first day of therapy was greater than necessary but unlikely to cause harm.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: Expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination.

The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations, which defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the six years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients.

Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary, and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent evidence.

### A randomized trial of empagliflozin to increase plasma sodium levels in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^116yw39y]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Treatment options to address the hyponatremia induced by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) are inadequate. The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin promotes osmotic diuresis via urinary glucose excretion, and therefore, might offer a novel treatment option for SIAD.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind, randomized trial, we recruited 88 hospitalized patients with SIAD-induced hyponatremia < 130 mmol/L at the University Hospital Basel from September 2016 until January 2019 and assigned patients to receive, in addition to standard fluid restriction of < 1000 ml/24 h, a once-daily dose of oral empagliflozin or placebo for 4 days. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in plasma sodium concentration after 4 days of treatment. Secondary endpoints included predisposing factors for treatment response and safety of the intervention.

- **Results**: Of the 87 patients who completed the trial, 43 (49%) received treatment with empagliflozin, and 44 (51%) received placebo. Baseline plasma sodium concentrations were similar for the two groups (median 125.5 mmol/L for the empagliflozin group and median 126 mmol/L for the placebo group). Patients treated with empagliflozin had a significantly higher increase in median plasma sodium concentration compared with those receiving placebo (10 versus 7 mmol/L, respectively; P = 0.04). Profound hyponatremia (< 125 mmol/L) and lower baseline osmolality levels increased the likelihood of response to treatment with empagliflozin. Treatment was well tolerated, and no events of hypoglycemia or hypotension occurred.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: Hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114mqwBU]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hyponatremia, especially in the context of severely symptomatic patients, initial management following the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommends limiting sodium correction to 8 mEq/L over 24 hours for patients with chronic hyponatremia who are at increased risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Sodium correction should be limited to 12 mEq/L over 24 hours and 18 mEq/L over 48 hours in patients without risk factors to minimize the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Hypertonic saline and desmopressin: A simple strategy for safe correction of severe hyponatremia [^111nqQot]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Prompt correction of severe hyponatremia is important, but correction must also be limited to avoid iatrogenic osmotic demyelination. Expert opinion recommends that the serum sodium level not be increased by more than 10–12 mEq/L in any 24-hour period or 18 mEq/L in any 48-hour period. However, inadvertent overcorrection is common, usually caused by the unexpected emergence of water diuresis.

- **Study design**: Quality improvement report.

- **Setting & participants**: All 25 patients admitted to a community teaching hospital between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2011, who were treated for serum sodium level increase of 12 mEq/L in 24 hours or > 18 mEq/L in 48 hours and without a decrease during therapy. There was no significant difference between…

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^111aNsKQ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

We included 140 hospitalized patients who received oral urea for hyponatremia. Median baseline plasma sodium was 127 mmol/L (IQR 123–130) and ranged between 108 and 134 mmol/L. The baseline urine osmolality and urine sodium concentration were 525 mOsm/kg (IQR 392–635) and 77 mmol/L (IQR 49–124), respectively. In 55 patients with available urine sodium and potassium, the (urine sodium + potassium)/plasma sodium ratio was > 1 in 30 (55%), indicating that they are unlikely to respond to fluid restriction alone.

The most common cause of hyponatremia was SIAD, which was most frequently associated with cancer (35%). Other causes of hyponatremia included heart failure, thiazide diuretics, primary polydipsia, and low solute intake. Among the 140 included patients, oral urea was used on 161 separate occasions. Oral urea was prescribed at a start dose of 30 g/day (IQR 22–30) for a median duration of 4 days (IQR 2–7), reaching a cumulative dose of 120 g (IQR 60–210). In 58 (36%) of the treatment episodes, the oral urea dose was modified 116 times (53% increased, 47% decreased).

Fluid restriction was started prior to oral urea in 117 treatment episodes (73%) and continued with oral urea in 104 treatment episodes (65%). Fluid restriction was modified 88 times during 58 treatment episodes (36%), and it was usually loosened or discontinued (in 61% and 18% of treatment episodes, respectively). Other less common treatments included isotonic fluid administration.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: Hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114Mg1Pm]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hyponatremia, particularly for severely symptomatic patients, adequate response to initial treatment is crucial. The AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend determining the next steps for managing hypotonic hyponatremia (true hyponatremia) when severe symptoms are absent. This management should be based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic.
