## Question

A patient came in with a fever and a bite mark on the arm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing a patient who presents with fever and a bite mark on the arm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and red flags. Then, I should verify the key elements of history that narrow the differential. Next, I will examine the wound and perform a focused exam to look for systemic clues. After that, I need to build a prioritized differential diagnosis and decide on empiric testing. Finally, I will outline empiric management, wound care, and follow-up, while continuously checking assumptions against guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and mental status come first, and I should not delay antibiotics if there are signs of sepsis, rapidly progressive cellulitis, or concern for life-threatening infections like RMSF or Capnocytophaga in the right host, because delays worsen outcomes [^d9650f76] [^c7ea2157].

> Wait, let me verify the history elements that most efficiently narrow the differential: timing of the bite relative to fever onset, animal or human source, geographic and travel context, immunocompromise or asplenia, and vaccination status, especially tetanus, are critical, and I should explicitly ask about rodents, dogs, cats, ticks, and any recent travel to sub-Saharan Africa or the Mediterranean because these steer me toward rat-bite fever, Capnocytophaga, Pasteurella, tick-borne rickettsioses, and African or Mediterranean spotted fevers, respectively [^d9650f76] [^2c3a9539] [^3d3d7bd9] [^4a41940f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the bite source; I need to check the wound carefully for puncture marks, erythema, swelling, purulence, necrosis, and especially an eschar, because a necrotic eschar with a red rim suggests spotted fever group rickettsioses such as R. parkeri, R. africae, or R. conorii, whereas a deep puncture with minimal external trauma is classic for cat bites and raises concern for Pasteurella and anaerobes [^992d4045] [^9cf69db4] [^9a2b97e3].

> I will now examine for systemic clues that refine the pretest probabilities: fever with headache and myalgia supports rickettsioses; migratory arthralgias and a rash with rodent exposure point to rat-bite fever; thrombocytopenia and leukopenia favor ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis; and hypotension or DIC in an asplenic patient after a dog bite should trigger concern for Capnocytophaga, which can be fulminant and requires early, appropriate antibiotics and supportive care [^f44d06dc] [^a4d87659] [^9784e5f2] [^7578f287] [^c7ea2157].

> Let me think about the differential diagnosis and how to prioritize it: in the United States, RMSF and other spotted fever rickettsioses, Pasteurella from cats, Capnocytophaga from dogs, rat-bite fever with rodent exposure, and tick-borne ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis are high-yield considerations; less common but important entities include tularemia, Lyme disease, and human bite infections, and I should keep in mind that many patients do not recall a tick bite, so absence of a remembered bite does not exclude tick-borne disease [^f44d06dc] [^cb4b6669] [^4a41940f] [^66de0a7b].

> I should double-check the timing patterns because they guide urgency: RMSF typically presents 3–12 days after a bite, with rash appearing 2–4 days after fever; African tick-bite fever and Mediterranean spotted fever often show an eschar and rash around day 5–7; Capnocytophaga can present within 1–14 days after a dog bite; rat-bite fever usually manifests 3–10 days after exposure; and ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis commonly appear about 5–14 days after a tick bite, so aligning the chronology strengthens or weakens each hypothesis [^f44d06dc] [^d2b38868] [^9a2b97e3] [^def42c21] [^a4d87659] [^9784e5f2] [^7578f287].

> Next, I should review what labs to order and why: in any febrile patient with a bite and systemic features, I need CBC with differential, platelets, CMP including liver enzymes, and blood cultures if there are systemic signs or concern for bacteremia; if tick-borne rickettsial disease is suspected, I should not wait for confirmatory serology because treatment must be immediate; if there is an eschar, I should consider swab or biopsy for PCR where available; and if there is lymphadenopathy with cat exposure, I should consider Bartonella serology, recognizing cross-reactivity and the need to interpret results in clinical context [^9372a5f1] [^8f16a196] [^9eb9c652].

> Hold on, I should verify empiric antibiotic choices and their rationale: for suspected RMSF or other rickettsioses, doxycycline is first-line for all ages, including children under 8, and delays increase mortality; for dog bites with systemic features or asplenia, I should cover Capnocytophaga with a beta-lactam such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or ampicillin-sulbactam, adding doxycycline if RMSF is in the differential; for cat bites, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate to cover Pasteurella and anaerobes; for rat-bite fever, penicillin G is traditional, but doxycycline is also effective and reasonable if the diagnosis is uncertain and RMSF must be covered; and for human bites, amoxicillin-clavulanate is recommended to cover oral flora [^8f16a196] [^739f6405] [^901ff5f7] [^a4d87659] [^5c8e0e19].

> I need to ensure I address wound care and tetanus properly: copious irrigation with saline or clean water is essential; leave puncture wounds open when feasible, especially cat bites and hand injuries; obtain cultures if there is purulence or systemic illness; and update tetanus immunization according to wound cleanliness and time since last dose, with Tdap preferred if not previously given, because tetanus is preventable and bites are often contaminated [^e51ee58d] [^50701446] [^d187da0b] [^586e2312].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or has a severe doxycycline allergy; I should confirm contingencies: for RMSF in pregnancy, the benefits of doxycycline outweigh theoretical risks and it remains first-line; for severe doxycycline allergy, chloramphenicol is an alternative for RMSF, though it carries higher risk and should be used with caution; for anaplasmosis in pregnancy or severe tetracycline allergy, rifampin may be considered, acknowledging weaker evidence [^8f16a196].

> Next, I should review follow-up and safety netting: reassess within 24–48 hours for clinical response, and if fever persists beyond 48 hours after starting appropriate therapy for rickettsial disease, I should reconsider the diagnosis or look for coinfection; counsel on wound care and red flags such as spreading erythema, increasing pain, purulent drainage, or new systemic symptoms; and coordinate rabies postexposure prophylaxis when indicated after animal bites per local public health guidance [^8f16a196] [^50701446].

> In summary, I should confirm stability first, then use history and exam to distinguish among high-stakes infections like RMSF, Capnocytophaga, rat-bite fever, and Pasteurella, start empiric therapy without delay when indicated, tailor antibiotics to the most likely pathogens, and provide meticulous wound care and tetanus prophylaxis, because early recognition and treatment prevent morbidity and mortality in this setting [^d9650f76] [^739f6405] [^8f16a196].

A patient with fever and a bite mark on the arm has a **high risk of infection** and needs prompt evaluation. The most likely causes are **cellulitis from Pasteurella multocida** (cat bites), **Capnocytophaga canimorsus** (dog bites, especially in asplenic or immunocompromised patients), or **rat-bite fever** (Streptobacillus moniliformis) with rodent exposure. Other considerations include RMSF, tularemia, and MRSA. Obtain wound cultures and blood cultures if systemic signs are present, and start empiric **amoxicillin-clavulanate** for cat bites and **doxycycline** if RMSF or tularemia is suspected. Update tetanus and assess for rabies risk; monitor closely for sepsis or necrotizing infection, and escalate care if the patient deteriorates [^739f6405] [^9372a5f1] [^d187da0b].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for a patient presenting with fever and a bite mark on the arm includes:

| **Category** | **Pathogen/condition** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Bacterial infections | - Pasteurella multocida (cat bites) <br/> - Capnocytophaga canimorsus (dog bites, asplenia) <br/> - Streptobacillus moniliformis (rat bites) <br/> - Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) <br/> - Streptococcus species <br/> - Bartonella henselae (cat-scratch disease) | - Cellulitis <br/> - Abscess <br/> - Lymphangitis <br/> - Sepsis <br/> - Endocarditis <br/> - Meningitis |
| Tick-borne infections | - Rickettsia rickettsii (Rocky Mountain spotted fever) <br/> - Rickettsia africae (African tick bite fever) <br/> - Francisella tularensis (tularemia) | - Fever <br/> - Rash <br/> - Eschar <br/> - Regional lymphadenopathy <br/> - Systemic symptoms |
| Viral infections | - Rabies <br/> - Herpes B virus (macaque bites) | - Neurological symptoms <br/> - Encephalitis <br/> - Fatal if untreated |
| Other considerations | - Necrotizing fasciitis <br/> - Tetanus <br/> - Allergic reactions | - Rapid progression <br/> - Severe pain <br/> - Crepitus <br/> - Systemic toxicity |

---

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough **clinical evaluation** should include:

- **History**: Animal type, timing of bite, patient comorbidities (asplenia, immunocompromise), travel history, tetanus status, and rabies risk.
- **Physical examination**: Assess for cellulitis, abscess, lymphangitis, necrosis, and systemic signs (fever, tachycardia, hypotension).
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, blood cultures, wound cultures, and serology for specific pathogens (e.g. RMSF, tularemia) as indicated [^9372a5f1].
- **Imaging**: Consider ultrasound or MRI if deep infection or abscess is suspected.

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be guided by the **likely pathogens** and patient risk factors:

- **Cat bites**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate (covers Pasteurella, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and anaerobes) [^739f6405].
- **Dog bites**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate; add doxycycline if RMSF or tularemia is suspected [^739f6405].
- **Rat bites**: Penicillin G or doxycycline (covers Streptobacillus moniliformis) [^a4d87659].
- **MRSA risk**: Add vancomycin or linezolid if MRSA is suspected.
- **Severe allergy**: Use doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone (e.g. moxifloxacin) as alternatives [^901ff5f7].

---

## Wound management

Wound management is critical to prevent complications. Perform **copious irrigation** with saline or dilute antiseptic, and debride devitalized tissue. Avoid primary closure for puncture wounds or bites to the hand; consider delayed primary closure after 48–72 hours if no infection is present. Immobilize and elevate the affected limb to reduce swelling and promote healing [^e51ee58d].

---

## Tetanus prophylaxis and rabies post-exposure prophylaxis

Tetanus prophylaxis should be administered according to the patient's **vaccination status** and wound characteristics [^d187da0b]. Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered for bites from animals with unknown or positive rabies status, following local public health guidelines [^50701446].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Patients should be monitored closely for signs of **clinical deterioration**, including progression of cellulitis, abscess formation, necrotizing infection, or sepsis. Arrange follow-up within 24–48 hours to reassess wound healing and response to therapy.

---

## Potential complications

Untreated or inadequately managed bite infections can lead to **severe complications**, including:

- **Necrotizing fasciitis**: Rapidly progressive soft tissue infection requiring surgical intervention.
- **Sepsis**: Systemic infection with multi-organ involvement.
- **Endocarditis**: Particularly associated with Capnocytophaga canimorsus.
- **Meningitis**: Rare but serious complication.
- **Rabies**: Fatal if untreated.

---

A patient with fever and a bite mark on the arm requires **prompt evaluation and empiric antibiotic therapy** based on the likely pathogen and patient risk factors. Close monitoring, appropriate wound management, and consideration of tetanus and rabies prophylaxis are essential to prevent serious complications.

Background

African tick-bite fever is an increasingly common cause for fever in the returning traveller. It needs to be considered in the febrile returning traveller with a characteristic rash: a black eschar.

Case Report

We describe a 51-year-old man returning from South Africa who presented to our emergency department with fever, headache, myalgia, and chills. On careful history and skin examination, a black eschar was found on the patient's left lateral shoulder, pointing toward a diagnosis of African tick-bite fever. The patient was treated with doxycycline and rapidly improved. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? In the emergency department, the diagnosis of African tick-bite fever is often overlooked in the pursuit of ruling out other travel-related illnesses, such as malaria. A thorough history, a complete physical examination, and a high level of suspicion are essential to the timely diagnosis and treatment of African tick-bite fever in the returning traveller.

Rat bite fever is a rare but potentially fatal Gram-negative infection that predominantly affects populations with exposure to rats, notably children. The clinical presentation is nonspecific and requires a high threshold of suspicion to elicit a history of rat exposure. We report here a case of a child whose diagnosis was made retrospectively but with good outcome.

### Overwhelming Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection in a patient with asplenia [^d3d56b8c]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Patients with asplenia are prone to overwhelming infections due to encapsulated organisms. We report a 62-year-old man presenting with fever and weakness. His medical history was significant for splenectomy and owning a dog as pet. The patient on examination had evidence of animal bite and scratch marks on his lower extremity and developed dry gangrene of multiple digits of his upper extremity soon after admission. The patient's initial blood cultures were positive for Gram-negative rods, but no organism was identified. Capnocytophaga canimorsus was the suspected organism and the patient's antibiotics were tailored accordingly, with good clinical recovery. The patient' blood cultures finally grew C canimorsus on day 20 for which the patient had already been treated with prior clinical judgement. Physicians should be aware of this organism in the setting of sepsis in patients with asplenia and use appropriate antibiotics until further results are obtained.

### Arthropod bites and stings [^5e657dd8]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on spider envenomation:

- **Definition**: Spider bites in the US are primarily caused by widow spider (Latrodectus) and brown recluse spider (Loxosceles). Less common spiders include Australian funnel web spiders (Atrax and Hadronyche species) found in eastern Australia, armed or wandering spiders (Phoneutria species) found in South America, hobo spiders (Tegenaria agrestis) found in Europe and in the Pacific Northwest of the US, and the noble false widow (Steatoda nobilis) found in England and Ireland.
- **Pathophysiology**: The venom of the widow spide contains α-latrotoxin, which affects the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle cramping and hypertension. The venom of the brown recluse spider contains multiple active components, including sphingomyelinase D hyaluronidase, and other enzymes, resulting in local tissue necrosis and, rarely, systemic effects.
- **Epidemiology**: There were 142,886 spider bites treated in emergency departments in the US from 2001 to 2010.
- **Disease course**: Most spider bites cause only localized skin injury, such as burning pain, swelling, erythema, and bleeding, typically on the upper oextremities. Fang marks and a hemorrhagic vesicle may also be observed. Skin necrosis may develop by 72 hours. Systemic symptoms include fever, chills, headache, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, pruritus, malaise, and musculoskeletal pain. Systemic toxicity leading to intravascular hemolytic anemia, coagulopathy, and acute renal failure is rare.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most spider bites are mild and resolve with supportive care. Systemic toxicity and mortality are rare.

### Rat-bite fever: an uncommon cause of fever and rash in a 9-year-old patient [^6970049f]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of fever, acral papulopustular rash, and arthralgias in an immunocompetent child include both systemic infections and inflammatory conditions. Lesions of chronic meningococcemia may be pustular and purpuric and are accompanied by fever and arthralgias. If there is concern for sexual abuse, disseminated gonorrhea and secondary syphilis should also be considered. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is characterized by fever, headache, and malaise followed by erythematous macules on the hands and feet, which may become purpuric or pustular.

Coxsackievirus infection may also present with fever, oral erosions, widespread edematous papules, and vesicopustules involving the hands, feet, perioral skin, and buttocks. Persistence of rash after 10 days argues against coxsackievirus in this case, as does the pustular (rather than vesicular) quality and location of the lesions. Varicella zoster virus lesions are vesicular rather than pustular and heal within 1 to 2 days with scarring. Noninfectious inflammatory conditions that should be considered include acute generalized pustular psoriasis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and bowel-associated dermatosis/arthritis syndrome.

Discussion

RBF was first reported in the United States in 1839. In 1914, the bacterial pathogen was identified as S moniliformis, a filamentous, gram-negative, nonmotile and non–acid-fast rod. In the early 1990s, 2 outbreaks of RBF occurred and more than 200 cases have now been documented in the country. Approximately 50% to 100% of wild rats harbor S moniliformis in their respiratory tract. About 1 in 10 rat bites may cause infection, and approximately 13% of untreated RBF illnesses are fatal. Because of its low incidence and high mortality, little information exists regarding its pathogenesis.

As the name suggests, this condition may be transmitted by a rat bite, but illness may also be transmitted via close contact with rat urine and feces. Fever, malaise, headache, vomiting, and diarrhea are followed by an eruption of macules, papules, and purpuric vesicles or pustules, with acral accentuation. Migratory arthritis or arthralgias are classical symptoms of RBF, which can be attributed to an asymmetrical pyogenic infection of multiple joints causing streptobacillary septic arthritis. Oral ulcerations have not been reported in association with RBF in the literature. Delayed diagnosis of RBF may be responsible for severe complications such as endocarditis, myocarditis, encephalitis, and visceral abscesses.

Case Histories

Patient 1

Patient 1 was a 49-year-old male resident of Arizona. In July 2014, he was hiking in the Pajarito Mountains of Santa Cruz County, Arizona. This remote and semi-arid region receives a mean annual precipitation of 430 mm and is situated at ≈1,200 m above sea level (Figure 1, panel A). During the hike, the man removed and discarded an adult tick he found attached to his right arm. The tick had been attached for < 3 hours. A similar tick found crawling on the patient was photographed on the same day (Figure 1, panel B). An ulcerated lesion appeared at the site of the tick bite ≈5 days later. Ten days after the tick bite, the man had onset of fever with a temperature reaching 38.7°C, which was accompanied by headache, myalgia, and scalp tenderness. On day 11, his physician noted a 1-cm eschar, surrounded by a ring of erythema, lateral to the antecubital fossa of his right arm (Figure 2, panel A). No rash or lymphadenopathy was noted. The patient was prescribed doxycycline (100 mg 2×/d for 10 days), and his temperature returned to normal within 24 hours. However, a sparse maculopapular rash subsequently developed on his back, flank, abdomen, and feet; this rash improved within 4 days. The patient reported no recent out-of-state travel or other tick exposures during the several weeks preceding his illness. A medical entomologist (J.W.M.), expert in Amblyomma tick identification and familiar with previous specimens in this genus collected from southern Arizona, reviewed the tick photograph associated with the case and, on the basis of the distinctive dorsal ornamentation of the tick and its geographic origin, presumptively determined the specimen to be an adult male tick of the A. triste species. In July 2015, the patient hiked with several other persons in the Pajarito Mountains, ≈5 miles south of where he had sustained a tick bite the preceding year. He and 1 of his hiking companions (patient 2) were bitten by ticks that visually resembled those observed in 2014. The tick that bit patient 1 in 2015 was attached for < 8 hours before it was removed. Patient 1 developed a small, erythematous papule with a central depressed scab at the bite site that healed within several days but remained otherwise asymptomatic.

She was admitted to the pediatric hospitalist service for workup and management. Her laboratory values were a leukocytosis of 16.97 × 10³/μL (reference range [ref], 4.5–14.0 × 10³/μL) with 83.8% neutrophils (ref, 33.0%-73.0%) and 7.1% lymphocytes (ref, 22.0%-57.0%). Hemoglobin was 11.6 g/dL (ref, 11.5–15.5 g/dL), hematocrit was 33.6% (ref, 35.0%-45.0%), and platelets were 422 × 10³/μL (ref, 145–370 × 10³/μL). Her total creatinine kinase was 99 U/L (ref, 0–400 units/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 64 mm/h (ref, 0–20 mm/h), and C-reactive protein was 146 mg/L (< 3 mg/L). A complete metabolic panel was normal. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Blood, urine, and stool cultures were obtained.

Supportive care was provided, and the dermatology service was subsequently consulted. Despite these measures, the patient did not clinically improve. Additional history was obtained by the consulting service, revealing that the patient owned pet rats that had just delivered a new litter. The patient also said that she had been recently playing and kissing the pet rats. Given her clinical presentation and additional history of considerable time handling pet rats, RBF was highly suspected. The dermatology team unroofed a pustule and obtained a skin biopsy, and intravenous penicillin therapy was initiated.

### Atypical systemic and dermatologic loxoscelism in a non-endemic region of the USA [^8b260b0b]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Loxosceles reclusa (LR), commonly known as the brown recluse spider, is endemic to the south central United States. We present a case of LR envenomation in a healthy adult male outside the usual geographic range, with atypical dermatologic and delayed, prolonged systemic loxoscelism (LX). This case demonstrates the importance of expanding the depth of knowledge of LR envenomations.

Case Report

A previously healthy 27year-old male presented to an emergency department (ED) in central Virginia two hours after a LR envenomation to his left proximal arm. He was treated with diphenhydramine and discharged on oral methylprednisolone for a 5-day taper. On post-bite Days 1 and 2, the patient developed subjective fevers, chills, arthralgias, and myalgias, followed by a blanching, pruritic, morbilliform rash throughout his trunk and lower extremities. Post-bite Day 3, the patient presented to the ED again because of marked erythema of face and the right lateral thigh, and posterior and anterior trunk. Vital signs and laboratory analysis were generally unremarkable. The patient was observed overnight, and discharged with a prescription for prednisone 60mg per day. On post-bite Day 7, the patient noted a petechial rash on the palms and soles and returned to the ED with a fever of 102.6°F, a heart rate of 130 beats per minutes, and systolic blood pressure ranging 80-90mmHg. After considering this may be an atypical presentation of LX, corticosteroids were increased to methylprednisolone 1mg/kg IV every 6h. The patient's condition slowly improved and he was discharged on post-bite Day 10. On post-bite Day 24, he had nearly complete resolution of skin findings.

Conclusions

LR envenomation can cause a variety of dermatological and systemic manifestations of toxicity. It is critical for toxicologists to be aware of the variety of presentations and findings to appropriately assess and treat LX.

African tick-bite fever (Rickettsia africae) — transmission and clinical features: Rickettsia africae is transmitted by the bite of a hard tick (Hyalomma spp.), and travelers who hike or camp outdoors or are on safari are particularly at risk for this disease; the disease is characterized by fever and an eschar at the site of the tick bite, the eschar (tache noire) is a mildly painful, dark brown or black, necrotic lesion with a red rim, several lesions might be present because exposed individuals often suffer multiple tick bites, and within a few days patients develop a fine petechial or papular rash associated with regional lymphadenopathy near the bite.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme arthritis — epidemiology and clinical features: Although historically arthritis was reported to occur in 60% of patients with untreated erythema migrans, more recent surveillance data document a 30% annual incidence of arthritis as a presenting manifestation. Lyme arthritis typically presents with marked swelling of 1 or a few large joints, most often the knee, with less pain than expected based on the degree of swelling, and in untreated disease overall, < 5 joints are typically affected and most often only a single joint is involved; small joint involvement of the hands and feet is very unusual and should prompt consideration of other diagnoses. In Lyme disease-endemic areas, there is a greater likelihood that acute infectious monarthritis is the result of Lyme disease rather than septic arthritis, and predictors of Lyme arthritis include history of a tick bite, isolated knee involvement, and lack of fever; absence of a history of a tick bite should not preclude consideration of Lyme arthritis in patients with acute inflammatory monoarthritis. There is considerable overlap between Lyme arthritis and septic arthritis in children in the following instances: presence of fever, elevated acute phase reactants, and the inability to bear weight (especially when the hip is involved), and previously published Kocher criteria should not be employed in distinguishing septic arthritis from Lyme arthritis; when there is any doubt, joint fluid should be obtained for culture for other bacterial causes of septic arthritis.

Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis — clinical features and laboratory findings include incubation and rash timing, symptom frequencies, laboratory abnormalities, and severity. Symptoms develop a median of 5 days (range: 2–10 days) after the bite of an infected tick, and an inoculation eschar is typically 0.5–2 cm in diameter. After fever begins, a nonpruritic maculopapular or vesiculopapular rash commonly develops (90%) approximately 0.5–4 days later, primarily on the trunk and extremities, and may involve the palms and soles in approximately half of patients and the face in < 20% of patients. Other common symptoms include myalgia (76%) and headache (86%). Regional lymphadenopathy is detected in approximately 95% of patients. Mild thrombocytopenia has been observed in 40%, mild leukopenia in 50%, and modest elevation of hepatic transaminase levels in 78% of cases. Hospitalization occurs in less than one third of patients; no severe manifestations or deaths have been reported.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) and other spotted fever group rickettsioses — key clinical features: RMSF is described as the most severe rickettsial illness in the United States, and delay in recognition and treatment is the most important factor associated with risk for death; early empiric therapy is the best way to prevent RMSF progression and resultant morbidity and mortality. The classic triad of fever, rash, and reported tick bite is rarely present at first presentation, and rash — present in most patients during the course of RMSF — can appear late or be atypical, localized, faint, evanescent, and difficult to recognize in persons with darker pigmented skin. Laboratory abnormalities that might occur include thrombocytopenia, increased immature neutrophils, elevations in hepatic transaminase levels, and hyponatremia, although laboratory findings are often within or slightly deviated from reference ranges early in illness. Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis is typically milder than RMSF with an inoculation eschar as the first manifestation in nearly all patients, and Rickettsia species 364D rickettsiosis has been described as a relatively mild illness characterized by eschar and regional lymphadenopathy.

History of tick bite or exposure — A detailed history should be taken to elicit information about known tick bites or activities associated with exposure to ticks, yet unrecognized bites are common: a history of a tick bite within 14 days of illness onset is reported in only 55%–60% of RMSF cases and 68% of ehrlichiosis cases, so absence of a recognized tick bite or tick bite–related rash does not exclude tickborne rickettsial disease and has been associated with delays in RMSF diagnosis and increased risk of death. Tick bites may be obscure and typically painless, and bites from immature stages such as nymphs, which are 1–2 mm (the size of a pinhead), may be less apparent. Health care providers should remain aware that tickborne rickettsial illnesses have been reported in every month of the year, including winter, potential exposures include recreational and occupational activities in tick habitats, and queries about contact with pets — especially dogs — might be useful because pet dogs with attached ticks can indicate peridomestic tick infestation and tick‑infested dogs can transfer ticks directly to humans and into dwellings.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) pathophysiology and clinical presentation — timing, rash features, and diagnostic cautions — include that symptoms of RMSF typically appear 3–12 days after the bite of an infected tick or between the fourth and eighth day after discovery of an attached tick, and the incubation period is generally shorter (5 days or less) in patients who develop severe disease. Initial symptoms include sudden onset of fever, headache, chills, malaise, and myalgia, and other early symptoms might include nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, and photophobia. A rash typically appears 2–4 days after the onset of fever, and the classic triad of fever, rash, and reported tick bite is present in only a minority of patients during initial presentation; therefore, health care providers should not wait for development of this triad before considering a diagnosis of RMSF. The RMSF rash classically begins as small (1–5 mm in diameter), blanching pink macules on the ankles, wrists, or forearms that subsequently spread and the classic spotted or generalized petechial rash usually appears by day 5 or 6 and is indicative of advanced disease. Absence of rash should not preclude consideration of RMSF; ≤ 50% of patients have a rash in the first 3 days of illness, children aged < 15 years more frequently have a rash than older patients, and unlike some SFG rickettsioses, an inoculation eschar is rarely present with RMSF. Rickettsia rickettsii primarily infects vascular endothelial cells leading to systemic vasculitis; pathogen-mediated endothelial injury results in increased capillary permeability, microhemorrhage, and platelet consumption, with late-stage manifestations including noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) and cerebral edema, and hyponatremia occurs as a result of appropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone in response to hypovolemia; if disease progresses untreated, it can result in end-organ damage associated with severe morbidity and death.

Case-patient 4 was a 74-year-old man from Arkansas who had malaise, arthralgia, fever, and nonbloody diarrhea in for 2 weeks in July 2014. The patient reported 2 tick bites 2 weeks before presentation. His medical history included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (treated with gemcitabine), lung cancer (treated with a right lobectomy), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that required supplemental oxygen, coronary artery disease, and hypothyroidism. At presentation, he had hypotension (79/46 mm Hg), tachycardia (142 beats/min), and a fever (temperature 100.1°F). Laboratory testing showed leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and morulae in neutrophils on a peripheral blood smear. Results of serologic testing for E. chaffeensis were negative. The patient received a 3-week course of doxycycline and showed clinical improvement; however, he died 1 month later of unrelated bacterial sepsis.

Case-patient 5 was a 73-year-old man from Missouri who had headache, fever, and nausea in August 2014. The patient reported a tick bite ≈2 months before presentation. His medical history included bladder cancer (treated with immunotherapy), a melanoma on his right arm (treated with surgical excision), type 1 diabetes, and hypothyroidism. He had leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased levels of liver enzymes. Blood cultures at presentation and serologic results for E. chaffeensis were negative. The patient received a 10-day course of doxycycline, and his symptoms resolved.

Ehrlichia chaffeensis ehrlichiosis (human monocytic ehrlichiosis) — pathophysiology, signs and symptoms: Ehrlichiae are obligate intracellular bacteria that infect peripheral blood leukocytes, and E. chaffeensis predominantly infects monocytes and tissue macrophages, multiplying in cytoplasmic membrane‑bound vacuoles to form morulae; in fatal infection, systemic, multi‑organ involvement with the greatest distribution of bacteria in the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow has been described. Symptoms typically appear a median of 9 days (range: 5–14 days) after the bite of an infected tick. Common features include fever (96%), headache (72%), malaise (77%), and myalgia (68%), with prominent gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea (57%), vomiting (47%), and diarrhea (25%). Approximately one‑third of patients develop a skin rash during the course of illness, more frequently in children than in adults, and rash typically occurs a median of 5 days after illness onset, involving the extremities and trunk but it can affect the palms, soles, or face. Cough or respiratory symptoms are reported in approximately 28% of patients and are more common among adults, and central nervous system involvement is present in approximately 20% of patients.

### Erythematous pink papules following a cat bite [^44db598d]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What treatment would be most appropriate for this patient?
A. Rifampin and isoniazid for 6 months
B. Cephalexin for 10 days
C. Fluconazole for 6 weeks
D. Azithromycin and doxycycline for 4 months
E. Ciprofloxacin for 2 weeks

Answers:
A. Rifampin and isoniazid for 6 months – Incorrect. Rifampin and isoniazid are more appropriate for the treatment of latent tuberculosis. While rifampin does have activity against some atypical mycobacterium, M chelonae is unlikely to respond well to this antibiotic combination.
B. Cephalexin for 10 days – Incorrect. Cephalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin with limited activity against atypical mycobacterium. It is more often used to target staphylococcal or streptococcal infections.
C. Fluconazole for 6 weeks – Incorrect. Fluconazole is an antifungal agent that is not effective against mycobacterium species.
D. Azithromycin and doxycycline for 4 months – Correct. Combination therapy with a macrolide antibiotic and tetracycline for a long-term period (at least 3 months) are appropriate to target M chelonae. Ideally, antibiotic treatment is based on specific susceptibilities if available. The use of doxycycline over other tetracyclines such as minocycline minimizes the risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions.
E. Ciprofloxacin for 2 weeks – Incorrect. Fluoroquinolones alone are inappropriate for the treatment of this atypical mycobacterium and would need to be combined with a macrolide or tetracycline to account for resistance.

### Mediterranean spotted fever with multiorgan involvement [^9a2b97e3]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Figure 6
Human rickettsial diseases.

MSF was first described in Tunisia in 1910and is endemic to the Middle East, India and Africa as well as the Mediterranean basin. It is the most common zoonosis in Mediterranean countries such as Portugaland classically occurs during the summer months. Reports of MSF incidence in Mediterranean countries have decreased in recent years. However, the worldwide incidence of rickettsial diseases is increasing due to increasing human travel and environmental degradationassociated with climate change, leading to increased contact with vectors and humans or animal reservoirs.

The causative organism of MSF is the obligate intracellular gram-negative bacterium Rickettsia conorii. The vector is the brown dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu lato). The animal reservoir includes dogs, small mammals and ticks. Ticks can be either vector or host of R. conorii and humans are an incidental host. Only about 10% of patients notice a tick bite. A black eschar (tache noire) at the site of the tick bite is present in 60%–72% of cases, usually on the trunk. There is typically only a single eschar, however, multiple eschars have been described, which could be due to multiple tick bites over several days' exposure in the case of our patient. The incubation period of MSF is around 7 days, following which patients commonly present with sudden onset of high fever and influenza-like symptoms, particularly headache and myalgia. Around 7 days after the onset of the fever, the patient usually develops a classic maculopapular spotted rash which involves the trunk, limbs, palms and soles but spares the face, as seen in our patient.

Rickettsial diseases in travelers — clinical presentations and red flags are outlined for African tick bite fever, scrub typhus, murine typhus, ehrlichiosis/anaplasmosis, and sennetsu fever. African tick bite fever is typically milder than other spotted fever group rickettsioses, and it should be suspected in a patient who presents with fever, headache, myalgia, and an eschar after recent travel to Sub-Saharan Africa or the Caribbean; regional lymphadenopathy is also common, and many patients may not remember a tick bite and not all will present with eschars. Scrub typhus presents with fever, headache, and myalgia; lymphadenopathy, respiratory symptoms, encephalitis, and eschars may also occur, with respiratory symptoms present in approximately two-thirds of patients and severity ranging from mild cough to acute respiratory distress syndrome; scrub typhus can be fatal if not treated appropriately. Patients with murine typhus usually present with a moderately severe but often otherwise non-specific febrile illness; approximately half of patients will develop a maculopapular rash, generally appearing on the trunk, and the fever can persist for up to 2 weeks in the absence of treatment; although generally less severe than Rocky Mountain spotted fever or scrub typhus, patients can develop organ failure or require hospitalization, and death can occur in some cases. Ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis also present as a non-specific febrile illness and are less commonly reported in travelers; cytopenias, particularly leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, are common and should heighten suspicion, and rash may be seen in some children with ehrlichiosis, but rash is not a feature of anaplasmosis. Sennetsu fever presents with fever, weakness, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly, resembling infectious mononucleosis, and although rarely reported in endemic regions, serologic evidence suggests it may be an underrecognized cause of fever in these regions.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether antibiotics are indicated for human bites. Eighty nine papers were found using the reported search, of which two represent the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given to all patients with human bites to the hands, feet, and skin overlying joints or cartilaginous structures, and to all patients with bites that penetrate deeper than the epidermal layer.

Anaplasmosis — signs and symptoms: Symptoms typically appear 5–14 days after a tick bite and commonly include fever (92%–100%), headache (82%), malaise (97%), and myalgia (77%), while rash occurs in < 10% of patients; compared with E. chaffeensis ehrlichiosis and RMSF, gastrointestinal symptoms are less frequent and central nervous system involvement is rare. Patients with anaplasmosis typically present later, at 5–8 days after onset, compared with 2–4 days for other tickborne rickettsial diseases.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 4 travel-associated infections and diseases [^d9650f76]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Rickettsial diseases — clinical presentation and treatment urgency emphasize that symptoms of rickettsial infections are non-specific and can be difficult to diagnose; although a "rickettsial triad" of fever, headache, and rash is classically described, this triad is not a reliable means of diagnosis. Symptoms common to many rickettsial diseases include fever, headache, malaise, rash, nausea, or vomiting, which typically occur within 1 week of infection, and many rickettsioses are accompanied by a maculopapular, vesicular, or petechial rash or sometimes a dark necrotic lesion known as an eschar at the site of the tick or mite bite. Although most rickettsial diseases are mild to moderate, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, scrub typhus, Mediterranean spotted fever, murine typhus, and epidemic typhus can be life-threatening, particularly if administration of appropriate antibiotics is delayed; prompt treatment with tetracycline-class antibiotics (most commonly doxycycline) is essential, and early treatment saves lives and prevents long-term sequelae. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the most severe spotted fever rickettsiosis, with initial symptoms including fever, headache, nausea, and abdominal pain that can rapidly progress to septic shock and even death; a maculopapular or petechial rash is commonly reported but may not occur until late in the illness course, eschars are rarely seen, and case fatality rates of 20%–40% are seen among patients for whom antibiotic treatment is delayed.

Box 7 — summary of the treatment and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases — doxycycline is the drug of choice for all tickborne rickettsial diseases in children and adults, and empiric therapy should be initiated promptly in patients with a clinical presentation suggestive of a rickettsial disease. Tickborne rickettsial diseases respond rapidly to doxycycline, and fever persisting for > 48 hours after initiation of therapy should prompt consideration of an alternative or additional diagnosis, including the possibility of coinfection. The American Academy of Pediatrics and CDC recommend doxycycline as the treatment of choice for patients of all ages, including children aged < 8 years, with a suspected tickborne rickettsial disease, and delay in treatment can lead to severe disease and death. In persons with severe doxycycline allergy or who are pregnant, chloramphenicol may be an alternative treatment for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, but persons treated with chloramphenicol have a greater risk for severe disease or death compared with those treated with doxycycline. For mild cases of anaplasmosis, rifampin might be an alternative to doxycycline for patients with a severe drug allergy or who are pregnant. Data on the risks of doxycycline use during pregnancy suggest that treatment at the recommended dose and duration is unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk, although data are insufficient to state that no risk exists. Prophylactic use of doxycycline after a tick bite is not recommended for the prevention of tickborne rickettsial disease, and treatment of asymptomatic persons seropositive for tickborne rickettsial disease is not recommended regardless of past treatment status because antibodies can persist for months to years after infection.

### Israeli spotted fever, Tunisia [^797aef71]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

De Sousa et al. reported the differences between patients infected with R. conorii Malish and ISF strains. The characteristic eschar at the site of the tick bite was markedly less noted in ISF. The absence of this eschar has been also described in other studies. In our report, patients were treated with a delay of 10 and 6 days and neither patient died, but 1 patient did experience severe illness. Our observations suggest that the supposed ability of the ISF Rickettsia sp. to cause more severe illness is not ascribed to late diagnosis but may be due to more virulent strains, as suspected by De Sousa.

Finally, PCR applied to whole blood and tissue samples was more effective in diagnosing these cases earlier than serology because antibodies appear to have slow kinetics. Physicians should be alert to the possibility of ISF in febrile patients in our region, especially because fatal outcomes of this infection have been reported.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^e51ee58d]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

American Heart Association and American Red Cross first aid — superficial wounds recommendations: Superficial wounds and abrasions should be thoroughly irrigated unless there is no obvious debris or foreign matter in the wound (COR 1, LOE C-EO). A superficial wound caused by an animal or human bite or with contamination with human or animal saliva should be evaluated in a medical facility as soon as possible (COR 1, LOE C-EO). It is reasonable to use running tap water or sterile saline solutions for wound irrigation instead of antiseptic agents such as povidone-iodine (COR 2a, LOE B-R). It is reasonable to cover clean superficial wounds and abrasions with an occlusive dressing to promote wound healing (COR 2a, LOE B-R). If a person with superficial wound or abrasion develops redness, swelling, foul-smelling wound drainage, increased pain, or fever, it is reasonable to remove the dressing, inspect the wound, and obtain medical care (COR 2a, LOE C-EO).

The Study

Case-patient 1 was a 57-year-old previously healthy man who sought treatment July 12, 2015, for chills and an acute onset of fever > 40°C. Five days before symptom onset, while camping at the northern rim of Grand Canyon National Park, he noted a small wound at the lateral aspect of his left elbow consistent with an insect bite. Cellulitis with regional lymphadenopathy developed on his left forearm, extending to the left axillary region. After surgical irrigation, debridement of the wound (August 8), and oral doxycycline treatment upon discharge, the patient fully recovered.

Case-patient 2 was a 55-year-old previously healthy woman who sought treatment on July 20, 2015, for sore throat and an acute onset of fever > 40°C. She reported no outdoor activity except being in a Coconino County park 4 days before symptom onset. Despite receiving treatment with amoxicillin, her fever persisted; she returned 4 days later with myalgia, fatigue, headaches, and emesis. Her therapy was switched to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and ceftriaxone. A 2-day hospitalization revealed left axillary lymphadenopathy with associated cellulitis in her left chest wall and breast. Her fever resolved with intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamicin. She received oral doxycycline upon discharge and fully recovered.

Case-patient 3 was a 73-year-old Coconino County woman with previous health conditions. She sought treatment in the summer of 2016 and died several days later (Appendix 2 Table). Details about this case-patient are presented elsewhere.

Case-patient 4 was a 24-year-old previously healthy woman from Navajo County who sought treatment in November 2016. A cat bite was the suspected source of infection, but the cat was euthanized without testing. Severe swelling and lymphadenopathy developed at the site of the bite; the patient was treated with antimicrobial drugs and recovered.

Case-patient 5 was a 52-year-old man who resided and traveled between both Coconino County and Pinal County. He sought treatment for dizziness, nausea, chills, headache, and body aches in June 2017. He was initially treated with antipyretics but returned to the hospital 2 days later. At this visit, he received treatment with several antimicrobial drugs and recovered. The source of his infection is unknown.

Question 2: Which of these organisms is the most likely cause of this presentation?
A. Staphylococcus aureus
B. Mycobacterium chelonae
C. Pasteurella multocida
D. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
E. S porothrix schenckii

Answers:
A. Staphylococcus aureus – Incorrect. S aureus colonizes the skin and is a common cause of skin infection. However, it is typically seen as gram positive cocci on histology.
B. Mycobacterium chelonae – Correct. M chelonae and other atypical mycobacteria can cause nodular lymphangitis and a Fite stain would demonstrate numerous acid-fast bacilli as was seen in this case. Tissue culture was further required to specifically identify M chelonae, which may be part of felines' oral flora depending on their diet. This patient's chronic immunosuppression likely made her more susceptible to infection; however, this presentation is possible even in immunocompetent patients.
C. Pasteurella multocida – Incorrect. P multocida is the most common bacteria associated with cat bites but does not typically stain with an AFB stain.
D. Pseudomonas aeruginosa – Incorrect. P aeruginosa cutaneous infections have a variable presentation ranging from green nail syndrome to folliculitis to cutaneous necrotic eschars when systemic. This typically is a gram-negative organism that is negative on AFB staining.
E. S porothrix schenckii – Incorrect. Although this patient has a history of exposure to roses and Sporothrix can be a cause of nodular lymphangitis, the organism is typically difficult to find on histology. It appears as a small elongated yeast which may stain with GMS or periodic acid-Schiff but is negative on AFB stain.

Q fever — epidemiology and exposure patterns include both occupational and nonoccupational risks and notable outbreaks. Q fever is an occupational disease in persons whose work involves contact with animals, but urban outbreaks and cases with no known exposure or close proximity to livestock have been reported, including nonoccupational exposures such as through a hobby farm. Case-report data from 2000–2010 indicate that 320 of 405 (79%) cases among those reporting occupational status were in patients not in previously defined high-risk occupations, and 243 of 405 (60%) were in patients without livestock contact. Approximately 200 cases of acute Q fever were reported in U.S. military personnel deployed to Iraq since 2003, and investigations linked illness to tick bites, sleeping in barns, and living near helicopter zones with environmental exposure resulting from helicopter-generated aerosols. The largest known reported outbreak involved approximately 4,000 human cases during 2007–2010 in the Netherlands, linked to dairy goat farms near densely populated areas with presumed windborne exposure.

Key points
- RBF should be suspected in patients with fever, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, and rash who have been around rodents
- Without early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, RBF can cause severe infections and death. Medication options There is limited research on the effectiveness of specific antibiotics to treat RBF. However, several antibiotics prove effective against S. moniliformis. These include:

- penicillins
- cephalosporins
- carbapenems
- aztreonam
- clindamycin
- erythromycin
- nitrofurantoin
- bacitracin
- doxycycline
- tetracycline
- teicoplanin
- vancomycin. Intravenous penicillin G given for 7 or more days, then oral penicillin, is usually recommended for the treatment of RBF. Patients can develop reactions to penicillin treatment, but usually improve quickly once they're on antibiotics. Treatment precautions In patients allergic to penicillin, doxycycline or streptomycin are alternative choices.

RBF can present similarly to other febrile rash illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. If RBF and RMSF are both in differential diagnosis, doxycycline should be considered as first-line treatment. This is because there is a need for rapid treatment and limited diagnostics for both diseases. In patients under the age of eight, dental staining is not a risk when using doxycycline for less than 14 days. Endocarditis is a rare complication and may require combination therapy with both intravenous penicillin G and streptomycin or gentamicin. Note, this is based on older studies and no recent studies have been done to evaluate the effectiveness of combination treatment.

### Blastomycosis in man after kinkajou bite [^8ed346eb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The Study

On September 21, 2009, a 37-year-old male zoologist in Indianapolis, Indiana, visited his physician with a 3-day history of swelling and tenderness of the third digit of his right hand. He reported having been bitten on the affected finger on August 29 by his pet kinkajou. At the time, the animal was severely ill with respiratory signs and died shortly after biting the patient. The wound initially healed after treatment with antimicrobial ointment. At the physician visit, the patient was prescribed 2 weeks of doxycycline and amoxicillin/clavulanate and instructed to return if no improvement was noted.

On September 24, the patient returned with worsening pain. He was hospitalized the next day with fever (101.0°F), nausea, headache, and continued finger tenderness. Ascending lymphangitis and swollen, tender, axillary lymph nodes were noted. Except for his leukocyte count (15,100 cells/mL), laboratory values were within reference ranges. The patient was treated with intravenous vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam, wound incision, and drainage. Results of blood and wound cultures were negative. By September 27, the patient's fever and lymphangitis subsided. He was discharged and received amoxicillin/clavulanate and ciprofloxacin.

The next week the patient returned to the emergency department with erythematous nodules along his right basilic vein and recurrent ascending lymphadenitis. An infectious disease consultant noted fusiform swelling of the right middle finger, nodular erythematous fluctuant areas of the right wrist, swollen and tender axilla, and a nodular area on the right ankle. A punch biopsy sample from the right hand showed acute inflammation and suppurative granulomas of deep soft tissue. Initial stainings were negative for parasites, fungi, and acid-fast bacilli. Tissue and blood cultures for aerobic, anaerobic, acid-fast, and fungal organisms were negative, as were serologic results for Bartonella spp. and Brucella spp.

The patient was readmitted to a local hospital on October 12 with lesions on the right ankle and swelling of the left ankle. Results of complete blood count with differential, metabolic profile, and liver function studies were unremarkable; additional blood cultures were obtained. The patient was treated with azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and streptomycin. Axilla aspirate was cultured. On October 16, the patient's condition improved, and he was discharged. Blood cultures obtained during hospitalization were negative. However, a mold was found growing in the axillary fungal culture.

### Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome acquired through dog bite, south Korea [^3ecff8f5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

This case underscores the importance of personal protective equipment and infection control in both veterinary and human healthcare settings to prevent zoonotic transmission. Prompt wound care after animal bite or scratches, including washing with soap and running water for > 20 minutes, can reduce the risk for infections such as B virus or rabies. Although the effectiveness of this approach against SFTS is unproven, the same principle may reduce the risk for other viral infections transmitted through animal bites or saliva exposure.

In conclusion, this case emphasizes the risk for SFTSV transmission not only via tick bites but also directly through bites from infected dogs. Enhanced awareness and preventive strategies in both veterinary and human healthcare settings are critical to mitigating the risks of SFTS.

### Tick-borne relapsing fever in the white mountains, Arizona, USA, 2013–2018 [^f2147943]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is a bacterial infection transmitted by tick bites that occurs in several different parts of the world, including the western United States. We describe 6 cases of TBRF acquired in the White Mountains of Arizona, USA, and diagnosed during 2013–2018. All but 1 case-patient had recurrent fever, and some had marked laboratory abnormalities, including leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated aminotransaminases. One patient had uveitis. Diagnosis was delayed in 5 of the cases; all case-patients responded to therapy with doxycycline. Two patients had Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions. The White Mountains of Arizona have not been previously considered a region of high incidence for TBRF. These 6 cases likely represent a larger number of cases that might have been undiagnosed. Clinicians should be aware of TBRF in patients who reside, recreate, or travel to this area and especially for those who sleep overnight in cabins there.

### Snakebite-associated infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6e5bf85e]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The prevalence of snakebite-associated infections is high, primarily due to M. morganii, and should be taken into account when selecting the most adequate empirical therapy. Most patients presenting with snakebite infection require surgical intervention. Rational use of antimicrobials is recommended and should guide initial empirical treatment. In light of the present results, snakebites warrant further microbiological study for the isolation and identification of bacteria in all cases to confirm or rule out an associated infection. Finally, the importance of monitoring infection in snake-bitten patients is of note.

### African tick bite fever in elderly patients: 8 cases in French tourists returning from South Africa [^d4190c94]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

African tick-bite fever, a tickborne disease caused by Rickettsia africae, is endemic in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa and in the French West Indies. Most cases reported in the literature occurred in middle-aged, otherwise-healthy persons and corresponded to benign diseases. The course of African tick bite fever in elderly people is less well documented.

Methods

The medical records of 8 elderly patients infected with R. africae during a trip to South Africa in 2005 are presented to summarize the epidemiologic, clinical, microbiological, treatment, and disease course characteristics.

Results

Eight patients, aged 63–75 years, developed African tick bite fever symptoms after a trip to South Africa. R. africae was grown from cutaneous eschar biopsy specimens obtained from 4 patients, confirming African tick bite fever. We observed unusual findings in this elderly population. Rash was frequent (present in 87.5% of patients), vesicular (in 100% of patients with rash), and often associated with an enanthema (in 50% of patients with rash). Severe clinical manifestations occurred: lymphangitis and myocarditis in 1 patient and suspected brain involvement in 2 patients. We observed severe and long-lasting general symptoms, including fever (in 75% of patients), chills (87.5%), asthenia (50%), anorexia (50%), and weight loss (12.5%). With doxycycline therapy, the outcome was favorable in all cases, but complete recovery was slow.

Conclusion

Ecotourism to sub-Saharan Africa is expanding, and people of advanced age, often with underlying chronic diseases, account for an increasing proportion of travelers. African tick bite fever appears to be more symptomatic in this population. Recommendations advising personal prophylactic measures to prevent tick bites in travelers to regions of endemicity may be particularly important for elderly individuals.

### A 42-year-old woman with septic shock: an unexpected source [^c7ea2157]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Dog bites are the most common animal bite injuries occurring in the United States. Estimated infection rates range between 15% and 20%. Polymicrobial infections are most common. Capnocytophaga canimorsus (C. canimorsus) is a Gram-negative rod strongly associated with dog bites, and is known to cause life-threatening infection in humans.

Objectives

1) Outline epidemiology of dog bites in the United States; 2) Identify host factors associated with infection, and common pathogens; 3) Discuss microbiology of C. canimorsus; 4) Discuss common clinical manifestations of C. canimorsus infection; 5) Outline treatment options.

Case Report

A 42-year-old woman with a remote history of Hodgkin's lymphoma (treated with irradiation) and thyroid carcinoma, both of which were in remission, presented to the Emergency Department with fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. She was found to be in septic shock. She was aggressively resuscitated and administered broad-spectrum antibiotics. Blood cultures grew C. canimorsus in 2/4 bottles. The patient recalled being bitten by the family dog 48 h before her initial presentation. She made an uneventful recovery. She was felt to be "functionally hyposplenic" due to her prior irradiation.

Conclusions

C. canimorsus is a rare pathogen strongly associated with dog bites. By eliciting a history of animal bite, clinicians may be able to alert the laboratory of suspected C. canimorsus infection. Prolonged laboratory incubation times may be necessary as the organism is fastidious. Predisposing conditions include, among others, prior splenectomy and alcoholism. The mortality rate from C. canimorsus sepsis is high, so treatment should be promptly initiated.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 10 post-travel evaluation [^50701446]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Bite-associated infections in travelers — pathogens, risk groups, and management are described as follows: Wound infections after cat and dog bites are caused by a variety of microorganisms. This includes S. aureus, α-, β-, and γ-hemolytic streptococci, several genera of gram-negative organisms, and several anaerobes. Pasteurella multocida infection classically occurs after cat bites but can also occur after dog bites; lesions caused by this organism develop quickly and are often painful. Patients lacking spleens are at particular risk for severe cellulitis and sepsis due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection after dog bites. Management of cat and dog bites includes consideration of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, as well as tetanus immunization and antibiotic treatment. Avoid primary closure of dog bites to the hand or puncture wounds anywhere on the body.

Capnocytophaga infection after dog or cat contact — Capnocytophaga spp. are bacteria that live in the mouths of dogs and cats; most people who have contact with a dog or cat do not become sick with Capnocytophaga infection, but rarely these bacteria can spread to people through bites, scratches, or close contact (especially contact with their saliva) and may cause serious illness, including sepsis. People with weakened immune systems are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill. Signs and symptoms include local blistering, redness, swelling, draining pus, or pain at the bite wound, and systemic symptoms such as abdominal pain, confusion, diarrhea, fever, headache, muscle or joint pain, or vomiting; after being bitten, most people who become ill will show symptoms within 1–14 days, and some infections can lead to death.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^fff23d32]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Our data suggests there could be scope to change and improve the management of insect bites, with greater use of non-antibiotic management. To help detect early cellulitis swab of purulent discharge and drawing round the erythema to monitor spread may be helpful. Exploration of antihistamine, topical steroid, and topical antiseptics in insect bite management may reduce antibiotic use. Our findings highlight the next steps needed in a QI approach to generate practice-based evidence on optimal management of insect bites, specifically work on alternatives to antibiotic prescribing.

The James Lind alliancehas worked with patients to identify research questions related to the management of cellulitis, including "What are the early signs and symptoms of cellulitis that can help to ensure speedy treatment?". For insect bites in general practice, we suggest "What early symptoms and signs in insect bite reactions do not require antibiotics?" and "What non-antibiotic treatments reduce inflammation and cellulitis?" as changes to design and implement as the next step in a QI model to develop practice-based evidence.

### A 4-year review of human bite injuries presenting to emergency medicine and proposed evidence-based guidelines [^c985f76f]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

Human bite injuries are a common injury, roughly accounting for around 0.1% of attendances to Emergency Medicine departments. Morbidities associated with such injuries are legion. Of paramount importance is the potential for infection of the wound site, both bacterial and viral. A retrospective 4-year review of 3136 case notes was conducted, identifying 421 human bites. This amounts to one every 3 days! The majority of those bitten were young males (male:female ratio = 3:1; 44% comprising the age group 16–25 years). The management of these wounds was found to be poor. 17% of patients did not receive any antibiotic cover; 21% of patients either did not have tetanus prophylaxis administered when required or had a tetanus booster when they were already covered; 34% of patients either did not receive a hepatitis B booster when one was required or received one when they were already covered. This lack of effective documentation, along with errors in addressing prophylaxis of the infective agents, may have profound medico-legal consequences. The author believes that the findings will be reproduced in other centres and in view of the inadequacies highlighted by this work, it is necessary to introduce an evidence-based protocol for the comprehensive management of the human bite. Using United Kingdom Department of Health evidence-based guidelines, the author proposes such a pathway.

### Alcaligenes faecalis cellulitis after a dog bite: case report and literature review [^15d6b17b]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Alcaligenes faecalis is a gram-negative organism that is commonly found in the environment and may also be a part of normal fecal flora in humans. Although various infections with this bacteria have been described in the pediatric population, it has not been previously identified in infections as the pathogen after a dog bite. A case of a 19-month-old boy is presented with a cellulitis secondary to a dog bite, which failed oral antibiotic therapy, and progressed to worsening fever and swelling. The patient ultimately required hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, and incision and drainage. The wound culture grew A. faecalis, whose identity was confirmed through recombinant DNA sequence analysis. Although it has been identified in cat bite wounds, A. faecalis has not been cited in the literature before in an infection after a dog bite.

### Human infections with Rickettsia raoultii, China [^1e80eb93]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The Study

On May 15, 2012, a 67-year-old man came to Mudanjiang Forestry Central Hospital in Mudanjiang, China, with an attached tick on his left shoulder. The feeding tick was detached in the outpatient department and subsequently identified as D. silvarum by an entomologist. Four days later, a painful erythematous rash developed around the site of the tick bite, and the patient returned to the hospital for treatment. The rash was irregular, round, and ≈1.5 cm in diameter. No other symptoms and signs were found.

On May 21, 2012, a 30-year-old man came to the same hospital with asthenia, anorexia, nausea, and a painful rash on his abdomen. He had been bitten by a tick 4 days before onset of symptoms. Physical examination identified a 20 × 5 cm erythematous rash on his abdomen around a tick-bite eschar. Vesicles were seen surrounding the site of the tick bite. Lymphadenopathy was not observed.

Routine laboratory and hematologic assays for blood and serum samples from both patients showed standard results. Because rashes were found during physical examinations and infection with spotted fever group rickettsia was suspected, oral doxycycline (100 mg, twice a day for 2 weeks) was then prescribed. The infections of the 2 patients were successfully treated at home and did not recur.

DNA was extracted from anticoagulated blood samples by using a Blood DNA Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCRs specific for the conserved citrate synthase gene (glt A) and spotted fever group–restricted outer membrane protein A gene (omp A) were conducted as described and followed by sequencing. Both partial gltA (341 bp) and ompA (325 bp) sequences from the 2 patients were identical to each other and to those of R. raoultii (Figure).

Chikungunya — clinical features and course in travelers are described as follows: The incubation period is typically 3–7 days (range 1–12 days), with sudden onset of high fever (temperature typically 39° C [102° F]) and joint pains; fevers typically last for 1 week and can be biphasic. Joint symptoms are typically severe, debilitating, and usually bilateral and symmetric, most commonly affecting hands and feet but possibly more proximal joints. Other findings include conjunctivitis, headache, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and a morbilliform rash that often pruritic and involves trunk and extremities and can include palms, soles, and face. Abnormal laboratory findings can include elevated creatinine and liver function tests, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia; rare but serious complications include hepatitis, myocarditis, neurologic disease, ocular disease, acute renal disease, and severe bullous skin lesions. Acute symptoms typically resolve in 7–10 days, but some patients have continuation or relapse of rheumatologic symptoms for months after acute illness, and studies report variable proportions, ranging from 5% to 80%, with persistent joint pains and prolonged fatigue for months or years. Deaths occur but are rare and are reported most commonly in older adults with comorbidities and young infants infected perinatally or by mosquito bites. In pregnancy, symptoms and outcomes are similar to others and most infections during pregnancy will not result in transmission to the fetus; however, intrapartum transmission can result in neonatal complications including hemorrhagic symptoms, myocardial disease, and neurologic disease, and rare spontaneous abortions after first-trimester maternal infection have been reported.

### Pathogenicity and treatment of Bartonella infections [^cab246db]. International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents (2014). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Bartonella quintana infection:

- **Definition**: Bartonella quintana infection, also known as trench fever, is a bacterial infection caused by the intracellular Gram-negative bacterium Bartonella quintana.
- **Pathophysiology**: Bartonella quintana, an intracellular, Gram-negative bacterium, is primarily transmitted by the body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus) through louse feces on altered skin. The bacterium invades endothelial cells and is released every 4–5 days, leading to relapsing fever. Bartonella quintana can also invade RBCs and persist for months, evading the host immune response and reducing the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for Bartonella quintana infection include immunocompromised states, such as HIV infection and organ transplantation, as well as homelessness and poor sanitation increasing the risk of exposure to body lice, the primary vector of Bartonella quintana.
- **Disease course**: Trench fever typically presents with recurrent febrile episodes, often following a 5-day fever pattern, followed by a week of resolution. It is usually accompanied by other symptoms such as headache, myalgia, bone pain, maculopapular rash, anorexia, and sweating. Severe complications of Bartonella quintana infection, such as endocarditis, bacillary angiomatosis, and neurological manifestations, can occur in immunocompromised patients.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Bartonella endocarditis is associated with a 9–12% mortality rate. Bacillary angiomatosis may be life-threatening if left untreated.

### Hypersensitivity to mosquito bites: a unique pathogenic mechanism linking Epstein-Barr virus infection, allergy and oncogenesis [^b9004c39]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2007). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity to mosquito bites (HMB) is characterized by intense local skin reactions and systemic symptoms, such as high fever, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Half of the patients reported died of hemophagocytic syndrome or lymphocyte proliferative disorders. Clinical and laboratory studies have revealed that HMB occurs in association with natural killer (NK) cell lymphocytosis related to chronic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Recent studies have clarified the unique pathogenic mechanism of this mysterious disease, and demonstrated the close relationship between HMB and EBV-carrying NK cell lymphocytosis; i.e. CD4(+) T cells from the patients markedly responded to mosquito salivary gland extracts, and the CD4(+) T cells stimulated by mosquito bites may play a key role in the development of HMB and NK cell oncogenesis via the induction of EBV reactivation and EBV-oncogene expression, respectively.

### Capnocytophaga canimorsus blebitis: case report and review of literature [^72a1099c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a Gram-negative bacillus that is capnophilic, a facultative anaerobe, and belongs in the Bacteroidetes phylum. It was originally named CDC group dysgonic fermenter 2 (DF-2), with articles published in the 1980s referring to Capnocytophaga canimorsus as DF-2. The first human infection was reported in 1976, and there has only been approximately 500 reported cases worldwide. This is likely an underreported figure given that C. canimorsus is notoriously difficult to culture, and can also result in subclinical infections. C. canimorsus can be transmitted through bites, scratches, and close animal contact (e.g. licking).

With recent advances in ribosomal DNA sequencing, some researchers have proposed splitting Capnocytophaga canimorsus into two different species. The proposed name of the subclinical strain is Capnocytophaga canis, and maintaining the same name of Capnocytophaga canimorsus for the clinically symptomatic strain. However, recent case reports have isolated C. canis from patients with sepsis. The strains that are harmful to humans all grow in heat-inactivated human serum, deglycosylate IgM and are cytochrome-oxidase positive. Healthy, immunocompetent individuals are typically not susceptible to overt systemic C. canimorsus infections. However, at-risk individuals (e.g. immunocompromised, alcoholics, splenectomized patients) can have systemic C. canimorsus infections like endocarditis, meningitis, and even fatal bacteremia leading to multi-organ system failure.

### Rare case ofmeningitis in a man without risk factors [^457a704d]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus meningitis is an uncommon but potentially serious cause of meningitis, which is considered particularly rare in healthy and immunocompetent individuals. We present a case of C. canimorsus meningitis in a young, immunocompetent patient which was acquired following a dog bite. We review the literature and propose that underdiagnosis of this condition is likely. To avoid misdiagnosis, and thus improper management, clinicians should ensure that they identify animal exposure in all meningitic patients, and adopt a higher clinical suspicion in the absence of classical risk factors.

### Bite injuries at a level 1 trauma center in Germany [^4a73368e]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

The study design of this investigation on animal and human bite injuries is retrospective and monocentric, conducted at a level 1 trauma center in Germany. The data set encompasses all patients presenting with bite wounds at the clinic during a 10-year period, from January 2010 to January 2020.

Epidemiological data were collected, including information pertaining to the demographic characteristics of the subjects. The anatomic region of the bite was examined to identify the parts of the body most vulnerable to injury. In the case of animal bites, the species was assessed, distinguishing between domestic and wild animals. It was also recorded whether the patient presenting with the injury was also the owner of the animal. Snakebites were classified as either venomous or constricting. Furthermore, it was established whether the rabies vaccination status of the animal was known. Additionally, it was documented whether the bite occurred at the site of contact or during a long-distance journey to an area with elevated risk. To ascertain whether there were any seasonal differences, the month in which the bite occurred was documented.

In the case of human bite wounds, the documented infection status regarding HIV or hepatitis infection was analyzed. The investigation also sought to ascertain whether the injuries had occurred during physical altercations, unintentional sexual incidents, or when treating psychiatric or neurological patients.

The efficacy of preclinical first aid, including that provided by the rescue service, and in-hospital care was evaluated. Furthermore, the current study sought to ascertain the infection rate associated with bite injuries. The clinical diagnosis of a superinfection of the bite wound was made, incorporating the following criteria: increasing redness, transmission of pain along the tendons, pronounced edema formation, pus, fever, chills, tachycardia, and hypotension. Indications of an infection may also be indicated by increased laboratory chemical values, for example, leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin. However, in patients with acute infection of the fingers, toes, hands or feet, these values may not necessarily be elevated.

### Managing snakebite [^9d05b3d1]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

Bites from venomous snakes can result in bleeding, paralysis, long term disability, and death
Immobilise the bitten limb when transporting the patient to a medical facility; the universal use of pressure immobilisation is controversial, and tourniquets are not recommended
The 20-minute whole blood clotting test is a simple bedside test to screen for and monitor coagulopathy in resource-limited settings
Assess vital parameters and initiate resuscitation measures if the patient is clinically unstable with signs of bleeding, shock, paralysis, or respiratory distress
Intravenous antivenom is recommended in patients with systemic symptoms; the dose and type depend on likely snake species, local guidelines, and availability

Snakebite affects between 1.8 to 2.7 million people worldwide each year, and it is estimated to cause between 80 000 and 138 000 deaths. A mixture of toxins (venom) is injected into the body following bite by a venomous snake. Envenoming can be a highly dynamic clinical event. Symptoms can progressively worsen to a life-threatening emergency. Snakebites can have long term physical sequelae such as amputation, paralysis and disability, and psychological health consequences.

Snakebite envenoming is more common in South and South-East Asia (2 million annually), sub-Saharan Africa (420 000) and Latin America (150 000). These regions also report a high burden of deaths from snakebite (100 000, 32 000, and 5000 deaths respectively) possibly due to poor access to medical aid. Delayed diagnosis and treatment can worsen prognosis. The World Health Organization recognised snakebite as a neglected tropical disease in 2017 and called for concerted global action to reduce deaths and disability.

In this clinical update, we present an approach to evaluation and management of snakebites for primary care providers in resource-limited settings in endemic regions. The principles of management are broadly similar, but it is beyond the scope of this article to cover clinical syndromes and management for the varied snake species globally.

### Murine typhus mistaken for COVID-19 in a young man [^5d560a70]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

In cases where obtaining a timely diagnosis has been challenging, clinicians should not overlook the importance of identifying a patient's occupational history. Inquiring about this patient's work as a dog trainer led me to consider a diagnosis of murine typhus. Because its symptoms are non-specific — it is often misdiagnosed and subsequently under-reported. The disease is primarily transmitted to humans through fleas found on rodents. While most studies indicate common reservoirs for this disease are rats and cats, there have been reports of serological evidence of the presence of R. typhi in dogs. There has also been an increased occurrence of murine typhus in warmer seasons.

Other illnesses related to dog exposure were excluded during the investigation of this patient's illness. Blood smear did not show evidence of either tick borne relapsing feveror ehrlichiosis — which is transmitted by the brown dog tick. Blood culture was negative, eliminating a diagnosis of Capnocytophaga canimorsus which usually occurs after a bite, scratch or lick from a dog.

Lack of awareness and inability to differentiate murine typhus from other diseases causing fever such as COVID-19 can lead to delayed treatment and subsequent prolongation of symptoms in addition to higher cost of healthcare. Although murine typhus has been described as a mild and self-limited illness, there are reports that the disease may be fatal in as high as 5% of patients for whom antibiotic treatment was delayed or not provided. Early recognition of this disease and prompt intervention with doxycycline will result in more favourable outcomes. During this pandemic, medical providers should develop more comprehensive differential diagnoses in patients who experience persistent symptoms that overlap with COVID-19 and repeatedly test negative for it.

Patient's perspective

This experience made me feel like a number rather than a person. I am thankful I was able to recover and my parents did not have to sign the consent form. However, I worry that someone with more than Typhus is out there receiving poor care in the name of COVID-19. While I was sick, I started to lose trust in the medical system. If my step-mother was not a nurse, I would have not have worked so hard to receive care. I did eventually receive care. I am thankful for those doctors and nurses that took the extra time to help me.

Protecting pets from tick bites — vectors and pet treatments: Various domestic animals are susceptible to tickborne rickettsial diseases that increase the likelihood of human exposure; dogs serve as the primary host for R. sanguineus, which is known to transmit R. rickettsii both to humans and dogs in certain geographic areas; regular use of pet ectoparasite control products (monthly topical acaricidal products, acaricidal tick collars, oral acaricidal products, and acaricidal shampoos) can help reduce the risk for human exposure to ticks on pets.

### Management of facial bite wounds [^9abeb099]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Bite wounds are especially prone to infectious complications, both local and systemic. In bite wounds to the face, such complications can create more difficulties than the initial tissue damage itself for the task of restoring an esthetic appearance. Management should aim to neutralize this potential for infection and provide an infection-free environment for wound healing. Wound cleansing followed by primary closure is the treatment of choice, and the use of prophylactic antibiotics may further decrease the risk of infection. Delay in presentation beyond 24 hours is not necessarily a contraindication to immediate repair, but excessive crushing of the tissues or extensive edema usually dictates a more conservative approach, such as delayed closure.

Dog or cat bites — Preemptive antibiotics are recommended for high-risk patients and rabies postexposure prophylaxis may be needed. Preemptive early antimicrobial therapy for 3–5 days is recommended for patients who are immunocompromised, asplenic, have advanced liver disease, have preexisting or resultant edema of the affected area, have moderate to severe injuries (especially to the hand or face), or have injuries that may have penetrated the periosteum or joint capsule (strong, low). Postexposure prophylaxis for rabies may be indicated; consultation with local health officials is recommended to determine if vaccination should be initiated (strong, low).

### Tularemia antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis: CDC recommendations for naturally acquired infections and bioterrorism response-United States, 2025 [^15777710]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

First responders and health care providers who followed standard precautions (e.g. personal protective equipment [PPE]) while caring for patients with tularemia need not take PEP. Antimicrobial PEP or fever monitoring might be considered for first responders and health care providers who had breaches in PPE and substantial exposure while caring for patients with tularemia (e.g. direct contact with a patient's ulcer without wearing gloves or performing intubation without wearing a surgical mask).

Response teams conducting environmental evaluations or other activities in an area of an intentional release of F. tularensis should use PPE recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reduce risk for infection from environmental contamination. If appropriate EPA-recommended PPE is not available and workers cannot avoid being in the area, antibiotic PrEP or PEP or fever monitoring after exposure may be considered.

Members of the general public are at risk for naturally acquired tularemia after tick or deer fly bites, lawn mowing, animal skinning, or other exposures. However, the overall risk after natural exposures is minimal because of the relatively low incidence of naturally acquired tularemia (0.064 per 100,000 population). PEP is not typically recommended after a potential natural exposure, although PEP can be considered for hunters, pet owners, or other persons who had direct contact with an animal known to be infected.

Additional details on selection of specific antimicrobials for PEP, including the GRADE EtD framework underlying recommendations, are available. Although evidence for fluoroquinolone use for PEP is particularly scant, fluoroquinolones are expected to be effective based on extrapolation from treatment data. In addition, evidence to inform optimal duration of PEP is limited.

### Cat-scratch disease [^244190df]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cat scratch disease:

- **Definition**: CSD is a bacterial infection caused by Bartonella henselae, an aerobic Gram-negative bacillus.
- **Pathophysiology**: CSD is caused by Bartonella henselae, an aerobic Gram-negative bacillus. Bartonella henselae can infect feline erythrocytes and fleas, which can contaminate saliva and then be introduced into humans through biting and clawing by cats. The cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, is the vector responsible for horizontal transmission of the disease from cat to cat, and its bite can also infect humans. In addition, tick bites may transmit the bacterium to humans.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the annual incidence of CSD is estimated at 4.5 cases per 100,000 person-years, while the incidence of CSD requiring hospitalization is estimated at 0.19 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: In the classic disease course, a papule or pustule develops 3–30 days following a scratch or a bite, and regional lymphadenopathy develops about 3 weeks after inoculation. Suppurative lymphadenopathy may develop in 10% of cases. Less than 2% of patients develop extranodal disease (for example CNS, liver, spleen, bone, and lung involvement).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In most patients, especially children, the disease is self-limited, and resolves without specific treatment. In immunosuppressed patients, Bartonella henselae can lead to bacillary angiomatosis and bacillary peliosis, which have high rates of relapse and require prolonged antibiotics.

### Epstein-Barr virus-positive T / NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorders [^8efc612e]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic active EBV infection

Chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV) was originally related to chronic or persistent EBV infection. On the basis of the EBV-induced clonal expansion of different lymphocytes, the origin of CAEBV is classified as B, T or NK cell. CAEBV, B-cell type is very rare in comparison with the T-cell type.

Patients with CAEBV present with fever, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, hepatic dysfunction and pancytopenia, and have markedly elevated peripheral blood levels of EBV DNA. This disease is rare with variable clinical severity and often causes high morbidity and mortality. Histologically, the lymph node pathology is variable and often similar to that of a polymorphic PTLD with paracortical expansion and numerous immunoblasts. Cells with plasmacytoid differentiation, plasma cells and occasional Reed–Sternberg-like cells are often observed. Variable numbers of the infiltrating cells are positive for EBERs.

Hypersensitivity to mosquito bites

Hypersensitivity to mosquito bites is a rare disease characterized by severe local skin reactions and general symptoms such as high fever, liver dysfunction, high IgE levels and regional lymphadenopathy after mosquito bites. NK-cell lymphocytosis is frequently observed in the peripheral blood. The mean age of onset is 6.7 years, with no gender predominance. hypersensitivity to mosquito bites is usually associated with chronic EBV infection as well as NK-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Mosquito bite-stimulated CD4 + T cells might associate with the development of hypersensitivity to mosquito bites and NK-cell oncogenesis by inducing EBV reactivation and EBV-oncogene expression, respectively. Hypersensitivity to mosquito bites patients without systemic symptoms may eventually develop CAEBV. Spongiotic epidermis and a polymorphous cellular infiltrate with angiocentricity throughout the dermis may be observed with this disease.

### Infectious complications of bite injuries [^d5c181b1]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Animal and human bite injuries are a public health burden. Dog bites outnumber cat bites, but cat bites pose the greatest risk for infection. Skin and soft tissue infections are the most frequent infectious manifestations resulting from bite injury, although invasive infection may occur through direct inoculation or dissemination through the bloodstream. Although contemporary, well-designed trials are needed to inform clinical practice, preemptive antibiotic therapy after a bite injury is warranted for injuries posing high risk for infection and for patients at risk of developing severe infection; antibiotics should target aerobic and anaerobic microbes that comprise the oral and skin flora.

WARNINGS

Refer to boxed "WARNINGS", "PRECAUTIONS", "ADVERSE REACTIONS" and "OVERDOSAGE" sections for additional information on serious adverse reactions and steps to be taken, if any occur.

Extreme caution is necessary when using diagnostic skin tests or injection treatment in highly sensitive patients who have experienced severe symptoms or anaphylaxis by natural exposure, or during previous skin testing or treatment. IN THESE CASES THE POTENCY FOR SKIN TESTS AND THE ESCALATION OF THE TREATMENT DOSE MUST BE ADJUSTED TO THE PATIENT'S SENSITIVITY AND TOLERANCE.

Benefit versus risk needs to be evaluated in steroid dependent asthmatics, patients with unstable asthma or patients with underlying cardiovascular disease.

Injections should never be given intravenously. A 5/8 inch, 25 gauge needle on a sterile syringe allows deep subcutaneous injection. Withdraw plunger slightly after inserting needle to determine if a blood vessel has been entered.

Proper measurement of dose and caution in making injection will minimize reactions. Adverse reactions to allergenic extracts are usually apparent within 20–30 minutes following injection of immunotherapy.

Extract should be temporarily withheld or dosage reduced in case of any of the following conditions: 1) flu or other infection with fever; 2) exposure to excessive amounts of allergen prior to injection; 3) rhinitis and/or asthma exhibiting severe symptoms; 4) adverse reaction to previous injection until cause of reaction has been evaluated by physician supervising patient's immunotherapy program.

Summary

Bite injuries are a prevalent form of injury globally, with the potential to result in a range of complications at the site of the wound. It is therefore essential that they receive time-critical and individualized care. Children are a high-risk demographic, with the head and neck region being particularly susceptible to injury. In addition to the common dog, cat, and human bites, there are regional differences in the species of domestic and wild animals that may inflict bites. Infection rates also exhibit regional variation, which is likely attributable to differences in the rates of presentation or injury severity.
