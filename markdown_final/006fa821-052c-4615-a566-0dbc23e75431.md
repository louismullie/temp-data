## Question

Testosterone for femal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to use testosterone therapy in women, including indications, formulations, dosing, monitoring, safety, and considerations for special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the strength of evidence for testosterone in women. Then, I should verify the precise indication and diagnostic approach. Next, I will review formulations and dosing, followed by monitoring and safety. After that, I need to consider special populations such as premenopausal women, those with premature ovarian insufficiency, and women with high cardiometabolic risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise clinical algorithm and highlight uncertainties and future directions, ensuring each claim is anchored to guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the strength of evidence. Testosterone is an essential female hormone with physiologic roles beyond reproduction, but the evidence base for therapy is concentrated on hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women, with modest benefits and no established long-term safety beyond 24 months, which means I should be cautious about extrapolation to other symptoms or populations [^1139fjAp] [^114CZ4De] [^111oCKzH].

> I need to verify the indication precisely. The only agreed-upon, evidence-based indication is hypoactive sexual desire disorder causing personal distress in postmenopausal women after a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment excludes other causes, and I should not conflate HSDD with other female sexual dysfunctions like arousal disorder, which are distinct entities with different responses to therapy [^115TWE1i] [^114kXfbP] [^1129qTcj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosing "androgen deficiency" in women. I should confirm that there is no validated female androgen deficiency syndrome and no testosterone level that diagnoses HSDD. Endocrine guidelines explicitly recommend against diagnosing androgen deficiency in healthy women, so testosterone assays should be used only to monitor for supraphysiologic exposure during treatment, not to establish the diagnosis itself [^113SL5ry] [^112tcLts] [^114kXfbP].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. Let me think about ruling out biopsychosocial contributors first: medications, mood disorders, relationship factors, and medical comorbidities must be addressed before considering testosterone, and the diagnosis of HSDD should follow accepted criteria and a careful clinical assessment rather than any biochemical threshold [^114kXfbP] [^115F2VAL].

> I will now examine formulations and dosing. Non-oral transdermal therapy is preferred because oral testosterone adversely affects lipids, and physiologic female dosing typically uses one-tenth of male gel doses to target premenopausal female ranges. For example, approximately 0.5–5 mg transdermal testosterone daily achieves levels around 1–3 nmol/L, which aligns with the female physiologic window and avoids supraphysiologic exposure [^1151dCLj] [^1116eGKM] [^111gK2zf].

> Wait, let me verify the monitoring cadence and targets. Baseline total testosterone should be measured with a high-quality assay, then rechecked 3–6 weeks after initiation to ensure levels remain within the female physiologic range, with periodic checks every 6 months and vigilant assessment for acne, hirsutism, alopecia, and voice change; if there is no meaningful response by 6 months, I should discontinue and reassess the diagnosis and contributing factors [^113VmVCj] [^114kXfbP] [^1113uMbp].

> I should double-check safety signals and contraindications. Short-term physiologic-dose therapy shows no increase in serious adverse events in RCTs, but androgenic side effects like acne and mild hirsutism can occur. Oral formulations worsen lipids, and long-term cardiovascular and breast safety remain uncertain because trials excluded high-risk women and were limited in duration, so shared decision-making and the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration are prudent [^114CZ4De] [^1151dCLj] [^111oCKzH].

> Let me consider special populations carefully. In premenopausal women, evidence is insufficient to recommend testosterone for HSDD, and guidelines advise against routine use. In women with premature ovarian insufficiency, expert guidance allows consideration of testosterone for distressing low desire after other causes are excluded, with counseling that long-term safety is unknown. In women with high cardiometabolic risk, data are lacking because such patients were excluded from trials, so I should individualize decisions and monitor closely if therapy is pursued [^111gK2zf] [^116WEn5R] [^1151dCLj].

> But wait, what about other potential benefits like bone, cognition, or well-being. I need to ensure I do not overstate these. High-quality evidence does not support testosterone to improve bone mineral density, cognition, or general well-being in postmenopausal women, so these are not appropriate indications outside of research settings [^111WHfat] [^114CZ4De].

> I should confirm assay considerations because mismeasurement can mislead therapy. Direct immunoassays are unreliable in the female range; liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry is preferred for accuracy, and even then, interpretation must be contextualized because circulating levels do not fully reflect intracrine tissue activity relevant to sexual function [^114kXfbP] [^116BGQd1].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical algorithm. First, confirm distressing low desire with a structured biopsychosocial assessment and exclude alternative causes. Second, counsel on off-label status, uncertain long-term safety, and expected modest benefits. Third, obtain a baseline total testosterone with a high-quality assay. Fourth, initiate low-dose transdermal therapy aiming for female physiologic levels. Fifth, reassess at 3–6 weeks with levels and symptom response. Sixth, continue only if there is meaningful benefit, with ongoing monitoring for efficacy and androgen excess, and discontinue by 6 months if ineffective [^114kXfbP] [^1113uMbp] [^115F2VAL].

> Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of benefit to set expectations. Meta-analytic data show an average increase of about one satisfying sexual event per month and modest improvements across desire, arousal, orgasm, pleasure, and distress, which is clinically meaningful for some but not all patients, reinforcing the need for shared decision-making and careful selection [^114CZ4De] [^111gK2zf].

> Finally, I need to ensure I highlight uncertainties and future directions. Long-term safety beyond 24 months is unknown, there are no FDA-approved female formulations in the United States, and ongoing research may clarify roles in cognition, musculoskeletal health, and broader sexual health phenotypes. Until then, conservative, guideline-concordant use with transparent counseling is the safest course [^111oCKzH] [^114Ubjs8] [^115TWE1i].

Testosterone therapy is appropriate for **postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD)** [^112SLFvX] after a thorough biopsychosocial assessment and exclusion of other causes [^114Ubjs8]. It is not indicated for premenopausal women [^111gK2zf], and **long-term safety data are limited** [^114CZ4De]; therefore, therapy should be individualized, with close monitoring for androgen excess and adverse effects [^113VmVCj]. Transdermal formulations at physiologic doses are preferred [^1129onmS], and treatment should be discontinued if there is no response within 6 months [^1113uMbp].

## Physiological role of testosterone in females

Testosterone is produced by the ovaries and adrenal glands [^117WPFGD] and plays a key role in female sexual function, mood, bone health, and muscle mass [^notfound]. Female testosterone levels are about one-tenth of male levels [^111XZSdT] and decline with age, particularly after menopause [^notfound].

---

## Indications for testosterone therapy in females

The **primary indication** for testosterone therapy in females is HSDD in postmenopausal women [^115TWE1i], characterized by low sexual desire causing significant distress [^1129onmS]. Evidence does not support use for other symptoms, such as fatigue, mood, cognition, or bone health [^111WHfat].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several professional organizations provide **guidelines** on testosterone therapy in females:

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Global Consensus Position Statement | - Only evidence-based indication is HSDD in postmenopausal women [^115TWE1i] <br/> - Emphasizes thorough assessment and exclusion of other causes [^115TWE1i] |
| International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health (ISSWSH) | - Recommends testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women with HSDD after comprehensive assessment [^114Ubjs8] <br/> - Highlights need for ongoing monitoring [^114Ubjs8] |
| American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) | - Recommends short-term transdermal testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women with sexual interest/arousal disorders after counseling [^1113uMbp] <br/> - Advises baseline and follow-up testosterone measurements [^1113uMbp] |

---

## Benefits of testosterone therapy

Clinical trials show **modest improvements** in sexual function, including increased desire, arousal, orgasmic function, and satisfaction [^114CZ4De]. Benefits are typically seen within 3–6 months [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Testosterone therapy in females is **generally well tolerated** at physiologic doses, but potential risks include:

- **Androgenic effects**: Acne, hirsutism, hair loss, voice deepening [^1119fXWz].
- **Cardiovascular risks**: Uncertain; short-term studies show no significant increase, but long-term data are limited [^1151dCLj].
- **Breast cancer risk**: No clear evidence of increased risk in short-term studies, but long-term data are lacking [^111oCKzH].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is **essential** to ensure safety and efficacy:

- **Baseline assessment**: Total testosterone level before initiation [^113VmVCj].
- **Follow-up monitoring**: Testosterone levels checked 3–6 weeks after initiation, then every 6 months [^1113uMbp].
- **Clinical assessment**: Monitor for androgen excess and adverse effects [^1129onmS].
- **Discontinuation**: Stop therapy if no response within 6 months [^1113uMbp].

---

## Contraindications

Testosterone therapy is **contraindicated** in women with:

- Breast or uterine cancer [^1129onmS]
- Cardiovascular or liver disease [^1129onmS]
- Pregnancy or breastfeeding [^notfound]

---

## Current research and future directions

Research is ongoing to clarify **long-term safety**, optimal dosing, and broader indications [^115TWE1i]. Development of female-specific formulations and standardized assays is needed [^115ezocS].

---

Testosterone therapy is effective for **postmenopausal women with HSDD** [^114CZ4De], with modest benefits and generally acceptable short-term safety [^111oCKzH]. Long-term safety remains uncertain; therefore, therapy should be individualized with careful monitoring [^114Ubjs8].

### Testosterone for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [^1174dHYa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although there is no androgen deficiency diagnosis for women, research demonstrates that testosterone treatment can be modestly beneficial in treating appropriately selected postmenopausal women with distressing low desire, also known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Current data do not support the role of testosterone treatment in supporting bone health or brain health or improving energy or cognition in women, and only limited research supports its benefit for HSDD treatment in women of late reproductive age. No current U.S. Federal Drug Administration-approved formulation of testosterone is available for women in the United States because of a lack of long-term safety data. However, two clinical guidelines now provide expert guidance on testosterone treatment and monitoring in women for HSDD. This narrative review presents the data and summarizes the guidelines in a clinically relevant format to make the information accessible to clinicians treating cisgender women with HSDD seeking testosterone treatment.

### Association of testosterone levels and future suicide attempts in females with bipolar disorder [^1128fdpS]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Considerable evidence suggests that testosterone may play a role in the pathophysiology of mood disorders in females. This is the first prospective study to examine whether blood testosterone levels predict suicide attempts in females with bipolar disorder.

Methods

Females with a DSM-IV diagnosis of a bipolar disorder in a depressive or mixed episode with at least one past suicide attempt were enrolled. Demographic and clinical parameters were assessed and recorded. Plasma testosterone was assayed using a double antibody radioimmunoassay procedure. Patients were followed up prospectively for up to 2.5 years.

Results

At baseline, testosterone levels positively correlated with the number of previous major depressive episodes and suicide attempts. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis found that higher baseline testosterone levels predicted suicide attempts during the follow-up period.

Limitations

A limitation of the study is that the sample size is modest. Another limitation is that we did not have a bipolar nonattempter or healthy volunteer control group for comparison.

Conclusion

Testosterone levels may predict suicidal behavior in women with bipolar disorder.

Regarding medical management for female sexual dysfunction, more specifically with respect to management of sexual arousal disorder, testosterone, ACOG 2019 guidelines recommend to offer a 3–6-month trial of transdermal testosterone therapy in postmenopausal patients with sexual interest and arousal disorders. Obtain testosterone levels at baseline and reassess after 3–6 weeks of initial use to ensure levels remain within the normal range for reproductive-aged patients. Discontinue transdermal testosterone therapy at 6 months in patients who do not show a response. Obtain follow-up clinical evaluation if ongoing therapy is pursued and obtain testosterone measurement every 6 months to assess for androgen excess. Recognize that the long-term safety and efficacy of transdermal testosterone have not been studied.

### Testosterone therapy in women: its role in the management of hypoactive sexual desire disorder [^1119fXWz]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2007). Low credibility.

Disorders of sexual dysfunction occur in nearly half of women during their life, and hypoactive sexual desire disorder accounts for most of those complaints. Although the relationship between low endogenous testosterone levels and sexual desire disorders in women has not been empirically established, clinical trials have shown that exogenous testosterone therapy improves arousability, sexual desire and fantasy, frequency of sexual activity and orgasm, and satisfaction and pleasure from the sexual act. Its therapeutic role in bone mineral density, fatigue, well-being and hot flashes requires more study before specific recommendations can be made. Potential adverse effects of testosterone therapy include hirsutism, acne and deepening of the voice along with changes in lipid profiles. While less well understood, concern after increased risks for breast cancer and cardiovascular events has been raised about this therapy. Testosterone therapy is available in various formulations; the most commonly used are oral and transdermal, including patches, gels, creams and ointments.

Conclusions

Appropriately prescribed testosterone is undoubtedly beneficial. However, caution needs to be exercised to ensure that the associated health benefits of testosterone therapy outweigh the potential increased risk of cardiovascular-related events, particularly in older men where cardiovascular disease is common.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^116qhvvx]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Key points — Biological sex is a determinant of athletic performance; adult males are faster, stronger, and more powerful than females, and the fastest and most powerful males outperform the fastest and most powerful females. The sex difference in athletic performance where endurance or muscular power is required is ~ 10%–30%, and women's improvement has exceeded men's over the last 100 yr. Exposure to high levels of endogenous testosterone at the onset of male puberty (~ 12 yr) is identified as the primary determinant of the large sex difference during puberty and adulthood, whereas before puberty the sex difference is minimal. Testosterone increases ~ 20–30-fold in males during puberty and is 15× higher than adult females, and testosterone addition in females increases muscle mass, muscle fiber size, hemoglobin concentration and mass, strength, and endurance performance.

Testosterone and aggression — although the link between testosterone and aggression in animals is known, the relationship is less clear in humans; a recent meta-analysis reported a positive relationship between endogenous testosterone and aggressive behavior, but baseline testosterone and changes in serum testosterone showed a weak, although significant association with aggression in men but not in women, and results from exogenous testosterone administration in both males and females did not provide compelling evidence for a causal role of testosterone in promoting aggression.

### Testosterone: a hormone preventing cardiovascular disease or a therapy increasing cardiovascular events? [^112WY3H2]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Decreasing testosterone levels with ageing is a well-known condition in older men named 'low T', 'manopause', or hypogonadism. Observational studies suggested an association between low endogenous testosterone levels and a high cardio-metabolic profile (increased blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, thrombosis), as well as a modest increase in total and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Controversies persist regarding the need for screening 'low T' in older men, as well as what precisely should be the indication(s) for testosterone replacement therapy. So far, no data have shown that normalization of testosterone levels reduce CV events. Although testosterone replacement therapy seems to have beneficial effects on male quality of life or physical condition, some data suggest serious adverse events, such as CV events. In addition, there is a lack of consensus on the threshold for treatment indication in men with non-specific symptoms or borderline levels of testosterone. Available data from clinical practice setting suggest an increase in testosterone prescription over time and possible overtreatment. In recent years, pharmaceutical companies have promoted 'low T' as a treatable disease, suggesting that testosterone replacement may help restore energy, positive mood and sexuality, and despite ageing. Currently, well-designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the impact of testosterone replacement therapy on CV clinically relevant CV outcomes within age-specific ranges to strengthen the evidence for clinical practice guidelines.

### A sex-specific dose-response curve for testosterone: could excessive testosterone limit sexual interaction in women? [^111EXbkc]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

Testosterone treatment increases sexual desire and well-being in women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder; however, many studies have shown only modest benefits limited to moderate doses. Unlike men, available data indicate women show a bell-shaped dose-response curve for testosterone, wherein a threshold dosage of testosterone leads to desirable sexual function effects, but exceeding this threshold results in a lack of further positive sexual effects or may have a negative impact. Emotional and physical side-effects of excess testosterone, including aggression and virilization, may counteract the modest benefits on sexual interaction, providing a possible explanation for a threshold dose of testosterone in women. In this commentary, we will review and critically analyze data supporting a curvilinear dose-response relationship between testosterone treatment and sexual activity in women with low libido, and also explore possible explanations for this observed relationship. Understanding optimal dosing of testosterone unique to women may bring us one step closer to overcoming regulatory barriers in treating female sexual dysfunction.

### Androgen therapy in women: a reappraisal: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1157rq8n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To update practice guidelines for the therapeutic use of androgens in women.

Participants

A Task Force appointed by the Endocrine Society, American Congress of Obestricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), European Society of Endocrinology (ESE), and International Menopause Society (IMS) consisting of six experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

Evidence

The Task Force commissioned two systematic reviews of published data and considered several other existing meta-analyses and trials. The GRADE methodology was used; the strength of a recommendation is indicated by a number "1" (strong recommendation, we recommend) or "2" (weak recommendation, we suggest).

Consensus Process

Multiple e-mail communications and conference calls determined consensus. Committees of the Endocrine Society, ASRM, ACOG, ESE, and IMS reviewed and commented on the drafts of the guidelines.

Conclusions

We continue to recommend against making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency syndrome in healthy women because there is a lack of a well-defined syndrome, and data correlating androgen levels with specific signs or symptoms are unavailable. We recommend against the general use of T for the following indications: infertility; sexual dysfunction other than hypoactive sexual desire disorder; cognitive, cardiovascular, metabolic, or bone health; or general well-being. We recommend against the routine use of dehydroepiandrosterone due to limited data concerning its effectiveness and safety in normal women or those with adrenal insufficiency. We recommend against the routine prescription of T or dehydroepiandrosterone for the treatment of women with low androgen levels due to hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, surgical menopause, pharmacological glucocorticoid administration, or other conditions associated with low androgen levels because there are limited data supporting improvement in signs and symptoms with therapy and no long-term studies of risk. Evidence supports the short-term efficacy and safety of high physiological doses of T treatment of postmenopausal women with sexual dysfunction due to hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Importantly, endogenous T levels did not predict response to therapy. At present, physiological T preparations for use in women are not available in many countries including the United States, and long-term safety data are lacking. We recommend that any woman receiving T therapy be monitored for signs and symptoms of androgen excess. We outline areas for future research. Ongoing improvement in androgen assays will allow a redefinition of normal ranges across the lifespan; this may help to clarify the impact of varying concentrations of plasma androgens on the biology, physiology, and psychology in women and lead to indications for therapeutic interventions.

### Prenatal origins of endometriosis pathology and pain: reviewing the evidence of a role for low testosterone [^1154unYz]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Androgens and Fertility in Women with Endometriosis

Optimal levels of serum and ovarian androgens, especially testosterone, play key roles in additional aspects of female reproductive development, functions and disease. Testosterone is essential for folliculogenesis, and low levels of testosterone are associated with both apoptosis of follicular granulosa cells, and reduced implantation success of embryos.

A shorter AGD, representing low androgen levels during fetal development, is directly related to a set of fertility correlates including higher risk of premature ovarian insufficiency, and poor ovarian response to controlled ovarian stimulation, consistent with roles in folliculogenesis. Moreover, by a recent meta-analysis, testosterone therapy increased IVF success in women with a poor response to ovarian stimulation. These convergent results suggest that low prenatal testosterone, with sequelae that include altered programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis during fetal development, and consequent reduced post-natal testosterone levels and higher levels of pain, results in a broad set of sexually dimorphic traits that may partially underlie the reduced fertility found in women with endometriosis (Figure 2).

Figure 2
Lower prenatal testosterone is caused by a variety of factors, and mediates a suite of effects on the development of female physical and reproductive traits, including increased risk for endometriosis.

Currently, the best-known correlates of low amniotic fluid testosterone among female fetuses are young maternal age, low weight gain during pregnancy, and low amniotic fluid cortisol; these factors together account for 64% of variation in testosterone level. However, the relationship between amniotic fluid testosterone and fetal AGD remains unknown.

Table 1
Factors that increase or decrease levels of SHBG in women.

Androgens have been demonstrated to play a role in sexual motivation in women, including but not limited to exhibiting sexual interest, initiating sexual activity, and responding to sexual stimulation. As a result, decreased testosterone levels have been hypothesized to be an important and reversible cause of HSDD. In 2019, The Global Consensus Position Statement on the Use of Testosterone Therapy for Women endorsed the use of TRT in postmenopausal women with HSDD. This recommendation has been widely accepted and endorsed by ten international societies as the best evidence-based guidance to date on TRT in women. In 2021, the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health (ISSWSH) then published the first clinical practice guidelines on the use of TRT for the treatment of HSDD in menopausal women.

The present article aims to highlight the use of TRT in the management of the postmenopausal woman experiencing symptoms of HSDD. The review begins by providing a concise definition of HSDD under the DSM-IV and the evaluation and diagnosis of HSDD. It then describes the clinical use of testosterone in the setting of HSDD, followed by exploring various testosterone formulations, and monitoring in patients who continue to be on TRT. Finally, we explore future areas of research to illustrate strengths, weakness, opportunities and downfalls of the use of testosterone to improve sexual health and function in women experiencing HSDD.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1136CcxY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^114M98fr]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Testosterone in adulthood — sex differences and performance effects — reflects that the primary cause for the large sex difference in athletic performance is exposure to high levels of endogenous testosterone in males at the onset of puberty, with circulating testosterone increasing because the testes produce ~20- to 30-fold more testosterone than before puberty and with circulating testosterone more than 15-fold of that of females at any age in adulthood; the distribution between males and females is nonoverlapping and bimodal, and in males endogenous testosterone levels produce potent anabolic effects on muscle mass and bone mass, circulating hemoglobin mass, and ultimately power and endurance-based sports performance, with advantages associated with higher testosterone providing the justification for sex-segregated sports.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^115TWE1i]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary and Key Messages

The international panel concluded the only evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy for women is for the treatment of HSDD, with available data supporting a moderate therapeutic effect. There are insufficient data to support the use of testosterone for the treatment of any other symptom or clinical condition, or for disease prevention.

Meta-analyses of the available data show no severe adverse events during physiological testosterone use, with the caveat that women at high cardiometabolic risk were excluded from study populations. The safety of long-term testosterone therapy has not been established.

It was considered of utmost importance that the diagnosis of HSDD involves a full clinical assessment and that other factors contributing to FSD must be identified and addressed before testosterone therapy is initiated. A blood total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD. Treatment should only be with formulations that achieve blood concentrations of testosterone that approximate premenopausal physiological concentrations. Because no approved female product is presently approved by a national regulatory body, male formulations can be judiciously used in female doses and blood testosterone concentrations must be monitored regularly. The panel recommended against the use of compounded testosterone.

The panel highlighted the pressing need for more research into testosterone therapy for women and the development and licensing of products indicated specifically for women.

### Testosterone in women – the clinical significance [^1139fjAp]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Testosterone is an essential hormone for women, with physiological actions mediated directly or via aromatisation to oestradiol throughout the body. Despite the crucial role of testosterone and the high circulating concentrations of this hormone relative to oestradiol in women, studies of its action and the effects of testosterone deficiency and replacement in women are scarce. The primary indication for the prescription of testosterone for women is loss of sexual desire, which causes affected women substantial concern. That no formulation has been approved for this purpose has not impeded the widespread use of testosterone by women — either off-label or as compounded therapy. Observational studies indicate that testosterone has favourable cardiovascular effects measured by surrogate outcomes; however, associations between endogenous testosterone and the risk of cardiovascular disease and total mortality, particularly in older women, are yet to be established. Adverse cardiovascular effects have not been seen in studies of transdermal testosterone therapy in women. Clinical trials suggest that exogenous testosterone enhances cognitive performance and improves musculoskeletal health in postmenopausal women. Unmet needs include the availability of approved testosterone formulations for women and studies to elucidate the contribution of testosterone to cardiovascular, cognitive, and musculoskeletal health and the risk of cancer.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^111GtxeD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Androgen excess is common in women and refers to clinical or biochemical evidence of elevated androgenic steroids such as testosterone. It is associated with underlying polycystic ovary syndrome in the majority of cases. However severe androgen excess is less common and may indicate the presence of underlying adrenal or ovarian neoplasms, genetic disorders or severe insulin resistance syndromes. Currently there are few consensus guidelines to assist clinicians with a standardised management approach to the patient with severe androgen excess.

Design

Clinical practice guideline.

Methods

This guideline has been developed with expertise from colleagues in endocrinology, gynaecology, clinical biochemistry and nursing, and furthermore provides a unique patient perspective to guide clinicians.

Results

The Society for Endocrinology commissioned this new guideline to collate multi-disciplinary guidance for clinical practitioners in the investigation of severe androgen excess. Recommendations have been made in the areas of clinical assessment, biochemical work up, dynamic testing and imaging, informed where possible by the best available evidence.

Conclusion

This guideline will provide guidance for clinicians in their approach to patients with severe androgen excess.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^115e6Qxf]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

American College of Sports Medicine consensus statement — resistance and high-intensity training adaptations in males and females reports that males and females exhibit similar relative magnitudes of hypertrophy, strength, and power gains with high-load resistance training (~6–12 wk) in young adults and adults older than 50 y, and they adapted similarly to 12 wk high-intensity interval cycling with similar muscle hypertrophy (5%) and increased fatigue resistance (4.8%); acutely, males typically display increases in testosterone after resistance exercise whereas females can but often do not, although greater total testosterone levels have been reported after 24 wk of resistance training in females.

### Genetic analyses implicate complex links between adult testosterone levels and health and disease [^111XZSdT]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Testosterone (T) is the male sex hormone responsible for regulation of development of primary and secondary male sexual characteristics. Individual variation in T levels has been suggested to shape human physiology broadly, including effects on disease risk in both men and women –. Epidemiological studies and randomized clinical trials for T replacement therapy have observed associations between serum T levels and various traits ranging from type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease to body composition and behavior –. Yet, these studies have yielded partly mixed results, and, in many instances, the proposed relationships between T, complex traits and disease remain elusive.

Besides the disease links, T is a known driver for sex differences. After puberty, men and women differ extensively with respect to their average T levels, with males showing roughly 7–15-fold higher serum total T concentrations. This difference largely results from the testicular T production in males that far exceeds the amount of T produced in the ovaries and the adrenal gland in females, and is known to directly contribute to variation in, for instance, body composition between the sexes.

### Testosterone therapy in women: a review [^111dcfL9]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2005). Low credibility.

Female sexual dysfunction is a complex problem with multiple overlapping etiologies. Androgens play an important role in healthy female sexual function, especially in stimulating sexual interest and in maintaining desire. There are a multitude of reasons why women can have low androgen levels with the most common reasons being age, oophorectomy and the use of oral estrogens. Symptoms of androgen insufficiency include absent or greatly diminished sexual motivation and/or desire, that is, libido, persistent unexplainable fatigue or lack of energy, and a lack of sense of well being. Although there is no androgen preparation that has been specifically approved by the FDA for the treatment of Women's Sexual Interest/Desire Disorder or for the treatment of androgen insufficiency in women, androgen therapy has been used off-label to treat low libido and sexual dysfunction in women for over 40 y. Most clinical trials in postmenopausal women with loss of libido have demonstrated that the addition of testosterone to estrogen significantly improved multiple facets of sexual functioning including libido and sexual desire, arousal, frequency and satisfaction. In controlled clinical trials of up to 2 y duration of testosterone therapy, women receiving androgen therapy tolerated androgen administration well and demonstrated no serious side effects. The results of these trials suggest that testosterone therapy in the low-dose regimens is efficacious for the treatment of Women's Sexual Interest and Desire Disorder in postmenopausal women who are adequately estrogenized. Based on the evidence of current studies, it is reasonable to consider testosterone therapy for a symptomatic androgen-deficient woman with Women's Sexual Interest and Desire Disorder.

### Testosterone and the androgen receptor [^113fFxds]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Testosterone is a steroid hormone that is responsible for the development of normal male sexual characteristics and function as well as the maintenance of homeostasis among multiple organ systems throughout life. Testosterone production is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis under the direction of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and luteinizing hormone. The testosterone-bound androgen receptor (AR) is a potent regulator of gene expression and may regulate a significant proportion of genes in prostate cells. Therapeutic modulation of testosterone levels and AR signaling activity can be achieved by several different approaches, with distinct consequences and side effects.

### Testosterone's role in COVID-19 [^112KJiMq]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 consistently displays a higher mortality in males. This sex-specific difference in outcomes is seen not only in the current COVID-19 pandemic, but also in prior viral epidemics and pandemics. Sex hormones, such as testosterone, play a clear role in modulating the immune response, providing a clue that may illuminate the underpinnings of these outcomes. Developing a deeper understanding of these epidemiological findings permits a more effective response to the disease. This article summarizes the sex-specific COVID-19 outcomes, the role of androgens in generating these outcomes, and the potential role of modifying testosterone levels as a form of treatment of COVID-19.

### Testosterone for midlife women: the hormone of desire? [^115hSvRm]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Testosterone declines with aging, so most midlife women have "low" testosterone levels. Because libido also declines with aging, and distressing sexual problems peak at midlife, should midlife women with low libido and associated distress be treated with testosterone? This Practice Pearl reports clinical trial evidence, reviews the risks, and explains how testosterone might be used in a clinical setting. For women who may be considering a trial of testosterone therapy, limitations and adverse effects should be disclosed and appropriate monitoring instituted once treatment has begun.

### Androgen therapy in women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112436tD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines for the therapeutic use of androgens in women.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) of The Endocrine Society, six additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

The Task Force used systematic reviews of available evidence to inform its key recommendations. The Task Force used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of recommendation and the quality of evidence, using the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) group. The strength of a recommendation is indicated by the number 1 (strong recommendation, associated with the phrase "we recommend") or 2 (weak recommendation, associated with the phrase "we suggest"). The quality of the evidence is indicated by cross-filled circles, such that [1 cross-filled circle, 3 empty circles] denotes very-low-quality evidence, [2 cross-filled circles, 2 empty circles] low quality, [3 cross-filled circles, 1 empty circle] moderate quality, and [4 cross-filled circles] high quality. Each recommendation is followed by a description of the evidence.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during one group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications. The drafts prepared by the task force with the help of a medical writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's CGS, Clinical Affairs Committee (CAC), and Executive Committee. The version approved by the CGS and CAC was placed on The Endocrine Society's web site for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

We recommend against making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency in women at present because of the lack of a well-defined clinical syndrome and normative data on total or free testosterone levels across the lifespan that can be used to define the disorder. Although there is evidence for short-term efficacy of testosterone in selected populations, such as surgically menopausal women, we recommend against the generalized use of testosterone by women because the indications are inadequate and evidence of safety in long-term studies is lacking. A review of the data currently available is presented, and areas of future research are outlined. To formulate clinical guidelines for use of testosterone in women, additional information will be necessary. This includes defining conditions that, when not treated with androgens, have adverse health consequences to women; defining clinical and laboratory parameters that distinguish those with these conditions; and assessing the efficacy and long-term safety of androgen administration on outcomes that are important to women diagnosed with these conditions. This necessary clinical research cannot occur until the biological, physiological, and psychological underpinnings of the role of androgens in women and candidate disorders are further elucidated.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^1151dCLj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

(7) Recommendations regarding possible androgenic side effects of testosterone therapy Systemic testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, is associated with mild increases in acne and body/facial hair growth in some women, but not with alopecia, clitoromegaly, or voice change (Level I, Grade A).

(8) Recommendations regarding testosterone therapy and cardiovascular health Oral testosterone therapy is associated with adverse lipid profiles with negative effects on high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, and is not recommended (Level I, Grade A). Studies of nonoral testosterone therapies (percutaneous and injectable), in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, have shown no statistically significant adverse effects on lipid profiles over the short term (Level I, Grade A). Testosterone therapy has not been associated with increases in blood pressure, blood glucose, or HbA1c levels (Level I, Grade A). A nonsignificant trend for an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis has been seen with testosterone therapy; however, the role of concurrent estrogen therapy in possible venous thrombosis risk cannot be excluded (Level I, Grade A). Limited data preclude assessment of the effects of testosterone therapy on myocardial infarction or death (Insufficient data). RCTs of testosterone therapy have excluded women at high cardiometabolic disease risk; most have included women taking concurrent estrogen therapy, and all have been of relatively short duration. Therefore, recommendations regarding the effect of physiologic doses of testosterone in postmenopausal women on cardiovascular health are not generalizable to a more "at-risk" population or to long-term therapy.

### Androgens and female sexual function and dysfunction – findings from the fourth international consultation of sexual medicine [^1129qTcj]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Androgens have been implicated as important for female sexual function and dysfunction.

Aim

To review the role of androgens in the physiology and pathophysiology of female sexual functioning and the evidence for efficacy of androgen therapy for female sexual dysfunction (FSD).

Methods

We searched the literature using online databases for studies pertaining to androgens and female sexual function. Major reviews were included and their findings were summarized to avoid replicating their content.

Main Outcome Measures

Quality of data published in the literature and recommendations were based on the GRADES system.

Results

The literature supports an important role for androgens in female sexual function. There is no blood androgen level below which women can be classified as having androgen deficiency. Clinical trials have consistently demonstrated that transdermal testosterone (T) therapy improves sexual function and sexual satisfaction in women who have been assessed as having hypoactive sexual desire disorder. The use of T therapy is limited by the lack of approved formulations for women and long-term safety data. Most studies do not support the use of systemic dehydroepiandrosterone therapy for the treatment of FSD in women with normally functioning adrenals or adrenal insufficiency. Studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of vaginal testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy are ongoing.

Conclusion

Available data support an important role of androgens in female sexual function and dysfunction and efficacy of transdermal T therapy for the treatment of some women with FSD. Approved T formulations for women are generally unavailable. In consequence, the prescribing of T mostly involves off-label use of T products formulated for men and individually compounded T formulations. Long-term studies to determine the safety of T therapy for women and possible benefits beyond that of sexual function are greatly needed.

### Testosterone target therapy: focus on immune response, controversies and clinical implications in patients with COVID-19 infection [^114yuwqk]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The global COVID-19 pandemic is causing a health emergency throughout the world. From the beginning of the pandemic, clinical studies have shown that the main risk factors for mortality from COVID-19 are older age, male sex and comorbidity. Given that male sex and older age are significant risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19, investigators have hypothesized that the hormonal milieu may play an important role both in the susceptibility to infection and in the severity of the clinical course. Differences between the male and female in immune responses are well known. The two most important factors accounting for the sex bias in immunity are genetics and sex hormones. In this short review, we analyzed the role of testosterone on the immune response and hypothesized possible mechanisms to explain the high incidence of COVID-19 infection and a worse clinical course in elderly male patients. Moreover, given the conflicting findings on the role of testosterone from clinical and epidemiological studies in patients with COVID-19 infection, we tried to propose a model to explain these reports.

### Testosterone regulates cell proliferation in aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumour) [^114sH8j8]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

As both oestrogen and testosterone have roles in modulating cell behaviour in aggressive fibromatosis, it is possible that sex steroid hormone modulation can be used to treat this tumour type. The effective use of oestrogen blockade has been reported in this tumour type, but not all tumours are responsive. A poor outcome with oestrogen blockade in some aggressive fibromatosis tumours could be related to the role of testosterone in this tumour type. It may be that effective therapy based on sex steroid hormone modulation requires blockade of both oestrogen and testosterone. This is an area for future investigation.

The oestrogen receptors responsiveness in aggressive fibromatosis tumours has been thought to be responsible for a predominance of this tumour type in females. However, although some studies suggest a female predominance of this tumour type, others do not. We found a similar rate in both males and females at our centre. In addition, studies reporting on larger number of cases reporting a female predominance show only a relatively mild if any effect of gender. Thus, oestrogen responsiveness of tumour cells is unlikely to result in an overwhelming female predominance to the development of aggressive fibromatosis. This clinical information, in concert with experimental data suggest that sex steroid hormones primarily has a predominant role regulating tumour cell proliferation, rather than in the initiation of tumour development. This concept is supported by our finding that both female and male mice develop tumours. The higher level of expression of the androgen receptor in tumours from male patients and the greater responsiveness to testosterone in tumours from men suggests that the larger size of tumours in male mice is related to this responsiveness. Despite this difference, both tumours from men and women express the androgen receptor, and exhibit a proliferative rate that is responsive to testosterone. Although the mice that develop aggressive fibromatosis tumours are models for the human disease they do not necessarily recapitulate every facet of the disease. The more severe phenotype in male mice than female mice does not seem to be present in human tumours. Despite this, the Apc1638N mouse remains a useful animal in which to study signalling pathways involved in this tumour type in vivo, but these differences highlight the importance of verifying the findings in tissue or cell cultures from patients.

### The role of hormone therapy in female aesthetic rejuvenation [^113b8gQG]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hormones are intricately involved in age-related aesthetic changes. Declining levels of several hormones in the postmenopausal period are associated with unwanted changes in appearance, including weight gain, fat redistribution, aged skin, and hair thinning. Hormone therapies may prevent or reverse these changes. In this article, we explore the role of estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and melatonin in female aesthetics. Based on our current understanding of the literature, dermatologists may safely and efficaciously incorporate several hormone formulations in their repertoire of treatments for female aesthetic rejuvenation. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(9):954–960. doi:10.36849/JDD.6232.

### Female androgen insufficiency: the princeton consensus statement on definition, classification, and assessment [^115Xs4SE]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the evidence for and against androgen insufficiency as a cause of sexual and other health-related problems in women and to make recommendations regarding definition, diagnosis, and assessment of androgen deficiency states in women.

Design

Evaluation of peer-review literature and consensus conference of international experts.

Setting

Multinational conference in the United States.

Patient(S)

Premenopausal and postmenopausal women with androgen deficiency.

Intervention(S)

Evaluation of peer-review literature and development of consensus panel guidelines.

Result(S)

The term "female androgen insufficiency" was defined as consisting of a pattern of clinical symptoms in the presence of decreased bioavailable T and normal estrogen status. Currently available assays were found to be lacking in sensitivity and reliability at the lower ranges, and the need for an equilibrium dialysis measure was strongly emphasized. Causes of androgen insufficiency in women were classified as ovarian, adrenal, hypothalamic-pituitary, drug-related, and idiopathic. A simplified management algorithm and clinical guidelines were proposed to assist clinicians in diagnosis and assessment. Androgen replacement is currently available in several forms, although none has been approved for treatment of sexual dysfunction or other common symptoms of female androgen insufficiency. Potential risks associated with treatment were identified, and the need for informed consent and careful monitoring was noted. Finally, the panel identified key goals and priorities for future research.

Conclusion(S)

A new definition of androgen insufficiency in women has been proposed along with consensus-based guidelines for clinical assessment and diagnosis. A simplified management algorithm for women with low androgen in the presence of clinical symptoms and normal estrogen status has also been proposed.

### Evidence-based guideline: premature ovarian insufficiency [^116WEn5R]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). High credibility.

Premature ovarian insufficiency — role of testosterone therapy: Testosterone treatment should be considered in women with iatrogenic POI to manage hypoactive sexual desire disorder when other biopsychosocial aetiologies are excluded. Testosterone treatment could be considered in women with non-iatrogenic POI to manage hypoactive sexual desire disorder when other biopsychosocial aetiologies are excluded. HCPs should be aware that although short term treatment with transdermal testosterone at doses approximating physiological premenopausal levels is safe, longer term safety data are lacking. The guideline group recommends that women with POI are informed that there are limited data for androgen treatment for indications other than hypoactive sexual desire disorder, and that long-term health effects are unknown.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^112rVxjX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Cardiovascular impact of androgen deprivation therapy: from basic biology to clinical practice [^1134E6Fp]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

The Role of Androgens in the Cardiovascular System

The role of androgens in the CV system has been actively studied throughout the past few decades. Historically, testosterone, the main form of androgens, was believed to increase the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD); men were found to be twice as likely as women to experience CVD. However, this sex discrepancy becomes insignificant when women undergo menopause, and it is now largely accepted that the sex discrepancy is largely driven by the cardioprotective role of estrogen during pre-menopause. Nevertheless, the cardiovascular effects of testosterone remain rather controversial. Some retrospective studies show that men receiving supplemental testosterone have a higher risk of CV events, suggesting that excessive testosterone may indeed accelerate CVD. However, deficient or low endogenous testosterone has also been associated with increased risk of CVD with an unfavorable metabolic profile and negative cardiovascular impact, indicating complex and potentially bimodal effects of testosterone in the cardiovascular system. Therefore, in this section, we will systematically review the current evidence highlighting the effects of testosterone on CV health.

### Which postmenopausal women should use testosterone for low sexual desire? [^1116eGKM]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Sarah uses kitchen measuring spoons to dispense just the right dose — between a pinch and a smidge — of testosterone gel formulated for men to treat her low sexual desire. "This is an absurd way for women to get testosterone therapy, " acknowledged 58-year-old Sarah's physician, Sharon Parish, MD, a professor of clinical medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. But with no female-tailored testosterone product on the market, it's a necessary workaround. Parish and an international group of researchers recently published a position statement on female testosterone therapy. In line with these first global recommendations, Parish advises some of her postmenopausal patients with low libido like Sarah to use one-tenth of a male dose to approximate their premenopausal testosterone levels.

GRADE recommendation strength — classification and application: Recommendations according to the GRADE framework are "either strong (GRADE 1) or weak (GRADE 2)". Strong recommendations are those that "should be applied consistently to most patients", while weak recommendations are "conditional recommendations that may not apply to all patients; variation in implementing these recommendations is acceptable". Strong recommendations are "typically reserved for situations when the confidence in the estimates is moderate or high", with an exception when low-quality evidence supports concern about cost or harm such that developers "recommend against using the intervention". In this guideline, the Task Force "recommended against using androgens in settings with unproven benefit (low-quality evidence) and concern about harm and cost (recommendations 1.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3)", and notes that "patient values, preferences, and context, should play a major role in determining how and when to apply them".

### Testosterone in female hypoactive sexual desire disorder… [^116JAggu]. ClinicalTrials (2005). Low credibility.

A recent study has shown that transdermal continuous patch testosterone dose 150micro g or 300micro g vs. placebo daily during the 12 week study improved sexual health including desire, arousal, and orgasm frequency in women with surgically induced menopause after oophorectomy. Blood levels reached 3. 0nmoles/L. Shrifren et al found no significant side effects with transdermal sustained testosterone treatment. Another study looked at transdermal testosterone given in gel, 10mg a day given for 12 weeks in a double-blind design for 31 pre-menopausal women with a mean age of 40 years. The women entered the study presenting with low sexual desire. Testosterone treatment resulted in a significant improvement in psychological general well being and sexual self rating scale. No adverse effects were reported. Blood levels of testosterone increase about 2. 5 times baseline to
2. 6nmoles/L.

Recently Tuiten et al studied normal volunteer women with vaginal flow measures using photoplethysmography in addition to questionnaire data on sexual arousal after exposure to erotic movies with pre treatment of sublingual testosterone vs. placebo in a single dose sublingually of 0. 5mg. Testosterone significantly enhanced vaginal blood flow response to the erotic movies and also the subjective sexual interest, desire and arousal to the movies. Slight local skin irritation or dryness of skin. However, as stated before, these side effects are unlikely using prn treatment. Dose: The recent study of Shifren et al used continuous transdermal patch and reached blood levels of 3. 0nmoles/L in post-menopausal women, with no side effects over 12 weeks. Goldstat et al looked at transdermal gel 10mg, which is applied daily but washes off as the day wears on, for 12 weeks with no side effects in pre-menopausal women. They reached blood levels of 2. 6nmoles/L. Tuiten et al used sublingual one time dose of 0. 5mg, reaching a peak blood level of 25nmoles/L at 10 minutes which returned to baseline within 90 minutes.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^111oCKzH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

(9) Recommendations regarding testosterone therapy and breast health Testosterone therapy does not increase mammographic breast density (Level I, Grade A). Available data suggest that short-term transdermal testosterone therapy does not impact breast cancer risk (Level I, Grade A). Data from RCTs are insufficient to assess long-term breast cancer risk (Insufficient data). There are no data to support the use of testosterone therapy to prevent breast cancer (Insufficient data). Women with a prior diagnosis of breast cancer were excluded from the randomized trials for HSDD. Caution is recommended for testosterone use in women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer (Expert Opinion).

(10) Recommendations regarding testosterone therapy and serious adverse events Testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, is not associated with serious adverse events (Level I, Grade A). Because RCTs of testosterone therapy have excluded women at high cardiometabolic disease risk, and most have included women taking concurrent estrogen therapy, recommendation 10(a) is not generalizable to a more "at-risk" population (Expert Opinion). Safety data for testosterone in physiologic doses are not available beyond 24 months of treatment (Level I, Grade A).order

(3) Recommendations pertaining to the associations between endogenous androgen concentrations and female sexual function The associations between endogenous androgen concentrations and sexual function in women remain uncertain because of issues relating to the sensitivity and specificity of androgen assays in some studies and insufficient data (Insufficient). The physiology of androgens is complex because of their conversion in tissues and possible intracrine metabolism in multiple tissues (Insufficient). No cutoff blood level can be used for any measured circulating androgen to differentiate women with and without sexual dysfunction (Grade C).

II. Recommendations regarding systemic testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, based on findings from meta-analyses of placebo/comparator-controlled RCTs

There are insufficient data to make any recommendations regarding the use of testosterone in premenopausal women for treatment of sexual function or any other outcome (Insufficient).
(4) Recommendations regarding testosterone treatment of naturally or surgically postmenopausal women with HSDD, with/or without concurrent estrogen therapy Testosterone therapy, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, exerts a beneficial effect on sexual function including increases, above the effects of placebo/comparator therapy, of an average of one satisfying sexual event per month, and increases in the subdomains of sexual desire, arousal, orgasmic function, pleasure, and sexual responsiveness, together with a reduction in sexual concerns including sexual distress (Level I, Grade A). Because the majority of studies reporting on sexual function recruited women assessed as having HSDD or generalized FSD, these recommendations cannot be generalized to other subtypes of FSD or women without sexual dysfunction (Expert Opinion). The recommendations of 4(a) do not apply to injectables, pellets, or formulations that result in supraphysiological blood concentrations of testosterone, or compounded preparations (Expert Opinion).

### Use of testosterone in postmenopausal women [^111czeX3]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The role of testosterone in women and its potential as a therapeutic agent continue to attract controversy. The clinical trials of testosterone therapy for women primarily have focused on treatment of female sexual dysfunction, with the largest placebo-controlled studies being of transdermal testosterone in postmenopausal women. Based on the cumulative data from these studies, loss of sexual desire with associated personal distress currently is the only agreed-on indication for judicious testosterone supplementation for postmenopausal women. This article reviews the physiology of testosterone in women, summarizes the findings from observational studies and clinical trials, and considers indications for testosterone use.

### Translational perspective on the role of testosterone in sexual function and dysfunction [^116t2oig]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The biological importance of testosterone is generally accepted by the medical community; however, controversy focuses on its relevance to sexual function and the sexual response, and our understanding of the extent of its role in this area is evolving.

Aim

To provide scientific evidence examining the role of testosterone at the cellular and molecular levels as it pertains to normal erectile physiology and the development of erectile dysfunction and to assist in guiding successful therapeutic interventions for androgen-dependent sexual dysfunction.

Methods

In this White Paper, the Basic Science Committee of the Sexual Medicine Society of North America assessed the current basic science literature examining the role of testosterone in sexual function and dysfunction.

Results

Testosterone plays an important role in sexual function through multiple processes: physiologic (stimulates activity of nitric oxide synthase), developmental (establishes and maintains the structural and functional integrity of the penis), neural (development, maintenance, function, and plasticity of the cavernous nerve and pelvic ganglia), therapeutically for dysfunctional regulation (beneficial effect on aging, diabetes, and prostatectomy), and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibition (testosterone supplement to counteract phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor resistance).

Conclusion

Despite controversies concerning testosterone with regard to sexual function, basic science studies provide incontrovertible evidence for a significant role of testosterone in sexual function and suggest that properly administered testosterone therapy is potentially advantageous for treating male sexual dysfunction.

### Men, testosterone and COVID-19 [^116N6ASD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Men have more severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outcomes and higher mortality rates than women, and it was suggested that testosterone levels might promote severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and Covid-19 severity. However, clinical studies have not supported this theory. Studies have consistently shown that serum testosterone concentrations during acute Covid-19 in men are inversely proportional to the inflammatory cytokines and severity of illness. It is likely that lower testosterone concentrations in this setting are a result of acute Covid-19 illness on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. Clinical trials that attempted to lower testosterone concentrations further or block androgen signaling acutely during Covid-19 in men did not result in improved Covid-19 outcomes. Additionally, pre-existing male hypogonadism, diagnosed before Covid-19 pandemic, was found to be a risk factor for hospitalization from Covid-19. In this review, we also discuss the preclinical and mechanistic studies that have evaluated the role of androgens in SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness. Finally, long-term consequences of Covid-19 on male reproductive health are reviewed. SARS-CoV-2 virus is known to infiltrate testis and induce orchitis in men, but it is unclear if Covid-19 leads to an increase in incidence of male hypogonadism.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^116BaJin]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

American College of Sports Medicine consensus — additional future research priorities address life stages and transgender athlete adaptations, including the short- and long-term consequences of pregnancy, childbirth, and childrearing on the female athlete body and performance; how aging and its hormonal consequences during and after menopause can change the sex-related difference in response to acute exercise, exercise training, and athletic performance; the trajectory of performance changes in transgender athletes and the physiological and anatomical mechanisms involved; and the effects and role of muscle memory on retention of strength, power, and endurance in transgender athletes who have been have previously been exposed to high levels of testosterone. The document notes knowledge gaps due to the potent effects of testosterone, highlights areas for opportunity and future directions, and observes that many acute exercise and training studies are conducted on men with an assumption of similarity to women. It also states this article is an official pronouncement of the American College of Sports Medicine.

### The effect of statins on testosterone in men and women, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111w2aSg]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis shows that statins reduce testosterone. This finding does not demonstrate that androgens mediate any health effect of statins, but raises the question as to whether testosterone modulation plays a role in statins' effects on health, particularly among men where testosterone is an important hormone. Whether reducing testosterone enhances or impairs the protective effects of statins on cardiovascular mortality needs to be determined urgently, because it could enable the development of enhanced statin based treatments, the development of other drugs in the same class and the identification of potentially modifiable population-wide risk factors for several non-communicable chronic diseases.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^113rpqey]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Sex differences in athletic performance — scope and definitions: The primary goal is to provide updated scientific knowledge for the sex-based differences in athletic performance and it highlights: the magnitude of sex differences across athletic pursuits; the differences in anatomy and physiology between males and females that determine responses to acute exercise, exercise training, and athletic performance across the life span; the role of sex steroid hormones (particularly testosterone and estrogen) and their effects on physiology and adaptability to training; models that provide insight into the role of sex steroid hormones including addition and suppression; and gaps in the knowledgebase and strategies to fill these gaps. For terminology, the statement defines sex and gender according to the US National Institutes of Health, with sex referring to biological differences between females and males (including chromosomes, sex organs, and endogenous sex hormone profiles) and gender referring to socially constructed and enacted roles and behaviors that vary by historical and cultural context over time.

### Testosterone, SHBG and cardiovascular health in postmenopausal women [^116LLm7m]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects men and women differently with women having a lower incidence and later onset of disease. Research has recently refocused interest on the cardiovascular role of androgens. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence available on the association between testosterone and cardiovascular health in postmenopausal women. Published studies relating testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) to CVD and its risk factors were reviewed. Studies included in this review suggest that increased androgenicity, characterized by high testosterone and low SHBG levels, is associated with an adverse CVD risk factor profile in postmenopausal women. However, evidence for an association with cardiovascular events is lacking and it is uncertain whether the observed associations with endogenous testosterone have clinical implications regarding the use of postmenopausal testosterone therapy. Large-scale, longitudinal studies relating testosterone and SHBG levels to cardiovascular risk factors and endpoints are needed to determine the temporal relationship between androgenicity and cardiovascular risk and to ascertain the long-term efficacy and safety of testosterone therapy in postmenopausal women.

### Estrogens in men: clinical implications for sexual function and the treatment of testosterone deficiency [^1148jN45]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The role of estrogens in male sexual function and the pathogenesis of testosterone deficiency remain controversial and poorly understood.

Aims

To review the distribution of estrogens in normal and testosterone deficient men, their potential role in sexual function, and the clinical implications of elevated estrogens during testosterone therapy.

Methods

A comprehensive, broad-based literature review was conducted on the role of estrogens in male sexual function and testosterone deficiency.

Results

Estrogens elicit a variety of physiological responses in men and may contribute to modulation of sexual function. In the absence of testosterone deficiency, elevations in estrogens do not appear to be harmful and estrogens may help maintain some, but not all, sexual function in castrated men. While the therapeutic use of estrogens at pharmacologic doses has been used to suppress serum testosterone, naturally occurring elevations of estrogens do not appear to be a cause of low testosterone. During testosterone replacement, estrogens may rise and occasionally reach elevated levels. There is a lack of evidence that treatment of elevated estrogen levels during testosterone replacement has benefit in terms of male sexuality.

Conclusion

Further research on the importance of estrogens in male sexual function is needed. Current evidence does not support a role of naturally occurring estrogen elevations in testosterone deficiency or the treatment of elevated estrogens during testosterone therapy.

### Androgen therapy in women: a reappraisal: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1111eSuc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Testosterone levels with aging — total and free testosterone (T) decline progressively with reproductive aging, and most prospective studies have not shown significant changes in T across menopause; only one longitudinal study noted a small but significant decrease. In cross-sectional data of 985 women ages 20–80 years, the median T value decreased in menopause but the range and overlap with menstruating women were substantial, with age best correlated with change in T level. Circulating T levels do not distinguish women in their late reproductive years from naturally postmenopausal women in the first decade after menopause.

Methods

This guideline was developed with the administrative support of the ISSWSH and the contributions from a multidisciplinary panel of international experts. The panel, consisting of 16 researchers and clinicians, who were the ISSWSH members and nonmembers, convened to review and discuss clinical management strategies for the use of testosterone using a modified Delphi method. In preparation, the panelists conducted an evidence-based literature review that included original research, meta-analyses, reviews, and clinical practice and consensus guidelines regarding testosterone in women. Where guidance is not provided in the Global Position Statement, previously published guidelines have been used. At the consensus meeting, the panelists presented summaries of the current literature; discussion of testosterone measurement, formulations, and indications for treatment; and developed consensus for this clinical guideline.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^115CwNXh]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Testosterone addition in females — postmenopausal and young exercising women is associated with body composition and performance changes. In postmenopausal women, increased testosterone administration up to 24 wk was associated with a dose-dependent increase in lean mass and muscle performance, with the highest dose yielding a mean testosterone concentration of 7.3 nmol·L−1 and an increase in lean mass of 4.4%. In a randomized clinical trial of young healthy exercising females treated with testosterone (10 mg daily) or placebo for 10 wk, the treated group's testosterone rose to a mean concentration of 4.3 nmol·L−1, muscle mass increased, and aerobic performance improved by 8.5% compared with placebo, whereas anaerobic power improved minimally (3.2%) and was not significantly different from placebo. These nonathlete studies indicate that testosterone can increase muscle mass via muscle fiber hypertrophy and aerobic performance in females after 2–3 months of testosterone administration.

### Safety and efficacy of testosterone for women: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trial data [^114CZ4De]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Background

The benefits and risks of testosterone treatment for women with diminished sexual wellbeing remain controversial. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess potential benefits and risks of testosterone for women.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science for blinded, randomised controlled trials of testosterone treatment of at least 12 weeks' duration completed between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 10, 2018. We also searched drug registration applications to the European Medicine Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration to identify any unpublished data. Primary outcomes were the effects of testosterone on sexual function, cardiometabolic variables, cognitive measures, and musculoskeletal health. This study is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), number CRD42018104073.

Findings

Our search strategy retrieved 46 reports of 36 randomised controlled trials comprising 8480 participants. Our meta-analysis showed that, compared with placebo or a comparator (eg, oestrogen, with or without progestogen), testosterone significantly increased sexual function, including satisfactory sexual event frequency (mean difference 0·85, 95% CI 0·52 to 1·18), sexual desire (standardised mean difference 0·36, 95% CI 0·22 to 0·50), pleasure (mean difference 6·86, 95% CI 5·19 to 8·52), arousal (standardised mean difference 0·28, 95% CI 0·21 to 0·35), orgasm (standardised mean difference 0·25, 95% CI 0·18 to 0·32), responsiveness (standardised mean difference 0·28, 95% CI 0·21 to 0·35), and self-image (mean difference 5·64, 95% CI 4·03 to 7·26), and reduced sexual concerns (mean difference 8·99, 95% CI 6·90 to 11·08) and distress (standardised mean difference -0·27, 95% CI -0·36 to -0·17) in postmenopausal women. A significant rise in the amount of LDL-cholesterol, and reductions in the amounts of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, were seen with testosterone administered orally, but not when administered non-orally (eg, by transdermal patch or cream). An overall increase in weight was recorded with testosterone treatment. No effects of testosterone were reported for body composition, musculoskeletal variables, or cognitive measures, although the number of women who contributed data for these outcomes was small. Testosterone was associated with a significantly greater likelihood of reporting acne and hair growth, but no serious adverse events were recorded.

Interpretation

Testosterone is effective for postmenopausal women with low sexual desire causing distress, with administration via non-oral routes (eg, transdermal application) preferred because of a neutral lipid profile. The effects of testosterone on individual wellbeing and musculoskeletal and cognitive health, as well as long-term safety, warrant further investigation.

### Are the endocrine society's clinical practice guidelines on androgen therapy in women misguided? A commentary [^113fjzko]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines on Androgen Therapy in Women (henceforth referred to as the Guidelines) do not necessarily represent the opinion held by the many health-care professionals and clinicians who are specialized in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of women's health in androgen insufficiency states. The recommendations provided in the published Guidelines are neither accurate nor complete. We disagree with the therapeutic nihilism promoted by these Guidelines. The members of the Guidelines Panel (henceforth referred to as the Panel), in their own disclaimer, stated that the Guidelines do not establish a standard of care. Based on data available in the contemporary literature, on the role of androgens in women's health, we provide in this commentary a point-by-point discussion of the arguments made by the Panel in arriving at their recommendations. It is our view that the Guidelines are not based on the preponderance of scientific evidence. Health-care professionals, physicians, and scientists often disagree when determining how best to address and manage new and emerging clinical issues. This is where we stand now as we endeavor to understand the role of androgens in a woman's health and welfare. Indeed, some basic facts are not in contention. All agree that dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) production from the adrenal gland begins during the preteen years, peaks in the mid 20s, then declines progressively over time. In contrast, ovarian androgen (i.e., testosterone) secretion commences at puberty, is sustained during a woman's peak reproductive years and declines as a woman ages, with a more rapid and steep decrease after surgical menopause. However, there are ample data to suggest that adrenal androgens play a role in the development of axillary and pubic hair, and that testosterone is critical for women's libido and sexual function. We take this opportunity to invite members of the Panel on Androgen Therapy in Women to discuss, clarify, comment, or rebut any of the points made in this Commentary. It is our goal to elevate this debate in order to provide women who are afflicted with androgen insufficiency and sexual disorders with the highest quality health care and to relieve their distress and suffering, as well as to improve their quality of life.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^111WHfat]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

(5) Recommendations regarding the effects of testosterone on wellbeing, mood, and cognition in postmenopausal women There is insufficient evidence to support the use of testosterone to enhance cognitive performance, or to delay cognitive decline, in postmenopausal women (Insufficient). Available data show no effect of testosterone therapy on general wellbeing (Level I, Grade A). Testosterone may improve wellbeing in premenopausal women but data are inconclusive (Level 1, Grade B). Available data do not show an effect of testosterone on depressed mood (Level I, Grade B).

(6) Recommendations regarding the musculoskeletal effects of testosterone Few studies have evaluated the musculoskeletal effects of testosterone. Of the studies that have reported musculoskeletal outcomes, the number of included participants has been small, all participants were taking concurrent estrogen therapy, and no studies have been in women with osteoporosis. The available data do not support an effect of testosterone treatment on bone mineral density at the spine, total hip, or femoral neck at 12 months (Level I, Grade A). No statistically significant effect of testosterone administered in physiologic doses has been demonstrated on lean body mass, total body fat, or muscle strength (Level I, Grade A). There is a need for clinical trials to evaluate the impact of testosterone treatment on musculoskeletal tissues (Expert Opinion).

### Testosterone and sexual function [^111SoFgf]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Testosterone therapy has been advocated in the treatment of symptoms that may represent normal aging. We briefly review randomized clinical trials on the effects of testosterone therapy on sexual function.

Recent Findings

About half of clinical trials showed no benefit of testosterone therapy on any aspect of sexual function. In those studies showing a benefit on some aspect of sexual function, most sexual function domains were not improved. Testosterone therapy has been disappointing in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Potential risks of therapy include an increase in thromboembolic and other cardiovascular diseases.

Summary

The limited and inconsistent benefits of testosterone therapy for sexual function argue against use of this therapy in aging men, including those with 'low testosterone'.

### The effects of testosterone on bone health in males with testosterone deficiency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1156b2e2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Searching and study screening

We conducted electronic searches in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and PubMed on 9 December 2019. The search strategy was developed by an information specialist and is presented in Additional file 1. There was no limitation on language, document type, and publication status. We also hand searched the references of relevant systematic reviews to identify additional RCTs for inclusion. Two reviewers screened the search results. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with assistance from a third party if necessary.

Data extraction and synthesis

Data from each study were extracted independently by two separate reviewers using a standardized data extraction form. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with the assistance from a third party if necessary.

We synthesized data using a fixed-effect method for all analyses. An I² estimate greater than or equal to 50% accompanied by a statistically significant χ² statistic was interpreted as evidence of a substantial level of heterogeneity. Where substantial heterogeneity was found, we explored potential sources that may have caused this heterogeneity. If we could not definitively locate the sources of heterogeneity, we synthesized the data using a random-effects model. We summarised all dichotomous outcome data using risk ratios (RRs) and all continuous outcome data using mean differences (MDs) and calculated their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Risk of bias assessment

We made the risk of bias judgments based on the methods endorsed by The Cochrane Collaboration, which included the following domains: patient allocation, blinding, selective reporting, attrition of study participants, and any other detected sources of bias.

Additional analysis

We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for the primary and secondary outcomes based on the GRADE approach. To test the robustness of the results of the synthesis, we conducted a trial sequential analysis (TSA) for the primary outcomes. The required information size (RIS) was calculated based on the empirical mean difference and variance with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20.

### European Association of Urology position statement on the role of the urologist in the management of male hypogonadism and testosterone therapy [^114szMj6]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Testosterone is a crucial sex hormone important for the health and development of men of all ages. It plays a role in the integrity and maintaining the function of several systems and organs. Testosterone deficiency is linked to a number of signs and symptoms potentially affecting every man in his complexity and masculinity, and is therefore of strong urological interest. For this reason, urologists should attach importance to the need for knowledge, vocational education, and training in this specific area.

### Sex-specific genetic effects across biomarkers [^111sML3N]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Sex differences have been shown in laboratory biomarkers; however, the extent to which this is due to genetics is unknown. In this study, we infer sex-specific genetic parameters (heritability and genetic correlation) across 33 quantitative biomarker traits in 181,064 females and 156,135 males from the UK Biobank study. We apply a Bayesian Mixture Model, Sex Effects Mixture Model (SEMM), to Genome-wide Association Study summary statistics in order to (1) estimate the contributions of sex to the genetic variance of these biomarkers and (2) identify variants whose statistical association with these traits is sex-specific. We find that the genetics of most biomarker traits are shared between males and females, with the notable exception of testosterone, where we identify 119 female and 445 male-specific variants. These include protein-altering variants in steroid hormone production genes (POR, UGT2B7). Using the sex-specific variants as genetic instruments for Mendelian randomization, we find evidence for causal links between testosterone levels and height, body mass index, waist and hip circumference, and type 2 diabetes. We also show that sex-specific polygenic risk score models for testosterone outperform a combined model. Overall, these results demonstrate that while sex has a limited role in the genetics of most biomarker traits, sex plays an important role in testosterone genetics.

### Sex and gender issues in competitive sports: investigation of a historical case leads to a new viewpoint [^114EjstL]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Sex characteristics, gender identity and testosterone

To have, or not to have, a Y chromosome is the primary decisive factor in human sexual differentiation, but there are exceptions. A prominent example is offered by 46, XY females who have the complete form of androgen insensitivity syndrome (cAIS), when the testes produce testosterone but the body is not able to respond to androgens (testosterone and its more powerful metabolite dihydrotestosterone) due to mutation of the X-encoded androgen receptor. Consequently, these individuals are born and raised as girls, and have a female gender identity. Action of testosterone through binding to the androgen receptor in the developing fetal brain is the predominant factor in programming human male gender identity, and the female gender identity of 46, XY cAIS women is explained by loss of this androgenic effect. In sports, 46, XY cAIS women can be expected to have a disadvantage compared to 46, XX women with a functional androgen receptor, the latter profiting from stimulation of muscle strength by a low level of circulating testosterone.

The biological basis for sex segregation in sports is the consequence of long-term endogenous androgen exposure of men after puberty. It cannot be excluded that proteins encoded by genes in the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY)might act together with androgens, widening the physiological gap between women and men. However, such a role for MSY genes will be minor, compared to the predominant role of androgen action. In men, the postpubertal testosterone level is a proven dose-dependent factor when muscle strength and other physiological factors such as the blood haemoglobin level come into play. A moderate pubertal and postpubertal excess of testosterone in a young woman can give extra muscle development and other signs of hyperandrogenism, but it would be a rude error to even suggest that this would affect her female gender identity.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^112wxWDs]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Testosterone has been an important evidence-based, albeit controversial, therapy for women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Over the past 2 decades, multiple publications consisting of original research, reviews, and meta-analyses have supported the use of testosterone therapy for HSDD in postmenopausal women. The Global Consensus Position Statement on the Use of Testosterone Therapy for Women (Global Position Statement) was recently published simultaneously in 4 journals, with authors representing 10 societies including the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health (ISSWSH) and endorsed by the ISSWSH and 10 other sexual medicine, endocrine, obstetrics and gynecology, and menopause societies. The Global Position Statement is the most comprehensive, evidence-based guideline to date, superseding all previous guidelines. It provided clinical guidance regarding the use of testosterone therapy in women, examining the effect on sexual function; well-being, mood, and cognition; musculoskeletal effects; cardiovascular and breast health; as well as androgenic side effects and adverse events. The conclusions were developed based on the systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy in women, and the clinical practice recommendations were based on the expert opinion and the consensus of the panelists. According to the Global Position Statement, the sole evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy is HSDD in postmenopausal women, using a biopsychosocial assessment and treatment model. The Global Position Statement provides the evidence and standard of care for the use of testosterone in women and serves as the basis for this clinical guidance document. There remains a need for a consensus clinical practice guideline that provides a comprehensive management strategy for the use of systemic testosterone in women with HSDD. The purpose of the present article is to provide specific recommendations regarding identification of patients, laboratory testing, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up care in the consideration of testosterone therapy for HSDD in women.

### The role of reproductive hormones in maintaining cognition [^1167mCqm]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

This article briefly reviews the impact of hormones on cognition. Estrogen has the most profound impact on brain functioning. Testosterone also seems to have significant brain-related benefits, whereas progesterone seems to have minor or possibly even adverse effects. As the field of neuroscience progresses, more definitive conclusions will follow. As the focus is shifted, however, from extending life to improving the quality of life, the existing data are very compelling. The brain is a target for the sex steroid hormones. Clearly, this is an exciting and dynamic area for further study. Although skeptics may believe that more definitive proof is necessary before recommending hormone replacement for their patients to preserve their cognitive health, it seems prudent to discuss the evidence available to empower the patient further to guide their own treatment options and validate their symptoms. For those who still subscribe to the menopause-is-natural philosophy this question is posed, "why does the brain naturally have sex hormone receptors if they are not necessary?"

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^114DBzQ8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

A Task Force of representatives of leading societies, whose international memberships include clinicians assessing and managing sex steroid therapy for women, was established. The Task Force agreed on the issues that needed to be addressed, after which a systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy for women were conducted. The Task Force then met on 17 May 2019 in Berlin, Germany, and drafted this consensus position statement.

Recommendations regarding the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy are based on findings from blinded placebo/comparator RCTs, of at least 12 weeks duration for which data were available for inclusion in meta-analyses. The findings are reported with Levels of evidence and Grades of Recommendations. Clinical practice recommendations are agreed expert opinions of the panel. Through constructive discussion, unanimous consensus agreement was reached on all the Expert Opinion recommendations included here.

### British Society for Sexual Medicine guidelines on adult testosterone deficiency, with statements for UK practice [^116AjNSy]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Testosterone deficiency (TD) is an increasingly common problem with significant health implications, but its diagnosis and management can be challenging.

Aim

To review the available literature on TD and provide evidence-based statements for UK clinical practice.

Methods

Evidence was derived from Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane searches on hypogonadism, testosterone (T) therapy, and cardiovascular safety from May 2005 to May 2015. Further searches continued until May 2017.

Outcomes

To provide a guideline on diagnosing and managing TD, with levels of evidence and grades of recommendation, based on a critical review of the literature and consensus of the British Society of Sexual Medicine panel.

Results

25 statements are provided, relating to 5 key areas: screening, diagnosis, initiating T therapy, benefits and risks of T therapy, and follow-up. 7 statements are supported by level 1, 8 by level 2, 5 by level 3, and 5 by level 4 evidence.

Clinical Implications

To help guide UK practitioners on effectively diagnosing and managing primary and age-related TD.

Strengths and Limitations

A large amount of literature was carefully sourced and reviewed, presenting the best evidence available at the time. However, some statements provided are based on poor-quality evidence. This is a rapidly evolving area of research and recommendations are subject to change. Guidelines can never replace clinical expertise when making treatment decisions for individual patients, but rather help to focus decisions and take personal values and preferences and individual circumstances into account. Many issues remain controversial, but in the meantime, clinicians need to manage patient needs and clinical expectations armed with the best clinical evidence and the multidisciplinary expert opinion available.

Conclusion

Improving the diagnosis and management of TD in adult men should provide somatic, sexual, and psychological benefits and subsequent improvements in quality of life.

American College of Physicians GRADE framework — grading certainty of evidence and recommendations is defined as follows: High certainty is described as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate certainty is "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low certainty is "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". Recommendation strength includes Strong, where there is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", it "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations should be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs"; and Conditional, where "Benefits probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", it "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and "Policy making will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that male gender is at a higher risk of developing more severe Covid-19 disease and thus having poorer clinical outcomes. However, the relationship between testosterone (T) and Covid-19 remains unclear with both protective and deleterious effects on different aspects of the disease suggested. Here, we review the current epidemiological and biological evidence on the role of testosterone in the process of SARS-CoV-2 infection and in mediating Covid-19 severity, its potential to serve as a biomarker for risk stratification and discuss the possibility of T supplementation as a treatment or preventative therapy for Covid-19.

### Systemic effects of the hormonal treatment of male hypogonadism with preliminary indications for the management of COVID-19 patients [^117WZEuk]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Male hypogonadism, defined as an inadequate production of testosterone (T), is associated with a greater morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological studies identified T deficiency as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Also, low serum T levels impact on glucose homeostasis through a worse glucose uptake, utilization, and disposal, and the general negative impact on metabolism. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive and updated overview of the effects of T replacement therapy on metabolic and cardiovascular systems and prostate tissue in patients with hypogonadism, including molecular mechanisms through which T exerts its actions. Furthermore, recent findings on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemiology have shown a greater mortality in male compared with female patients and a role of T in promoting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection of the host cells has been demonstrated. Hence, the secondary aim of this review is to provide preliminary indications on the management in patients with COVID-19.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113dj8vX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic illness and low testosterone concentrations — treatment individualization: Many chronic disorders are associated with an increased risk of low testosterone concentrations and related symptoms, but the paucity of randomized controlled trial data on efficacy or safety precludes a general recommendation for testosterone therapy in these conditions. Clinicians must individualize the decision to treat or not to treat based on the severity of symptoms, the degree of testosterone deficiency, confounding effects of the comorbid illness, patient preferences, and the uncertainty of the risks and benefits of therapy.

Sex Difference in Circulating Testosterone Levels

Testosterone biosynthesis, secretion, and regulation in men and women

An androgen is a hormone capable of developing and maintaining masculine characteristics in reproductive tissues (notably the genital tract, as well as in other tissues and organs associated with secondary sexual characteristics and fertility) and contributing to the anabolic status of nonreproductive body tissues. The two dominant bioactive androgens circulating in mature mammals, including humans — testosterone and its more potent metabolite DHT — account for the development and maintenance of all androgen-dependent characteristics, and their circulating levels in men and nonpregnant women arise from steroids synthesized de novo in the testes, ovary, or adrenals.

The sexually undifferentiated gonads in the embryo develop into either ovaries or testes according to whether a Y chromosome (or at least the sry gene) is present. After birth and until puberty commences, circulating testosterone concentrations are essentially the same in boys and girls, other than briefly in the neonatal period of boys when higher levels prevail. The onset of male puberty, a brain-driven process triggered by a still mysterious hypothalamic or higher cerebral mechanism, initiates a hormonal cascade. In males, this leads to enhanced pituitary LH secretion that stimulates the 500 million Leydig cells in the testes to secrete 3 to 10 mg (mean, 7 mg) of testosterone daily. This creates a very high local concentration of testosterone within the testis as well as a steep downhill concentration gradient into the bloodstream that maintains circulating testosterone levels at adult male levels, which are tightly regulated by strong negative hypothalamic feedback of circulating testosterone. In the absence of testes, these mechanisms do not function in females. In girls, serum testosterone increases during puberty, peaking at age 20 to 25 years before declining gradually with age, but it remains < 2 nmol/L at all ages, as determined by a reliable method (see below).

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^116nBF9d]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

American College of Sports Medicine consensus on sex differences in athletic performance — Biological sex is a primary determinant of athletic performance because of fundamental sex differences in anatomy and physiology dictated by sex chromosomes and sex hormones. Adult men are typically stronger, more powerful, and faster than women of similar age and training status, and for events relying on endurance, muscle strength, speed, and power, males typically outperform females by 10%–30% depending on the requirements of the event. These sex differences in performance emerge with the onset of puberty and coincide with the increase in endogenous sex steroid hormones, particularly testosterone in males, which increases 30-fold by adulthood, but remains low in females. The review highlights differences in anatomy and physiology, roles of sex steroid hormones, and historical and nonphysiological factors that influence performance and identifies knowledge gaps; a major step toward closing the knowledge gap is to include more and equitable numbers of women to that of men in mechanistic studies that examine any of the sex differences in response to an acute bout of exercise, exercise training, and athletic performance.

Recommendations

I. Measurement of testosterone, female sexual dysfunction, and endogenous androgen levels

(1) Recommendations pertaining to the measurement of circulating testosterone in women Testosterone may act directly via the androgen receptor/nongenomic androgenic action, or by reduction to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone and/or aromatization to estradiol and their metabolites. Testosterone concentrations decline during the reproductive years (Level IIB). Testosterone concentrations appear to be maintained in women beyond the age of 65 years, but whether this confers a benefit is yet to be understood (Level IIB). Total testosterone can be measured with high accuracy and reproducibility using liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assays (Grade B). Direct assays for the measurement of total and free testosterone are highly unreliable in the female range (Grade A). Reference laboratories should be "harmonized" with biological standards in coordination with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Expert Opinion). Measurement of testosterone using direct assays in clinical practice is appropriate, if liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assay is not available, to exclude high baseline concentrations and also to exclude supraphysiological concentrations during treatment (Expert Opinion). Current research into testosterone physiology and clinical effects should mainly focus on measuring total testosterone as the main biomarker rather than "free" testosterone because evidence that "free" testosterone is the biologically active testosterone fraction is lacking (Expert Opinion).

(2) Recommendations for the terminology for female sexual dysfunction (FSD) Hypoactive sexual desire disorder/dysfunction (HSDD) and female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) are distinct conditions that should be categorized separately when considering the impact of androgens on their clinical presentation and response to treatment (Grade B). Although HSDD and FSAD overlap, they have distinct etiologies, risk factors, clinical features, and responses to psychological and biological interventions (Grade B). Traditional specifiers (i.e. lifelong vs acquired; generalized vs situational) should be retained and used to further categorize and stratify treatments for HSDD and other female sexual disorders/dysfunctions. The diagnosis of HSDD in clinical practice should be based on thorough clinical assessment guided by available diagnostic criteria such as the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health or the International Classification of Diseases, 11th edition (Expert Opinion).

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^116aAKrr]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Sex differences in athletic performance — endogenous testosterone and female athletic performance — are characterized by normal circulating testosterone ranges of 0.1–1.8 nmol•L−1 in females and 7.7–29.4 nmol•L−1 in men. Observational data report that national- and international-level female sprinters and team sports athletes showed superior performances that correlated with serum testosterone, and androgen precursors have been associated with enhanced performance in physical fitness tests of female Olympic athletes. In a large cohort of more than 1000 female track and field athletes, those in the highest tertile of testosterone performed significantly better than those in the lowest tertile in specific events, and the authors note that mild variations of endogenous testosterone within the normal female range may be advantageous for athletic performance.

### The effect of statins on testosterone in men and women, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1111tPkD]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of this reduction in testosterone with statins is difficult to gauge. The normal range of testosterone is wide and sexual function similar across the range. Erectile dysfunction is a rare side effect of statins, perhaps because statins' have beneficial effects on cardiovascular function that would counteract changes of this magnitude in testosterone. However, large changes in testosterone (and libido) can occasionally occur with statin use, which are reversible by statin withdrawal. The impact on population health may be more germane, where statins causing diabetes could be another side effect. We are not aware of any study examining whether lowering testosterone mediates the effect of statins on diabetes, as this possibility has not, to the best of our knowledge, been considered before, and remains speculative. Moreover, observational studies suggest serum testosterone has sex-specific physiological effects on diabetes, negative among men, but positive among women, when statins increase diabetes in both sexes. We could not identify any RCT confirming testosterone therapy increases diabetes incidence among women. In postmenopausal women, RCTs of testosterone therapy indicate little effect on glucose metabolism. In younger women, some RCTs indicate that low doses of testosterone may improve glucose metabolism; female to male transsexuals given high doses of testosterone have improved glucose metabolism. Nevertheless, distinct effects of testosterone on diabetes may occur by dose, sex and age with the reduction in testosterone with statin treatment insufficient to modulate diabetes risk consistently. This meta-analysis also raises the question as to whether lowering testosterone is a side effect of statin therapy or contributes to statins' mode of action, which could inform new treatments and prevention policies. Observationally testosterone is inversely associated with cardiovascular mortality; whether testosterone is causal or a marker of health is unknown. No RCT has shown testosterone therapy reduces cardiovascular events; two RCTs of testosterone therapy were halted because of adverse, mainly cardiovascular events, among men allocated to testosterone. Natural experiments suggest lower testosterone protects against specifically ischemic heart disease mortality, with a relatively lower risk in men legally castrated or with Klinefelter's syndrome. Physiologically lowering testosterone may reduce thromboxane and platelet activation, specifically relevant to reducing ischemic cardiovascular disease but not to diabetes. However, whether lowering testosterone with statin treatment modulates cardiovascular disease, via these or other pathways, has not been examined.

### Testosterone target therapy: focus on immune response, controversies and clinical implications in patients with COVID-19 infection [^112cYUEs]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Testosterone levels and their effect on the immune response can explain some of the differences in COVID-19 incidence and mortality between males and females. However, it is crucial to emphasize that testosterone and testosterone ablation used in PC may have opposing roles in the different phases of COVID-19 infection: low testosterone levels may be protective against the initial susceptibility and stimulate a worse clinical course in the advanced COVID-19 infection.

### Should women receive androgen replacement therapy, and if so, how? [^117BYfbc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The available clinical evidence supports efficacy of testosterone therapy for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) who have undergone a comprehensive clinical evaluation. Although few preparations designed to deliver an appropriate dose of testosterone for women are available, use of testosterone by women for the management of HSDD is widespread. Issues that continue to simulate debate in this therapeutic area include whether HSDD is a condition that merits pharmacotherapy, how effective is such treatment and whether testosterone therapy is safe. Hence the question, should women receive androgen replacement therapy, and if so, how?

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^116BGQd1]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

The lack of clear correlation between sexual function and declining androgen levels has been explained by the complexity of androgen metabolism and measurementand the observation that circulating testosterone levels do not adequately reflect tissue concentrations. Although circulating hormone levels have been used as indicators of tissue exposure, a significant proportion of androgen synthesis may be intracrine, such that circulating precursors and testosterone act as prohormones and are converted to active hormones within target cells. The complex regulation of AR expression plays a key role in androgen effects. Furthermore, androgenic effects vary according to individual variations in the amount and activity of the enzymes 5α-reductase and aromatase and individual differences in the AR response. However, it is still not clear whether the AR activity is a modulator of the androgenic effect on sexual desireor if levels of intracrine activity of androgens are better parameters for androgen effect on sexual desire.

What is the rationale for testosterone therapy in women?

Although no testosterone serum concentration correlates with the presence or absence of HSDD or its severity, there is a loose correlation between testosterone concentration while undergoing treatment and its benefits for improving sexual dysfunction. Although the complexity of central and peripheral mechanisms of action of testosterone on sexual desire is not completely understood, research and clinical evidence support a positive effect of testosterone therapy on sexual desire when premenopausal physiologic levels are maintained. When testosterone supplementation exceeds the normal premenopausal range, which is the recommended optimal treatment threshold, sexual desire may actually decrease, suggesting a bimodal effect.

### A roadmap for sex-and gender-disaggregated health research [^116B2Zdv]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Broaden the scope of research on the role of sex hormones

The sex hormones, oestrogen and testosterone, play an important role in both reproductive and non-reproductive systems. The contribution of hormones to understanding sex differences in health and disease, however, remains debated. To date, most research has focused on the role of oestrogen, which is thought to have an important role in the cardiovascular system, as it has vasodilator effects and reduces or prevents platelet activation. In addition, it improves the profile of circulating lipoproteins, modulates blood pressure, and may underpin the observed sex differences in arterial blood pressure and differences in blood pressure between premenopausal versus postmenopausal women.

Studying the role of sex hormones in women is challenging, given the complexity of accurately measuring natural levels during women's monthly cycle. A recent study in the UK Biobank showed that the presumed cardioprotective effects of oestradiol seem to be largely confounded by age. Early menopause in women, as a marker of accelerated reproductive ageing, has been associated with a higher risk of CHD and stroke in observational studies. However, the presumed adverse effects of an early menopause on cardiovascular risk have also been brought into question by new evidence from a MR study, which showed that genetically determined early age at natural menopause is not causally associated with either CHD risk or with CHD risk factors. Postmenopausal hormone therapy alleviates menopausal symptoms and results from observational studies consistently showed that the use of hormone therapy was associated with a lower risk of CHD and stroke. However, findings from RCTs on the effects of hormone therapy have been null or showed adverse effects on stroke risk. It now seems that timing is critical, and the benefits only seem to be present when the therapy is initiated temporally close to menopause and not when initiated later.

The effects of testosterone on health outcomes, in both women and men, are considerably less well-studied. A recent study in postmenopausal women, however, showed that the balance between testosterone and estrogens, as expressed by the testosterone/estradiol ratio, as well as testosterone levels per se, were associated with the risk of CVD. Studies on the role of sex hormones in men's health, although scarce, imply that higher levels of testosterone might be associated with a higher risk of CVD. Also, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which lowers circulating testosterone, might protect against CHD in men. Future studies are needed to simultaneously assess the effects of multiple sex hormones, and their combinations, on a range of health outcomes in both women and men.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^114Ubjs8]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Government-approved testosterone therapy for women is not currently available worldwide, presumably because of the lack of long-term efficacy and safety data and the barriers to product development and approval. Systemic transdermal testosterone therapy is recommended by the Global Position Statement for postmenopausal women; in this Clinical Practice Guideline, testosterone is recommended for postmenopausal and late reproductive age women with HSDD. Current available research supports a moderate therapeutic benefit. Available safety data show no serious adverse events with physiologic testosterone use, but long-term safety has not been established. Using established clinical guidance, such as the ISSWSH POC for the management of HSDD, the diagnosis should include a thorough biopsychosocial clinical assessment that leads to identification, modification, and management of contributing factors before testosterone therapy is considered. Before initiation of therapy, patients should receive informed consent, and shared decision-making should involve a comprehensive discussion of off-label use, as well as benefits and risks. A total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD. Total testosterone is recommended as the best available measure, rather than free or bioavailable testosterone or FAI. Transdermal formulations can be used cautiously with dosing appropriate for women, and signs of androgen excess and total testosterone levels must be monitored routinely to maintain women in the physiologic premenopausal range. The Global Position Statement, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Report, and this Clinical Practice Guideline recommend against the use of compounded testosterone.

Although the FDA and other government agencies acknowledge the treatment of HSDD in postmenopausal women as a significant unmet need, barriers to regulatory approval for a female testosterone product are formidable. Most important is the lack of guidance as to the types of studies, end points, results, and safety data required for approval, in contrast to the clear pathway for testosterone products for men. More clinical trial evidence demonstrating longer and more robust testosterone safety data is integral to the development, submission, and regulatory approval of testosterone preparations specifically indicated and designed for women.

### The role of testosterone therapy in postmenopausal women: position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1129onmS]. Menopause (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To create an evidence-based position statement regarding the role of exogenous testosterone in postmenopausal women.

Design

The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) enlisted a panel of clinicians and researchers acknowledged to be experts in the field of testosterone therapy to review the evidence obtained from the medical literature, compile supporting statements and conclusions, and reach consensus on recommendations. The document was reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Endogenous testosterone levels have not been clearly linked to sexual function in postmenopausal women. Published evidence from randomized controlled trials, although limited, indicates that exogenous testosterone, both oral and nonoral formulations, has a positive effect on sexual function, primarily desire, arousal, and orgasmic response, in women after spontaneous or surgically induced menopause. Data are inadequate to support recommending testosterone use for any other indication, including preserving or increasing bone mineral density, reducing hot flashes, increasing lean body mass, or improving well-being. Hirsutism and acne have been associated with testosterone therapy, but the actual risks are not well defined. It is not known whether testosterone therapy increases the risk of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, or thromboembolic events. There are few data regarding the safety and efficacy of testosterone therapy in women not using concomitant estrogen therapy or for the use of testosterone therapy for longer than 6 months. Clinically available laboratory assays do not accurately detect testosterone concentrations at the values typically found in women, and no testosterone level has been clearly linked to a clinical syndrome of hypoandrogenism or testosterone insufficiency.

Conclusions

Postmenopausal women with decreased sexual desire associated with personal distress and with no other identifiable cause may be candidates for testosterone therapy. Testosterone treatment without concomitant estrogen therapy cannot be recommended because of a lack of evidence. When evaluating a woman for testosterone therapy, recommendations are to rule out causes not related to testosterone levels (eg, physical and psychosocial factors, medications) and to ensure that there is a physiologic cause for reduced testosterone levels (eg, bilateral oophorectomy). Laboratory testing of testosterone levels should be used only to monitor for supraphysiologic levels before and during therapy, not to diagnose testosterone insufficiency. Monitoring should also include subjective assessments of sexual response, desire, and satisfaction as well as evaluation for potential adverse effects. Transdermal patches and topical gels or creams are preferred over oral products because of first-pass hepatic effects documented with oral formulations. Custom-compounded products should be used with caution because the dosing may be more inconsistent than it is with government-approved products. Testosterone products formulated specifically for men have a risk of excessive dosing, although some clinicians use lower doses of these products in women. Testosterone therapy is contraindicated in women with breast or uterine cancer or in those with cardiovascular or liver disease. It should be administered at the lowest dose for the shortest time that meets treatment goals. Counseling regarding the potential risks and benefits should be provided before initiating therapy.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^112SLFvX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

There are no clearly established indications for testosterone therapy for women. Nonetheless, clinicians have treated women with testosterone for decades, with the intention of alleviating a variety of symptoms, with uncertain benefits and risks. In most countries, testosterone therapy is prescribed off-label such that women are using either testosterone formulations approved for men with dose modification, or compounded therapies. Because of these issues, there is a compelling case for a global consensus Position Statement on testosterone therapy for women based on the available evidence from placebo/comparator randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

This Position Statement was developed, by consensus between the participating organizations, to inform health care professionals of the known benefits and potential risks of testosterone therapy for women. The aims were to provide clear guidance as to which women might benefit from testosterone therapy, to identify symptoms, signs, and conditions for which evidence does not support the prescribing of testosterone, to explore areas of uncertainty, and to identify any prescribing practices that have the potential to cause harm.

### Androgens show sex-dependent differences in myelination in immune and non-immune murine models of CNS demyelination [^113q734o]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

DHT efficiently mitigates the course of EAE disease in females

Given the important role of AR-mediated signal in myelin regeneration in females and because remyelination cannot be considered independently of the peripheral immune process characterizing MS, we further investigated the role of testosterone and DHT in the EAE model. Androgens were administered according to a curative protocol at onset of neurological symptomsin ovariectomized EAE female mice assigned to intranasal administration of the vehicle, testosterone or DHT for 30 days (Fig. 7a). Vehicle-treated females displayed the typical profile of disease progression with hindlimb paralysis with a 3.0–3.5 clinical score reached by day 8 and persisting until the end of the experiment. Testosterone or DHT-treated females displayed significantly lower scores throughout the whole experiment. However, DHT tended to be less efficient (Fig. 7a) suggesting that testosterone may act via different mechanisms compared with DHT.
