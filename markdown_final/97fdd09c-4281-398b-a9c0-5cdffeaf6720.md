## Question

Hypotension after TAVR

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hypotension after TAVR, including its mechanisms, prognostic impact, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why hypotension matters in TAVR. Then, I should categorize the types of hypotension by timing and mechanism. Next, I will appraise the evidence linking hypotension to outcomes, including delirium, acute kidney injury, and mortality. After that, I should identify modifiable risk factors and propose practical intraoperative and postoperative management strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, reference-aware conclusion and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why hypotension is salient after TAVR. TAVR relieves chronic afterload in severe aortic stenosis, but patients are typically elderly with comorbidities and limited physiologic reserve, so abrupt hemodynamic shifts and procedural hypotension can precipitate end-organ injury and worse outcomes, which is why continuous invasive monitoring and vasoactive support are standard in many programs [^111Jjgid] [^113hHk8V].

> I will now examine the timing and mechanisms of hypotension, because management hinges on distinguishing intraoperative from early postoperative patterns. Intraoperative hypotension arises from rapid ventricular pacing, balloon valvuloplasty, valve deployment, anesthesia-induced vasodilation, and transient myocardial stunning, whereas early postoperative hypotension reflects persistent low cardiac output, vasoplegia, bleeding, tamponade, or unrecognized complications such as paravalvular regurgitation or coronary obstruction; dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction ("suicide LV") is a rare but critical cause of acute hemodynamic collapse immediately after deployment and requires urgent echocardiographic diagnosis and escalation [^111LBC9b] [^117NKWzX] [^1177oiJ1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality between intraoperative hypotension and delirium. I initially thought IOH would independently predict postoperative delirium given cerebral hypoperfusion during pacing, but wait, let me verify the adjusted analyses. A large retrospective cohort using area-under-the-threshold metrics for mean arterial pressure found that IOH was common yet not independently associated with delirium after multivariable adjustment, suggesting confounding by patient frailty, anesthesia type, and procedural factors rather than a direct causal link, so I should correct my earlier assumption and emphasize uncertainty pending prospective data [^115GbmF4] [^111KtKP7].

> Next, I should review the relationship between hypotension and acute kidney injury, because renal perfusion is vulnerable during low-flow states. Observational TAVR cohorts show that intra-procedural hypotension, when defined as sustained MAP less than 60 mmHg, correlates with AKI risk, and multiple pacing episodes and longer cumulative pacing duration are associated with higher AKI and mortality; importantly, post-procedural vasopressor requirement — a marker of persistent low output or vasoplegia — independently predicts AKI, whereas isolated intra-procedural hypotension without ongoing support may not carry the same risk signal [^1114wq2w] [^115Z9Ag5] [^111kaXcS].

> I need to check the mortality data tied to early post-TAVR blood pressure, since this is the most actionable. Large pooled analyses from Medtronic and PARTNER datasets demonstrate that early post-AVR SBP less than 120 mmHg and DBP less than 60 mmHg are independently associated with increased 30-day to 1-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with the diastolic signal appearing stronger and more consistent across sensitivity analyses; importantly, many patients with low BP were on one or more antihypertensives, raising the possibility of iatrogenic hypotension and a modifiable target for de-escalation [^1148EwyC] [^117Ts6W2].

> Let me consider the hemodynamic physiology to ensure the associations are biologically plausible. Relief of fixed outflow obstruction abruptly alters ventriculoarterial coupling, coronary perfusion dynamics, and autonomic tone; low diastolic pressure may impair subendocardial perfusion in the setting of hypertrophied, fibrotic myocardium, while low systolic pressure may reflect impaired stroke volume and systemic perfusion, explaining worse outcomes even when ejection fraction appears "preserved" on echocardiography [^111pjMGS] [^114GAa7v].

> I should double-check modifiable contributors to hypotension that we can act on perioperatively. Rapid ventricular pacing is necessary but should be minimized in frequency and duration when feasible; balloon predilatation can be omitted in selected cases to reduce ischemic burden; anesthesia induction agents with less vasodilation, such as etomidate or cuffed propofol analogs like cipepofol, may reduce induction hypotension; and proactive vasopressor support before anticipated hypotensive phases is prudent, especially in patients with low EF, pulmonary hypertension, or frailty [^1133YTdg] [^116KWHYV] [^111Jjgid].

> Now, I will translate this into intraoperative management steps. Maintain invasive arterial pressure monitoring, preload with judicious fluids given frequent baseline volume depletion in older adults, and anticipate hypotension during pacing or deployment with preemptive phenylephrine or norepinephrine; if sustained low output or vasoplegia occurs, escalate to inotropes and be prepared for mechanical support, and if catastrophic complications like annular rupture or coronary obstruction are suspected, activate salvage pathways including pericardiocentesis, covered stenting, or emergent surgical consultation [^113hHk8V] [^112Jq5th] [^113peq8B].

> For early postoperative care, I need to ensure we avoid overtreatment of "hypertension" that is actually a beneficial afterload-normalization response. Hold or reduce antihypertensives if SBP is below 120 mmHg or DBP is below 60 mmHg in the first month, favoring a permissive range of roughly SBP 130–150 mmHg and DBP 60–80 mmHg while monitoring renal function, mentation, and symptoms; if hypotension persists, evaluate for bleeding, tamponade, paravalvular regurgitation, conduction disease, or dynamic LV obstruction, and treat the cause rather than reflexively intensifying vasopressors without a target [^notfound] [^1148EwyC] [^117NKWzX].

> But wait, what if the patient is on renin–angiotensin system inhibitors that we are now considering holding? Let me reconsider the long-term role of RAS blockade. Meta-analytic data suggest RAS inhibitors after TAVR are associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality without excess AKI, so the safer approach is to titrate the dose to avoid early hypotension rather than discontinue entirely, resuming or up-titrating once blood pressure stabilizes and renal function is secure [^111HEzyQ] [^112s5g3Y].

> I should confirm that our monitoring and follow-up align with best practices. Early post-discharge echocardiography at 30 days and structured blood pressure assessment are essential to detect complications and guide medication reconciliation; given weak correlation between pre- and post-AVR blood pressures, individualized targets based on symptoms, renal function, and end-organ perfusion are reasonable until randomized data define optimal ranges [^11268mVM] [^117HZoji].

> In summary, hypotension after TAVR is common, multifactorial, and prognostically meaningful when sustained in the early postoperative period. Intraoperative hypotension is often expected and manageable, whereas persistent low SBP or DBP in the first month is associated with increased mortality and should trigger evaluation of reversible causes and cautious de-escalation of antihypertensives; prospective trials are needed to test whether deliberately raising BP in low-BP phenotypes improves outcomes, but until then, a pragmatic, physiology-informed approach with vigilant monitoring and cause-directed therapy is warranted [^112dTNRq] [^1148EwyC] [^117Ts6W2].

Hypotension after TAVR is common and multifactorial, with **rapid ventricular pacing** [^115Z9Ag5] and **vasodilatory anesthesia** as key intraoperative drivers, and **vasoplegia**, bleeding, or complications (tamponade, annular rupture, coronary obstruction) as postoperative causes [^1177oiJ1]. Early hypotension is linked to **increased mortality, AKI, and delirium** [^112dTNRq], so prevention and prompt management are essential. Strategies include minimizing pacing duration [^115Z9Ag5], using hemodynamically stable anesthesia [^116KWHYV], proactive vasopressor support, and rapid identification of complications [^111Jjgid]; persistent hypotension warrants echocardiography, CT, and consideration of mechanical support or surgical rescue [^112Jq5th] [^113peq8B].

---

## Incidence and clinical significance

Hypotension is frequent during and after TAVR, with **intraoperative hypotension reported in 76–90%** of cases and postoperative hypotension in 10–30% [^115LTAT1] [^1148EwyC]. It is associated with increased risks of mortality, acute kidney injury (AKI), delirium, and prolonged hospital stay, underscoring the need for vigilant monitoring and management [^112dTNRq] [^115LTAT1] [^112sezkk].

## Etiology and risk factors

Hypotension after TAVR arises from **multiple mechanisms**:

| **Category** | **Specific causes** |
|-|-|
| Intraoperative factors | - Rapid ventricular pacing [^115Z9Ag5] <br/> - Vasodilatory anesthesia [^116KWHYV] <br/> - Balloon valvuloplasty [^1133YTdg] <br/> - Valve deployment [^111LBC9b] |
| Postoperative factors | - Vasoplegia <br/> - Bleeding/tamponade [^1177oiJ1] <br/> - Annular rupture [^113dJ4qv] <br/> - Coronary obstruction [^111LBC9b] <br/> - Dynamic LV obstruction [^117NKWzX] <br/> - Sepsis <br/> - Arrhythmias [^1177oiJ1] |

---

Patient-specific risk factors include **advanced age, low EF, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and frailty** [^111Jjgid] [^115171AM].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with hypotension

Hypotension after TAVR is associated with **significant adverse outcomes**:

- **Mortality**: Lower SBP (< 120 mmHg) and DBP (< 60 mmHg) at discharge and 30 days are independently associated with increased 30-day to 1-year mortality [^112dTNRq] [^1148EwyC].
- **Acute kidney injury**: Intraoperative hypotension and prolonged low MAP are strong predictors of AKI, which itself increases mortality and morbidity [^115LTAT1] [^1113iq2z].
- **Delirium**: Intraoperative hypotension has been linked to postoperative delirium, though findings are mixed and may reflect confounding by patient and procedural factors [^112sezkk] [^115GbmF4].
- **Length of stay**: Hypotension-related complications prolong ICU and hospital stay, increasing costs and resource utilization [^1113iq2z].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management requires **multidisciplinary coordination** and rapid intervention:

- **Prevention**: Minimize pacing duration [^115Z9Ag5], use hemodynamically stable anesthesia [^116KWHYV], and optimize volume status [^113hHk8V].
- **Intraoperative management**: Proactive vasopressor support (phenylephrine, norepinephrine), careful pacing protocols, and vigilant hemodynamic monitoring [^111Jjgid].
- **Postoperative management**: Rapid identification and treatment of complications (bleeding, tamponade, annular rupture, coronary obstruction) [^112Jq5th], echocardiography, CT angiography, and escalation to mechanical circulatory support (Impella, ECMO) or surgical rescue when indicated [^113peq8B].
- **Long-term considerations**: Reassess antihypertensive regimens to avoid iatrogenic hypotension, and monitor for late complications such as paravalvular leak or conduction abnormalities [^11268mVM].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current ACC/AHA guidance emphasizes **individualized BP targets**, avoidance of prolonged hypotension, and structured post-TAVR surveillance with echocardiography and ECG at discharge, 30 days, and annually [^11268mVM] [^1113ZoYS]. They also recommend a Heart Valve Team approach for risk stratification and complication management [^113vsYN7].

---

## Knowledge gaps and future research

Key uncertainties include the **optimal BP targets** after TAVR, the role of **vasopressor choice and timing**, and the impact of **anesthesia protocols** on outcomes. Prospective trials are needed to define BP thresholds, test early vasopressor strategies, and compare sedation versus general anesthesia for hemodynamic stability [^112dTNRq] [^116KWHYV].

---

Hypotension after TAVR is common and consequential, driven by procedural and patient factors. Early recognition, prevention, and targeted therapy — including minimizing pacing, using stable anesthesia, proactive vasopressors, and rapid complication management — are essential to reduce mortality, AKI, and delirium. Ongoing research should clarify **BP targets** and **anesthesia strategies** to optimize outcomes.

INTRODUCTION

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a valuable option to treat symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis in older adults considered to be inoperable or at increased risk for surgical aortic valve replacement. Compared with surgical replacement, TAVR is a less invasive treatment strategy that is performed on a beating heart without involvement of cardiopulmonary bypass, or sternotomy. Relief of aortic valve stenosis by TAVR is associated with short and mid‐term favorable cardiac, hemodynamic and geometrical changes, including improvement of coronary microvascular function, increase in cardiac output and cerebral blood flow, and decrease in interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness. Despite improvement in procedural techniques, minimalistic transfemoral approach, and reduced procedural complications rate, the occurrence of postoperative delirium (POD) remains an important complication after TAVR.

Delirium is a clinical expression of acute encephalopathy with a multifactorial etiology and impaired outcome. The reported frequency of POD following TAVR ranges from 10% to 44% depending on the access strategy. Clinical adverse outcomes associated with POD after TAVR include prolonged hospital stay, increased readmission rate, and early and long‐term post‐discharge mortality.,

Delirium is a multifactorial syndrome due to predisposing and precipitating factors. The pathophysiology of POD after TAVR is not well understood, and intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is presumed to play a role.

Patients during TAVR experience IOH and cerebral hypoperfusion due to temporary reduction in cardiac output, particularly during valve deployment. For instance, few studies have shown reduction in cerebral oxygenation during TAVR using near‐infrared spectroscopy. However, the literature on the association of IOH with delirium after TAVR is limited, and heterogeneous with regard to study populations and IOH definitions.

With the increasing number of TAVR procedures, and expanding indications toward patients with lower surgical risk, understanding the etiologies of delirium is crucial to be able to apply preventive strategies. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between IOH and POD after TAVR.

### Controversies and complications in the perioperative management of transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^111LBC9b]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2014). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is performed with increasing frequency in the United States since Food and Drug Administration approval in 2011. The procedure involves the replacement of a severely stenosed native or bioprosthetic aortic valve with a specially constructed valvular prosthesis that is mounted onto a stent, without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass and the complications of a major open surgical procedure. TAVR has been performed mostly in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities or who have undergone previous cardiac surgery. The most commonly used access routes are the femoral artery (transfemoral) or the cardiac apex (transapical), but the transaortic and transubclavian approaches are also used with varying frequency. Conscious sedation may be used in patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR, but the use of general anesthesia has not been shown to carry greater risk and permits the use of transesophageal echocardiography to assist in valve positioning and diagnose complications. Cardiovascular instability during TAVR is relatively common, necessitating invasive monitoring and frequent use of vasoactive medications. Complications of the procedure are still relatively common and the most frequent is vascular injury to the access sites or the aorta. Cardiovascular collapse may be the result of major hemorrhage pericardial effusion with tamponade or coronary occlusion due to incorrect valve placement. Persistent hypotension, myocardial stunning, or injury requiring open surgical intervention may necessitate the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, the facilities for which should always be immediately available. Ongoing and planned trials comparing conventional surgery with TAVR in lower risk and younger patients should determine the place of TAVR in the medium- to long-term future.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Anesthetic considerations for TAVR emphasize that patients are at a high risk for procedural complications, including hemodynamic collapse; careful planning and intraoperative anesthetic management can mitigate this risk, and preventing prolonged hypotension is a key goal. Preoperative evaluation pays special attention to factors that may predict higher risk of intraprocedural instability, particularly depressed EF, elevated pulmonary pressures, significant mitral or tricuspid regurgitation, incomplete revascularization, collateral-dependent coronary and cerebral circulation, chronic lung disease, heart failure, and acute/chronic kidney disease. In patients least likely to tolerate rapid ventricular pacing and hypotension, preventive measures may be instituted and steps taken to allow for rapid institution of cardiopulmonary bypass, and rarely, elective bypass may be utilized. Of critical importance is a baseline evaluation of the airway with a focus on the ease or difficulty of emergently securing the airway during cardiovascular compromise or collapse, attention to possible equipment obstruction (such as from the c-arm) that often limits access, and a review of allergies, particularly to iodinated contrast, performed routinely.

Abstract

Background

Postoperative delirium (POD) is a frequently observed complication after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The effects of intraoperative hypotension (IOH) on POD occurrence are currently unclear.

Methods

A retrospective observational cohort study of patients who underwent TAVR was conducted. We predefined IOH as area under the threshold (AUT) of five mean arterial blood pressures (MBP), varying from < 100 to < 60 mmHg. The AUT consisted of the combination of duration and depth under the MBP thresholds, expressed in mmHg*min. All MBP AUTs were computed based on the complete procedure, independent of procedural phase or duration.

Results

This cohort included 675 patients who underwent TAVR under general anesthesia (n = 128, 19%) or procedural sedation (n = 547, 81%). Delirium occurred mostly during the first 2 days after TAVR, and was observed in n = 93 (14%) cases. Furthermore, 674, 672, 663, 630, and 518 patients had at least 1 min intraoperative MBP < 100, < 90, < 80, < 70, and < 60 mmHg, respectively. Patients who developed POD had higher AUT based on all five MBP thresholds during TAVR. The penalized adjusted odds ratio varied between 1.08 (99% confidence interval [CI] 0.74–1.56) for the AUT based on MBP < 100 mmHg and OR 1.06 (99% CI 0.88–1.28) for the AUT based on MBP < 60 mmHg.

Conclusions

Intraoperative hypotension is frequently observed during TAVR, but not independently associated with POD after TAVR. Other potential factors than intraoperative hypotension may explain the occurrence of delirium after TAVR.

### Acute kidney injury following transcatheter aortic valve implantation: predictive factors, prognostic value, and comparison with surgical aortic valve replacement [^116ePec2]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most serious complications following cardiac surgery, with an incidence varying between 1 and 30% depending on the definition of AKI and baseline characteristics of the study population. Several studies have shown that the occurrence of AKI after cardiac surgery is an independent predictor of in-hospital, mid- and long-term mortality, with a two- to three-fold increase in the risk of death in those patients presenting AKI following the intervention. – Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is the gold standard for the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS), and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an alternative treatment for those patients considered at very high or prohibitive surgical risk. – Patients undergoing TAVI nowadays are thus commonly very old and have a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In fact, trying to avoid potential deterioration of renal function in patients with CKD has become an important argument for choosing TAVI rather than SAVR in those cases. However, very few data exist on the occurrence and prognosis of AKI following TAVI, and no studies have as yet determined whether a TAVI strategy is associated with a lower incidence of AKI compared with SAVR. TAVI procedures involve the administration of contrast media, the systematic occurrence of short periods of extreme hypotension (rapid pacing, balloon valvuloplasty, and valve deployment), and the manipulation of large catheters in the aorta of patients with a high prevalence of diffuse atherosclerosis with the risk of cholesterol embolization, all of them are potential risk factors for AKI. Therefore, the objectives of this study were (i) to determine the incidence, predictive factors, and prognostic value of AKI following TAVI, and (ii) to compare the occurrence of AKI in TAVI vs. SAVR in the subset of patients with pre-procedural CKD.

### The pressure is on: implications of blood pressure after aortic valve replacement [^1123J4a6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic control of blood pressure (BP) in an "all‐comer" patient population is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular mortality. 1 Recent evidence and contemporary guidelines suggest that the benefit of strict therapeutic reduction in BP (systolic BP [SBP] < 120 mm Hg and diastolic BP [DBP] < 80 mm Hg) confers additional benefit in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or those with a prior cardiovascular event. 2 Such BP control has also been shown to be beneficial in those without diabetes mellitus and aged > 75 years. 3, 4 However, in patients with aortic valve disease, a large proportion of whom are elderly patients, it is unclear whether this level of intensive BP control further improves prognosis.

Guidance for BP control in patients with significant aortic stenosis has been confusing, particularly with the fear of afterload reduction causing syncope. To date, most of the evidence for BP control before aortic valve replacement (AVR) has involved alterations to the renin‐angiotensin system. The renin‐angiotensin system has been thought to have an influence on myocardial physiological characteristics, left ventricular hypertrophy, and extent of myocardial fibrosis. There is early evidence of potential benefits in angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibition, potentially reducing the progression of aortic stenosis without causing harm. 5 Similar prognostic benefits have been found after AVR. 6

The observation that BP after AVR is an independent predictor of outcome was first described by Perlman et al, who made the association that postprocedural hypertension after transcatheter AVR (TAVR) was a predictor of a better prognosis. 7 In their study of 105 consecutive patients after TAVR, 51% had sustained increases in BP after TAVR, requiring intensification of antihypertensive treatment. 7 Patients with increased BP had an increase in stroke volume and cardiac output independent of other factors and, thereafter, a better prognosis. 7 Lindman et al, before their most recent publication, evaluated the effects of post‐TAVR hypertension using the Edwards Balloon expandable system. 8 Analyzing the Partner I trial data, they demonstrated that postprocedural hypertension was independently associated with improved survival. 8 So if hypertension after AVR indicates a good prognosis, can we deduce that hypotension is a bad thing?

Other possible associations between low BP early after AVR and a poorer long‐term outcome include impairment of left ventricular function, although the study by Lindman et al 9 showed no such correlation, which is rather surprising. The final conceivable association would be a systemic inflammatory response, particularly in the surgical AVR group, which would lower early BP values and has previously been associated with a poor long‐term outcome. 18 Again, the most recent study of Lindman et al 9 found no such relationship, with either surgical AVR or changes in systemic vascular resistance.

How could low BP early after AVR cause an adverse outcome? The first potential hypothetical mechanism involves changes in coronary flow and myocardial perfusion that occur after AVR. Low diastolic pressure may be a marker of less adequate coronary perfusion, which, in turn, would lead to subendocardial ischemia, particularly in the setting of diffuse coronary atheroma. On‐table studies after TAVR have demonstrated increases in coronary flow, most likely related to changes in systemic hemodynamics. 19 However, it is conceivable that the aortic valve prosthesis may disturb normal aortic root flow patterns and alter the blood flow impairing coronary perfusion, thus making lower diastolic perfusion pressure more deleterious. 8

The second potential causative mechanism is overtreatment. After the results of the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention) trial, efforts have intensified to control systemic pressure, in particular with evidence of the benefit of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors. 3, 5 It is possible that overmedication in the early postprocedure period will lead to systemic hypotension and reduced coronary flow, as well as renal underperfusion, which, in turn, would lead to increased adverse events.

In the spirit of Goldilocks and the 3 bears, if too high is bad and too low is bad, what then is just right? There is no doubt that hemodynamics after AVR are complex and at present not well understood. The management of BP in the post‐AVR period should, therefore, be separated from conventional BP treatment in the stable setting and tailored to the individual patient. Establishing the optimal BP range in this growing patient group is the most important clinical goal and will form a platform for further research into the mechanistic association to help us understand the most appropriate post‐AVR management. In patients after AVR, it may be reasonable to accept a more relaxed level of BP in the early postoperative period, then adopt a more intensified longer‐term approach. Clinical considerations in the management of BP early after AVR are summarized in Table.

### The pressure is on: implications of blood pressure after aortic valve replacement [^111pjMGS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Lindman et al demonstrate that low BP (both SBP and DBP) is linked to poorer outcomes after AVR via both surgical and transcatheter approaches. 9 Patients enrolled in the Medtronic intermediate, high‐ and extreme‐risk trials receiving either TAVR with a self‐expanding valve or surgical AVR were analyzed (Figure). They concluded that a DBP of 30 to < 60 mm Hg compared with a DBP of 60 to < 80 mm Hg was associated with increased all‐cause (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.23–2.14) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.52–3.00). 9 A similar association was shown for SBP, where SBP of 90 to < 120 mm Hg compared with SBP of 120 to < 150 mm Hg was again associated with increased all‐cause (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.21–2.21) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.25–2.61). 9 Why is this phenomenon observed and what are the biological explanations for this association?

Figure 1
Forest plot of adjusted hazard ratio of 1‐year all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, according to early post–aortic valve replacement (AVR) diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (all patients with transcatheter AVR and surgical AVR). 9

There is no doubt that replacement of the aortic valve in the setting of long‐standing and incrementally severe aortic stenosis brings about dramatic hemodynamic changes in the cardiovascular system. The abrupt relief of excess afterload causes immediate alterations in systolic and diastolic function, ventriculoarterial interactions, coronary blood flow, and, thus, cardiac output. These changes are now no longer masked by the confounding effects of cardiopulmonary bypass with the widespread introduction of TAVR as a mainstream therapy. The implications of changes in SBP and DBP early after AVR, which are crude markers of this complex hemodynamic environment, are likely to be different from those in the long‐term setting. The rules governing optimal BP management, therefore, may well be different after AVR, compared with those in a stable outpatient without severe valve disease.

### The pressure is on: implications of blood pressure after aortic valve replacement [^113FQtuE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The observations of Lindman and colleagues suggest that low BP either causes an adverse outcome or is associated with a clinical scenario with a less favorable prognosis. 9 There are several potential explanations as to why low BP may be associated with a poor outcome, the first of which is variation in the complex ventriculo‐aortic‐arterial interaction and the changes that occur when aortic valve stenosis is suddenly relieved. Arterial stiffness has been repeatedly associated with adverse left ventricular remodeling and a poor outcome. 10, 11, 12 The crude echocardiographic index of ejection fraction is a poor marker of myocardial contractility, which is often depressed at the time of AVR. 13 It is, therefore, conceivable that those patients with a stiffer vasculature and more pronounced ventriculoaortic interaction have lower DBP, and a consequent adverse outcome as the heart attempts to equilibrate to the new norm after AVR.

The second association is the possibility of low DBP being a marker of paravalvular leak (PVL). In the literature, the measurement of post‐TAVR PVL has been hugely variable, with the use of echocardiography, aortography, and hemodynamics all giving slightly different information. 14 Such assessment has become less uniform with the decline in peri‐TAVR transesophageal echo, which is perhaps the most accurate imaging modality in assessing PVL. 15 Moreover, many of those involved in these studies, both the device companies and enthusiastic physicians alike, have been keen to underplay its severity, particularly now that we know that more than mild aortic regurgitation after TAVR confers a poorer prognosis. 16 Transthoracic echocardiography on table is notoriously difficult in obtaining an accurate quantification of PVL, and many TAVR operators use hemodynamics to identify significant aortic regurgitation immediately after valve deployment. 17 The findings of Lindman et al 9 of an association between post‐AVR hypotension and poor outcome hold true, even when the analysis excluded those reported to have "moderate to severe PVL", but it remains possible/likely that in a population after AVR of patients with low DBP, there will be a higher prevalence of unappreciated or poorly imaged PVL, thus explaining the worse prognosis in this group. However, although this mechanism may account for the DBP association, it is more difficult to account for the relationship with SBP, although the systolic association was weaker.

### Lower blood pressure after transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement is associated with increased mortality [^117Ts6W2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

we showed that lower DBP (< 60 mm Hg) and lower SBP (< 120 mm Hg) in the first month after TAVR or SAVR are each associated with increased all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality and repeat hospitalizations. In light of these and prior findings, a randomized strategy trial may now be appropriate in patients with AS treated with AVR to determine whether patients with lower BP measurements (SBP < 120 or 130 mm Hg or DBP < 60 mm Hg) should have their medication regimen adjusted to allow their BP to rise above these levels. Given the growing number of patients with AS undergoing valve replacement and the large percentage of patients with these lower BP values, clarifying BP targets and appropriate management strategies is both timely and consequential.

### Packed red blood cell transfusion associates with acute kidney injury after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^114LYVgp]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis is a common form of degenerative valve disease and its prevalence markedly increases as people age. Many patients with aortic stenosis have comorbidities that place them at higher risk for morbidity and mortality after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). As a consequence, trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been increasingly utilized as an alternative to SAVR for aortic valve replacement in patients who are intermediate or high risk SAVR candidates. Despite being less invasive than SAVR and not requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the risk of TAVR patients developing post-procedure AKI is similar to the risk observed in SAVR patients (~ 10–30%). The occurrence of AKI is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in both SAVR and TAVR patients. It is therefore important to identify perioperative risk factors that are potentially modifiable for AKI prevention.

Various clinical risk factors have been associated in observational studies with the development of AKI after TAVR. These have included clinical variables such as chronic kidney disease, trans-apical TAVR approach, diabetes, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of myocardial infarction, leukocytosis, bleeding, and blood transfusion. Interestingly, a meta-analysis of observational studies reported that contrast media volume is not significantly associated with development of AKI after TAVR.

Transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) during cardiac surgery or TAVR may be avoided depending upon clinical management of factors such as preoperative anemia, perioperative fluid administration, and utilized transfusion thresholds. In cardiac surgical patients, pRBC transfusion has been associated with development of AKI, with perioperative anemia seeming to present an additional additive risk. Observational cohort studies examining the association between pRBC transfusion and the development of AKI after TAVR have reported conflicting results. To date, the studies that have assessed the association between pRBC transfusion and AKI after TAVR have not included peri-procedure anemia, fluid balance, intra-procedure hypotension, and intra-procedure and post-procedure inotrope/vasopressor use as potential confounders. Since lower nadir hemoglobin (Hgb), hypotension and need for inotropes or vasopressor drugs may occur in conjunction with bleeding and need for blood transfusion, it is important to assess these factors along with pRBC transfusion in order to identify what risk factors might best be targeted to prevent AKI after TAVR.

Table 1
Procedural and Postprocedural Considerations Related to Blood Pressure Management After AVR

Lindman et al 9 have demonstrated an intriguing association of post‐AVR low SBP and DBP with a poor outcome. The authors acknowledge limitations of their study, including using post hoc data from previous studies designed to answer a different question and only a crude snapshot measure (2 readings) of BP early after AVR. As such, the study has potentially raised more questions than it has answered, but it has exposed our lack of understanding of the complex hemodynamics that occur after this increasingly common intervention. It is intriguing that although the study demonstrated an increase in all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, there was no increase in myocardial infarction or stroke, raising the question: what are these patients dying of? There are several hypothesized mechanistic reasons for the association that need to be further explored, and randomized trials of "liberal" versus "intensive" BP control in the post‐AVR cohort are needed to translate these theories into clinical practice and ultimately patient benefit.

### Impact of selected comorbidities on the presentation and management of aortic stenosis [^115171AM]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent native valve disease worldwide, affecting approximately 3.4% of elderly individuals in Europe and the USA. Patients with severe AS who do not undergo timely aortic valve replacement (AVR) face an extremely poor prognosis; this is particularly true following symptom onset, at which point average survival is just 2–3 years. Consequently, rapid, effective management is paramount.

Current European guidelines recommend that AVR be performed in patients with AS that are symptomatic, experience symptoms/hypotension during exercise testing, and/or that have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%. However, despite the ever-growing availability of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) as a minimally invasive alternative to surgical AVR (SAVR), studies suggest that up to 40% of patients with severe AS still do not receive either of these life-saving interventions. The reason for this appears to be multifactorial, though a high comorbidity burden has been suggested as a key driver. Furthermore, certain comorbidities may have clinical presentations resembling those of AS. To the best of our knowledge, no formal investigations into such effects have been carried out to date.

The aim of this analysis therefore was to assess the impact of comorbidities on disease presentation and management decisions in patients with severe AS.

### Intraoperative hypotension and delirium among older adults undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^115GbmF4]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In summary, IOH was common during TAVR, and patients who developed POD had higher AUTs based on all predefined five MBP thresholds. Patients with POD compared with patients without POD after TAVR had a higher operative risk, smaller aortic valve area, suffered more from carotid stenosis, and underwent frequently non‐transfemoral TAVR with general anesthesia. In the multivariable analyses, IOH was however not associated with POD after TAVR when adjusted for possible confounding factors, as the observed effects were clinically irrelevant. Neither was IOH associated with POD according to the type of anesthesia: the effects were small with limited clinical relevance, but with very large uncertainties in their estimates.

Due to the lack of widely accepted uniform definition of IOH, and different settings and outcome, it is difficult to define a common 'cutoff' for IOH associated adverse postoperative outcomes. In the 2012 ACCF/AATS/SCAI/STS expert consensus document on TAVR, maintenance of an MBP of > 75 mmHg (or systolic blood pressure of at least 120 mmHg) during TAVR has been advised. In the current study, we analyzed data according to the five frequently used hypotension definitions pending a widely accepted definition of IOH.

Our findings that IOH was not associated with POD may be explained by adaptation in older adults with severe aortic valve stenosis to chronic reduced cardiac output and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Recent studies show an immediate increase in cardiac output and cerebral blood flow following TAVR, suggesting a reserved or even decreased cerebral blood flow pre‐TAVR. Our findings put forward the hypothesis that a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion pre‐TAVR may result into tolerance to an acute drop in IOH with a short duration during TAVR, a phenomenon called brain ischemic preconditioning. Another factor that may explain our findings is the so‐called physiologic cerebral autoregulation, which alleviates a possible neurocognitive harmful effect of IOH. Future prospective studies are needed to investigate the abovementioned hypothesis following TAVR.

A strength of this study is that we used continuous variables during TAVR in order to reduce loss of information, and analyzed them with restricted cubic splines. Another strength is that a multiple imputation method was used for missing data. Furthermore, In order to minimize overfitting and optimize model performance, penalization and bootstrapping methods were used.

### Intraoperative hypotension and delirium among older adults undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^111KtKP7]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

There are however several important limitations of this study. First, this is an analysis of retrospectively collected data with inherent limitations. Therefore, our results should be interpreted as hypothesis generating. Second, in the majority of cases delirium was diagnosed using DOS scores combined with clinical features. According to the local protocol, DOS scores should be registered during every shift. However, in some patients, DOS scores were not reported and/or were missing. Moreover, by using DOS scores, the hypoactive type of delirium may be easily overlooked. Third, we have excluded patients without POD assessment, which could have led to an under‐ or overestimation of the number of delirium cases in this study. Fourth, there may have also been other time‐dependent, which could influence the incidence of delirium that we did not include in our analyses, such as blood pressure variability during rapid ventricular pacing. To facilitate precise prosthesis positioning and to reduce the risk of device embolization and malpositioning, rapid ventricular pacing is required during valve deployment for temporary reduction in cardiac output, transvalvular flow, and cardiac motion. Rapid ventricular pacing was found to be associated with transient IOH, cerebral perfusion disturbances, and POD after TAVR. Finally, our post hoc sensitivity analysis was underpowered due to the small sample size of patients undergoing TAVR with general anesthesia. Therefore, larger studies are needed to assess the effect of general anesthesia on delirium occurrence after TAVR.

In conclusion, this study shows that IOH is frequent during TAVR. Our findings do not suggest an association between IOH during TAVR and delirium thereafter. Other potential factors rather than intraoperative hypotension may explain the development of delirium among older adults undergoing this treatment.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement: current status and future directions [^113ThMVT]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a revolutionary therapy for patients with aortic stenosis. Large registries and randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that TAVR is safe and effective in patients considered inoperable because of severe comorbidities and those who are high-risk surgical candidates. As TAVR evolves for lower-risk patients, attention will need to focus on reducing the rates of vascular injury, stroke, and paravalvular regurgitation. In this review, we discuss the status of TAVR in clinical practice, including patient selection, preoperative evaluation, techniques, and complications.

Given the potential inter-relations between peri-procedure pRBC transfusion, fluid balance, anemia, hypotension and vasoactive drug administration, this study aimed to assess if pRBC transfusion as well as these other potential risk factors associate with the development of AKI after TAVR. The primary hypothesis of this study is that pRBC transfusion associates with AKI after TAVR even after adjusting for other clinical parameters such as peri-procedure anemia and the use of vasoactive drugs.

### Lower blood pressure after transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement is associated with increased mortality [^1148EwyC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In 2897 patients with severe symptomatic AS undergoing SAVR or TAVR, we showed that lower DBP (< 60 mm Hg) and SBP (< 120 mm Hg) in the first month after AVR were associated with increased 30‐day to 1‐year all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality and a higher rate of hospital readmission. These associations were significant after adjustment, in sensitivity analyses excluding patients with moderate or severe aortic regurgitation, and across multiple subgroups. Between the 2, lower DBP had the stronger association with adverse outcomes. Sustained DBP < 60 mm Hg (at discharge and 30 days) was associated with the highest 30‐day to 1‐year mortality. Notably, early post‐AVR DBP < 60 mm Hg and SBP < 120 mm Hg were common, observed in 30% and 21% of the cohort, respectively. Many patients with lower blood pressure values were taking ≥ 1 blood pressure lowering medications. Collectively, these data combined with other reports suggest that invigorated attention to blood pressure after AVR is warranted to optimize outcomes and that blood pressure goals in these patients may need to be higher than in the general population. These findings are particularly relevant as recent observational studies have suggested a potential benefit of inhibitors of the renin‐angiotensin system after AVR without specifically considering any lower blood pressure limits. 9, 10, 11

### Transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and non-randomised trials [^113RDAhU]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Need for a permanent pacemaker and post procedural atrial fibrillation

Owing to the proximity of the infranodal conduction system to the aortic valvular apparatus, patients with AS frequently present with atrioventricular conduction abnormalities (AVCA). In addition, the procedure itself may lead to temporary or permanent injury resulting in AVCA with the need for prolonged monitoring and/or a high rate of permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation after TAVR. The rates of AVCA reported after SAVR are lower and a PPM is implanted in only 3–4% of patients undergoing SAVR. Cao et al found a 3.5-fold increased risk (13.2% vs 3.0%; p = 0.0003) of pacemaker need in patients undergoing TAVR compared to SAVR. Our study presents similar findings; however, the significance was lost on performing a subgroup analysis for statistically sound studies, which was not done by Cao et al.

Postprocedural AF is a predictor of long-term mortality in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Earlier studies revealed a significant reduction of left atrial pressure in the first postoperative days after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis.TAVR allows one to avoid most of the factors causing AF after standard open AVR, such as the inflammatory effect of cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest, part of the postoperative increase of adrenergic tone and pericarditis. The fact that patients with TAVR experience less periprocedural AF than those receiving AVR is not unexpected. Motloch et al reported that the prevalence of post procedural AF was significantly lower in the TAVR group (6.0%, vs 33.7% after SAVR, p < 0.05). A lower incidence of new-onset AF was observed in the TAVR cohort (OR = 0.353, 95% CI = 0.148 to 0.842) in our analysis, which is consistent with the aforementioned hypothesis.

Acute renal failure and aortic regurgitation

AKI after cardiac surgery is an autonomous predictor of mortality. Contrast to cholesterol embolisation, hypotension (rapid pacing, balloon valvuloplasty and valve deployment) are risk factors for acute renal failure. In our study, however, the incidence of AKI was similar in both clusters. Patients who underwent TAVR had a higher risk of developing moderate or severe aortic regurgitation, which is inversely related to survival.

### Packed red blood cell transfusion associates with acute kidney injury after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^112y2Uuq]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

AKI is known to be associated with increased risk of mortality and renal and non-renal morbidities following TAVR. Despite the less invasive trans-catheter approach versus open SAVR with CPB, 17.2% of the TAVR patients in this study developed post-TAVR AKI. Similar to what has been reported in other TAVR cohorts, most of the AKI observed in this study was Stage 1 AKI. However, even Stage 1 AKI is associated with increased mortality in ambulatory, non-cardiac surgery, cardiac surgery and TAVR patients. Thus, it is important to identify risk factors that can potentially be modified to mitigate development of AKI after TAVR.

In this study we found that pRBCs transfusion during the TAVR procedure or the first 24 h after TAVR significantly associates with the occurrence of post-TAVR AKI. This was true even after adjusting for other clinical parameters including pre-TAVR eGFR, nadir measured peri-procedure Hgb, and post-procedure inotrope and vasopressor use. Just over one-fourth of our TAVR cohort underwent pRBC transfusion. This transfusion rate is similar to or lower than the rates of pRBC transfusion that have been reported in other TAVR cohort studies. Several prior TAVR cohort studies and a recent meta-analysis have also reported significant associations between pRBC transfusion and development of AKI. What differentiates our study from prior studies is that we concurrently assessed the associations between intra-procedure hypotension, peri-procedure anemia, and inotrope/vasopressor usage with occurrence of post-TAVR AKI. These are additional factors that could potentially affect perfusion and oxygen delivery to the kidneys, predisposing to AKI.

### Lower blood pressure after transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement is associated with increased mortality [^115nh9Rz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For patients with aortic stenosis (AS), the American and European guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease recommend treating hypertension according to standard blood pressure guidelines. 1, 2 In patients with a history of AS who have undergone aortic valve replacement (AVR), the valve guidelines provide no specific recommendations for blood pressure management. 1, 2

Accordingly, the treatment of blood pressure in patients with AS or in patients with a history of AS treated with AVR matches those in the general population. 3 The recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association blood pressure guidelines define normal blood pressure as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 80 mm Hg. 3 Prescription of blood pressure‐lowering medication is recommended for patients with stage I hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg or DBP 80–89 mm Hg) and with a prior cardiovascular event or at high risk for one. These criteria would apply to most patients with AS before and after AVR. 3 Other large meta‐analyses recommend a target SBP < 130 mm Hg as well. 4, 5 The SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) showed that targeting an SBP < 120 mm Hg yields better clinical outcomes than a target of < 140 mm Hg, a finding which was also observed in patients aged > 75 years regardless of their relative fitness or frailty. 6, 7 In patients treated with AVR, it would seem advantageous to try to treat hypertension to optimize unloading of the left ventricle as an adjunct to unloading from valve replacement. 8 Furthermore, several retrospective observational studies have shown improved long‐term clinical outcomes for patients taking inhibitors of the renin‐angiotensin system after AVR. 9, 10, 11 However, we recently observed that lower SBP (SBP 100–129 mm Hg compared with SBP 130–170 mm Hg) after transcatheter AVR (TAVR) was associated with increased mortality, even after multivariable adjustment, raising concern about optimal blood pressure targets after valve replacement in patients with AS. 12

In the present study, we aimed to clarify the relationship between blood pressure and clinical outcomes in a large group of patients with AS treated with TAVR or surgical AVR (SAVR). We analyzed the relationships between SBP and DBP and clinical outcomes separately and looked for thresholds below or above which risk increased. We hypothesized that lower SBP and DBP measurements, including levels commonly targeted in blood pressure guidelines, would be associated with increased mortality. These findings could have important implications for establishing specific blood pressure targets in patients with AS treated with AVR.

### Lower blood pressure after transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement is associated with increased mortality [^1124EzRU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

These findings confirm and extend those recently made from the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) trial and other smaller studies. 12, 17 In the PARTNER analysis, among patients undergoing TAVR with severe symptomatic AS at high or prohibitive risk for surgery, an SBP of 100 to 129 mm Hg compared with 130 to 170 mm Hg at 30 days after TAVR was associated with higher 30‐day to 1‐year all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality. Further, compared with an SBP of 130 to 139 mm Hg, 30‐day SBP 100 to 109, 110 to 119, and 120 to 129 mm Hg were each associated with increased mortality in adjusted analyses, whereas 30‐day SBP 140 to 149, 150 to 159, and 160 to 169 mm Hg were not. An association between lower 30‐day DBP and increased mortality was also observed, even after adjustment for 30‐day SBP and other clinical factors. The findings reported here not only confirm these prior observations in a larger study population and extend them to one including patients at intermediate risk for surgery and those undergoing SAVR, they also emphasize the importance of considering DBP and not just SBP. We also examined other relevant clinical end points, including non‐cardiovascular mortality, repeat hospitalization, stroke, and myocardial infarction and considered whether additional clinical factors (eg, frailty, valve size, TAVR versus SAVR, and aortic dimensions) might alter the relationship between blood pressure and mortality. We observed relatively modest correlations between pre‐AVR SBP and early post‐AVR SBP (0.32) and between pre‐AVR DBP and early post‐AVR DBP (0.28), emphasizing the known effects of valve replacement on the arterial tree. 18 Based on the sensitivity and interaction analyses, our findings are unlikely to be confounded or altered by paravalvular AR or LV function, neither of which was associated with mortality in this cohort. While the significance of paravalvular AR may be underappreciated by transthoracic echocardiography and the mean early post‐AVR DBPs may be lower than expected, the early post‐AVR DBPs are similar to those observed in other series and unlikely to be substantially related to post‐AVR AR because those undergoing TAVR and SAVR experienced a similar 5 mm Hg drop in DBP after the procedure and significant AR occurs rarely after SAVR. 12 With weak correlations between both early post‐AVR SBP and DBP and clinical, frailty, and echocardiographic parameters, it remains unclear what factors underlie a lower blood pressure after AVR.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers after transcatheter aortic valve Replacement: a meta-analysis [^111HEzyQ]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our meta-analysis comparing clinical outcomes of patients with and without ACEIs/ARBs after TAVR, we found that patients receiving ACEIs/ARBs had a lower risk of both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, as well as postprocedural, new-onset AF (Central Illustration). There were no differences in risk of other secondary outcomes, including AKI. These findings of clinical benefit without greater risk of adverse events provide further evidence supporting the use of ACEIs/ARBs after TAVR, a practice which still lacks consensus.

Central Illustration
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement

Meta-analysis of 10 studies comparing outcomes of patients receiving ACEIs/ARBs after TAVR (intervention), compared with those who did not (control). The intervention group had lower all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and new-onset atrial fibrillation compared with the control group. ACEI = angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB = angiotensin receptor blocker; TAVR = transcatheter aortic valve replacement; TIA = transient ischemic attack.

AS involves the entire heart, not just the aortic valve. Central to its pathology is compensatory LVH, which results in compromised subendocardial perfusion, causing myocardial fibrosis. Progression of this fibrosis, along with myocyte necrosis eventually cause decompensation and HF. Given that angiotensin II and aldosterone are key mediators of these pathological processes, ACEIs/ARBs could aid outcomes. Yet, for a long time, ACEIs/ARBs were avoided in AS for fear of severe hypotension in the setting of ventricular outflow obstruction. With time, clinical evidence of good tolerability, as well as delayed progression of AS and regression of LVH accumulated, proving earlier fears were unfounded. ACEIs/ARBs are now considered for AS before replacement, but there are no guidelines regarding their use after TAVR.

### Packed red blood cell transfusion associates with acute kidney injury after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^115ea5hM]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

There are multiple biologic characteristics of pRBCs and physiologic responses to transfusion that support the concept of pRBC transfusion as a putative cause of AKI. Stored allogenic pRBCs undergo changes in shape and deformability that can decrease oxygen delivery to tissues such as the kidney. Plasma levels of the inflammatory biomarkers bactericidal permeability increasing protein (BPI) and interleukin-6 have also been reported to be significantly elevated in patients who received pRBCs. An in vivo study by Donadee et al identified storage mediated hemolysis causing impaired vascular function due to endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstriction. RBC hemolysis occurs during pRBC storage and following transfusion can lead to increase in plasma free Hgb and iron which cause dysfunction of microcirculation.

pRBC transfusion has been associated with postoperative AKI or reduced postoperative eGFR in several observational studies of patients who underwent cardiac surgery with CPB. These studies found that preoperative anemia and nadir intraoperative Hgb significantly associate with development of AKI. In our study, nadir Hgb did not remain significantly associated with post-TAVR AKI in the multivariable analysis. Additional larger prospective studies may be warranted to assess for interactive influence of peri-procedural anemia and transfusion in TAVR patients.

To our knowledge no prior study of TAVR patients has assessed the impact of intra-procedure hypotension on development of post-TAVR AKI. One cohort study of 213 TAVR patients did assess the occurrence of any procedural complication that led to severe sustained hypotension and assessed the association between such occurrences and development of AKI. They did not observe an association between such complications and development of post-TAVR AKI, but only 10 patients experienced these complications. We assessed occurrence of MAP < 60 mmHg for greater than or equal to 5 min and also added up the total minutes in all hypotensive episodes that lasted greater than or equal to 5 consecutive minutes. Neither of these intra-procedure hypotension variables significantly associated with AKI in our TAVR cohort. Some have hypothesized that rapid ventricular pacing during TAVR procedure (i.e. period of no blood pressure) may be associated with development of post-TAVR AKI. We did not observe a significant association between rapid pacing and development of post-TAVR AKI, a finding consistent with several other TAVR studies.

### Acute hemodynamic compromise after transcatheter aortic valve replacement due to dynamic left ventricle obstruction: a systematic review [^117NKWzX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute hemodynamic compromise after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) because of dynamic left ventricle (LV) obstruction (LVO), also known as suicide LV, is an infrequent but severe complication of TAVR that is poorly defined in previous studies. Understanding this complication is essential for its prompt diagnosis and optimal treatment. We conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Medline databases for studies describing acute hemodynamic compromise after TAVR because of dynamic LVO or suicide LV. Each study was reviewed by 2 authors individually for eligibility, and a third author resolved disagreements. From a total of 506 studies, 25 publications were considered for the final analysis. The majority of patients with this condition were women demonstrating a hypertrophic septum, a small ventricle, and hyperdynamic contractility on pre-TAVR echocardiographic assessment. An intraventricular gradient before TAVR was found in half of the cases. Acute hemodynamic compromise after TAVR because of dynamic LVO manifested mainly as significant hypotension and occurred most often immediately after valve deployment. The LV outflow tract was the most common site of obstruction. Advanced therapies were required in nearly 65% of the cases. In conclusion, acute hemodynamic compromise after TAVR because of dynamic LVO occurred almost invariably in women. Echocardiography before TAVR may offer essential information to anticipate this complication. LV outflow tract obstruction appears to carry the highest risk of developing this phenomenon. Advanced therapies should be promptly considered as a bailout strategy in patients with hemodynamic collapse refractory to medical therapy.

### Acute kidney injury post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^1113iq2z]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a treatment option in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis who are not surgical candidates. In light of emerging evidence, it is being increasingly performed even in intermediate-risk patients in recent years. Patients who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) following TAVR are known to have worse outcomes. The objective of this concise review was to identify the prevalence and the impact of AKI following TAVR on patient outcomes by including the most recent literature in our search. After a thorough search on MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and PubMed, we included all literature relevant to AKI following TAVR. We found that AKI was caused by a variety of reasons, such as hemodynamic instability during rapid pacing, blood transfusion, periprocedural embolization, and use of contrast medium, to name a few. In patients who developed AKI following TAVR, 30-day and 1-year mortality were increased. Further, in these patients, length and cost of hospital stay were increased as well. Preventive measures such as optimal periprocedural hydration, careful contrast use, and techniques to prevent embolization during device implantation have been tried with limited success. Given that TAVR is expected to be increasingly performed, this review aimed to summarize the rapidly expanding currently available literature in an effort to reduce procedural complications and thereby improve patient outcomes.

### Impact of rapid ventricular pacing on outcome after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^115Z9Ag5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of the present study indicate that the majority of TAVR patients undergo RVP during the procedure. Performance of 1 or 2 RVP episodes during the procedure seems safe and does not increase the risk for early or late adverse events. However, performance of ≥ 3 RVP episodes is associated with increased risk for peri‐procedural AKI, and atrial fibrillation, as well as higher in‐hospital and 1‐year mortality.

Furthermore, assessment of RVP according to total pacing duration showed similar results, irrespective of number of pacing episodes. Longer pacing duration was associated with prolonged procedural hypotension, peri‐procedural AKI, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Longer RVP duration was also associated with higher in‐hospital and 1‐year mortality.

The high rates of RVP shown in the present study (87% of the procedures) are attributable to the multiple indications for RVP during TAVR. Performance of RVP is required during implantation of balloon expandable transcatheter heart valves to transiently diminish cardiac output, thus allowing accurate deployment of the transcatheter heart valve without the risk of dislodgement because of cardiac output. RVP is also required during TAVR with other transcatheter heart valve systems, when balloon pre‐ or post‐dilatation of the aortic valve is required. Furthermore, several studies have suggested that a long period of RVP which allows for controlled deployment of balloon expandable valves may improve the positioning accuracy of the valve. 6

Rapid ventricular pacing diminishes cardiac output, causing transient hypotension. As with any hypotensive period, RVP may have adverse clinical impact. However, even though RVP is routinely performed during the majority of TAVR procedures, current data on the clinical impact of RVP during TAVR are limited to small numbers of patients with surrogate end points. 1, 2, 4, 7 Few studies have correlated RVP with a clinical end point. A sub‐analysis of the PARTNER trial found that in the subgroup of patients undergoing transapical TAVR, a greater number of pacing runs (not pacing duration) showed intermediate association with higher risk for stroke. 3 Similarly, a report from the CoreValve trials indicated a higher risk of stroke in patients who underwent RVP for predilation of the aortic valve versus those who did not. 8 The findings of the present study show a similar trend with increased rates of stroke with longer duration of RVP but further expand the scope of understanding the consequences of RVP.

### Post-procedural hypertension following transcatheter aortic valve implantation: incidence and clinical significance [^116Mck2L]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to investigate the blood pressure (BP) response after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and its correlation with short- and mid-term clinical outcomes.

Background

TAVI is an emerging therapy for aortic stenosis patients at high surgical risk. The acute hemodynamic sequelae of this procedure and their clinical relevance are yet unclear.

Methods

Consecutive patients who underwent TAVI in a single center were prospectively monitored for BP response during 5 post-procedural days. Clinical parameters, adverse events, and medical treatment were recorded during hospitalization, at 30 days, and at 12 months after the procedure. Patients were divided according to their post-procedural BP response into 2 groups: increased BP and stable BP.

Results

One hundred and five patients were analyzed. Overall, systolic BP increased immediately after TAVI in the entire cohort by an average of 15 ± 31 mm Hg. This rise was sustained and led to intensification of antihypertensive treatment in 53 patients (51%); these patients were designated as the increased BP group. The increase in systolic BP after TAVI was associated with an increase in stroke volume and cardiac output and was not related to age, baseline cardiac function, or procedural outcomes. Patients with increased BP after TAVI had a significantly better prognosis with fewer adverse events in the hospital (21% vs. 62%, p < 0.01), after 30 days (30% vs. 71%, p < 0.01), and after 12 months (53% vs. 83%, p < 0.01) as compared with patients with stable BP.

Conclusions

After TAVI, a substantial number of patients have a significant rise in systolic BP necessitating long-term treatment. This increase in BP is associated with an increase in cardiac output and predicts a better clinical outcome.

### Packed red blood cell transfusion associates with acute kidney injury after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^1114wq2w]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

We assessed hypotension in the intraoperative period but not in the postoperative period, as minute-to-minute post-TAVR blood pressures were not available for our retrospective study cohort. We did find that post-procedure inotrope/vasopressor use was independently associated with development of AKI. Inotrope/vasopressor drug use and its association with AKI has been studied in the cardiac surgical literature with mixed results. A study by Haase et al. did not find an association between vasopressor administration and AKI in patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery. A study by Magruder et al. investigating patients who developed AKI following cardiac surgery with CPB showed higher epinephrine dose on ICU arrival and greater total administered dose of epinephrine and norepinephrine in patients who developed postoperative AKI. Porhomayon et al. found a significantly higher incidence of AKI following vasopressin use during coronary artery bypass graft surgery with CPB.

It is not uncommon to administer inotropes and vasopressor drugs during the TAVR procedure in order to offset transient effects of anesthesia and/or rapid ventricular pacing. Interestingly, in our study the number of concurrent inotropes and vasopressors administered during the TAVR procedure was not associated with development of post-TAVR AKI. However, maximum number of required concurrent inotropes or vasopressors administered after the TAVR procedure was an independent predictor of AKI. This finding warrants further prospective study of the impact of post-TAVR inotropes and vasopressors with a prospectively defined protocol for how inotropes and vasopressors are dosed and when multiple inotropes and vasopressors are administered. Future study also appears warranted to address whether it is post-TAVR hypotension, low cardiac output, or the vasoconstrictive effects of these drugs (or a combination of all of these factors) that predisposes to AKI.

### Emergent use of impella CP ™ during transcatheter aortic valve replacement: transaortic access [^113peq8B]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2015). Low credibility.

Sudden onset of hypotension is a rare but emergent event in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This primarily occurs due to coronary artery obstruction, valve misplacement/migration, ventricular perforation, cardiac tamponade, severe paravalvular regurgitation, stunned myocardium, ventricular arrhythmia, and annulus rupture. While the operator makes an attempt to identify and correct the underlying problem, an emergent placement of mechanical hemodynamic assist device may be necessary and crucial for a successful outcome. We describe a unique and challenging case of complete circulatory collapse in a patient undergoing transaortic TAVR with Edwards SAPIEN prosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences, CA) who required rescue Impella CP™ (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) placement directly through the ascending aorta due to unfavorable femoral access.

Methods

The data, analytic methods, and study materials are owned by the sponsor and will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure.

Study Population

Among 3033 patients with severe, symptomatic AS at intermediate, high, or extreme surgical risk who underwent SAVR or TAVR in a previously published clinical trial, 2897 patients with a SBP recorded at discharge or 30 days were included in this analysis. There were no patients alive at 30 days without a discharge or 30‐day SBP. Patients were excluded for: an early post‐AVR SBP (average of the discharge and 30‐day measurements) of < 90 mm Hg (n = 2) or ≥ 180 mm Hg (n = 14); or death before 30 days (n = 113); or withdrawal or loss to follow‐up (n = 7). The design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, definitions for clinical variables, and primary results of the extreme, high risk, and intermediate risk trials including patients considered for this analysis have been reported. 13, 14, 15 The study protocols were approved by the institutional review board at each enrolling site, and all patients provided written informed consent.

Blood Pressure, Vascular Parameters, and Echocardiography

Heart rate and blood pressure measurements were obtained before AVR at a baseline clinical visit and after AVR at discharge and 30 days. Early post‐AVR measurements reflect an average of discharge and 30‐day values when both were available (96% of patients) or only one of them. Mean arterial pressure was calculated as: diastolic blood pressure+(1/3×pulse pressure). 3 Systemic arterial compliance, systemic vascular resistance, and valvuloarterial impedance were calculated as described previously. 12 These parameters, which required measurements from an echocardiogram, were obtained before AVR using measurements from the baseline echocardiogram and after AVR using measurements from the discharge echocardiogram. All echocardiograms were evaluated and measurements made by a core laboratory.

Clinical End Points

Our primary end point was all‐cause death between 30 days and 1 year after AVR. Secondary end points included cardiovascular death, non‐cardiovascular death, aortic valve‐related hospitalizations, stroke, and myocardial infarction between 30 days and 1 year and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary score, left ventricular (LV) mass index, LV ejection fraction (LVEF), and 6‐minute walk distance 1 year after AVR.

### Lower blood pressure after transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement is associated with increased mortality [^112dTNRq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Blood pressure (BP) guidelines for patients with aortic stenosis or a history of aortic stenosis treated with aortic valve replacement (AVR) match those in the general population, but this extrapolation may not be warranted. Methods and Results Among patients enrolled in the Medtronic intermediate, high, and extreme risk trials, we included those with a transcatheter AVR (n = 1794) or surgical AVR (n = 1103) who were alive at 30 days. The associations between early (average of discharge and 30 day post-AVR) systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) measurements and clinical outcomes between 30 days and 1 year were evaluated. Among 2897 patients, after adjustment, spline curves demonstrated an association between lower SBP (< 120 mm Hg, representing 21% of patients) and DBP (< 60 mm Hg, representing 30% of patients) and increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and repeat hospitalization. These relationships were unchanged when patients with moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation post-AVR were excluded. After adjustment, compared with DBP 60 to < 80 mm Hg, DBP 30 to < 60 mm Hg was associated with increased all-cause (adjusted hazard ratio 1.62, 95% CI 1.23–2.14) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2.13, 95% CI 1.52–3.00), but DBP 80 to < 100 mm Hg was not. Similarly, after adjustment, compared with SBP 120 to < 150 mm Hg, SBP 90 to < 120 mm Hg was associated with increased all-cause (adjusted hazard ratio 1.63, 95% CI 1.21–2.21) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.81, 95% CI 1.25–2.61), but SBP 150 to < 180 mm Hg was not. Conclusions Lower BP in the first month after transcatheter AVR or surgical AVR is common and associated with increased mortality and repeat hospitalization. Clarifying optimal BP targets in these patients ought to be a priority and may improve patient outcomes. Clinical Trial Registration Information URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

### Who can we save after an intraprocedural catastrophe during TAVR? [^112z6BYg]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Intraprocedural catastrophes during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are associated with a high mortality. Even "operable patients" can suddenly be deemed inoperable during an intraprocedural TAVR complication. The low incidence of a major complication prevents "crowd learning"; consequently, a high-volume TAVR center will have the greatest capability for a robust salvage response.

### Mechanisms and management of TAVR-related complications [^1177oiJ1]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at high surgical risk or not considered to be suitable candidates for surgical aortic valve replacement are increasingly being treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Although this novel treatment modality has been proven to be effective in this patient population, serious complications occur in approximately one-third of patients during the month after the procedure. Such events include myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, vascular complications, bleeding, acute kidney injury, valve regurgitation, valve malpositioning, coronary obstruction, and conduction disturbances and arrhythmias, which can all lead to death. Prevention of these complications should be based on patient screening and selection by a dedicated 'heart team' and the use of multimodality imaging. Anticipation and early recognition of these complications, followed by prompt management using a wide range of percutaneous or surgical rescue interventions, is vital to patient outcome. Continuous patient assessment and reporting of complications according to standardized definitions, in addition to growing operator experience and upcoming technological refinements, will hopefully reduce the future rate of complications related to this procedure.

### Acute effects of transcatheter aortic valve replacement on central aortic hemodynamics in patients with severe aortic stenosis [^114GAa7v]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Severe aortic stenosis induces abnormalities in central aortic pressure, with consequent impaired organ and tissue perfusion. Relief of aortic stenosis by transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is associated with both a short- and long-term hypertensive response. Counterintuitively, patients who are long-term normotensive post-TAVR have a worsened prognosis compared with patients with hypertension, yet the underlying mechanisms are not understood. We investigated immediate changes in invasively measured left ventricular and central aortic pressure post-TAVR in patients with severe aortic stenosis using aortic reservoir pressure, wave intensity analysis, and indices of aortic function. Fifty-four patients (mean age 83.6 ± 6.2 years, 50.0% female) undergoing TAVR were included. We performed reservoir pressure and wave intensity analysis on invasively acquired pressure waveforms from the ascending aorta and left ventricle immediately pre- and post-TAVR. Following TAVR, there were increases in systolic, diastolic, mean, and pulse aortic pressures (all P < 0.05). Post-TAVR reservoir pressure was unchanged (54.5 ± 12.4 versus 56.6 ± 14.0 mm Hg, P = 0.30) whereas excess pressure increased 47% (29.0 ± 10.9 versus 42.6 ± 15.5 mm Hg, P < 0.001). Wave intensity analysis (arbitrary units, au) demonstrated increased forward compression wave (64.9 ± 35.5 versus 124.4 ± 58.9, ×10³ au, P < 0.001), backward compression wave (11.6 ± 5.5 versus 14.4 ± 6.9, ×10³ au, P = 0.01) and forward expansion wave energies (43.2 ± 27.3 versus 82.8 ± 53.1, ×10³ au, P < 0.001). Subendocardial viability ratio improved with aortic function effectively unchanged post-TAVR. Increased central aortic pressure following TAVR relates to increased transmitted power and energy to the proximal aorta with increased excess pressure but unchanged reservoir pressure. These changes provide a potential mechanism for the improved prognosis associated with relative hypertension post-TAVR.

### Lower blood pressure after transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement is associated with increased mortality [^112inxp3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. Although this analysis averages 2 blood pressure values taken in the early post‐AVR period (discharge and 30 day), that is still a relatively limited number to characterize a patient's blood pressure. Blood pressure measurements were obtained according to the standard of care at each site and not standardized. Medication data were captured inconsistently across the trials and only β‐blockers and renin‐angiotensin system antagonists were routinely categorized, limiting our analyses on the potential relationship between blood pressure and medications. However, this limitation means that our assessment of the proportion of patients with lower blood pressure values who are on blood pressure‐lowering medications is an underestimate. The actual number of patients with low SBP or DBP measurements early post‐AVR who are on ≥ 1 blood pressure‐lowering medications is likely higher. Finally, this is a retrospective analysis and our findings could be influenced by unmeasured confounders.

### Coil embolization to successfully treat annular rupture during transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^113TAfoP]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Aortic annular rupture is one of the most feared complications of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This complication often presents as sudden cardiac tamponade with hypotension and requires urgent intervention. The traditional rescue strategy for such cases is emergency surgical intervention, yet the mortality remains high considering most patients who undergo TAVR are not candidates for open heart surgery. As such, there is a need for percutaneous alternatives to treat this critical complication. Here, we describe a case of annular rupture during TAVR that was successfully treated with coil embolization at the rupture site. This case illustrates the use of coil embolization as a treatment strategy in patients with acute aortic annular rupture who are at high-risk for surgical intervention.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intraprocedural monitoring and supportive care include invasive access, defibrillation readiness, temperature management, volume status optimization, pulmonary hypertension rescue therapy, and infection prophylaxis. "At least 1 large-volume line is obtained peripherally or centrally". "Immediate access to a defibrillator device is necessary because ventricular fibrillation can occur with manipulation of catheters within the heart or with rapid ventricular pacing", and "Routine steps to prevent significant hypothermia are recommended". Regarding fluids, "Unless otherwise indicated, volume status needs to be supplemented, as patients in this age group are usually volume depleted", but "both volume overload and depletion can be problematic", and multimodal monitoring "can guide tailored therapy". For severe pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular failure, "Inhaled nitric oxide or inhaled epoprostenol should be readily available". "Routine surgical antibiotic prophylaxis administered prior to surgical incision or vascular access is warranted to decrease the risk of wound infection and endocarditis".

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in intermediate-and low-risk patients [^114zs6oD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Initially restricted to high‐risk and inoperable patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly being offered to younger and lower‐risk patients with fewer comorbidities who are otherwise good operative candidates and until now would have undergone surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). This evolution in clinical practice is underpinned by robust evidence, but do the data support the universal use of TAVR in all patients with AS, or is there still a role for surgery? In this review, we will review the data of TAVR in operable patients, examine potential limitations of TAVR in younger patients, and highlight the areas in which more research is required.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis staging for TAVR candidates — patients considered for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) should have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) (Stage D). Symptomatic severe high-gradient AS (Stage D1) is characterized by an aortic velocity of 4.0 m/s or higher and a mean transaortic gradient of 40 mm Hg or higher, with typical valve areas ≤ 1.0 cm² and indexed ≤ 0.6 cm²/m². Stage D2 severe symptomatic low-flow low-gradient AS with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (< 50%) is defined by a severely calcified valve and aortic valve area ≤ 1.0 cm², with aortic velocity < 4.0 m/s at rest that increases to at least 4.0 m/s on low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography. Stage D3 severe symptomatic low-flow low-gradient AS with normal LVEF is defined as aortic valve area ≤ 1.0 cm² with aortic velocity < 4.0 m/s and mean gradient < 40 mm Hg; key features include indexed aortic valve area ≤ 0.6 cm²/m² and stroke volume index < 35 ml/m², with confirmation when the patient is normotensive and no other explanation for symptoms.

Results

Patient Population

Among 2897 patients included in this analysis with severe, symptomatic AS at intermediate, high, or extreme surgical risk receiving SAVR or TAVR, 578 were treated in the pivotal extreme risk trial, 706 were treated in the pivotal high‐risk randomized trial, and 1613 were treated in the pivotal intermediate risk trial. Table 1 shows baseline characteristics and correlations with early post‐AVR SBP and DBP for the whole population and the patients undergoing TAVR and SAVR. The correlation between discharge and 30‐day SBP was 0.24 and the correlation between discharge and 30‐day DBP was 0.23. The clinical characteristics were as expected for this patient population. Although there are statistically significant correlations between many of the parameters and early post‐AVR SBP and DBP, these correlations are uniformly weak. Interestingly, the correlation between pre‐AVR SBP and early post‐AVR SBP is 0.32 and the correlation between pre‐AVR DBP and early post‐AVR DBP is 0.28. Table 2 shows data on post‐AVR vascular and echocardiographic parameters. While there are some expected correlations between early post‐AVR SBP and DBP with other vascular parameters, the correlations with echocardiographic parameters are notably weak. The correlation between early post‐AVR SBP and DBP was 0.35. SBP and DBP are reported for pre‐AVR, discharge, and 30‐day time points in Table S3.

### Impact of rapid ventricular pacing on outcome after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^116PxCph]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Consecutive patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent transfemoral TAVR from 2008 to 2016 at Sheba Medical Center were included in the analysis. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and all participants gave informed consent to participate in the study. Eligibility for TAVR was established based on the consensus of a multidisciplinary heart team. Selection of the transcatheter heart valve, approach and anesthesia was chosen at the discretion of the physician. Patients undergoing non‐transfemoral approach were excluded.

The full disclosure of procedural 3‐lead ECG tracings and invasive blood pressure recordings during the entire TAVR procedure were reviewed retrospectively and each episode of pacing was recorded, including number of pacing episodes during the procedure, duration of each pacing episode, and duration of recovery of blood pressure. For the purpose of this study patients were divided according to the number of rapid pacing episodes during the TAVR procedure comparing patients undergoing no pacing, 1 to 2 pacing episodes, and ≥ 3 (3+) pacing episodes.

To assess the clinical impact of cumulative pacing duration, a sub‐group analysis of paced patients (1–2 and 3+ pacing groups) was performed according to the cumulative pacing time (in paced seconds), dividing patients into tertiles of pacing duration.

Pre‐specified clinical and laboratory data were collected for all patients at baseline before the procedure, immediately post‐procedure, during the index hospitalization, and during long term follow up. Collected data included medical history, ECG, echocardiography studies, laboratory tests, and clinical outcomes. In‐hospital outcomes were collected according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)‐2 consensus document 5 and included acute kidney injury (AKI), peri‐procedural myocardial infarction, stroke, bleeding, vascular complications, and death. In addition, data on new‐onset atrial fibrillation, myocardial biomarker levels post‐procedure (creatinine phosphokinase and troponin I) and sustained intra‐procedural hypotension (defined as a reduced systolic pressure under 80 mm Hg for over 1 minute or requiring administration of vasopressor drugs) was collected. All suspected events were adjudicated by a blinded interventional cardiologist.

### Blood pressure and arterial load after transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis [^114Vmj3Y]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Background

After aortic valve replacement, left ventricular afterload is often characterized by the residual valve obstruction. Our objective was to determine whether higher systemic arterial afterload-as reflected in blood pressure, pulsatile and resistive load-is associated with adverse clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

Methods and Results

Total, pulsatile, and resistive arterial load were measured in 2141 patients with severe aortic stenosis treated with TAVR in the PARTNER I trial (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve) who had systolic blood pressure (SBP) and an echocardiogram obtained 30 days after TAVR. The primary end point was 30-day to 1-year all-cause mortality. Lower SBP at 30 days after TAVR was associated with higher mortality (20.0% for SBP 100–129 mmHg versus 12.0% for SBP 130–170 mmHg; P < 0.001). This association remained significant after adjustment, was consistent across subgroups, and confirmed in sensitivity analyses. In adjusted models that included SBP, higher total and pulsatile arterial load were associated with increased mortality (P < 0.001 for all), but resistive load was not. Patients with low 30-day SBP and high pulsatile load had a 3-fold higher mortality than those with high 30-day SBP and low pulsatile load (26.1% versus 8.1%; hazard ratio, 3.62; 95% confidence interval, 2.36–5.55).

Conclusions

Even after relief of valve obstruction in patients with aortic stenosis, there is an independent association between post-TAVR blood pressure, systemic arterial load, and mortality. Blood pressure goals in patients with a history of aortic stenosis may need to be redefined. Increased pulsatile arterial load, rather than blood pressure, may be a target for adjunctive medical therapy to improve outcomes after TAVR.

### Transcatheter aortic valve implantation: review of the nature, management, and avoidance of procedural complications [^115UyCmr]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is becoming a reality in the management of patients with severe aortic stenosis and high or prohibitive risk for standard surgical management. Current understanding of the potential adverse events associated with this procedure is limited. Risks associated with TAVI differ from those related to surgical valve replacement and include vascular injury; stroke; cardiac injury such as heart block, coronary obstruction, and cardiac perforation; paravalvular leak; and valve misplacement. The clinical experience of multiple centers experience with different valve implantation systems and techniques was reviewed. Awareness of how complications occur might help in their avoidance, recognition, and management. Ultimately, improved understanding of the potential complications associated with TAVI might help improve outcomes and allow wider application of this therapy.

Case presentation

Patient 1

84 year old female with a BMI of 23.1 and a history significant for coronary artery disease, stage 3 CKD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a 16 pack-year history of smoking who presented for placement of a balloon expandable TAVR, size 29. Her preoperative aortic annulus measurements on CT scan were as follows: Short axis 22.6 mm, long axis 32.5 mm, area defined effective diameter 26.9, square area 570 mm². (Fig. 1) She was noted to have severe calcification of the aortic valve annulus. She was undergoing a subclavian approach when her annulus ruptured during balloon valvuloplasty prior to TAVR. The extravasation of contrast was not initially noted, but she rapidly became hypotensive within 5 min of valvuloplasty. An emergent echocardiogram was performed, and she was noted to have a pericardial effusion. She underwent a pericardiocentesis within 3 min of the initial hypotension event, which yielded blood, and transiently improved the blood pressure, but hemostasis was unable to be achieved even after reversal of anticoagulation. After 9 min of attempting hemostatic control, the decision was made to do an emergent sternotomy with surgical aortic valve replacement. 13 min after the initial hypotension event, a sternotomy was performed, and after 17 min from the initial hypotension event, the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. She underwent a surgical aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm bioprosthetic valve. She was noted on surgical opening to have damage to both the septum, inferior to the membranous septum, and annulus along the noncoronary sinus, as well as hematoma under the epicardial fat. Hemashield (Maquet, Wayne, NJ) patches were used to close the aorta and septum. Her chest was left open following the procedure with delayed closure on post-op day 2, with one pleural drain, and one mediastinal drain in place. She had multiple episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation throughout her stay that ultimately resolved without further intervention. The remainder of her post-operative care was standard surgical aortic valve replacement care and was without complications. She was discharged to a skilled nursing rehabilitation facility on post-op day 15 and later returned home. At nearly one year follow-up, her surgical aortic valve was functioning normally, with no long term effusion.

### Acute kidney injury following transcatheter aortic valve implantation: predictive factors, prognostic value, and comparison with surgical aortic valve replacement [^115rFfny]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation and surgical aortic valve replacement procedures

TAVI procedures have been described in detail in previous reports. – The Cribier–Edwards or Edwards-SAPIEN valve (Edwards Lifesciences Inc. Irvine, CA, USA) was used in all cases either by transfemoral (n = 111, 52%) or transapical (n = 102, 48%) approach. Patients with pre-procedural CKD received intravenous hydration before and after the procedure, and the use of a prophylactic treatment (N-acetylcysteine, intravenous bicarbonate) was left at the discretion of the physician performing the procedure. The amount of contrast, number of rapid pacing runs, the occurrence of any complication leading to severe maintained hypotension, and/or the need for haemodynamic support (aortic counterpulsation balloon and extracorporeal circulation) were recorded. A successful procedure was defined as the implantation of a functioning prosthetic valve within the aortic annulus at the end of the procedure without in-laboratory mortality. SAVR procedures were performed through mid-sternotomy, using standard surgical techniques and under extracorporeal circulation.

Serum creatinine measurements and acute kidney injury definition

All patients in both TAVI and SAVR groups had a systematic determination of serum creatinine and eGFR calculation based on the simplified modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formulabefore (< 7 days) and at 48 h following the procedure. The occurrence of AKI was defined as a decrease of > 25% in eGFR at 48 h following the procedure (RIFLE criteria), or the need of haemodialysis during index hospitalization. The degree of AKI was further classified as (i) > 25% decrease in eGFR, (ii) 50–75% decrease in eGFR, and (iii) > 75% decrease in eGFR.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) immediate postprocedure management calls for institutional protocols for monitoring and recovery after sedation or anesthesia, with early extubation encouraged when general anesthesia is used, careful access-site hemostasis and distal flow monitoring, continued mental status monitoring with early mobilization, and prompt resumption of appropriate pre-operative medications. Early discharge within 72 h for selected transfemoral TAVR patients does not increase the risk of 30-day mortality, bleeding, pacer implantation, or rehospitalization.

### Packed red blood cell transfusion associates with acute kidney injury after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^115LTAT1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Maximum number of concurrent inotropes or vasopressor drugs administered was assessed separately for the intra-procedure period and the post-procedure period, as need for transient vasopressor support during the intra-procedure period is not uncommon secondary to vasodilation under anesthesia as well as to facilitate recovery from transiently low cardiac output during valve deployment. However, need for post-TAVR inotrope and vasopressor drugs was prospectively considered by the investigators to represent a persistent need for inotropes and vasopressor drugs that might have greater impact on renal perfusion. The post-TAVR period for which administration of inotrope or vasopressor infusions was assessed included the first 5 postoperative days or until the patient was discharged from the hospital if that was sooner. Inotropes or vasopressor drugs included continuous infusions of any of the following: dobutamine, dopamine, epinephrine, milrinone, norepinephrine, phenylephrine or vasopressin.

Hypotension during TAVR procedure was defined as having at least one intra-procedural episode of ≥ 5 consecutive minutes of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) < 60 mmHg. Intraoperative hypotension was assessed for all patients who had continuous blood pressure monitoring via arterial line that was recorded minute to minute in the electronic operating room anesthesia record throughout the TAVR procedure from before induction of anesthesia to the time of patient departure from the operating room at the end of the TAVR procedure. Two patients did not have intraoperative hypotension data available since their charting was done on paper with every 5 min blood pressure noted.

Table 3
Clinical Outcomes According to Early * Post‐AVR Diastolic Blood Pressure and Systolic Blood Pressure (All TAVR and SAVR Patients)

When looking at groups defined by an early post‐AVR DBP < 60 versus ≥ 60 mm Hg and SBP < 120 versus ≥ 120 mm Hg, a DBP < 60 mm Hg appeared to have more of an adverse influence than an SBP < 120 mm Hg with the highest mortality observed in those with a DBP < 60 mm Hg and SBP < 120 mm Hg (Figure 3). We also evaluated 30‐day to 1‐year all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality for groups defined by a discharge DBP < 60 versus ≥ 60 mm Hg and 30‐day DBP < 60 versus ≥ 60 mm Hg (Figure 4). Mortality was the highest in those with persistent DBP < 60 mm Hg followed by those with a discharge DBP ≥ 60 mm Hg but then a 30‐day DBP < 60 mm Hg. Mortality was similar in those with a 30‐day DBP ≥ 60 mm Hg regardless of their discharge DBP. When similar analyses were performed based on discharge and 30‐day SBP, the relationships seen for DBP were not as apparent, although an SBP < 120 mm Hg at 30 days, regardless of discharge SBP, tended to be associated with the highest all‐cause mortality rates (Figure S2).

### Appraisal of urgent transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^114UUMDT]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Urgent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is needed in unstable patients with severe aortic stenosis and acute decompensated heart failure who are refractory to initial medical management. The outcome of urgent TAVR is worse and heavily influenced by the severity of the clinical status prior to intervention. Careful patient evaluation, procedural planning, and postoperative management should be optimized to improve the clinical results.

Introduction

The first transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was performed in 2002 in a patient with severe aortic stenosis suffering from cardiogenic shock unsuited for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) because of a critical perioperative state. 1 During the following years, TAVR became an alternative for inoperable patients suffering from aortic valve stenosis. After 5 years of development and trials, 2 valves received the European certification for application in humans. These valves showed non‐inferiority to SAVR in 2 randomized controlled trials with patients at extreme or high operative risk. 2, 3 Consequently, guidelines adopted TAVR as a treatment option for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis at high operative risk. 4 TAVR procedures soon outnumbered SAVR in clinical practice. 5 Advances in transcatheter technology and learning effects over time further improved results after TAVR. 6 Several large registries proved that the convincing results from randomized controlled trials are transferable into clinical practice. 7, 8, 9 Subsequently, 2 randomized controlled trials compared TAVR and SAVR in patients at intermediate operative risk and demonstrated non‐inferiority of TAVR after 2 years of follow‐up. 10, 11 Transfemoral TAVR (TF‐TAVR) with a balloon‐expandable valve was even superior to SAVR in a propensity‐matched analysis. 12 These results led to a further modification of the guidelines: TAVR is now recommended for patients at intermediate or high operative risk. 13 Nevertheless, risk scores are not the only criteria for the decision between SAVR and TAVR: SAVR remains the preferred method for patients aged < 75 years, since there are concerns about the durability of transcatheter valves. On the other hand, TAVR is recommended in case of severe comorbidities which are not adequately reflected by risk scores. 13 Data from randomized controlled trials or large registries comparing both treatment strategies in younger patients or in patients with distinct comorbidities are still lacking. This may be because of limited cohort sizes in studies and resulting difficulties in obtaining statistically significant results for subgroups. However, breaking down the outcomes achieved by patients treated with the various approaches by patient subgroup is vital to provide an empirical basis for clinical practice, which is faced with a highly diverse patient population. For an accurate estimation of treatment effects within subgroups, estimates from observational databases can complement randomized controlled trials. 14 This is particularly true for subgroups for which randomized controlled trials are not feasible because of financial constraints.

### Comprehensive update on the new indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the latest 2017 European guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [^115HkRDs]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Interestingly, the updated guidelines now also state that SAVR should be considered in asymptomatic patients with normal ejection fraction if the surgical risk is low and one of the following findings is present: (1) very severe aortic stenosis defined by a peak velocity > 5.5 m/s, (2) severe valve calcification and a rate of peak velocity progression ≥ 0.3 m/s/year, (3) markedly elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels (> 3-fold normal range) confirmed by repeated measurements and (4) severe pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary artery pressure at rest > 60 mm Hg) without other explanation. In patients without these predictive factors, watchful waiting appears safe and early surgery is unlikely to be beneficial.

For the time being, there is no evidence available showing a role for TAVR in the treatment of asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, studies are on their way to investigate the potential value of TAVR for this specific patient population.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedural complications — management options in Table 5 are summarized as follows: Valve embolization in the aortic position can be treated with "Recapture or deploy in descending aorta if still attached to delivery system (self-expanding)", "Valve-in-valve", or "Endovascular (snare)", whereas embolization to the left ventricle prompts "Surgical AVR and extraction". Central valvular aortic regurgitation is "Usually self-limited, but may require gentle probing of leaflets with a soft wire or catheter" or "Delivery of a second TAVR device". Paravalvular aortic regurgitation options include "Post-deployment balloon dilation", "Delivery of a second TAVR device", and "Repositioning of valve if low (recapture, snare)". For shock or hemodynamic collapse, actions include "Assess and treat underlying cause if feasible", "Inotropic support", "Mechanical circulatory support", or "CPB". Coronary occlusion can be addressed with "PCI (easier if coronaries already wired before valve implantation)" or "CABG". Annular rupture and ventricular perforation share initial steps of "Reverse anticoagulation", "Surgical repair", and "Pericardial drainage". Complete heart block management is "Transvenous pacing with conversion to PPM if needed". Stroke management distinguishes ischemic ("Catheter-based, mechanical embolic retrieval for large ischemic CVA") from hemorrhagic ("Conservative"). Bleeding or hemorrhage calls to "Treat source if feasible", "Transfusion", and "Reversal of anticoagulation", and access site–related complications warrant "Urgent endovascular or surgical repair".

### Myocardial injury after balloon predilatation versus direct transcatheter aortic valve replacement: insights from the DIRECTAVI trial [^1133YTdg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

BAV and Myocardial Injury

Myocardial injury during TAVR may be induced by periprocedural conditions with a mismatch between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. 25 Among the factors involved in the occurrence of myocardial injury, BAV, but also acute aortic regurgitation, microembolism, or temporary hypotension during rapid ventricular pacing, were advocated. 16, 19 New‐generation TAVR devices with a lower profile sheath system and improved radial force provide adequate expansion in most cases. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Thus, systematic BAV before device implantation may not be a mandatory step in the current TAVR era, particularly with balloon‐expandable prosthesis. Moreover, as BAV may be associated with specific complications involving aortic regurgitation, systemic embolism, and annulus rupture, avoiding BAV may be of interest. 3, 4, 12, 19, 20 Rapid pacing may induce myocardial injury through a hypotensive or a pro ischemic effect 13, 14 and may also be associated with negative effects on microcirculation. 26 Thus, duration of rapid pacing, required for BAV and balloon‐expandable valve positioning, may be reduced by a direct implantation strategy, with a positive impact on myocardial injury. 27 Our results argue with the impact of BAV not only on incidence but also on the magnitude of myocardial injury assessed by mean hs‐TnT elevation levels. Only 1 observational study including 164 patients evaluated the effect of BAV on myocardial injury with a self‐expandable device. The authors found that direct device implantation was associated with lower incidence of myocardial injury. 19 Therefore, direct TAVR, which is both feasible and safe, appears to be a useful option to simplify the TAVR procedure in the "minimalist TAVR" era and to reduce myocardial injury. 28, 29

Other Predictive Factors of Myocardial Injury

In our study, coronary artery disease was not related to incidence of myocardial injury, suggesting that myocardial ischemia was not the predominant mechanism of myocardial injury. In addition to BAV, hypertension was also predictive of myocardial injury. No similar data were found in the literature. However, one can hypothesize that patients with hypertension had potential left ventricular hypertrophy and may be more impacted by periprocedural‐induced mismatch between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Conversely, atrial fibrillation was negatively associated with myocardial injury in our study. One can hypothesis that preprocedural anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation might have played a role in microembolism during TAVR. However, an effect of anticoagulant therapy on myocardial injury cannot be definitively asserted as all patients are equally anticoagulated during the procedure.

### Comparison of valve academic research consortium (VARC)-2 and VARC-3 criteria for bleeding complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^117AJDJB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

VARC‐3 criteria classify bleeding events as type 1, 2, 3 or 4, with type 1 bleeding as any overt bleeding requiring medical intervention or transfusion of 1 unit of whole blood or RBCs. Type 2 bleeding was determined as overt bleeding associated with a hemoglobin drop of > 3 g/dL but < 5 g/dL or overt bleeding requiring transfusion of 2 to 4 units of whole blood or RBCs. Type 3 bleeding was characterized as overt bleeding in a critical organ, causing hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring vasopressors or surgery, requiring reintervention or reoperation, or postthoracotomy chest tube output ≥ 2 L in 24 hours, or associated with a drop in hemoglobin level of ≥ 5 g/dL or leading to a transfusion of ≥ 5 units of whole blood or RBCs. Type 4 bleeding was defined as bleeding leading to death. Although the VARC‐2 document postulates that bleeding has to be the result of overt bleeding, the VARC‐3 document declares that any procedural blood loss should be interpreted as overt bleeding, even in the absence of an obvious source of bleeding. Thus, type 2 bleeding events were defined as any procedural blood loss with a hemoglobin decrease of 3 to 5 g/dL and type 3 bleeding events were defined as any procedural blood loss with a hemoglobin decrease of ≥ 5 g/dL. It is important to note that in this article, procedural blood loss (type 2 or type 3 bleeding) is classified as non‐attributable bleeding if it is defined solely by a hemoglobin decrease without a clinically apparent source of bleeding. We analyzed hemoglobin levels 1‐day prior TAVR and the lowest value within 96 hours after TAVR to identify periprocedural blood loss and the extent of overt bleeding during the index hospitalization. The administration of RBCs during hospitalization and whether it was related to overt bleeding was carefully evaluated to classify bleeding severity. At our institution, patients with hemoglobin levels < 7 g/dL usually receive 1 to 2 units of RBCs before TAVR, and patients with renal failure were administered 500 mL of isotonic saline solution before the procedure.

### Lower blood pressure after transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement is associated with increased mortality [^114zzP9d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Blood pressure guidelines for patients with aortic stenosis or a history of aortic stenosis treated with aortic valve replacement match those in the general population, but this extrapolation may not be warranted.

Methods and Results

Among patients enrolled in the Medtronic intermediate, high, and extreme risk trials, we included those with a transcatheter(n = 1794) or surgical(n = 1103) who were alive at 30 days. The associations between early (average of discharge and 30 day post‐) systolic and diastolic measurements and clinical outcomes between 30 days and 1 year were evaluated. Among 2897 patients, after adjustment, spline curves demonstrated an association between lower(< 120 mm Hg, representing 21% of patients) and(< 60 mm Hg, representing 30% of patients) and increased all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality and repeat hospitalization. These relationships were unchanged when patients with moderate‐to‐severe aortic regurgitation post‐were excluded. After adjustment, compared with60 to < 80 mm Hg,30 to < 60 mm Hg was associated with increased all‐cause (adjusted hazard ratio 1.62, 95%1.23–2.14) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2.13, 95%1.52–3.00), but80 to < 100 mm Hg was not. Similarly, after adjustment, compared with120 to < 150 mm Hg,90 to < 120 mm Hg was associated with increased all‐cause (adjusted hazard ratio 1.63, 95%1.21–2.21) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.81, 95%1.25–2.61), but150 to < 180 mm Hg was not.

Conclusions

Lowerin the first month after transcatheter AVR or surgical AVR is common and associated with increased mortality and repeat hospitalization. Clarifying optimaltargets in these patients ought to be a priority and may improve patient outcomes.

### Clinical conundrum of coronary artery disease and aortic valve stenosis [^1144d5uD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The introduction of TAVR has presented a paradigm shift in treating severe aortic valve stenosis. With that came the challenge of optimal management of concomitant CAD. The PARTNER and US CoreValve High Risk Study trials, which led to approval of TAVR by the US Food and Drug Administration, excluded patients with unrevascularized CAD. 8, 9 With further advances in the safety of TAVR, however, attention has turned again to discovering the best approach to treatment. Revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) now, in the early days of TAVR, might be less risky than the addition of CABG was in the early days of SAVR. The potential benefits of revascularization prior to TAVR might include the prevention of myocardial ischemia during periods of hypotension and rapid pacing, especially with increased wall stress, microvascular dysfunction, and impaired coronary blood flow. In contrast, there are risks in performing PCI prior to TAVR. These include periprocedural myocardial infarction; bleeding from antiplatelet agents, especially in patients with atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation; and contrast‐induced nephropathy. Again, the long‐term benefits of complete revascularization are unclear in this population of patients whose primary problem is the increased afterload from the valve disease.

### Transfemoral versus transcarotid access for transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^111YW8HK]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this study are as follows: (1) TC access for TAVR was necessary in a limited number of patients (11.5%); (2) patients undergoing TC-TAVR had a significantly increased operative risk than those undergoing TF-TAVR; (3) when differences between the study groups were adjusted by propensity score matching, TC-TAVR presented an early- and mid-term mortality, stroke/transient ischemic attack not different than TF-TAVR; and (4) secondary adverse events were not frequent in this series and were not more significant in the TC-TAVI group.

Neurologic and vascular complications are key issues in patients in whom femoral access for TAVR is contraindicated. Neurologic complications are of concern, particularly in patients undergoing TC-TAVR because of the transient clamping and manipulation of the common carotid artery. Other potential mechanisms underlying the development of stroke/transient ischemic attack are embolization of debris during balloon valvuloplasty and the deployment of the prosthesis device, episodes of hypotension due to rapid ventricular stimulation, atrial fibrillation, and inadequate collateral cerebral vascularization through the circle of Willis. This study showed that the incidence of stroke in patients undergoing a TC access occurred late after the procedure (on the third and twentieth postoperative day). Similarly, in the overall series, there was not a significant different rate of stroke/transient ischemic attack in the study groups (TF-TAVR 3.5% vs TC-TAVR 3.2%, P = 1.00; only stroke: TF-TAVR 2.9% vs TC-TAVR 3.2%, P = 0.76). These findings could suggest the non-dangerousness of TC access for TAVR. However, the preoperative assessment of the patency of circle of Willis and the absence of significant atherosclerotic changes in the carotid arteries are key issues with this approach and have contributed to the low incidence of neurologic complications in patients undergoing TC-TAVR.

The absence of significant differences in terms of vascular complications and other early outcomes further can demonstrate the nondifference of safety and efficacy of the TC-TAVR than TF-TAVR, as documented by previous institutional and multicenter studies. In fact, the access to the common carotid artery can be achieved easily, and this makes bleeding and infectious complications quite uncommon. The minimal distance between the vascular-site access and the valve plane also allows the stability of the introduction system with greater precision during the deployment of the valve.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Severe aortic stenosis — supportive perioperative considerations include that "transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement before elective NCS reduces perioperative risk" in patients who meet criteria for intervention, that in those who "require urgent elevated-risk NCS, balloon aortic valvuloplasty may be considered as a bridging strategy", and that "Patients with asymptomatic severe AS and normal LV function can safely undergo elective low-risk NCS, especially in the absence of severe CAD, but patients should be monitored closely to avoid hypotension, excessive hypertension, and tachycardia".

### Impact of complications during transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement: how can they Be avoided and managed? [^112ztHh6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolutionized the treatment of aortic stenosis and is the treatment of choice for patients at prohibitive and high surgical risk. Extension of indications into intermediate surgical risk has begun, and recently 2 large randomized trials demonstrated that TAVR may be superior to surgery in patients at low surgical risk and can potentially offer better results at initial follow‐up. 1, 2, 3 TAVR practice has evolved continuously with concomitant simplification of the procedure. If one disregards the financial considerations, predictability of the procedural outcome and certainty regarding the durability of TAVR prostheses are 2 of the main remaining restrictions to universal implementation.

Transfemoral access is the preferred approach, as it has a 20% relative reduction in mortality compared with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) (hazard ratio HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69–0.93; P = 0.024). 3 Understanding the mechanisms that underlie complications during transfemoral TAVR is essential, and familiarity with the techniques for their prevention and treatment is mandatory. In this review, we provide a state‐of‐the‐art overview on the avoidable procedural complications of contemporary transfemoral TAVR practice, with a specific focus on strategies for their prevention and management.

Quality of Life, Walk Distance, and the Left Ventricle

Compared with an early post‐AVR DBP 60 to < 80 mm Hg and adjusted for baseline values, a DBP 30 to < 60 mm Hg was associated with a shorter 6‐minute walk distance at 1 year after AVR (Table 4). No significant associations were observed between early post‐AVR DBP and quality of life, LV mass index, or LVEF at 1 year after AVR. For early post‐AVR SBP, there were no significant associations observed with 1‐year 6‐minute walk distance, quality of life, or LV mass index or LVEF (Table 4).

Medications

Among those with an early post‐AVR DBP 30 to < 60 mm Hg, at least 89% and 39% were on ≥ 1 blood pressure‐lowering medication at discharge and 30 days, respectively, and at least 41% and 19% were on ≥ 2 blood pressure‐lowering medications at discharge and 30 days, respectively (Table S11). Similarly, among those with an early post‐AVR SBP 90 to < 120 mm Hg, at least 87% and 43% were on ≥ 1 blood pressure‐lowering medication at discharge and 30 days, respectively, and at least 40% and 22% were on ≥ 2 blood pressure‐lowering medications at discharge and 30 days, respectively (Table S12).

### 2017 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the management of adults with aortic Stenosis: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^11268mVM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Post–transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) echocardiographic and electrocardiographic surveillance — baseline, intervals, and parameters are specified as follows: echocardiography before discharge provides a new baseline study of transcatheter valve function and should include the antegrade TAVR velocity, mean transaortic gradient, valve area, and assessment of paravalvular AR, with other key parameters including LV size, regional wall motion and EF, evaluation of MV anatomy and function, estimation of pulmonary pressures, and evaluation of the right ventricle. Repeat echocardiography is recommended at 30 days and then at least annually to meet registry requirements, monitor for complications of TAVR, and guide medical therapy of concurrent cardiac conditions; because long-term durability is not yet known, annual evaluation for regurgitation, stenosis, and leaflet calcification or thrombosis is appropriate. Routine ECG assessment is also recommended due to a potential need for pacemaker implantation beyond the initial 30-day period, particularly following implantation of the self-expanding TAVR.

### Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement… [^1128R8eG]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The median STS PROM was calculated for each hospital center using the STS isolated surgical AVR risk algorithm and variables reported to the TVT Registry and shown as a function of center-level TAVR volume evaluating the relationship between observed center-level variation in patient selection and procedural volume, with the hypothesis that a larger proportion of low-volume centers would select lower-risk TAVR cases. Patients in this cohort had a high burden of advanced heart failure, with severe functional limitations. Prior to the TAVR procedure, more than 81. 3% had New York Heart Association class III/IV heart failure symptoms. Among the 3065 patients for whom a 5-m walk test results was reported, a slow gait speed was present in 2198 patients. Among the 5979 patients with an immediate pre–hospital discharge echocardiogram, moderate or severe aortic insufficiency was observed in 508 patients; moderate in 481, and severe in 27. Among patients with available baseline and post-TAVR echocardiogram results, the degree of mitral regurgitation was reduced in 2402, unchanged in 1962, and worsened in
554. Patients with inoperable status in the PARTNER trial had a mean STS PROM of 11. 2% and those with high-risk but operable status had a mean of
11. 8%. Although this may represent incomplete entry of variables into the risk calculator by US clinical sites, it could indicate "risk creep, " meaning patients with lower surgical risk are being treated in the United States, leading to better outcomes with TAVR. Among the 7710 patients undergoing TAVR at 224 sites in the STS/ACC TVT Registry, device success was achieved in 92% of cases, with a 5. 5% incidence of in-hospital mortality and a 2% incidence of stroke.

Although procedural complication rates were relatively low, within the first 30 days most deaths remained noncardiovascular in nature. These findings are comparable with prior published randomized trial and international registry experience. Longer-term follow-up is essential to assess continued safety and efficacy as well as patient health status.

### Renin-angiotensin system inhibition in Patients with myocardial injury complicating transcatheter aortic Valve Replacement [^111HBquZ]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The salient findings of this study are as follows: 1) in a prospective TAVR registry, 1 out of 7 patients with severe AS developed VARC-3 periprocedural myocardial injury after TAVR; 2) VARC-3 periprocedural myocardial injury was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of cardiovascular death at 1 year; 3) 30% of patients were not prescribed RAS inhibitors after TAVR, irrespective of the development of myocardial injury; 4) prescription of RAS inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of 1-year cardiovascular mortality after TAVR in both patients with and without development of periprocedural myocardial injury with no significant interaction between groups.

Periprocedural elevations in cardiac biomarkers after TAVR are common and result from a combination of several factors: 1) direct myocardial damage induced by mechanical compression of the left ventricular outflow tract during balloon dilatation and valve implantation; 2) distal embolization of calcium microparticles into the coronary arteries; and 3) myocardial supply-demand mismatch due to transient hypotension during rapid pacing, excessive bradycardia because of conduction abnormalities, and ischemia induced by inotropic hemodynamic support during the procedure. Previous studies have identified several patient characteristics as predictors of periprocedural myocardial injury, including female sex, hypertension, and peripheral artery disease. Similarly, procedural factors may influence the elevation of cardiac biomarkers. In the randomized DIRECTAVI (Direct Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial comparing TAVR with contemporary balloon-expandable valves with versus without balloon predilatation, predilatation prior to valve deployment was an independent predictor of periprocedural myocardial injury. Procedural adverse events may also increase the risk of myocardial injury. In the present analysis, conversion to surgical aortic valve replacement was more frequent in patients with myocardial injury. This observation corroborates the findings of a previous study in which reported procedural time was the only predictor of myocardial injury. Of note, our data show that 13% of patients develop periprocedural myocardial injury even in the absence of procedural complications. In addition, preprocedural RAS inhibitors did not reduce the incidence of periprocedural myocardial injury after TAVR. These findings are consistent with the observations of previous studies. Preprocedural prescription of RAS inhibitors did not reduce the incidence of periprocedural myocardial injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Different mechanisms of periprocedural elevations in cardiac biomarkers may outweigh the protective effect of RAS inhibitors in myocardial injury. Further studies are warranted to determine the optimal strategy to reduce the risk of periprocedural myocardial injury.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement complications: a narrative review for emergency clinicians [^111nu2gi]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is present in up to 10% of individuals over age 80 years. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the most common method to replace the aortic valve in patients with AS. TAVR-related complications may occur.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the emergency department (ED) assessment and management of patients with TAVR complications.

Discussion

Post-TAVR complications can be conceptualized as occurring peri-procedurally and after the peri-procedural period. Peri-procedural complications include device landing zone rupture, coronary artery obstruction, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, and valve embolization. Complications beyond the peri-procedural window include vascular access/bleeding, mechanical valve issues, electrical conduction complications, and end-organ damage.

Conclusions

Emergency clinicians are more likely to encounter TAVR complications after the initial procedural hospitalization and must be prepared to diagnose and manage these complications.

### Aortic annulus rupture after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: successful management of a dangerous complication [^113dJ4qv]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Aortic annulus rupture remains one of the most fatal complications of TAVR. While attempts have been made to describe and predict this complication, the data remains insufficient without evidence-based guidelines for management of this rare complication.

Methods

Here we describe a series of 3 aortic annulus ruptures after TAVR which were managed successfully to hospital discharge.

Results

Patient 1 suffered annulus rupture during balloon valvuloplasty prior to TAVR. The patient became hypotensive, and echocardiogram showed pericardial effusion. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis which transiently improved the blood pressure, but bleeding continued. The patient was transitioned to an open surgical aortic valve replacement due to ongoing hemorrhage. The chest was left open with delayed closure on post-op day 2. The patient was discharged on post-op day 15. Patient 2 was undergoing TAVR valve expansion. The patient became hypotensive. An echocardiogram revealed pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis yielded 200 mL of blood. SURGIFLO (Johnson & Johnson Wound Management, Somerville, NJ) was injected into the pericardial space. Aortic root angiography confirmed no further contrast extravasation. A pericardial drain was left in place for 2 days, and the patient was discharged on post-op day 7. Patient 3 received a TAVR valve and post-placement dilation due to paravalvular leak. The echocardiogram showed a pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis was performed, yielding 500 cc of blood. The patient's healthcare proxy declined emergent surgery; thus, a pericardial drain was placed. No hemostatic agents were used, and drainage reduced over several hours. The drain was removed on post-op day 3, and the patient was discharged on post-op day 8.

Conclusions

Based on the timelines in these three cases, and interventions used, the following steps may be employed in the event of annulus rupture: identification of hemodynamic instability, echocardiogram to confirm pericardial effusion, emergent pericardiocentesis, pericardial drain placement for evacuation of the pericardial space and use of hemostatic agents, repeat aortogram to rule out ongoing extravasation. If hemostasis is unable to be achieved and/or the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable at any point, rapid transition to emergent surgical management is necessary. This management strategy proved successful for this case series and warrants further investigation.

Univariate associations with development of post-TAVR AKI

Table 1 shows univariate associations between patient demographic, procedural and clinical variables and the development of post-TAVR AKI with data stratified according to whether patients did or did not develop post-TAVR AKI. Patients who developed post-TAVR AKI received significantly more pRBC transfusions than patients who did not (mean units transfused in AKI group 1.7 versus 0.4 units in no AKI group; P = 0.03; Table 1). Of the patients who developed post-TAVR AKI, 55% received pRBC transfusion, while only 21% of the patients who did not develop AKI received pRBCs (P = 0.002).

More patients who developed AKI were anemic prior to TAVR (75% of the AKI group versus 51% of the no AKI group, P = 0.05). Furthermore, patients who developed AKI had significantly lower nadir Hgb measurements obtained during the TAVR procedure and the first 24 h following TAVR (mean Hgb 8.8 ± 1.5 g/dL in the AKI group versus 9.8 ± 1.7 g/dL in the no AKI group; P = 0.02). Figure 1 shows the patients who did and did not receive pRBC transfusions and the nadir Hgb recorded during TAVR or the 24 h following TAVR for each patient. Since patients may receive pRBCs in the setting of ongoing bleeding and need for volume resuscitation in the operating room, it is possible that some actual nadir Hgb was lower than recorded.

Fig. 1
Nadir measured hemoglobin (intra-procedure and first 24 h post-TAVR) and number of patients transfused and not transfused pRBCs at these hemoglobin values. pRBC = packed red blood cells

Continuous intra-procedure blood pressure monitoring was done via arterial line. Neither the occurrence of any episode of intraoperative hypotension with MAP < 60 mmHg for ≥ 5 consecutive minutes, the total number of these intraoperative hypotension episodes, nor the total number of intraoperative minutes included in these hypotensive episodes was significantly associated with development of AKI after TAVR. Having a period of ≥ 10 consecutive minutes of MAP < 60 mmHg was also not significantly associated with development of post-TAVR AKI. Intra-procedure rapid pacing was utilized in 90% of the patients who developed post-TAVR AKI and in 75% of the patients who did not. This difference was not statistically significant.

### Bleeding events after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: JACC state-of-the-art review [^115qyrz2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has gained over time a major reduction in procedural complications. Despite this, clinically relevant bleeding still occurs in a non-negligible proportion of patients and adversely affects prognosis. Patients with severe aortic stenosis are at heightened risk for spontaneous bleeding due to advanced age and a high comorbidity burden. Also, procedural factors and antithrombotic management contribute to define individual bleeding susceptibility. Bleeding prevention represents an emerging area for improving patient care. Because of the tight hemorrhagic/ischemic balance, a tailored approach based on individual bleeding-risk profile, such as a less invasive antithrombotic regimen or appropriate diagnostic preprocedural evaluation, should be pursued to avoid bleeding events. This review aims to provide an in-depth overview of bleeding events in the TAVR field, including definitions, timing and the extent of risk, and clinical impact, as well as updates on antithrombotic management and its potential influence on bleeding complications.

### Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors After transcatheter aortic Valve replacement: the jury is still out [^112s5g3Y]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The definitive therapy for severe aortic stenosis (AS) is aortic valve replacement (AVR), either performed as surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, there is limited evidence on post-AVR optimal medical therapy to treat the adverse cardiac effects of AS. The use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been shown to be safe in patients with uncorrected severe AS, with careful blood pressure monitoring.RAS inhibition has been associated with reduced progression of left ventricular (LV) mass, improved survival, and a lower risk of cardiovascular events in patients with AS before valve replacement. Given the potential benefits of RAS inhibition in reducing adverse LV remodeling, LV hypertrophy, and myocardial fibrosis, several investigators have studied the potential benefits of RAS inhibition after AVR. Post-hoc analyses from trials and observational studies suggest a possible association between RAS inhibition and a reduction in post-TAVR events. Consequently, RAS inhibition may be considered after TAVR to reduce the long-term risk of all-cause mortality (Class IIb, Level of Evidence: B). However, as evidenced by the strength of its recommendation, further research on the potential benefits of RAS inhibition after TAVR is needed.

### 2017 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the management of adults with aortic Stenosis: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^111Wbcre]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) futility — assessment focuses on avoiding procedures without symptomatic or survival benefit. It is appropriate to avoid intervention in patients who will not benefit, and SAVR/TAVR is considered futile with a life expectancy < 1 year despite a successful procedure or a chance of "survival with benefit" < 25% at 2 years; "survival with benefit" means survival with improvement by at least 1 New York Heart Association class or at least 1 Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class, improvement in quality of life, or improvement in life expectancy. If a procedure is considered futile and not recommended, it is important that care plans are put into place to prevent a feeling of abandonment, and input from palliative care specialists is particularly helpful.

### Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with cardiogenic shock [^112ayzQD]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

The safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with contemporary balloon expandable transcatheter valves in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) remain largely unknown. In this study, the TAVRs performed for CS between June 2015 and September 2022 using SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra bioprosthesis from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry were analysed.

Methods and Results

CS was defined as: (i) coding of CS within 24 h on Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry form; and/or (ii) pre-procedural use of inotropes or mechanical circulatory support devices and/or (iii) cardiac arrest within 24 h prior to TAVR. The control group was comprised of all the other patients undergoing TAVR. Baseline characteristics, all-cause mortality, and major complications at 30-day and 1-year outcomes were reported. Landmark analysis was performed at 30 days post-TAVR. Cox-proportional multivariable analysis was performed to determine the predictors of all-cause mortality at 1 year. A total of 309 505 patients underwent TAVR with balloon-expandable valves during the study period. Of these, 5006 patients presented with CS prior to TAVR (1.6%). The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 10.76 ± 10.4. The valve was successfully implanted in 97.9% of patients. Technical success according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 criteria was 94.5%. In a propensity-matched analysis, CS was associated with higher in-hospital (9.9% vs. 2.7%), 30-day (12.9% vs. 4.9%), and 1-year (29.7% vs. 22.6%) mortality compared to the patients undergoing TAVR without CS. In the landmark analysis after 30 days, the risk of 1-year mortality was similar between the two groups [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95–1.21]. Patients who were alive at 1 year noted significant improvements in functional class (Class I/II 89%) and quality of life (ΔKCCQ score +50). In the multivariable analysis, older age (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.02–1.03), peripheral artery disease (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06–1.47), prior implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07–1.77), patients on dialysis (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.69–2.53), immunocompromised status (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05–1.69), New York Heart Association class III/IV symptoms (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.06–2.12), lower aortic valve mean gradient, lower albumin levels, lower haemoglobin levels, and lower Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores were independently associated with 1-year mortality.

Conclusion

This large observational real-world study demonstrates that the TAVR is a safe and effective treatment for aortic stenosis patients presenting with CS. Patients who survived the first 30 days after TAVR had similar mortality rates to those who were not in CS.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR): recent updates [^1165e3ft]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Within the last two decades, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolutionized the management of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS). Newer generations of transcatheter valve design, optimized imaging planning, growing operator experience, and technical refinements have driven enhancements in safety and reduction of procedural complications over time. These improvements have allowed expansion to lower risk patients, in which TAVR confirmed favorable outcomes compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Based on current evidence, the 2020 AHA/ACC guidelines provided updated recommendations on indications for TAVR, with several clinical indications remain with SAVR. As TAVR expands to younger, low-risk patients with longer life expectancies, different issues of utmost importance have emerged, such as long-term durability, bioprosthetic valve performance, coronary reaccess, prognostic impact of conduction disturbances and paravalvular leak, reintervention after TAVR, and optimal pharmacological management after the procedure. In this review, we provide an update of recent clinical guidelines and available data from clinical trials and registries, and highlight novel strategies to further reduce procedural complications.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Shared decision-making and Heart Valve Team — the management of patients with severe AS considered for TAVR is 'best achieved by a multidisciplinary, collaborative Heart Valve Team' including cardiologists with expertise in valvular heart disease, structural interventional cardiologists, imaging specialists, cardiovascular surgeons, cardiovascular anesthesiologists, and cardiovascular nursing professionals. Patient management 'relies on a shared decision-making approach' integrating patient preferences and values; specific tasks are to review the patient's condition and valve severity, determine which interventions are indicated, technically feasible, and reasonable, and discuss benefits and risks with the patient and family. The Heart Valve Team 'should emphasize that the purpose of valvular intervention is to improve symptoms and/or prolong survival, while minimizing adverse outcomes associated with the intervention'. Initial assessment includes evaluation of AS symptoms, disease severity and comorbidities, and 'Echocardiographic measures of AS severity should be reviewed, disease severity confirmed, and additional imaging performed as indicated'.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) post-deployment assessments and aortic regurgitation (AR) — immediate checks, complication frequency, and AR characterization are outlined. Immediately following implantation, valve position and location should be checked with echocardiography (TTE or TEE), hemodynamics, and/or aortography, and complications with TAVR are fairly common and should be promptly addressed; a quick assessment for changes in MV or LV function and new pericardial effusion should also be routinely performed. Post-TAVR AR must be characterized by location, severity, and cause, integrating central and paravalvular origins. Central regurgitation is generally due to improper deployment or sizing and can be exacerbated by heavy guidewires holding a leaflet open, with full evaluation only after wire removal. Paravalvular regurgitation is generally caused by underdeployment, very low implants below the valve skirt of the self-expanding valve, or calcific deposits preventing proper seating and sealing; acute leaks may respond to repeat ballooning. Predisposing factors include eccentric calcification, heavy irregular calcific deposits, and incorrectly sized prostheses.

### Challenges and future opportunities for transcatheter aortic valve therapy [^115FhQVE]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a novel less-invasive therapy for high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Despite the impressive clinical growth of TAVR, there are many challenges as well as future opportunities.

Results

The heart valve team serves as the central vehicle for determining appropriate case selection. Considerations which impact clinical therapy decisions include frailty assessments and defining clinical "futility". There are many controversial procedural issues; choice of vascular access site, valve sizing, adjunctive imaging, and post-dilatation strategies. Complications associated with TAVR (strokes, vascular and bleeding events, para-valvular regurgitation, and conduction abnormalities) must be improved and will require procedural and/or technology enhancements. TAVR site training mandates a rigorous commitment to established society and sponsor guidelines. In the future, TAVR clinical indications should extend to bioprosthetic valve failure, intermediate risk patients, and other clinical scenarios, based upon well conducted clinical trials. New TAVR systems have been developed which should further optimize clinical outcomes, by reducing device profile, providing retrievable features, and preventing para-valvular regurgitation. Other accessory devices, such as cerebral protection to prevent strokes, are also being developed and evaluated in clinical studies.

Summary

TAVR is a worthwhile addition to the armamentarium of therapies for patients with AS. Current limitations are important to recognize and future opportunities to improve clinical outcomes are being explored.

### Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jNohH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The comparative benefits and harms of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with aortic stenosis are unclear.

Purpose

To compare clinical outcomes, including early (≤ 30-day) and midterm (≤ 1-year) mortality, in adults with severe aortic stenosis undergoing either TAVI or SAVR.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Scopus databases (without language restrictions) from April 2002 to 5 April 2016; multiple registries and Web sites; scientific meeting presentations.

Study Selection

Five randomized trials and 31 observational matched studies comparing mortality outcomes after TAVI or SAVR.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently extracted study data and rated risk of bias.

Data Synthesis

16 638 patients were analyzed. Overall, there was no statistically significant difference between TAVI and SAVR in early (odds ratio [OR], 1.01 [95% CI, 0.81 to 1.26]) or midterm (OR, 0.96 [CI, 0.81 to 1.14]) all-cause mortality. Analyses restricted to trials (early: OR, 0.80 [CI, 0.51 to 1.25]; midterm: OR, 0.90 [CI, 0.64 to 1.26]) were inconclusive, with wide CIs, whereas analyses of matched studies were similar to the overall results. Transfemoral TAVI provided mortality benefits over SAVR in trials. Analyses restricted to studies of patients at low to intermediate risk showed statistically nonsignificant reductions in early (OR, 0.67 [CI, 0.42 to 1.07]) and midterm (OR, 0.91 [CI, 0.67 to 1.23]) mortality with TAVI. Incidence of periprocedural myocardial infarction, major bleeding, acute kidney injury, and new-onset atrial fibrillation was lower with TAVI, but risk for pacemaker implantation, vascular complications, and paravalvular leak increased. Overall, there was a statistically nonsignificant increased risk in long-term (2- to 5-year) all-cause mortality with TAVI (OR, 1.28 [CI, 0.97 to 1.69]), whereas long-term mortality outcomes in patients at low to intermediate risk were inconclusive, with wide CIs (OR, 1.06 [CI, 0.59 to 1.91]).

Limitation

The number of trials was limited, and study designs and patient characteristics were heterogeneous.

Conclusion

Compared with SAVR, TAVI may have similar or better early and midterm outcomes for adults with aortic stenosis, including those at low to intermediate risk.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### A retrospective analysis of hemodynamic stability in TAVR and TTVR under general anesthesia: implications for sedation in TTVR [^1158shkE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is routinely performed under general anesthesia (GA) or sedation. However, there were few studies focused on the anesthesia method when transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR) was performed. This study aimed to investigate whether TTVR procedures can be performed effectively under sedation.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 45 patients who underwent TAVR and 56 patients who underwent TTVR at Shanghai General Hospital between August 2023 and November 2024. The primary endpoints were the incidence of hemodynamic fluctuations and the administration of vasoactive drugs during the surgical procedures. The secondary outcomes included perioperative complications. All relevant clinical data were meticulously collected and analyzed using standardized protocols.

Results

The groups did not differ in characteristics, comorbidities and cardiac function, or myocardial injury indicators. More patients in the TAVR group experienced post-induction hypotension. The duration of hypotension was significantly longer in the TAVR group. The magnitude of MAP decline and the heart rate were more considerable in the TAVR group than in the TTVR group during the operation. The dosage of vasopressor agents was higher in the TAVR group than in the TTVR group. Finally, the clinical outcomes of patients from both groups did not differ between the two groups after surgery.

Conclusions

Performing TTVR have fewer harmful effects on hemodynamic stability and a lower likelihood of sudden incidents under GA. The results suggested that sedation may be a suitable and safe anesthesia method for TTVR and is worthy of future investigation.

Trial registration

The study was registered with ChiCTR (No: ChiCTR2500099352||), 21 March 2025.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement: history and current status [^111kScQH]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the poor prognosis associated with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis, treatment options were limited for a large subgroup of patients deemed high risk for surgical replacement. The introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) over the past 10 years marks a new and exciting era in the treatment of valvular disease in these high-risk and inoperable patients. In this review, we outline the historical development, key clinical trials, current outcomes and future directions of TAVR.

Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) — randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) included only symptomatic patients, and "Asymptomatic patients with COR 2a indications for AVR should either undergo SAVR or wait until a COR 1 indication is present before intervention". The recommendation for SAVR in preference to TAVI includes asymptomatic patients with abnormal exercise blood pressure response, elevated serum BNP, rapid hemodynamic progression, or very severe AS with a velocity of ≥ 5 m/s, with the final implantation approach determined by shared decision-making that discusses indications, values, and risks including valve reintervention.

### Impact of rapid ventricular pacing on outcome after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^111kaXcS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Rapid ventricular pacing (RVP) is used commonly during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Little is known about the safety and clinical consequences of this step. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of RVP on immediate and long-term clinical outcomes in a large cohort of non-selected TAVR patients.

Method and Results

The study included 412 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR with a mean age of 82 ± 7 years, of which 47% were male. Patients were divided according to the number of RVPs during the TAVR procedure comparing patients undergoing no pacing (0), 1 to 2, and ≥ 3 pacing episodes (3+). Patients undergoing 3+ pacing episodes were significantly more likely to develop new atrial fibrillation (5.6% versus 7.3% versus 15%, respectively, for 0, 1–2, and 3+ groups, P = 0.047), acute kidney injury (AKI) (18% versus 18% versus 28%, respectively, P < 0.001), prolonged procedural hypotension (0%, 16%, and 25%, respectively; P < 0.001), and suffered greater in-hospital mortality (1.7%, 1.7%, and 6.5%, respectively, P = 0.045), and 1-year mortality (11.1%, 7.7%, and 18%, respectively, P = 0.015). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that acute kidney injury (OR 3.27 [1.763–6.09], P < 0.001), euroSCORE II (OR 1.06 per unit [1.01–1.12], P = 0.03), and 3+ pacing episodes (OR 2.35 [1.18–4.7], P = 0.02) were the only independent predictors for 1-year mortality.

Conclusions

In patients undergoing TAVR, multiple RVP episodes and prolonged RVP duration are associated with adverse outcomes including short- and long-term mortality. Thus, operators should attempt to minimize the use of RVP, especially in patients who are at risk for post-procedural acute kidney injury.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

TAVR decision pathway outline — patients with severe AS with indication for AVR are identified as a potential TAVR candidate, after which a Heart Valve Team is engaged, including cardiology valve and imaging experts, interventional cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, anesthesia, and valve clinic coordination. Patient selection and evaluation include shared decision making goals of care; clinical information (major CV comorbidities, major non-CV comorbidities, risk score assessment); functional assessment (frailty, physical and cognitive function); and risk categories (low risk, intermediate risk, high or extreme risk). Pre-TAVR cardiovascular imaging includes echocardiography to assess aortic valve anatomy, confirm AS severity, LV function, and MR, AR, PAP, RV function, and TAVR protocol computed tomography angiography (CTA) for vascular access, annular sizing, aortic root anatomy, and interventional planning. The TAVR procedure covers preplanning (valve choice and access options, anesthesia and procedure location, anticipated complication management) and procedural details (vascular access and closure, valve delivery and deployment, postdeployment evaluation, management of complications). Echocardiography (TEE or TTE) is used for annular sizing, valve placement, paravalvular leak assessment, and procedural complications. Post-TAVR management includes early postprocedure monitoring and pain management, early mobilization and discharge planning, and monitoring for conduction abnormalities; long-term management includes antithrombotic therapy and endocarditis prophylaxis, management of concurrent cardiac disease, and evaluation of post-TAVR complications. Post-TAVR imaging calls for echo and ECG post-procedure, at 30 days and then annually, assessing valve function, LV size and function, PA systolic pressure, and cardiac rhythm, with ultimate hand back to Clinical Cardiologist & Primary Care Provider.

Post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedural completion and access management — following deployment, the delivery system and sheath are removed, anticoagulation is typically reversed, and access site closure is performed; for percutaneous transfemoral access, a completion descending aortogram is recommended after sheath removal and tying of the percutaneous closure sutures to assess for distal aortic or iliofemoral perforations/dissections; rapid pacing (typically ~120 beats/min) may facilitate tying of aortic and apical sutures for transaortic and transapical approaches, and a pleural and/or pericardial drain may need to be placed after completion for transaortic and transapical cases.

Pathway assumptions and scope — these algorithms assume patients considered for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are adults with calcific valvular aortic stenosis (AS); TAVR for congenital AS, rheumatic valve disease, or isolated aortic regurgitation (AR) has not been studied in clinical trials. The document also assumes that the Heart Valve Team will be involved with all aspects of the decision-making and delivery of this complex technology, and for the majority of this document the patient being considered has already been determined to have an indication for aortic valve replacement (AVR).

Concomitant disease management after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) — care coordination and rhythm surveillance are outlined as follows: long-term management focuses on treatment of comorbid cardiac and noncardiac conditions, many of which are best managed by the primary care provider or geriatrician, with the cardiologist providing consultation regarding changes in cardiac signs or symptoms. Referral back to the Heart Valve Team is appropriate when prosthetic valve dysfunction is a concern or if a second interventional procedure might be needed for another valve or for coronary artery disease. In addition to echocardiography, periodic ECG monitoring is recommended for detection of asymptomatic AF and because heart block or other conduction defects can occur late after TAVR.

### Study details | Ischemic and bleeding risk assessment after TAVR… [^115ivrf1]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Ischemic And Bleeding Risk Assessment After TAVR ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Transcatheter aortic valve replacement represents an effective treatment to improve symptoms and prognosis in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Giving an established uniform approach towards anticoagulation and antithrombotic therapy after TAVR in the post POPULAR-TAVI era, recent data coming from the analysis of different trials, highlight the relevance of the patient's background on the occurrence of ischemic and bleeding events. Despite this a targeted antithrombotic strategy remains unexplored and all patients undergoing TAVR without other indication to DAPT or OAC, were currently treated according with the concept of "less is more" regardless the risk level.

The keys points of the project will be 1) the assessment of ischemic and bleeding risk after TAVR stratified according with antithrombotic therapy and surgical risk; 2) the evaluation of the impact of prostheses type and the complete blood count variables on the daily average ischemic and bleeding risk and 3) the evaluation of the dynamic therapeutic changes after TAVR during the follow up. By comparing the frequency of ischemic and bleeding events, data from trial revealed that the bleeding events were more frequent than the ischemic one despite the level of surgical risk, however a gradient of reduction in terms of difference was seen from the highest to the lowest risk profile. Furthermore, recent literature showed how the timeframe analysis approach, giving the possibility for a complete time variability evaluation, is able to visualize the fluctuation of the risk over the time.

Unfortunately, no stratified data according with the surgical risk level, are available using this approach. Moreover, despite these results that highlight the relevance of the patient's background on the occurrence of ischemic and bleeding events, a tailored antithrombotic strategy remains unexplored and all patients undergoing TAVR without other indication to DAPT or OAC, were currently treated with a uniform approach in terms of intensity during the time. Thus, the comprehension of this phenomena holds the potential benefit of a tailored antithrombotic therapy guided by an integrated approach based on the trend of ischemic and bleeding risk stratified according to the patient's risk profile and the antithrombotic regimen adopted.

### Hemodynamic impact of cipepofol vs propofol during anesthesia induction in patients with severe aortic stenosis… [^116KWHYV]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Results A total of 124 patients with AS scheduled for TAVR were randomized into either the cipepofol group or the propofol group. Of 124 patients randomized, 1 patient from each group was excluded due to ineligibility for the TAVR procedure, and data were analyzed for 122 patients based on the intention-to-treat principle. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT05881291 Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is a less invasive alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement for patients with severe aortic stenosis. 1 Arterial hypotension is a common complication that can occur from anesthesia induction to the first surgical incision, 2–5 particularly in older patients with compromised preoperative physical status. 3, 5, 6 AS is characterized by left ventricular outflow obstruction, leading to inadequate cardiac output and heart failure.

7 A significant proportion of patients have concomitant coronary artery disease. 8 Peripheral vascular resistance is crucial for maintaining blood pressure in this population. Propofol is a commonly used induction anesthetic for patients undergoing TAVR; however, its use is linked to excessive vasodilation and decreased cardiac output, frequently leading to arterial hypotension. 10, 11 Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify an alternative anesthetic that offers a similar anesthetic efficacy to propofol while offering better hemodynamic stability. TAVR is recommended in older patients or in those who are considered high risk or unsuitable for surgery according to the 2021 European Society of Cardiology /European Association. During induction, BIS values showed no statistically significant differences between groups.

This randomized clinical trial demonstrated that compared with propofol, cipepofol at an equipotent dose provided superior hemodynamic stability during anesthesia induction in patients undergoing TAVR, especially for older patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. Specifically, patients managed with cipepofol significantly reduced the AUC within the first 15 minutes postinduction. The benefit of cipepofol did not seem to be due to compromised anesthesia depth, as there were no differences in the BIS index between the 2 groups within 15 minutes postinduction.

### Valve implantation for successful sealing of a balloon predilatation-induced annular rupture during transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^114a2JGu]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Annular rupture is a rare and dreaded complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and even rarer when caused by predilatation balloon aortic valvuloplasty. This complication often presents as sudden cardiac tamponade with hypotension and requires urgent intervention. The traditional rescue strategy for patients with annular rupture is emergency surgical repair. However, the mortality rate is still high, considering that most patients who undergo TAVR are not candidates for conventional cardiac surgery. Therefore, there is a need for additional emergency treatment strategies to decrease mortality. This report describes a case of predilatation-induced annular rupture during TAVR that was successfully sealed at the rupture site by valve implantation. This case suggests that continuing with valve deployment may be a successful treatment for predilatation-induced annular rupture during TAVR.

### Transcatheter aortic valve implantation: anesthetic considerations [^1122tKuD]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Aortic valvular stenosis remains the most common debilitating valvular heart lesion. Despite the benefit of aortic valve (AV) replacement, many high-risk patients cannot tolerate surgery. AV implantation treats aortic stenosis without subjecting patients to sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and aorta cross-clamping. This transcatheter procedure is performed via puncture of the left ventricular (LV) apex or percutaneously, via the femoral artery or vein. Patients undergo general anesthesia, intense hemodynamic manipulation, and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). To elucidate the role of the anesthesiologist in the management of transcatheter AV implantation, we review the literature and provide our experience, focusing on anesthetic care, intraoperative events, TEE, and perioperative complications. Two approaches to the aortic annulus are performed today: transfemoral retrograde and transapical antegrade. Iliac artery size and tortuosity, aortic arch atheroma, and pathology in the area of the (LV) apex help determine the preferred approach in each patient. A general anesthetic is tailored to achieve extubation after procedure completion, whereas IV access and pharmacological support allow for emergent sternotomy and initiation of CPB. Rapid ventricular pacing and cessation of mechanical ventilation interrupts cardiac ejection and minimizes heart translocation during valvuloplasty and prosthesis implantation. Although these maneuvers facilitate exact prosthesis positioning within the native annulus, they promote hypotension and arrhythmia. Vasopressor administration before pacing and cardioversion may restore adequate hemodynamics. TEE determines annulus size, aortic pathology, ventricular function, and mitral regurgitation. TEE and fluoroscopy are used for positioning the introducer catheter within the aortic annulus. The prosthesis, crimped on a valvuloplasty balloon catheter, is implanted by inflation. TEE immediately measures aortic regurgitation and assesses for aortic dissection. After repair of femoral vessels or LV apex, patients are allowed to emerge and assessed for extubation. Observed and published complications include aortic regurgitation, prosthesis embolization, mitral valve disruption, hemorrhage, aortic dissection, CPB, stroke, and death. Transcatheter AV implantation relies on intraoperative hemodynamic manipulation for success. Transfemoral and transapical approaches pose unique management challenges, but both require rapid ventricular pacing, the management of hypotension and arrhythmias during beating-heart valve implantation, and TEE. Anesthesiologists will care for debilitated patients with aortic stenosis receiving transcatheter AV implantation.

### Complications after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement with a balloon-expandable prosthesis: the importance of preventative measures and contingency planning [^115oMhFt]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with balloon-expandable Edwards-SAPIEN valve was superior to standard therapy in inoperable patients and noninferior to surgical aortic valve replacement in high surgical-risk, but operable patients, with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis in the randomized controlled PARTNER trial. Since the first case of TAVR with a balloon-expandable valve in 2002, several groups have reported their experience with balloon-expandable valves with high-procedural success. In the United States, the balloon-expandable Edwards-SAPIEN valve is the only transcatheter heart valve approved by the FDA for commercial use. Moreover, this is only in high-risk inoperable patients. Despite increasing experience with the TAVR procedure, it can be associated with complications, which can be technically challenging, even for an experienced operator. Complications associated with TAVR include vascular complications, valve malpositioning, regurgitation, embolization, coronary compromise, conduction abnormalities, stroke/transient ischemic attack, acute kidney injury, cardiac tamponade, and hemodynamic collapse. A thorough understanding of the procedure is essential for pre-emptive planning for procedural complications and early identification and management of complications are necessary for procedural success. We hereby review our experience of transfemoral TAVR with balloon-expandable valves, offer practical tips to maximize the likelihood of procedural success, describe pre-emptive strategies to prevent peri-procedural complications and bailout measures to manage them, should they occur. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a safe and effective therapy for patients with severe, symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. As the patient population being referred for TAVR expands, waiting times for the procedure have extendedmostly due to the larger candidate population and meticulous pre‐TAVR evaluation process including various imaging studies and heart team discussions.

Left untreated, patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) will suffer frequent heart failure decompensations events often requiring hospitalizationand in extreme situations, patients will develop pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock, unresponsive to medical treatment. Expedited TAVR has emerged as a treatment option for these high‐risk patients. However, the data regarding the procedural success and outcome of these intervention in extremely sick population is limited.

Thus, the purpose of this current study was to evaluate frequency as well as the short and long‐term outcome of patients undergoing expedited TAVR among a real‐life, large population with AS.
