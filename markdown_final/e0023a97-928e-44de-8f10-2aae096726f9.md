## Question

Trichotillomania

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and wants a stepwise expert analysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disorder's classification and core phenomenology. Then, I should verify epidemiology and burden. Next, I will review comorbidity and functional impact. After that, I need to appraise diagnostic nuances, including DSM-5 changes and the automatic versus focused pulling distinction. Then, I should evaluate evidence-based treatments, starting with behavioral therapies and followed by pharmacologic options. I will then consider special populations, subtyping, and relapse prevention. Finally, I will integrate this into a pragmatic, staged clinical plan with monitoring and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the nosology and phenomenology so I don't misframe the problem. Trichotillomania is classified under Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders in DSM-5, having moved from impulse-control disorders, which better reflects shared phenomenology with OCD and related conditions like excoriation disorder and body dysmorphic disorder [^111cK4Y4]. Wait, let me verify the core features: recurrent hair pulling from any hair-bearing site, resulting in hair loss, repeated attempts to stop, and clinically significant distress or impairment; many patients experience "automatic" pulling with low awareness, whereas others engage in "focused" pulling driven by sensory or emotional triggers, and these styles can co-occur within the same individual, complicating treatment selection and prognosis [^111Gip3w] [^113iG1t7].

> I need to check the epidemiology to calibrate pretest probability and screening thresholds. Community estimates suggest a point prevalence around 1% for DSM-defined TTM, whereas subthreshold hair-pulling behaviors may be far more common, with pooled estimates near 8–9%, and the female-to-male ratio approximates 2:1 in treatment-seeking samples, although some epidemiologic samples suggest closer parity, which may reflect ascertainment bias rather than true differences in prevalence [^112UYeQd] [^1122csTm]. Hold on, I should verify age of onset: most studies converge on a pediatric-to-adolescent onset, with mean ages around the mid-teens, which underscores the need for early identification and intervention to mitigate chronicity and impairment [^111ivYUD].

> Next, I should review comorbidity and functional burden because they drive both assessment and treatment sequencing. High rates of anxiety and depressive disorders are reported, alongside substantial rates of OCD, ADHD, PTSD, and substance use, and suicidality is not rare and tracks with comorbid depression, so routine screening for mood and suicidality is warranted; quality of life is consistently reduced across academic, occupational, and social domains, with high shame and avoidance contributing to underdiagnosis and delayed care [^116swPtk] [^112ACY5F] [^112tDmVK]. I should double-check the physical risks: trichophagia occurs in a minority but can lead to trichobezoars and Rapunzel syndrome, which mandate anticipatory guidance and monitoring in susceptible patients [^112tDmVK] [^116C35Pk].

> Now, I will examine diagnostic nuances so I don't over-apply legacy criteria. DSM-5 removed the prior requirement for increasing tension before pulling and pleasure/relief after pulling because these features are not universal; many patients endorse urges or sensory experiences without classic tension-release, and this change improves diagnostic sensitivity without sacrificing specificity, which I should keep in mind when eliciting phenomenology during assessment [^111Gip3w] [^113HU5mx]. Let me reconsider the automatic versus focused distinction: although this schema can guide treatment selection, high co-occurrence limits its utility for rigid subtyping, and recent work suggests a dimensional approach better captures the heterogeneity and its treatment implications, especially given that mixed automatic-focused presentations tend to be more severe and treatment-resistant [^113iG1t7] [^113HCnfq].

> Before jumping to treatment, I should confirm how we measure response so I can interpret trial data correctly. The Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale and the NIMH Trichotillomania Severity Scale are standard, and signal detection work suggests that approximately a 45% reduction on the MGH-HPS or a 7-point raw change best indicates response, while a 55–60% reduction approximates remission; these benchmarks help with shared decision-making and with judging whether a given intervention is working clinically rather than just statistically [^1128mdeZ].

> Turning to treatment, I will now examine behavioral therapies as first-line, because I need to ensure I anchor care to the highest-certainty evidence. Habit reversal training (HRT) and its variants (for example, acceptance-enhanced HRT, DBT-enhanced HRT, ACT-based approaches) consistently produce large effects versus control conditions in adults and children, with superiority to SSRIs and maintenance of gains in some studies, although relapse remains a concern and booster strategies are often needed; HRT's components — awareness training, competing response practice, and motivational enhancement — map well onto both automatic and focused pulling, which supports broad applicability with tailoring to style and triggers [^1131hCDq] [^111U1JFX] [^117Vwo4D] [^116f2oMv]. Wait, let me verify group formats: randomized and uncontrolled studies of group CBT/HRT also show benefit and can expand access, though therapist competence and manualized delivery still matter for effect sizes and durability [^1132ARM8].

> I should confirm pharmacologic evidence so I don't overstate or understate what to offer when psychotherapy is declined, unavailable, or insufficient. There are no FDA-approved medications for TTM, and SSRIs have not shown robust efficacy in rigorous trials, with Cochrane concluding insufficient evidence for any medication class and meta-analytic data showing only small, inconsistent effects; thus, SSRIs should not be first-line for TTM per se, though they remain appropriate for comorbid anxiety or depression when clinically indicated [^1177mcBh] [^114EwK6t] [^1131hCDq]. But wait, what about promising agents? N-acetylcysteine showed a significant benefit in adults in one RCT but failed to separate from placebo in pediatric RCTs, so I should not extrapolate adult data to youth; olanzapine showed a large effect in a small RCT but metabolic risks constrain its use to carefully selected, treatment-refractory cases; clomipramine may outperform desipramine in a small trial but tolerability is limited; memantine has emerging positive data in adults with TTM or skin picking and deserves replication; onabotulinumtoxinA has intriguing case-level signals but remains investigational [^1177mcBh] [^1131hCDq] [^111Kby4P] [^112NiEaH] [^116p3miU] [^111f8ojv].

> Next, I should review pediatric considerations so I don't inadvertently apply adult algorithms to children. For youth, behavioral therapy remains first-line and is superior to minimal-attention control, with durability in some trials; pharmacotherapy evidence is sparse and generally negative for NAC in adolescents, so medications should be reserved for severe, refractory cases or when comorbidities dictate their use, ideally coordinated with behavioral intervention and family engagement [^11471Fys] [^116f2oMv] [^111Kby4P]. Hold on, I should verify developmental trajectory: early-onset cases can be self-limited but many persist, so watchful waiting without active behavioral intervention risks chronicity and cumulative impairment, which argues for early, structured behavioral treatment when available [^116SnAqR].

> I will now examine relapse prevention and maintenance, because short-term gains often wane without planned follow-up. Booster sessions, ongoing awareness practice, and strategies targeting emotion regulation appear to improve durability; DBT-enhanced HRT and ACT-informed approaches correlate with sustained improvements and better coping with triggers, though more controlled data are needed to define optimal maintenance schedules and predictors of relapse [^117Vwo4D] [^112xnjuH] [^1174YyH3]. Let me think about implementation: embedding cue exposure, competing responses tailored to sensory triggers, and relapse-prevention plans can help maintain gains between and after formal treatment phases.

> I should also consider subtyping and individualized care, but I need to be cautious not to overfit unvalidated categories. Mixed automatic-focused pulling appears linked to greater severity and poorer response to HRT alone, suggesting a need to layer awareness-enhancement, emotion-regulation skills, and possibly pharmacologic augmentation; emerging work hints that targeting trans-diagnostic compulsivity and emotion dysregulation may address residual functional impairment even when hair-pulling frequency declines, which could reshape outcome measurement and treatment design [^113iG1t7] [^116WS7Y1]. Hold on, I should verify family history utility: first-degree family loading for OCD and related disorders may index greater impulsivity and distress intolerance, which could guide both psychoeducation and the intensity of behavioral intervention [^11276ihY].

> Next, I should review dermatologic and procedural adjuncts, making sure I separate symptomatic improvement from hair regrowth. Microneedling has case-level evidence suggesting dual benefit — promoting regrowth and serving as a competing response — particularly for scalp pulling; for eyelash or eyebrow involvement, bimatoprost or minoxidil can accelerate cosmetic recovery while behavioral work proceeds, but I need to ensure these are framed as adjuncts rather than primary treatments for the BFRB itself [^1126krKS] [^115HturY] [^116ZP5Xj]. I should confirm safety and tolerability: microneedling appears safe when taught properly, but education on technique and infection control is essential to avoid harm [^1126krKS].

> Bringing this together into a pragmatic, staged clinical plan, I should start with psychoeducation, functional analysis of triggers, and initiation of HRT or an evidence-based variant, setting response benchmarks using validated scales and the 45% reduction threshold for response; if response is inadequate after an adequate trial, consider augmentation with NAC in adults given its favorable risk-benefit profile, and reserve antipsychotic augmentation (for example, low-dose aripiprazole or carefully monitored olanzapine) for severe, refractory cases with explicit metabolic risk counseling; throughout, screen and treat comorbidities, especially mood, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD, and maintain regular follow-up with relapse-prevention planning and booster sessions [^115ANws2] [^1128mdeZ] [^1177mcBh] [^1131hCDq] [^114MDS4j]. But wait, what if the patient is a child or adolescent? In that case, prioritize behavioral therapy and family involvement, avoid routine pharmacotherapy as first-line, and escalate to medication only for severe impairment or comorbidity-driven indications, ideally in coordination with pediatric mental health specialists [^11471Fys] [^116f2oMv].

> Finally, I should double-check safety and monitoring so I don't miss preventable harms. Given elevated rates of depression and suicidality, screen at baseline and periodically; assess for trichophagia and counsel on trichobezoar risk; if antipsychotics are used, monitor weight, glucose, and lipids; and if NAC is used, watch for gastrointestinal tolerability and drug interactions, while reinforcing that behavioral strategies remain foundational even when medications are added [^112ACY5F] [^112tDmVK] [^1177mcBh] [^115ANws2].

Trichotillomania is a **body-focused repetitive behavior** characterized by recurrent hair pulling with **noticeable hair loss** and significant distress or impairment [^115ANws2]. It is classified in DSM-5 under obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, with a prevalence of about 1–3% and a female predominance in clinical samples [^111cK4Y4] [^112UYeQd] [^114MDS4j]. The disorder often begins in childhood or adolescence and can be chronic, with **comorbid anxiety, depression, and OCD** common [^111ivYUD] [^116swPtk]. First-line treatment is **habit reversal training** (HRT) within CBT, with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) as adjuncts [^1171YBtD] [^1131hCDq]. Pharmacologically, **N-acetylcysteine (NAC)** has moderate evidence in adults, while SSRIs and antipsychotics have limited or conflicting support; no medications are FDA-approved for TTM [^1177mcBh] [^112DNi88]. Management should be individualized, addressing comorbidities and using combined behavioral and pharmacologic approaches for optimal outcomes [^115ANws2].

---

## Clinical features and diagnostic criteria

According to DSM-5, **diagnostic criteria** include:

- **Recurrent hair pulling** resulting in hair loss.
- Repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling.
- Hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment.
- Hair pulling is not better explained by another medical condition or mental disorder [^notfound].

Hair pulling can involve **scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, or other body areas**, and may be accompanied by **trichophagia** (hair ingestion), which can lead to trichobezoars and gastrointestinal complications [^116C35Pk].

---

## Epidemiology and demographic characteristics

Prevalence is approximately 1–3% in the general population, with a female predominance in clinical samples; onset is typically in childhood or adolescence, and the course is often chronic with **waxing and waning symptoms** [^112UYeQd] [^113LvHGB].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

The etiology is **multifactorial**, involving genetic, neurobiological, and environmental factors:

- **Genetic factors**: Family and twin studies suggest a genetic predisposition, with higher prevalence among first-degree relatives of individuals with TTM [^11276ihY].
- **Neurobiological factors**: Abnormalities in serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate systems have been implicated. Neuroimaging studies show altered activity in cortico-striatal circuits involved in habit formation and impulse control [^116p3miU].
- **Environmental factors**: Stress, anxiety, and traumatic experiences are common triggers. Emotional regulation difficulties and negative reinforcement (relief of tension or anxiety) maintain the behavior [^1157powb].

---

## Comorbidities and associated conditions

TTM commonly co-occurs with other psychiatric conditions, including **anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)** [^116swPtk] [^112tDmVK]. Trichophagia can lead to trichobezoars, causing gastrointestinal obstruction and requiring surgical intervention [^116C35Pk].

---

## Treatment approaches

### Psychological interventions

Psychological interventions are the cornerstone of TTM treatment, with **habit reversal training (HRT)** — a core CBT technique that increases awareness of triggers and teaches competing responses — demonstrating significant efficacy in reducing hair-pulling symptoms [^1131hCDq]. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) enhances HRT by addressing emotional triggers and promoting acceptance of urges, while **dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)** is useful for individuals with significant emotion regulation difficulties [^117Vwo4D] [^112xnjuH].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

Currently, **no medications are FDA-approved** for TTM, though several have been studied:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Evidence level** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| SSRIs | - Fluoxetine <br/> - Sertraline | Limited/conflicting | Some trials show no significant benefit; may help comorbid anxiety/depression [^111U1JFX] [^115ANws2] |
| Tricyclic antidepressants | Clomipramine | Moderate | Some benefit reported, but side effects limit use [^1177mcBh] |
| Antipsychotics | - Olanzapine <br/> - Aripiprazole | Limited | Small studies suggest potential benefit; metabolic side effects [^112NiEaH] [^115UVLNY] |
| Glutamate modulators | - N-acetylcysteine (NAC) <br/> - Memantine | Moderate | NAC shows moderate benefit in adults; memantine promising in recent trials [^1177mcBh] [^116p3miU] |

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

TTM is often chronic, with **waxing and waning symptoms**. Long-term outcomes depend on illness severity, comorbidities, and treatment adherence. Relapse is common, particularly without ongoing maintenance therapy or booster sessions [^112xnjuH] [^1174YyH3].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on:

- **Neurobiological mechanisms**: Investigating genetic factors, neurotransmitter systems, and neural circuits involved in TTM [^112QN9ei].
- **Development of novel pharmacological treatments**: Exploring glutamate modulators, opioid antagonists, and other agents [^1177mcBh].
- **Personalized medicine**: Tailoring treatments based on individual patient characteristics, comorbidities, and response patterns [^114sCm2y].

---

Trichotillomania is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent hair pulling, with significant distress and impairment. Psychological interventions, particularly **HRT and CBT**, are effective, while pharmacological treatments remain limited. Ongoing research aims to elucidate mechanisms and develop targeted therapies.

### Pharmacotherapy for trichotillomania [^112DNi88]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Trichotillomania (TTM) (hair-pulling disorder) is a prevalent and disabling disorder characterised by recurrent hair-pulling. The effect of medication on trichotillomania has not been systematically evaluated.

Objectives

To assess the effects of medication for trichotillomania in adults compared with placebo or other active agents.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register (to 31 July 2013), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years); EMBASE (1974 to date); MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Two review authors identified relevant trials by assessing the abstracts of all possible studies.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of a medication versus placebo or active agent for TTM in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed the data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments, and disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third review author. Primary outcomes included the mean difference (MD) in reduction of trichotillomania symptoms on a continuous measure of trichotillomania symptom severity, and the risk ratio (RR) of the clinical response based on a dichotomous measure, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We identified eight studies with a total of 204 participants and a mean sample size of 25. All trials were single-centre trials, and participants seen on an outpatient basis. Seven studies compared medication and placebo (n = 184); one study compared medication and another active agent (n = 13). Duration of the studies was six to twelve weeks. Meta-analysis was not undertaken because of the methodological heterogeneity of the trials. The studies did not employ intention-to-treat analyses and were at a high risk of attrition bias. Adverse events were not well-documented in the studies. None of the three studies of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) demonstrated strong evidence of a treatment effect on any of the outcomes of interest. The unpublished naltrexone study did not provide strong evidence of a treatment effect. Two studies, an olanzapine study and a N-acetylcysteine (NAC) study, reported statistically significant treatment effects. One study of clomipramine demonstrated a treatment effect on two out of three measures of response to treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

No particular medication class definitively demonstrates efficacy in the treatment of trichotillomania. Preliminary evidence suggests treatment effects of clomipramine, NAC and olanzapine based on three individual trials, albeit with very small sample sizes.

### Treatment strategies for pediatric trichotillomania: state-of-the-art review on progress and persistent challenges [^11471Fys]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Trichotillomania (TTM) is a condition characterized by recurrent hair pulling, often resulting in hair loss and functional impairment. The disorder remains underreported in the pediatric population, despite high rates of psychiatric comorbidities. Moreover, diagnosing and treating TTM among children remains challenging due to a lack of standardized guidelines. Hence, this systematic review aims to evaluate the current treatment approaches for pediatric TTM. A comprehensive search was conducted of five databases, using the search concepts of trichotillomania, pediatric populations, and treatments/interventions. Studies were included if they (1) directly addressed the topic, (2) were of an appropriate study type (e.g., clinical trials, case-control studies, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, or interview studies), (3) were published within the past 10years, and (4) appeared in peer-reviewed journals published in English. Ultimately, 10 studies met our inclusion criteria, from which data were extracted and synthesized following formal quality assessment. Our results indicate that behavioral interventions, particularly habit reversal training, consistently demonstrated the greatest therapeutic benefit. Pharmacological treatments, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, have been explored in various case series. Although some individuals have shown improvement, overall evidence remains insufficient to support pharmacotherapy as first-line. Alternative therapies, such as N-acetylcysteine, have also been studied, though findings are variable and require further investigation in pediatric cohorts. Our review underscores the importance of early behavioral intervention and the need for larger, controlled studies to inform standardized treatment protocols. Given the functional and psychosocial burden of TTM in youth, comprehensive management strategies are essential.

### Pharmacotherapy for trichotillomania [^1177mcBh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Trichotillomania (TTM; hair-pulling disorder) is a prevalent and disabling disorder characterised by recurrent hair-pulling. Here we update a previous Cochrane Review on the effects of medication for TTM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of medication for trichotillomania (TTM) in adults, children and adolescents compared with placebo or other medication.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, eleven other bibliographic databases, trial registries and grey literature sources (to 26 November 2020). We checked reference lists and contacted subject experts.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials of medication versus placebo or other medication for TTM in adults, children and adolescents.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Twelve studies were included. We identified 10 studies in adults (286 participants) with a mean sample size of 29 participants per trial; one study in children and adolescents (39 participants); and, one study in adults and adolescents (22 participants: 18 adults and 4 adolescents). All studies were single-centre, outpatient trials. Eleven studies compared medication and placebo (334 participants); one study compared two medications (13 participants). Studies were 5 to 13 weeks duration. We undertook meta-analysis only for opioid antagonists as other comparisons contained a single study, or reported insufficient data. Antioxidants versus placebo in adults There was little to no difference in treatment response between antioxidant (35.7%) and placebo groups (28.6%) after six weeks, based on a single trial of silymarin (risk ratio (RR) 2.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 5.99; 36 participants; low-certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (18 participants; low-certainty evidence). Antioxidants versus placebo in adolescents There was little to no difference in treatment response between antioxidant (50%) and placebo groups (25%) after six weeks, based on a single trial of silymarin (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.28 to 14.20; 8 participants; low-certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (8 participants; low-certainty evidence). Antipsychotics versus placebo in adults There may be greater treatment response in the antipsychotic group (85%) compared to the placebo group (17%) after 12 weeks, based on a single trial of olanzapine (RR 5.08, 95% CI 1.4 to 18.37; 25 participants; low-certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (25 participants; low-certainty evidence). Cell signal transducers versus placebo in adults There was little to no difference in treatment response between cell signal transducer (42.1%) and placebo groups (31.6%) after 10 weeks, based on a single trial of inositol (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.57 to 3.11; 38 participants; low-certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (38 participants; low-certainty evidence). Glutamate modulators versus placebo in adults There is probably greater treatment response in the glutamate modulator group (56%) compared to the placebo group (16%) after 12 weeks, based on a single trial of N-acetylcysteine (RR 3.5, 95% CI 1.34 to 9.17; 50 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (50 participants; low-certainty evidence). Glutamate modulators versus placebo in children and adolescents There was little to no difference in treatment response between the glutamate modulator (25%) and placebo groups (21.1%) in children and adolescents, based on a single trial of N-acetylcysteine (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.77; 39 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference in dropouts due to adverse events between glutamate modulator (5%) and placebo (0%) groups, based on a single trial (RR 2.86, 95% CI 0.12 to 66.11; 39 participants; low-certainty evidence). Opioid antagonists versus placebo in adults There may be little to no difference in treatment response between opioid antagonist (37.5%) and placebo groups (25%) after six to eight weeks, based on two studies of naltrexone, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.25 to 18.17; 2 studies, 68 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available regarding dropouts due to adverse events. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus placebo in adults There were no data available for treatment response to SSRIs. There was little to no difference in dropouts due to adverse events in the SSRI group (5.1%) compared to the placebo group (0%) after 6 to 12 weeks, based on two trials of fluoxetine (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.62; 2 studies, 78 participants; low-certainty evidence). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) with predominantly serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) actions versus placebo in adults There may be greater treatment response in the TCAs with predominantly SRI actions group (40%) compared to the placebo group (0%) after nine weeks, but the evidence is very uncertain, based on a single trial of clomipramine (RR 5.73, 95% CI 0.36 to 90.83; 16 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There may be increased dropouts due to adverse events in the TCAs with predominantly SRI actions group (30%) compared to the placebo group (0%), but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 4.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 73.81; 16 participants; very low-certainty evidence). TCAs with predominantly SRI actions versus other TCAs in adults There may be greater treatment response in the TCAs with predominantly SRI actions group compared to the other TCAs group after five weeks, based on a single trial comparing clomipramine to desipramine (mean difference (MD) -4.00, 95% CI -6.13 to -1.87; 26 participants; low-certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (26 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence from meta-analysis to confirm or refute the efficacy of any agent or class of medication for the treatment of TTM in adults, children or adolescents. Preliminary evidence suggests there may be beneficial treatment effects for N-acetylcysteine, clomipramine and olanzapine in adults based on four trials, albeit with relatively small sample sizes.

### Pharmacological and behavioral treatment for trichotillomania: an updated systematic review with meta-analysis [^1131hCDq]. Depression and Anxiety (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Trichotillomania (TTM) is a difficult-to-treat psychiatric condition with no first-line medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Individuals with TTM often feel that clinicians know little about this disorder. Here, we present an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining treatments for TTM.

Methods

Pubmed, PsychINFO, Embase, and CENTRAL were searched with the terms "Trichotillomania OR Hair Pulling Disorder" to identify randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating treatments for TTM.

Results

Twenty-four trials involving 26 comparisons and 857 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Behavioral therapy with habit-reversal training components (BT-HRT) demonstrated a large benefit compared to control conditions (standardized mean difference [SMD] [95% CI] = -1.22 [-1.71, -0.73], p < .0001) for improving TTM symptoms. Clomipramine (SMD [95% CI] = -0.71 [-1.38, -0.05], p = .036), N-acetylcysteine (SMD [95% CI] = -0.75 [-1.36, -0.13], p = .017) and olanzapine (SMD [95% CI] = -0.94 [-1.77, -0.12], p = .025) demonstrated significant benefits compared to placebo in RCTs.

Conclusions

BT-HRT has demonstrated the largest treatment effects and has the strongest evidence base for reducing TTM symptoms. In contrast, several pharmacological agents have demonstrated efficacy in single randomized clinical trials that would benefit from replication. Additional trials are needed to identify other effective medications for TTM and determine the relative efficacy of available agents.

### Pediatric trichotillomania [^116app9o]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Trichotillomania (TTM) is an impulse control disorder characterized by chronic hair-pulling, distress, and impairment. Although the negative effects of TTM are documented and often readily evident, there remains a paucity of psychopathology and treatment research on this disorder, particularly in pediatric populations. In an effort to improve assessment of pediatric TTM, several TTM-specific instruments for youth have now been developed to reliably identify symptoms and examine related phenomenology. Instrument development has now yielded instruments to evaluate TTM and related symptoms in the context of clinical trials of youth, and the first randomized controlled trial of any treatment for pediatric TTM was recently published. Using the initial pediatric TTM studies as building blocks, future research is now needed to create a stronger body of knowledge about the relative and combined efficacy of potential interventions for TTM in youth, as well as to examine the effects of TTM phenomenology and comorbidity on treatment outcome. Dissemination efforts must also be heightened for this knowledge to best reach these vulnerable populations.

### Hair-pulling disorder (trichotillomania): etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment in a nutshell [^1139yXht]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Hair-pulling disorder (Trichotillomania) is a disabling mental disorder. Patient's behavior is characterized by the recurrent pulling of own hair with hair loss and a marked dysfunction in various areas of daily life. Trichotillomania is a relatively common disorder with pediatric onset, often associated with significant morbidity, comorbidity, and functional decline. Surprisingly, children or adolescents have been little studied in the research studies on the pathophysiology and psychopathology of trichotillomania. Furthermore, more evidences regarding the effective and evidence-based pharmacological interventions for the treatment of this condition are encouraged. This narrative review will report on the etiopathogenesis and clinical manifestations of trichotillomania including criteria for diagnosis and treatment issues of this complex mental disorder.

### Examining DSM criteria for trichotillomania in a dimensional framework: implications for DSM-5 and diagnostic practice [^111Hdmuq]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of trichotillomania (TTM) requires meeting several criteria that aim to embody the core pathology of the disorder. These criteria are traditionally interpreted monothetically, in that they are all equally necessary for diagnosis. Alternatively, a dimensional conceptualization of psychopathology allows for examination of the relatedness of each criterion to the TTM latent continuum.

Objectives

First, to examine the ability of recently removed criteria (B and C) to identify the latent dimensions of TTM psychopathology, such that they discriminate between individuals with low and high degrees of hair pulling severity. Second, to determine the impact of removing criteria B and C on the information content of remaining diagnostic criteria. Third, to determine the psychometric properties of remaining TTM diagnostic criteria that remain largely unchanged in DSM-5; that is, whether they measure distinct or overlapping levels of TTM psychopathology. Fourth, to determine whether information content derived from diagnostic criteria aid in the prediction of disease trajectory (i.e., can relapse propensity be predicted from criteria endorsement patterns).

Method

Statistics derived from item response theory were used to examine diagnostic criteria endorsement in 91 adults with TTM who underwent psychotherapy.

Results

The removal of two criteria in DSM-5 and psychometric validity of remaining criteria was supported. Additionally, individual trait parameters were used to predict treatment progress, uncovering predictive power where none previously existed.

Conclusions

Diagnostic criteria for TTM should be examined in dimensional models, which allow for nuanced and sensitive measurement of core symptomology in treatment contexts.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of olanzapine in the treatment of trichotillomania [^112NiEaH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Trichotillomania has been considered as part of the obsessive-compulsive disorder spectrum; however, trichotillomania treatment with obsessive-compulsive disorder medications has largely been unsuccessful.

Objective

To determine whether a dopaminergic treatment as used in tics and Tourette's syndrome would be effective in trichotillomania.

Method

Twenty-five participants with DSM-IV trichotillomania participated in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of flexible-dose olanzapine for trichotillomania. Recruitment occurred between August 2001 and December 2005, and follow-up was completed in February 2006. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale, and secondary measures of efficacy included the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale for Trichotillomania (TTM-YBOCS) and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scale.

Results

Eleven of 13 participants (85%) in the olanzapine group and 2 of 12 (17%) in the placebo group were considered responders according to the CGI-I (P = 0.001). There was a significant change from baseline to end point in the TTM-YBOCS (P < .01) and the CGI-S (P < .001). The mean ± SD dose of olanzapine at end point was 10.8 ± 5.7 mg/d. Twenty-one of 25 patients (84%) reported at least 1 adverse event, but no adverse events resulted in early withdrawal from the study.

Conclusion

Olanzapine seems to be a safe and effective treatment for primary DSM-IV trichotillomania.

### Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder): clinical characteristics, psychosocial aspects, treatment approaches, and ethical considerations [^113LvHGB]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) is a fairly common but underreported disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of pulling hair from different parts of the body. Currently classified in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-5) under the heading of the "Obsessive-compulsive spectrum and related disorders". The estimated prevalence data suggest that 0.5–2% of the general population suffers from this disorder. Stress and anxiety are directly correlated to the production of trichotillomania symptoms. The psychosocial aspects of trichotillomania are greatly underestimated, but recent literature suggests an increased interest in this neglected area. Although no FDA approved medications are available for the treatment of trichotillomania, a variety of medications including N-acetylcysteine have shown benefit in case reports. Combined liaison clinics, with an interdisciplinary approach, are highly advisable in the treatment of these cases.

### Long-term follow-up of acceptance-enhanced behavior therapy for trichotillomania [^117Vwo4D]. Psychiatry Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Acceptance-enhanced behavior therapy for trichotillomania (AEBT-TTM) is effective in reducing trichotillomania (TTM) symptoms, but the durability of treatment effects remains in question. This study analyzed 6-month follow-up data from a large randomized clinical trial comparing AEBT-TTM to an active psychoeducation and supportive therapy control (PST). Adults with TTM (N = 85; 92% women) received 10 sessions of AEBT-TTM or PST across 12 weeks. Independent evaluators assessed participants at baseline, post-treatment, and 6 months follow-up. For both AEBT-TTM and PST, self-reported and evaluator-rated TTM symptom severity decreased from baseline to follow-up. TTM symptoms did not worsen from post-treatment to follow-up. At follow-up, AEBT-TTM and PST did not differ in rates of treatment response, TTM diagnosis, or symptom severity. High baseline TTM symptom severity was a stronger predictor of high follow-up severity for PST than for AEBT-TTM, suggesting AEBT-TTM may be a better option for more severe TTM. Results support the efficacy of AEBT-TTM and show that treatment gains were maintained over time. Although AEBT-TTM yielded lower symptoms at post-treatment, 6-month follow-up outcomes suggest AEBT-TTM and PST may lead to similar symptom levels in the longer term. Future research should examine mechanisms that contribute to long-term gain maintenance.

### Single modality versus dual modality treatment for trichotillomania: sertraline, behavioral therapy, or both? [^116sUtVA]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Trichotillomania is a psychiatric condition characterized by chronic hair pulling. Both cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have shown promise in the treatment of trichotillomania, with comparison studies favoring CBT over pharmacotherapy. However, no randomized, controlled studies to date have compared the efficacy of individual SSRI or CBT treatment to the combination of both treatment modalities.

Method

In this study, which ran from February 2000 through April 2003, subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for trichotillomania were randomly assigned to treatment with sertraline or placebo in a double-blind study design. Following 12 weeks of active pharmacotherapy, subjects not demonstrating significant trichotillomania symptom improvement had habit reversal training (HRT) added to their treatment regimen. Primary outcome measures were the Hair Pulling Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions scale.

Results

Thirteen subjects completing the 22-week study received single modality treatment of either sertraline or HRT, and 11 received both modalities of treatment. Trichotillomania symptoms in both groups improved, although the dual modality treatment group demonstrated larger gains and were much more likely to reach responder status at final evaluation.

Conclusion

These results suggest that the combination of sertraline and HRT may be more efficacious in the treatment of trichotillomania than either approach alone.

### Trichotillomania [^116SnAqR]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with trichotillomania often first present to dermatologists, as patients may be unaware of or deny hair pulling and seek an etiology for their hair loss. It therefore becomes the job of the dermatologist to correctly diagnose trichotillomania as well as offer treatment options. There appear to be three groups characterized by age of onset: preschool-age children, preadolescents to young adults, and adults. Young children often have a self-limited course of hair pulling. Adults frequently have psychiatric conditions associated with their trichotillomania. Preadolescents to young adults may benefit the most from active intervention, such as increasing awareness of hair pulling behaviors and behavior modification training. The approach of a patient by age of onset is helpful in guiding a dermatologist towards effective treatment options.

### Trichotillomania [^114cP8q2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Trichotillomania is a neglected psychiatric disorder with dermatologic expression that has only recently received research attention. On the basis of clinical data, trichotillomania appears to be far more common than previously believed. Like obsessive-compulsive disorder, the hair-pulling behavior is recognized as senseless and undesirable but is performed in response to several emotions and affects, such as increasing anxiety, or unconscious conflicts with resultant tension relief. The condition may be episodic but is usually chronic and difficult to treat. On the basis of possible medical and psychiatric complications, it is important that the diagnosis is exact and early. We describe the comorbidity and the phenomenology of trichotillomania, paying attention to the possible available treatments. (J Am Acad Dermatol 2002;46:807–21.)

Learning Objective

At the conclusion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with clinical and histologic aspects of trichotillomania and should be able to cope with the risks of medical and psychiatric complications in these patients. Finally, participants will be able to easily interact with psychiatrists, when needed, to identify the most successful treatment.

### Automatic and focused hair pulling in trichotillomania: valid and useful subtypes? [^11712D5D]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Trichotillomania is characterized by the repetitive pulling out of one's own hair resulting in distress and/or functional impairment. Trichotillomania has defied any easy understanding, and as a consequence, has been difficult to treat with currently available options. One common thought is that perhaps there are subtypes of trichotillomania and by understanding those subtypes, we could target treatments more effectively. Many theories of how to assess these subtypes have been suggested and have included gender, age of onset, family history, and comorbidity. Another school of thought focuses on differences in the underlying psychological mechanisms driving the hair pulling. Toward that end, many people report not being fully aware of their pulling (referred to as "automatic" pulling), whereas "focused" pulling generally occurs when the person has awareness of pulling and intends to pull (e.g. remove a kinky hair that feels "not right"). Could style of pulling therefore be useful in better understanding this behavior?

### Group treatment for trichotillomania: cognitive-behavioral therapy versus supportive therapy [^1132ARM8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Trichotillomania is a psychiatric condition characterized by the chronic pulling and plucking of one's own hair. Cognitive-behavioral therapy shows promise as a treatment for trichotillomania and might be preferable to pharmacotherapy. However, there have been no randomized, controlled studies of the efficacy of group cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Method

We evaluated 44 subjects, recruited from April 2009 to May 2010, all of whom met DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of trichotillomania. Subjects were randomized to receive 22 sessions of either group cognitive-behavioral therapy or group supportive therapy (control). Treatment evaluation was non-blind and used self-report scales. The primary outcome measure was the improvement of hair-plucking behavior as assessed by the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale. Secondary measures included scores on the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report.

Results

Both groups showed significant posttreatment improvement in the scores from the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale (F = 23.762, P < .001) and the Beck Depression Inventory (F = 6.579, P = 0.003). The decrease in hair-plucking behavior over time was significantly greater in the study group than in the control group (F = 3.545, P < .038). There were no significant differences between the pretreatment and posttreatment time points or between the groups in the scores from the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report.

Conclusions

We conclude that group cognitive-behavioral therapy is a valid treatment for trichotillomania. This treatment model should be further revised and expanded to address comorbidities such as anxiety and social maladjustment.

### Trichotillomania. presentation, etiology, diagnosis and therapy [^112SNMxL]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Trichotillomania (TTM) is an impulse disorder, in which patients chronically pull hair from the scalp and/or other sites. Very early onset of hair pulling in children under the age of 6 may be more benign and self-limiting than the more common syndrome of late childhood onset hair pulling. While far more women and adolescent girls appear for treatment, survey studies suggest chronic hair pulling also occurs in males. Diagnosis may be complicated by patient and family denial or ignorance of the hair pulling; accurate scalp examination and biopsy can be critical. Classic scalp biopsies for TTM feature trichomalacia, pigment clumps, peribulbar hemorrhage and hair canal pigment casts, and lack lymphocytic infiltrates seen in alopecia areata. Treatment is difficult: the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine is the most promising agent, although many patients find it difficult to tolerate at adequate dosages, and treatment response may not be maintained over the long term. More benign medications have not demonstrated efficacy in controlled studies. Augmentation with topical preparations or psychotropic medications may be helpful for patients experiencing limited efficacy or relapse. Specialized psychotherapy, known as habit reversal training, is highly recommended; however, the treatment is intensive and highly specialized. Skilled therapists are difficult to locate.

### Recent advances in the treatment of trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) [^111urcpU]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Trichotillomania (TTM) is a condition in which affected individuals pull out their hair resulting in hair loss. This disorder affects roughly 0.5% to 2.0% of the population and can have significant psychological morbidity. Behavioral therapy has been used with success in the treatment of TTM, but not all patients are willing or able to comply with this treatment strategy. There is a need for effective pharmacological treatment options. Historically, pharmacotherapy for TTM has been inadequate in most cases, but recent advances have been made in this regard. Fluoxetine, clomipramine, olanzapine, and naltrexone have all been used in the treatment of TTM, but evidence of benefit has varied, and side effect profiles can limit practical utility. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of TTM, as well as evidence of benefit seen with some glutamate-modulating agents such as N-acetylcysteine and dronabinol, have provided newer potential pharmacotherapy options.

### From tugs to treatments: a systematic review on pharmacological interventions for trichotillomania [^114MDS4j]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Trichotillomania (TTM) is a psychiatric disorder with dermatological consequences, characterized by recurrent hair pulling. It affects 1–3% of the population, and often coexists with other psychiatric disorders, leading to emotional distress. Effective management of TTM can be challenging because of underdiagnosis, symptom heterogeneity and stigma. Pharmacological interventions, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) are commonly used.

Objectives

To assess the existing literature on pharmacotherapy for TTM and identify potential avenues for future research and treatment advancements.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was performed using PubMed and Scopus databases within the past 10 years (PROSPERO: CRD42023454009). Included studies assessed pharmacotherapy for TTM and provided insights into current evidence and potential directions for future research and treatment advancements.

Results

In total, 23 articles were identified that met inclusion criteria. The most successful interventions were NAC, aripiprazole and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. NAC was identified as the most impressive adjunctive therapy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and behavioural therapies in treatment through its mechanism of decreased glutamate-induced excitatory neuronal damage, with adjunctive antioxidant properties. Most of the other therapeutics that were identified require further research and controlled trials to validate their findings.

Conclusions

Even if successful therapeutic outcomes are achieved, it is important to consider the patient's comorbidities and to combine pharmacological interventions with behavioural therapy interventions to comprehensively manage TTM.

### Nonpharmacological treatment approach in trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) [^116ZcAjp]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Trichotillomania (TTM) is a fairly common psychodermatological disorder. This is characterized by recurrent urges to pull hair from hair-containing parts of the body and produces bald patches on scalp. Besides scalp, eye lashes, eyebrows, and pubic area may be involved. Clinically two types are recognized, the automatic and focused types. Currently, this is classified into obsessive- and compulsive-related disorder. Most common psychiatric manifestations include anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. It has bimodal distribution in children and adolescents and adults. No recognized treatment is available. Pharmacological treatment is based on limited trials and case reports. Psychotherapies are mainstay of treatment. This review mainly focuses on evidence-based psychotherapeutic techniques used in the treatment of TTM.

### The genetics of trichotillomania and excoriation disorder: a systematic review [^111xo6hK]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Psychotherapeutic interventions such as cognitive-behavioral approaches with habit reversal training show efficacy in reducing TTM and ED symptoms. However, identifying trained providers in evidence-based psychotherapeutic approaches is challenging, and many individuals do not respond or may relapse in the long-term. Currently, there are no FDA-approved medications or pharmacologic agents with robust, clear evidence of efficacy to treat either disorder, highlighting the urgent need to better understand the underlying biological mechanisms to inform the development of effective treatments. Previous work on the pathophysiology of TTM and ED supports the critical role of genetic factors and provides evidence that the same genes may contribute risk to both disorders.

To our knowledge, there are no previous systematic reviews that have focused on the genetics of TTM and ED. Previous reviews have acknowledged the genetic overlap between TTM and ED as being related to OCD but have not discussed separate, disorder-specific genetic findings for TTM or ED. In this systematic review, we summarize previous research on the genetics of these disorders and highlight gaps in the field that warrant further research that may advance our understanding of these common and impairing psychiatric conditions.

### A retrospective review of 12 patients with trichotillomania treated in a psychodermatology service [^111aSbdR]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Trichotillomania is a condition characterized by the pulling of hair from anywhere on the body and is classified as an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. Patients with hair disorders are commonly referred to psychodermatology services, and can represent a management challenge. Few publications exist that report outcomes for patients with trichotillomania in real clinical practice. We report 12 such patients seen within our own psychodermatology service, who were managed using a variety of treatment strategies. The rate of defaulting of appointments was high, but improvements were seen in patients engaging with services.

### The genetics of trichotillomania and excoriation disorder: a systematic review [^115cRqRk]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Background:

Trichotillomania (TTM) and excoriation disorder (ED) are impairing obsessive-compulsive related disorders that are common in the general population and for which there are no clear first-line medications, highlighting the need to better understand the underlying biology of these disorders to inform treatments. Given the importance of genetics in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), evaluating genetic factors underlying TTM and ED may advance knowledge about the pathophysiology of these body-focused repetitive behaviors.

Aim:

In this systematic review, we summarize the available evidence on the genetics of TTM and ED and highlight gaps in the field warranting further research.

Method:

We systematically searched Embase, PsycInfo, PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science for original studies in genetic epidemiology (family or twin studies) and molecular genetics (candidate gene and genome-wide) published up to June 2023.

Results:

Of the 3536 records identified, 109 studies were included in this review. These studies indicated that genetic factors play an important role in the development of TTM and ED, some of which may be shared across the OCD spectrum, but there are no known high-confidence specific genetic risk factors for either TTM or ED.

Conclusions:

Our review underscores the need for additional genome-wide research conducted on the genetics of TTM and ED, for instance, genome-wide association and whole-genome/whole-exome DNA sequencing studies. Recent advances in genomics have led to the discovery of risk genes in several psychiatric disorders, including related conditions such as OCD, but to date, TTM and ED have remained understudied.

### Trichotillomania: a perspective synthesised from neuroscience and lived experience [^116swPtk]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

People with these disorders suffer significant impacts to their quality of life. The Trichotillomania Impact Project surveyed 1697 people who self-reported symptoms consistent with a clinical diagnosis of trichotillomania. They reported high levels of distress (5.1/7) and mild to moderate impacts on quality of life across social, occupational, academic and psychological domains. Despite this, the majority of patients never seek treatment, and the majority of those who do find that their healthcare provider knows little or nothing about the disorder.

A range of behavioural and pharmacological treatments have been trialled, mostly in very low numbers of participants. A 2007 review of all available trials from 1980 to 2006contained a total of 240 participants across 13 trials. More recent reviews of both behaviouraland pharmacologicaltherapies suggest that there is some benefit from habit-reversal based therapy, but that there is little support for any beneficial effects of SSRIs or antipsychotics. Some single placebo controlled RCTs of repurposed agents look more promising. For example, a recent RCT of a glutamate modulator (memantine) in 100 adults with either trichotillomania or skin-picking disorder yielded promising results, with 60.5% of the memantine group reporting much improved symptoms after 8 weeks of treatment, relative to only 8.3% of the placebo group.

Comorbidities are common, particularly with anxiety disorders (55%), depression (43%), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD, 29%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, 29%), post traumatic stress disorder (29%), panic disorder (25%), bipolar disorder (19%) alcohol or drug abuse (18%), and eating disorder (17%). There is also a large degree of comorbidity within the category of BFRBs (eg, 24% with skin-picking disorder). Attempts have been made to factor-analyse the comorbidities, with three clusters emerging: trichotillomania with no comorbidities (21%), + major depression (16%) and 'complex' (63%).

### N-acetylcysteine in the treatment of pediatric trichotillomania: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled add-on trial [^111Kby4P]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for the treatment of pediatric trichotillomania (TTM) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on study.

Method

A total of 39 children and adolescents aged 8 to 17 years with pediatric trichotillomania were randomly assigned to receive NAC or matching placebo for 12 weeks. Our primary outcome was change in severity of hairpulling as measured by the Massachusetts General Hospital-Hairpulling Scale (MGH-HPS). Secondary measures assessed hairpulling severity, automatic versus focused pulling, clinician-rated improvement, and comorbid anxiety and depression. Outcomes were examined using linear mixed models to test the treatment×time interaction in an intention-to-treat population.

Results

No significant difference between N-acetylcysteine and placebo was found on any of the primary or secondary outcome measures. On several measures of hairpulling, subjects significantly improved with time regardless of treatment assignment. In the NAC group, 25% of subjects were judged as treatment responders, compared to 21% in the placebo group.

Conclusions

We observed no benefit of NAC for the treatment of children with trichotillomania. Our findings stand in contrast to a previous, similarly designed trial in adults with TTM, which demonstrated a very large, statistically significant benefit of NAC. Based on the differing results of NAC in pediatric and adult TTM populations, the assumption that pharmacological interventions demonstrated to be effective in adults with TTM will be as effective in children, may be inaccurate. This trial highlights the importance of referring children with TTM to appropriate behavioral therapy before initiating pharmacological interventions, as behavioral therapy has demonstrated efficacy in both children and adults with trichotillomania.

### Trichotillomania: a perspective synthesised from neuroscience and lived experience [^1122csTm]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

A brief review of facts and figures

A comprehensive review of the state of our understanding of trichotillomania is available hereand is updated here. In brief, people who suffer from trichotillomania have irresistible urges to pull out their hair. The sites most commonly affected are the scalp, eyelashes and eyebrows, although any body hair can be targeted, and pulling from multiple sites is common. Triggers vary between individuals, with some describing sensory, emotional and cognitive precursors to the pulling behaviour, but many individuals describe being unaware of either the urge to pull or even the pulling behaviour itself, with some even reporting pulling in their sleep.

Large population surveys do not typically include questions related to disordered hair-pulling, so the only evidence we have for prevalence comes from relatively small samples, often of USA-based university students giving prevalence estimates of between 0.5%–2%. One moderately sized community sample (n = 10 169) estimated a prevalence of 1.7%, which would represent as many as 1.1 million people in the UK. Although samples of treatment/support-seeking individuals have around a 4:1 ratio of women to men, the community surveys suggest that disordered hair-pulling affects men and women equally. Interestingly, hair-pulling disorders appear to be equally prevalent across cultures and do not differentiate according to socioeconomic status or education level.

### Patient advocacy and DSM-5 [^115KpqMn]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Our subworkgroup carefully considered whether the term 'trichotillomania', which was used in DSM-IV, was an optimal name for this condition. We noted the concerns of some patient advocates that 'mania' could be perceived as pejorative and inaccurate. At the same time, we noted the concerns of other patient advocates that the alternative term 'hair pulling disorder', because of its somewhat colloquial nature, could possibly detract from the disorder's medical significance. Our subworkgroup also took into account the view that a change in name could lead to confusion in the scientific literature. Our subworkgroup, therefore, recommended a compromise name: 'trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder)'. A similar set of considerations led to the choice of the term 'excoriation (skin picking) disorder'. Our subworkgroup considered the scientific literature on diagnostic criteria for the various entities in the chapter on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. We noted, for example, that the criteria for trichotillomania were based on the notion that this was an impulse control disorder, and that a sizeable minority of patients with distressing/impairing and chronic hair-pulling did not demonstrate all of the DSM-IV criteria. Comments on the website strongly agreed with our subworkgroup's recommendation to change the problematic criteria; this change was also supported by a study sponsored by the subworkgroup that tested alternative criteria.

In summary, feedback from patients and patient advocates played a useful role in influencing some of our subworkgroup recommendations for the DSM-5 section on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. This feedback complemented and, in some cases, reinforced the value of recommendations that were based on the scientific literature. Perhaps the most helpful impact of this feedback was support from many individuals who suffered from excoriation (skin picking) disorder to add this condition to DSM-5; this input usefully supported the view that the available scientific data were sufficient to add this disorder to DSM-5. This feedback was also helpful in assisting our subworkgroup with making recommendations for which no scientific data were available on which to base a recommendation (such as the best name for trichotillomania).

### Trichotillomania: a perspective synthesised from neuroscience and lived experience [^1157powb]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

Third, many studies (as well as lived-experience accounts) of trichotillomania refer to the intense shame and isolation experienced by those who suffer, and the lengths to which individuals go to hide their disorder. Despite being commonly reported, little attention has been given to the extent to which shame could be both a consequence and a maintainer of the disordered behaviour. One study described one of the drivers of self-grooming behaviour in macaques as 'social uncertainty', and the behaviour itself is described as 'displacement activity'. This might align with the lived experience of those who often associate the onset of the disorder with a socially/emotionally stressful life event and describe the sensation of pulling/picking/biting as soothing. The majority of psychological therapies that have been trialled in these disorders focus on the behaviour itself (eg, habit-reversal therapy), and although the short-term outcomes show some efficacy, long-term relapse is common. Therapies that specifically target shamemight increase the efficacy of behavioural interventions.

### Treating trichotillomania: a meta-analysis of treatment effects and moderators for behavior therapy and serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^114EwK6t]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2014). Low credibility.

Few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exist examining the efficacy of behavior therapy (BT) or serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) for the treatment of trichotillomania (TTM), with no examination of treatment moderators. The present meta-analysis synthesized the treatment effect sizes (ES) of BT and SRI relative to comparison conditions, and examined moderators of treatment. A comprehensive literature search identified 11 RCTs that met inclusion criteria. Clinical characteristics (e.g., age, comorbidity, therapeutic contact hours), outcome measures, treatment subtypes (e.g. SRI subtype, BT subtype), and ES data were extracted. The standardized mean difference of change in hair pulling severity was the outcome measure. A random effects meta-analysis found a large pooled ES for BT (ES = 1.41, p < 0.001). BT trials with greater therapeutic contact hours exhibited larger ES (p = 0.009). Additionally, BT trials that used mood enhanced therapeutic techniques exhibited greater ES relative to trials including only traditional BT components (p = 0.004). For SRI trials, a random effects meta-analysis identified a moderate pooled ES (ES = 0.41, p = 0.02). Although clomipramine exhibited larger ES relative to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the difference was not statistically significant. Publication bias was not identified for either treatment. BT yields large treatment effects for TTM, with further examination needed to disentangle confounded treatment moderators. SRI trials exhibited a moderate pooled ES, with no treatment moderators identified. Sensitivity analyses highlighted the need for further RCTs of SRIs, especially among youth with TTM.

### Behavioral treatment of trichotillomania and trichophagia in a 29-month-old girl [^113WBgP5]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Early childhood trichotillomania (TTM) has often been considered to be benign. However, untreated early childhood TTM can have significant negative physical and psychological consequences. This report describes the behavioral treatment of a 29-month-old girl with TTM. Treatment consisted of 14 daily sessions of behavioral intervention, followed by 3 consecutive days of follow-up treatment conducted 7 weeks after the end of initial treatment. The hair pulling was addressed by using reinforcers for not pulling, provided at intervals of increasing length. At the end of initial treatment, the hair pulling improved significantly. At follow-up, although some of the initial treatment gains were reduced, the patient maintained significant improvement compared with baseline.

### Trichotillomania: a perspective synthesised from neuroscience and lived experience [^115GyVbP]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

Trichotillomania (trich) is a hair-pulling disorder, and is one of a family of disorders called body-focused repetitive behaviours (BFRBs), which also include disordered skin-picking (dermotillomania) and nail-biting (onychophagia). They are currently categorised as a subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorders in DSM V, having previously been categorised as impulse control disorders. These disorders are under-recognised, under-researched and underestimated in terms of their scale and impact. Here I will briefly review the background, draw attention to some key aspects of the pathology, and propose an immune- and shame-based pathological grooming model, including potential new therapeutic targets.

### Behavior therapy for pediatric trichotillomania: a randomized controlled trial [^116f2oMv]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the efficacy and durability of a behavioral therapy (BT) protocol for pediatric TTM compared with a minimal attention control (MAC) condition. It was hypothesized that the BT condition would be superior to MAC at the end of acute treatment, and would also demonstrate durability of gains through the maintenance treatment phase.

Method

A randomized controlled trial in which 24 youths were assigned to either a pilot-tested BT protocol, consisting of eight weekly sessions, or to MAC, consisting of three sessions and five telephone calls over 8 weeks. Independent evaluators assessed outcome at pretreatment (week 0) and post-treatment (week 8) for BT and MAC, and again at week 16 for BT patients only. The primary outcome measure was the National Institute of Mental Health Trichotillomania Severity Scale (NIMH-TSS).

Results

For the BT condition, the week 8 mean NIMH-TSS score was significantly lower than that of the MAC condition. The BT condition's mean week 8 score was also significantly lower than their own mean week 0 score, whereas no such reductions were observed for the MAC condition. Upon completion of acute treatment at week 8, the BT group's gains were maintained through an 8-week maintenance treatment phase.

Conclusions

BT produced a superior outcome compared with a condition that controlled for participation in a pediatric TTM research study, nonspecific therapist contact effects, repeated assessments, and the passage of time. Maintenance of gains after acute BT provides preliminary support for the durability of treatment gains.

### An open-label, flexible-dose study of olanzapine in the treatment of trichotillomania [^113s6nwj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Thus far, only selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been systematically studied in the treatment of trichotillomania, and the results are conflicting. This open-label study is the first to systematically evaluate an atypical neuroleptic, olanzapine, as a monotherapy in the treatment of trichotillomania.

Method

Twenty-one patients were screened and 18 patients were enrolled in a 3-month open-label study of olanzapine for trichotillomania (diagnosis based on modified DSM-IV criteria). Patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders or on treatment with psychoactive medication were excluded. Olanzapine was titrated gradually in 2.5-mg/week increments up to a maximum dose of 10 mg/day.

Results

Seventeen patients who completed at least 1 week of olanzapine treatment were evaluated. Hair pulling, as measured by the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale, decreased by 66% from baseline (p ≤ .001), and mean scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety decreased by 63% (p ≤ .05). Clinical Global Impressions scale scores also revealed significant improvement as a whole (p ≤ .001), with 4 patients having complete symptom remission at the end of the study period.

Conclusion

Findings suggest that olanzapine may be an effective monotherapy for trichotillomania.

### Double-blind placebo-controlled study of memantine in trichotillomania and skin-picking disorder [^116p3miU]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Trichotillomania and skin-picking disorder are underrecognized and often disabling conditions in which individuals repeatedly pull at their hair or pick at their skin, leading to noticeable hair loss or tissue damage. To date there is a severe paucity of evidence-based treatments for these conditions. In this study, the authors sought to determine whether memantine, a glutamate modulator, is more effective than placebo in reducing hair-pulling and skin-picking behavior.

Methods

One hundred adults with trichotillomania or skin-picking disorder (86 women; mean age, 31.4 years [SD = 10.2]) were enrolled in a double-blind trial of memantine (dosing range, 10–20 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. Participants were assessed with measures of pulling and picking severity. Outcomes were examined using a linear mixed-effects model. The prespecified primary outcome measure was treatment-related change on the NIMH Trichotillomania Symptom Severity Scale, modified to include skin picking.

Results

Compared with placebo, memantine treatment was associated with significant improvements in scores on the NIMH scale, Sheehan Disability Scale, and Clinical Global Impressions severity scale in terms of treatment-by-time interactions. At study endpoint, 60.5% of participants in the memantine group were "much or very much improved", compared with 8.3% in the placebo group (number needed to treat = 1.9). Adverse events did not differ significantly between the treatment arms.

Conclusions

This study found that memantine treatment resulted in statistically significant reductions in hair pulling and skin-picking symptoms compared with placebo, with relatively high efficacy (based on number needed to treat), and was well tolerated. The glutamate system may prove to be a beneficial target in the treatment of compulsive behaviors.

### Defining treatment response in trichotillomania: a signal detection analysis [^1128mdeZ]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

The Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale (MGH-HPS) and the NIMH Trichotillomania Severity Scale (NIMH-TSS) are two widely used measures of trichotillomania severity. Despite their popular use, currently no empirically-supported guidelines exist to determine the degrees of change on these scales that best indicate treatment response. Determination of such criteria could aid in clinical decision-making by defining clinically significant treatment response/recovery and producing accurate power analyses for use in clinical trials research. Adults with trichotillomania (N = 69) participated in a randomized controlled trial of psychotherapy and were assessed before and after treatment. Response status was measured via the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale, and remission status was measured via the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Scale. For treatment response, a 45% reduction or 7-point raw score change on the MGH-HPS was the best indicator of clinically significant treatment response, and on the NIMH-TSS, a 30–40% reduction or 6-point raw score difference was most effective cutoff. For disorder remission, a 55–60% reduction or 7-point raw score change on the MGH-HPS was the best predictor, and on the NIMH-TSS, a 65% reduction or 6-point raw score change was the best indicator of disorder remission. Implications of these findings are discussed.

### Assessment and treatment of trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin picking) disorder [^115ANws2]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations are provided for the assessment and treatment of trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder, or HPD) and excoriation disorder (skin picking disorder, or SPD), two body-focused repetitive behavior (BFRB) disorders, based on their severity, comorbidities, and behavioral style. Habit reversal training (HRT) and stimulus control are first-line behavioral treatments that can be used in cases of all severity levels and may be particularly helpful when pulling or picking is performed with lowered awareness/intention. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) are behavioral treatments that can be employed to augment HRT/stimulus control, especially when negative emotions trigger the pulling or picking. There are currently no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for HPD or SPD, though certain medications/supplements have shown varying degrees of efficacy in trials. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) should be considered for all severity levels and styles given its moderate gain/low side effect profile. Other pharmacologic interventions, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), should be considered in cases with significant comorbidities or previous behavioral/NAC treatment failure.

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy for childhood repetitive behavior disorders: tic disorders and trichotillomania [^1117F1PQ]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

This article provides an overview of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for repetitive behavior disorders. Because tic disorders and trichotillomania are the most often studied and most debilitating of these conditions, this article focuses on the efficacy of CBT for these 2 conditions. An overview of CBT for children presenting with these concerns is provided. This review focuses particularly on habit reversal training, which is at the core of most CBT-based interventions. Two recent empirical studies on the immense potential of CBT in treating childhood repetitive behavior disorders and future areas of research are also discussed.

### Microneedling as an adjunctive treatment for trichotillomania [^114XNWFZ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, microneedling is a novel treatment option for patients with trichotillomania. While the present case series offers promising initial data, further controlled trials with monotherapy of miconeedling using dermarollers are warranted.

### Automatic and focused hair pulling in trichotillomania: valid and useful subtypes? [^1131L8qa]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Potential advantages of this study involve the use of a data-driven clustering methodology, and the relatively large sample size; however, the study has some notable limitations. First, these results are based on secondary analysis of archival data originally collected for other purposes. Second, treatment response was not available and so we cannot evaluate the relationship between automatic and focused pulling and treatment response. Third, we considered automatic and focused pulling scores from the MIST-A, since our studies collected these total scores in particular. Future work could examine other operationalisations of the full MIST such as more recent analysis suggesting Intention and Emotion subscores. Fourth, there are of course other methods that could be used to identify potential subtypes; but our approach has the advantage of being relatively scientifically neutral as it was data-driven.

There is no current evidence that the four proposed types of automatic and focused pulling have distinct neurobiological underpinnings either and thus we are left with multiple and somewhat conflicting reports as to the relevance importance of pulling style in maintaining the behavior. We propose that studies into trichotillomania need to revisit whether subtypes based on focused vs automatic hair pulling have statistical validity and clinical utility. To properly define reproducible subtypes, it is likely going to be necessary to capture a comprehensive range of measurement domains at large sample size. Some initial work has been conducted in efforts to address this. However, clarification of subtypes is likely to require longitudinal data collection since subtypes may only be apparent over time. It would also be interesting to explore subtypes in terms of response to different treatment modalities for trichotillomania.

### Microneedling as an adjunctive treatment for trichotillomania [^115HturY]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Trichotillomania is a psychocutaneous disorder characterized by the compulsive pulling of one's hair from the scalp, eyebrows, or other regions of the body. The lifetime prevalence of trichotillomania is estimated to be 2% with a mean age of onset in late adolescence. Trichotillomania is currently classified in the Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders category of the Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.

Microneedling is a dermatological procedure involving the intentional creation of percutaneous wounds with medical‐grade needles to stimulate the release of factors involved in wound‐healing and angiogenesis. Typically, this is achieved using a dermaroller, a handheld tool covered by small, fixed needles. In patients with trichotillomania, microneedling may be particularly effective as it not only stimulates hair growth but also reproduces the sensation of hair pulling. In mimicking such a sensation, patients with trichotillomania may relieve urges without performing the undesired behavior and prevent further impulsive acts of hair pulling. Here, we report three cases of trichotillomania treated with microneedling using a dermaroller.

Informed consent was obtained for all patients. In the first case, a 33‐year‐old female with trichotillomania since adolescence presented with parietal and temporal patches of hair loss (Figure 1A, B). In the second case, a 30‐year‐old female with trichotillomania since age 13 years presented with hair loss localized to the scalp vertex (Figure 1C, D). Symptoms had worsened over the past 2 years despite treatment with daily antidepressant and behavioral therapy. Finally, a 15‐year‐old female with trichotillomania presented with 4 months of hair pulling from the left frontal and parietal regions of the scalp (Figure 1E, F). In all patients, pull‐test was negative and trichoscopic examination revealed decreased hair density, marked morphologic variability, and many short hairs of differing lengths. Trichoptilosis, flame hairs, and occasional yellow dots were also present.

### DBT-enhanced habit reversal treatment for trichotillomania: 3-and 6-month follow-up results [^112xnjuH]. Depression and Anxiety (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Maintenance of gains with cognitive-behavioral treatment for trichotillomania (TTM) has historically been problematic.

Methods

We conducted follow-up assessments 3 and 6 months after completion of a 3-month maintenance phase on 10 individuals with DSM-IV-TR TTM who participated in an open trial of a dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)-enhanced habit reversal treatment (HRT).

Results

Significant improvement from baseline was reported at 3-and 6-month follow-up on all measures of hair pulling severity and emotion regulation, although some worsening was reported on some measures from earlier study time points. At 6-month follow-up, five and four participants were full and partial responders, respectively. Significant correlations were reported at both follow-up time points between changes in hair pulling severity and emotion regulation capacity.

Conclusions

DBT-enhanced HRT offers promise for improved long-term treatment results in TTM. Changes in TTM severity from baseline to 3-and 6-month follow-up is correlated with changes in emotion regulation capacity.

### Trichotillomania: a perspective synthesised from neuroscience and lived experience [^111ZqDpR]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

Focusing on some salient points

Three important aspects of our understanding of trichotillomania are the basis of this perspective:

First, the high incidence of comorbidities associated with trichotillomania are likely contributors to the high rate of both underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis. We are lacking any large-scale epidemiological data in the UK, and there is little more than anecdotal information available about referral/treatment pathways or outcomes. In at least two US-based independent samples, there is a consistent minority of 21% of individuals who meet diagnostic criteria for trichotillomania but no other condition. A greater understanding of trichotillomania and other BFRBs, and how they relate to other disorders (eg, anxiety, ADHD, mood disorders, OCD, self-harm, etc), is required.

Second, the symptoms of BFRBs (hair-pulling, skin-picking and nail-biting) might be considered as disordered extremes of normal primate grooming behaviour. Importantly, the phenomenology of these disordered behaviours is often described as subconscious, like scratching an itch. Pulling/picking/biting are all examples of self-grooming, which can be observed in many animal species, not least in non-human primates, where they contribute to the creation and maintenance of social bonds. Indeed a number of species have been noted to pull out their own hair when in captivity, and there is a mouse model of OCD which exhibits excessive self-grooming. In a study of self-directed behaviour in macaque monkeys, three potential drivers were described: ectoparasite defence (immune), environmental and social, and there have been suggestions of inflammatory biomarker differences in people with BFRBs. It is likely that there are genetically determined individual differences in sensitivity threshold, which might explain the high heritability of BFRBs. Multiple brain systems are involved in the initiation, modulation and maintenance of self-directed behaviours. These might form the basis of some cognitive and neural differences that have been observed in people with trichotillomania.

### Tourette's syndrome, trichotillomania, and obsessive-compulsive disorder: how closely are they related? [^117GPkdd]. Psychiatry Research (2009). Low credibility.

The question of whether Tourette's syndrome (TS) and trichotillomania (TTM) are best conceptualized as obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders was raised by family studies demonstrating a close relationship between TS and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and by psychopharmacological research indicating that both TTM and OCD respond more robustly to clomipramine than to desipramine. A range of studies have subsequently allowed comparison of the phenomenology, psychobiology, and management of TS and TTM, with that of OCD. Here we briefly review this literature. The data indicate that there is significant psychobiological overlap between TS and OCD, supporting the idea that TS can be conceptualized as an OCD spectrum disorder. TTM and OCD have only partial overlap in their phenomenology and psychobiology, but there are a number of reasons for why it may be useful to classify TTM and other habit disorders as part of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum of disorders.

### Pilot trial of dialectical behavior therapy-enhanced habit reversal for trichotillomania [^1174YyH3]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Not all hair pullers improve acutely with cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) and few maintain their gains over time.

Methods

We conducted an open clinical trial of a new treatment that addresses affectively triggered pulling and emphasizes relapse prevention in addition to standard CBT approaches. Ten female participants satisfying DSM-IV criteria for trichotillomania (TTM) at two study sites received Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)-enhanced CBT consisting of 11 weekly sessions and 4 maintenance sessions over the following 3 months. Independent assessors rated hair pulling impairment and global improvement at several study time points. Participants completed self-report measures of hair pulling severity and emotion regulation.

Results

Significant improvement in hair pulling severity and emotion regulation, as well as hair pulling impairment and anxiety and depressive symptoms, occurred during acute treatment and were maintained during the subsequent 3 months. Significant correlations were reported between changes in emotion regulation and hair pulling severity during both the acute treatment and maintenance phases.

Conclusions

This study offers preliminary evidence for the efficacy of DBT-enhanced CBT for TTM and suggests the importance of addressing emotion regulation during TTM treatment.

### Reversal of trichotillomania with aripiprazole [^115UVLNY]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

Trichotillomania (TTM) is a common psychiatric illness with marked chronicity and comorbidity that significantly impacts on psychosocial functioning and physical features of the sufferer. Treatment studies, to date, using behavioral and pharmacological interventions alone or simultaneously, are equivocal with few showing a sustained cessation of hair-plucking. In this report of a single patient with treatment resistant TTM, the sole use of the atypical neuroleptic Aripiprazole resulted in a cessation of hair-plucking maintained, at the time of reporting, for a period of 24 months. This finding, a first with Aripiprazole, warrants further investigation of this drug in the treatment of TTM.

### Chronic hair-pulling: phenomenology-based subtypes [^116VrJna]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Distinct subtypes of trichotillomania (TTM)/chronic hair-pulling may exist. The aim of this study was to extend an earlier analysis by our group to a larger sample of patients with chronic hair-pulling, and to assess the validity and clinical utility of several putative subtypes. Eighty patients with various putative hair-pulling subtypes were compared on sociodemographic and clinical variables. Gender and disability due to pulling accounted for a number of important differences; for example, females more commonly had earlier age of onset of pulling, less comorbidity, and more disability than males. Also, those who met DSM-IV criteria B and C of TTM appeared to have a more disabling course of illness than those who did not. These data appear to support a dimensional rather than a categorical approach to subtyping. Future work, incorporating further investigation of the role of gender and psychobiological and treatment outcomes, is needed before definitive conclusions about hair-pulling subtypes can be drawn.

### Automatic and focused hair pulling in trichotillomania: valid and useful subtypes? [^113HCnfq]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This study found that the style of hair pulling (i.e. automatic and focused) had some associations with clinical variables, but that trichotillomania did not form coherent subtypes based on these variables when k-means clustering was used. In fact, high scores of both automatic and focused pulling was associated with more severe symptoms of trichotillomania. This is only somewhat consistent with the Flessner and colleagues study that reported high scores on either automatic or focused pulling were associated with more severe symptoms. The current study also found that a different style of hair pulling (high focused and low automatic pulling) was associated with worse quality of life, more anxiety, and more depression (although depression was also associated with low focused and low automatic pulling). These findings suggest that different styles may have variable associations with different aspects of trichotillomania.

If both high focused and high automatic pulling are associated with greater symptom severity, then these findings may highlight why many people do not respond to most available psychotherapy treatments. There is some indication that habit reversal therapy (which has been incorporated to some degree in most therapies for trichotillomania) works best for focused pulling, but pulling may be driven by both high focused and high automatic styles, not just one. Therefore, one could imagine that a therapy to ameliorate the automatic behavior, combined with habit reversal therapy for the focused style, would be optimal to reduce symptom severity. Alternatively, perhaps strengthening/extending the 'awareness training' component of habit reversal therapy could aid its ability to target automatic pulling in conjunction with focused pulling.

The other finding from this study is that the idea of automatic and focused pulling may not be particularly helpful in subtyping trichotillomania. We found that the k-means clustering modelling did not converge on an optimal solution, despite the large sample size in this study, indicating that while automatic and focused hair pulling may have some clinical relevance, there were not any coherent subtypes of the disorder based on these variables. This would be in keeping with the notion that automatic and focused pulling commonly co-occur in the same individual. When we force fitted four subtypes, the findings were not coherent. Collectively, this may be unsurprising as both focused and automatic pulling may characterize the same pulling episode, or certainly the same person across episodes; and therefore not be useful for subtyping.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: part I [^111a8SXH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder and related conditions

Insufficient evidence base

It is a common pitfall to think that the evidence base accurately covers the full range of obsessive and compulsive conditions. This is not the case. For instance, to date, there is no published evidence supporting the role of low-dose antipsychotic augmentation in body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) nor is any clear evidence that SSRI medications are helpful in the treatment of trichotillomania. It is important therefore to be clear about the dominant aspect of the mental state in the child and make decisions on the evidence base, where it exists and, in turn, being clear where there is a lack of evidence or indeed evidence that medication is not likely to be of benefit.

Co-morbidity in obsessive-compulsive disorders

The issue of co-morbidity in the presentation requires careful thought. A common pitfall in treatment planning is not comprehensively assessing the full clinical presentation and then missing opportunities to design the best treatment plan. Co-morbid mood (more than 60%) and anxiety (more than 75%) diagnoses are extremely common in young people with obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD). These co-morbidities may require careful additional consideration, as they will undoubtedly influence the choice and sequencing of pharmacological interventions for OCD. As an example, whilst trichotillomania is unlikely to respond to treatment with SSRI medication, the presence of a co-morbid affective disorder might increase the likelihood of a better medication response, in a young person with trichotillomania.

The broader neurodevelopmental profile can help guide the best choice of medications, as well as their sequencing. For instance, a common pitfall can be to attempt to treat OCD with psychological therapy in a patient with co-morbid ADHD, without adequately addressing the impact of ADHD. This can render treatment much less effective in our experience. We therefore find that ensuring ADHD symptoms are adequately treated pharmacologically can be a helpful precursor to better treatment outcomes of OCD. Some young people, however, can become more focussed on their compulsions when treated for ADHD.

### The genetics of trichotillomania and excoriation disorder: a systematic review [^1125V7Zm]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Trichotillomania (TTM) and excoriation disorder (ED) are debilitating psychiatric conditions classified as obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5). In this edition, TTM was reclassified from an impulse control disorder to an OCRD, and ED was added as a diagnosis due to its phenomenological and biological similarities to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). TTM and ED are often further grouped together as body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs) due to their shared symptomology and presentation. TTM is characterized by repetitive pulling out of one's hair from the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, or other hair-bearing parts of the body, leading to hair loss. ED is characterized by repetitive manipulation of the skin that causes tissue damage, often leading to sores and scabs. Both disorders occur despite efforts to stop and cause significant distress and impairment for the afflicted individual.

### Trichotillomania, stereotypic movement disorder, and related disorders [^114n8FgN]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Trichotillomania is currently classified as an impulse control disorder not otherwise classified, whereas body-focused behaviors other than hair-pulling may be diagnosed as stereotypic movement disorder. A number of disorders characterized by repetitive, body-focused behaviors (eg, skin-picking) are prevalent and disabling and may have phenomenological and psychobiological overlap. Such disorders deserve greater recognition in the official nosology, and there would seem to be clinical utility in classifying them in the same diagnostic category.

### Microneedling as an adjunctive treatment for trichotillomania [^1126krKS]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Clinical and trichoscopic findings before and after treatment with microneedling. (A, B) Case 1 patient before treatment; (C, D) Case 2 patient before treatment; (E, F) Case 3 patient before treatment; (G, H) Case 1 patient after treatment; (I, J) Case 2 patient after treatment; (K, L) Case 3 patient after treatment

A dermaroller with 0.5 mm needles was provided to each patient, which they were instructed to use on their scalp whenever they experienced an urge to hair‐pull. Daily topical 5% minoxidil foam was also prescribed to stimulate local hair regrowth. On evaluation at six or 12 months, all patients reported good adherence to dermaroller use and demonstrated significant clinical improvement of affected scalp regions, which was confirmed with trichoscopy (Figure 1G–L).

Trichotillomania can have a significant negative impact on quality of life in affected patients. Symptoms can be challenging to manage despite treatment, and often require a multi‐modal therapeutic approach. The present case series highlights the feasibility, safety, and potential efficacy of microneedling using a dermaroller for both the behavioral and dermatological treatment of trichotillomania.

The action of microneedling for trichotillomania is twofold: (1) Cutaneous micro‐injuries stimulate hair regrowth on the scalp; (2) The sensation of needles in the scalp mimics the sensation of hair‐pulling, thereby satisfying the patient's behavioral urge. Microneedling in this context acts as a competing response to the hair pulling impulse. Such competing responses are a major component of habit reversal training, a therapeutic approach commonly used in patients with trichotillomania. The use of microneedling for trichotillomania is also similar to some harm minimization strategies employed for patients performing self‐harm. These strategies may involve the use of sensation proxies, or behaviors that provide a safer, less damaging version of a desired physical sensation. In patients who self‐harm, this may include snapping an elastic band against the skin or squeezing an ice cube. Microneedling similarly may act as a sensation proxy in patients with urges to hair pull.

### Suicidal ideation and attempts in trichotillomania [^1113z5B9]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Trichotillomania is characterized by the failure to resist impulses to pull out one's hair often resulting in noticeable hair loss. Trichotillomania is classified as an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Version 5 (DSM-5). The condition is frequently associated with poor self-esteem, depression, psychosocial dysfunction, and overall lower quality of life. More specifically, approximately 45% of people with trichotillomania struggle with comorbid major depressive disorder. Given the negative consequences associated with trichotillomania, and the elevated rates of co-occurring major depressive disorder, we would expect that rates of suicidal ideation may also be elevated in this population, and yet we have found no data on rates of suicidal ideation or suicide attempts among people with trichotillomania.

To address this unmet need, the present study assessed suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a large sample of adults with trichotillomania using a secondary analysis of pooled research studies. We hypothesized that both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts would be elevated in individuals with trichotillomania compared to normative data from the US general population.

### Amelioration of trichotillomania with onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine [^111f8ojv]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

We report a case of a woman in her 30s who struggled with a life-long history of trichotillomania (TTM; hair-pulling disorder), which was unsuccessfully treated with behavioural therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In addition to TTM, our patient had a history of chronic migraine which brought her to our clinic, and treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA (OBTA) was initiated per the Phase III REsearch Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy protocol. After experiencing improvement with migraine symptoms, she began off-label treatment with OBTA for her TTM with 45 units being injected, 5 units per site, in diffuse regions of her scalp, primarily on the affected areas of TTM-induced alopecia. The patient reported marked improvement in her TTM signs and symptoms, which resulted in hair regrowth as early as the first follow-up visit 12 weeks post-treatment initiation. Treatment effects were maintained, and additional hair regrowth was observed at the 1-year post-treatment visit, which equated to four cycles of treatment.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^112rK2nG]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) psychiatric assessment — evaluation will usually include the elements of the adult general psychiatric evaluation and the psychiatrist should be alert for co-occurring conditions, giving particular attention to mood disorders, since depressive and bipolar disorders are more common in OCD; careful exploration for family history for bipolar disorder is also important in view of the risk of precipitating hypomania or mania with anti-OCD medications. Other anxiety disorders (panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia) are common and may complicate treatment planning. Tics are common; OCD has been diagnosed in 28%–62% of individuals with Tourette's disorder, and in such co-occurring cases a rating scale such as the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) may be helpful. Eating disorders may be more common in OCD, and the prevalence of OCD appears elevated in patients with either anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Evaluation should also include screening for alcohol or substance abuse or dependence; some but not all studies note an increased risk of alcohol abuse and dependence, and the presence of a substance disorder will influence treatment planning. Other disorders with elevated prevalence in OCD include certain impulse-control disorders, such as skin picking and trichotillomania.

### Significance of family history in understanding and subtyping trichotillomania [^11276ihY]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The existence of subtypes of trichotillomania (TTM) have long been hypothesized, and recent studies have further elucidated characteristic subtypes of TTM and possible ramifications of subtyping for treatment. In clinical applications of subtyping for treatment of TTM, family history (FH) of psychiatric disorders in patients may serve as a tool to differentiate disorder presentations and inform care. We compared prevalence of psychiatric illnesses in first-degree relatives of participants with TTM and healthy controls, respectively, in a large sample, and examined associations between those psychiatric disorders that were significantly different in the FH between groups and measures of disability, severity, and neuropsychological constructs.

Methods

We compared FHs of 152 participants (mean age = 29.9) with TTM and 71 healthy controls (mean age = 29.6), utilizing chi-squared tests to determine which psychiatric illnesses were more prevalent in FHs of participants with TTM. We then used two-tailed t-tests to compare TTM participants with those more prevalent FHs to participants without those FHs on measures of disorder severity, disability, and neuropsychological constructs.

Findings

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), TTM, skin picking disorder (SPD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) were significantly more frequent in first-degree relatives (p < 0.0033) of TTM participants than those of healthy controls. TTM participants with a FH of OCD scored significantly higher on measures of impulsivity and lower on measures of distress tolerance. Those with FH of TTM, SPD, and MDD did not differ significantly across measured variables.

Conclusion

OCD, TTM, SPD, and MDD are more prevalent in the FHs of people with TTM, as compared to healthy controls. TTM participants with a family history of OCD may be more likely to demonstrate decreased distress tolerance and increased impulsivity. In all, as understanding of TTM subtypes develops, the FH may prove a useful tool in delineating subtypes and informing care.

### The genetics of trichotillomania and excoriation disorder: a systematic review [^111yWWN2]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

This study is reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). A protocol was not pre-registered. One independent reviewer conducted all review stages (MR) and consulted regularly with senior researcher (EO) to discuss progress.

We searched select electronic databases (Embase, PsycInfo, PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science) up to June 2023 (summary of records identified in Table S1). The search strategies employed were tailored to each database and details of the search terms are provided in the supplement (Table S2). We restricted eligibility to studies in English. Titles and abstracts were initially screened followed by the full text to assess eligibility. Articles were considered for inclusion if they provided data on the genetics of TTM, ED, and/or more generally obsessive-compulsive related disorders. No restrictions regarding the definition or assessment of TTM, ED, and obsessive-compulsive-related disorders were made. Articles were excluded if they did not present genetic findings in either human or animal studies. Fig. 1 shows the PRISMA flowchart of article selection. After the final screening, 109 studies were included in this systematic review.

### Patient advocacy and DSM-5 [^111txLsz]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Our subworkgroup reviewed the literature on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and concluded that there was sufficient scientific evidence to support the utility and validity of this construct, which has been widely adopted by the field for more than a decade. At the same time, our review of the literature on anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder suggested that there was considerable overlap between these sets of conditions. The final recommendation of our subworkgroup was that anxiety disorders and the new chapter of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders should be placed next to each other in the nomenclature in order to emphasize the close relationship between some of the disorders in these two chapters - for example, between body dysmorphic disorder and social anxiety disorder (social phobia).

There was considerable feedback from the public, via the internet postings, on this question. Patient advocates for Tourette's Disorder were concerned about the possibility that Tourette's Disorder would be classified in the anxiety disorders' chapter or the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders' chapter. They argued that it was important that Tourettte's Disorder be seen as a neurodevelopmental condition, and that it, therefore, fit best into the new chapter of neurodevelopmental disorders. Patient advocates for trichotillomania and skin picking disorder were concerned that if these disorders were classified alongside obsessive-compulsive disorder, patients might receive inappropriate treatment.

### Trichotillomania and co-occurring anxiety [^115hGz3K]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Trichotillomania appears to be a fairly common disorder, with high rates of co-occurring anxiety disorders. Many individuals with trichotillomania also report that pulling worsens during periods of increased anxiety. Even with these clinical links to anxiety, little research has explored whether trichotillomania with co-occurring anxiety is a meaningful subtype.

Methods

One hundred sixty-five adults with trichotillomania were examined on a variety of clinical measures including symptom severity, functioning, and comorbidity. Participants also underwent cognitive testing assessing motor inhibition and cognitive flexibility. Clinical features and cognitive functioning were compared between those with current co-occurring anxiety disorders (i.e. social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and anxiety disorder NOS) (n = 38) and those with no anxiety disorder (n = 127).

Results

Participants with trichotillomania and co-occurring anxiety reported significantly worse hair pulling symptoms, were more likely to have co-occurring depression, and were more likely to have a first-degree relative with obsessive compulsive disorder. Those with anxiety disorders also exhibited significantly worse motor inhibitory performance on a task of motor inhibition (stop-signal task).

Conclusions

This study suggests that anxiety disorders affect the clinical presentation of hair pulling behavior. Further research is needed to validate our findings and to consider whether treatments should be specially tailored differently for adults with trichotillomania who have co-occurring anxiety disorders, or more pronounced cognitive impairment.

### Sleep-isolated trichotillomania: a survey of dermatologists [^111yTeHD]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To determine whether sleep-isolated trichotillomania has been recognized or suspected by dermatologists.

Methods

Eight-hundred and seven practicing dermatologists in the Midwest were identified through the American Academy of Dermatologists website database. A 10-question multiple-choice survey regarding trichotillomania was mailed to each. Responses were anonymously returned by fax.

Results

A total of 107 (13%) of the 807 dermatologists surveyed responded. Twelve (11%) reported having seen patients with trichotillomania that occurred solely during sleep. In cases of unexplained hair loss, 21(20%) suspected hair-pulling occurred only in sleep. Seventy-six subjects (71%) said they had seen patients with unexplained hair loss; 67 (88%) of those respondents said they would ask those patients if they pull their hair. Only 16 (24%) said they would ask patients who deny hair pulling while awake if they pull their hair during sleep. Twenty (19%) said they ask patients diagnosed with trichotillomania if hair pulling also occurs in sleep.

Conclusions

Although sleep-isolated trichotillomania has only recently been reported, some dermatologists report having recognized this entity in their own practices. When dermatologists see patients with unexplained hair loss, only a small percentage consider trichotillomania isolated to sleep. Increased physician awareness of this disorder may allow diagnosis and treatment of many patients.

### DSM-5: a collection of psychiatrist views on the changes, controversies, and future directions [^115fQkxF]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Definitions of psychiatric disorder continue to be debated, and it is surely important not to medicalize problems of daily living. However, those who meet diagnostic criteria for these conditions experience distress or impairment, and deserve appropriate intervention. The category of other specified OCRD brings attention to those individuals, who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for a DSM-5 mental disorder, but who nevertheless experience clinical distress or impairment; this category includes individuals with olfactory reference syndrome, obsessional jealousy, and body-focused repetitive behavioral disorders other than trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder.

The name 'trichotillomania' has been felt by some consumer advocates to be inappropriate and confusing, as mania is not a defining symptom of this condition. While some consumer advocates have expressed preference for a plain language term such as 'hair-pulling disorder', others have felt that such a term would not have sufficient medical gravitas. Furthermore, there would not be continuity with the previous literature. Thus, the name 'trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder)' was proposed, allowing individuals the choice of which name to use. A similar set of considerations led to a proposal for the name 'excoriation (skin-picking) disorder'.

### DSM-5: a collection of psychiatrist views on the changes, controversies, and future directions [^111Gip3w]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In DSM-5, OCD, BDD, and hoarding disorder have an insight specifier that ranges from 'good insight' through 'fair insight' and on to 'no insight/delusional' This sub-typing reflects the dimensional nature of insight in OCRDs, the existence of data indicating that different levels of insight require different treatment approaches, and a scientific consensus that patients with an OCRD that reaches delusional levels should be diagnosed with an OCRD rather than delusional disorder. In DSM-5, OCD can be specified as tic-related, BDD can be specified with muscle dysmorphia, and hoarding disorder can be specified with excessive acquisition, again reflecting the data that such specifiers have clinical implications.

Several changes to the diagnostic criteria for OCRDs have been made. It is notable that some of these changes help to emphasize the overlapping features of conditions in the OCRD chapter. Thus, BDD includes a new diagnostic criterion, which emphasizes that individuals respond to their appearance preoccupations with repetitive behaviors or mental state or acts. Similarly, the criteria for trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) no longer include diagnostic criteria that conform to the pattern of impulse control disorders, but include an extra criterion, which emphasizes that individuals have attempted to decrease or stop the hair-pulling. The validity of such changes have been confirmed by secondary analyses and field surveys.

### The classification of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders in the ICD-11 [^112QN9ei]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

To present the rationale for the new Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders (OCRD) grouping in the Mental and Behavioural Disorders chapter of the Eleventh Revision of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), including the conceptualization and essential features of disorders in this grouping.

Methods

Review of the recommendations of the ICD-11 Working Group on the Classification for OCRD. These sought to maximize clinical utility, global applicability, and scientific validity.

Results

The rationale for the grouping is based on common clinical features of included disorders including repetitive unwanted thoughts and associated behaviours, and is supported by emerging evidence from imaging, neurochemical, and genetic studies. The proposed grouping includes obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, hypochondriasis, olfactory reference disorder, and hoarding disorder. Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders, including trichotillomania and excoriation disorder are also included. Tourette disorder, a neurological disorder in ICD-11, and personality disorder with anankastic features, a personality disorder in ICD-11, are recommended for cross-referencing.

Limitations

Alternative nosological conceptualizations have been described in the literature and have some merit and empirical basis. Further work is needed to determine whether the proposed ICD-11 OCRD grouping and diagnostic guidelines are mostly likely to achieve the goals of maximizing clinical utility and global applicability.

Conclusion

It is anticipated that creation of an OCRD grouping will contribute to accurate identification and appropriate treatment of affected patients as well as research efforts aimed at improving our understanding of the prevalence, assessment, and management of its constituent disorders.

### Identifying subtypes of trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin picking) disorder using mixture modeling in a multicenter sample [^114PZiHQ]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

4.2 Differences between the SPD subtypes

The two SPD subtypes also exhibited clinical differences from each other. Of the two subtypes of SPD, Subtype 1 (which we refer to "emotional/reward pickers") which represents the majority of people with SPD is characterized by strong and frequent urges to pick, picking from negative emotions as well as automatic picking, and reporting little control. People in this subtype score high on measures of ADHD and report high levels of perfectionism.

Subtype 2 (which we refer to as "functional pickers") reflects a group of people with fairly mild SPD, with lower urges to pick, and overall little distress or impact from the picking. Interestingly, these people report some problems with sensory sensitivity and poor distress tolerance. They report minimal impairment due to their picking and do not present problems with emotional dysregulation, perfectionism or impulsivity.

The subtypes of SPD are a bit more problematic than those for TTM. Are these two subtypes truly categorically different, or, might they simply be different ends of a continuum? Considering the move toward dimensional conceptualizations and the lack of robust distinguishing characteristics here, these two subtypes may be reflective of a mild vs more moderate-severe symptomatology, rather than "subtypes". Future research should examine whether these "subtypes" change over time with treatment as their symptoms improve.

4.3 Clinical relevance

One of the possible benefits of understanding the complexity of BFRBs is that treatment can be better tailored. In terms of psychosocial treatments, there are several options that have shown some benefit for BFRBs. Habit reversal training, alone or enhanced with dialectical behavior therapy, or acceptance and commitment therapy, and comprehensive model for behavioral treatment, to name a few, are all associated with some benefit for BFRBs. To a lesser extent (in terms of their being fewer studies evaluating such treatments), but with a similar limited efficacy, pharmacotherapy (e.g. clomipramine, olanzapine, and N-acetyl cysteine) has shown some benefit for BFRBs as well. The question of whether there is a subgroup of BFRB which preferentially benefits from a particular therapy or medication, however, has not been answered. Instead of considering the BFRB the therapeutic target, possibly treating these comorbidity symptoms or other differences could reduce BFRB severity.

### Automatic and focused hair pulling in trichotillomania: valid and useful subtypes? [^116mY42k]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Participants

Adults, ages 18–65 with a primary and current DSM-5 diagnosis of trichotillomania were enrolled for various research studies over the period from 2009 to 2021 (all who met criteria under DSM-IV were reevaluated using DSM-5 criteria). Participants were primarily recruited from a large urban area using referrals and advertisements (online and print). Exclusion criteria included: (1) any neurological or psychiatric conditions that would prohibit completion of questionnaires, and (2) inconsistent or unstable psychotropic medication use or psychotherapy participation within the prior three months.

Data were collected at the University of Chicago following Institutional Review Board approval of the studies and associated consent procedures. Participants were given a comprehensive explanation of the study procedures and were given the opportunity to put forth any questions. After all questions were answered, participants provided written informed consent. This research was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Automatic and focused hair pulling in trichotillomania: valid and useful subtypes? [^113iG1t7]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In an online survey of 1545 adults, found that adults with trichotillomania who scored high on either a scale of automatic pulling or focused pulling reported more severe trichotillomania symptoms and greater functional impact (using the Milwaukee Inventory for Subtypes of Trichotillomania-Adult Version [MIST-A] and a median-split procedure). Thus, the authors proposed four pulling subtypes or styles: low automatic-low focused, low automatic-high focused, high automatic-low focused, and high automatic-high focused. A study by Tung and colleagues in 187 adults with trichotillomania further found significant correlations between focused pulling and poor quality of life, which appeared to be largely statistically mediated by depression (2014). A large study of adults with trichotillomania who were seen in person across four sites (n = 279) found three subtypes of trichotillomania, using a data-driven approach (mixture modelling statistics) across a range of measures (not only automatic vs focused). One subtype was characterized by highly focused pulling, infrequent and low intensity urges to pull, and low frequency of pulling behavior whereas the most common subtype reported high automatic pulling, with more pulling due to emotional triggers. In the case of children, Flessner and colleagues similarly examined a group of 186 youth via the same online platform and found that "high-focused" pullers reported more severe trichotillomania than "low-focused" pullers. There is also some indication that youth with trichotillomania develop more focused pulling as they get older and that greater focused pulling among children may be associated with poorer long-term prognosis. Interestingly, a recent study of 40 youth with trichotillomania demonstrated that focused pulling style largely improved with habit reversal therapy but there was limited improvement for automatic pulling.

### Prevalence, gender correlates, and co-morbidity of trichotillomania [^111ivYUD]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Trichotillomania is a mental health condition characterized by repetitive pulling out of one's hair, often leading to functional impairment and/or distress. A convenience sampling of 10,169 adults, aged 18–69 years, representative of the general US population, completed a survey to establish occurrence of trichotillomania, other mental health concerns, and impact of the illness. 175 (1.7%) identified as having current trichotillomania. Rates of trichotillomania did not differ significantly based on gender (1.8% of males and 1.7% of females). The mean age of onset for trichotillomania was 17.7 years. The mean age of onset differed significantly for males (mean 19.0 years) versus females (mean 14.8 years (p = 0.020). The average amount of distress reported due to trichotillomania was relatively high, and 79% of people with trichotillomania had one or more mental health comorbidities, the most common being anxiety/depressive disorders, OCD, PTSD, and ADHD. This study suggests trichotillomania is relatively common in the general population and typically characterized by moderate-high distress and high rates of comorbidity.

### The validity of DSM-IV-TR criteria B and C of hair-pulling disorder (trichotillomania): evidence from a clinical study [^113cqfAK]. Psychiatry Research (2011). Low credibility.

In both DSM-IV-TR and the ICD-10, hair-pulling disorder (trichotillomania, or TTM) is described as hair-pulling, with a rising urge or tension prior to pulling or when attempting to resist, and pleasure, relief or gratification during or after pulling. However, it has been questioned whether all patients with hair-pulling experience these other phenomena, and whether they occur with all pulling episodes. The objective of this study was to examine the DSM-IV-TR requirement of criteria B and C for a diagnosis of TTM in a sample of people with hair-pulling. A multi-site sample of adults with hair-pulling who met both DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria B and C (n = 82, 89.13%) were compared to those who failed to satisfy both B and C (n = 10, 10.87%) on a number of clinical variables. There were no differences in hair-pulling severity, levels of comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms, number of comorbid body-focused repetitive behaviors, or impairment between those patients who did and did not meet criteria B and C. Our study does not provide convincing support for the inclusion of the current diagnostic criteria B and C for TTM in DSM-5.

### Prevalence and gender distribution of trichotillomania: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112UYeQd]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Epidemiological studies have provided varying prevalence estimates of trichotillomania (TTM) and other hair-pulling behaviors. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide data-driven prevalence estimates of TTM and hair-pulling. PubMed, PsycInfo and Embase were searched on June 2020 (updated in November 2021). Studies reporting the frequency of TTM defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria or hair-pulling behaviors were included. Prevalence data was extracted for both genders, and female-to-male odds ratios (OR) were computed for TTM and any hair-pulling behaviors. Data were pooled through random-effects meta-analyses. Of the 713 records identified through database searches, 30 studies involving 38,526 participants were included. Meta-analyses indicated TTM had a prevalence of 1.14% (95% CI 0.66%, 1.96%), while any hair-pulling behavior had a prevalence of 8.84% (95% CI 6.33%, 12.20%). Meta-analyses demonstrated females were at an increased risk of any hair-pulling when noticeable hair loss was required (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.60, 3.10, p < 0.0001), but not of any hair-pulling when noticeable hair loss was not required (OR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.72, 1.64, p = 0.33). Meta-analyses did not indicate female preponderance in TTM (k = 10; N = 22,775; OR = 1.29; 95% CI 0.91, 1.83; I² = 28%, p = 0.15), although there was considerable heterogeneity across studies. This study demonstrates that TTM impacts ∼1% of the population, while general hair-pulling behaviors affects ∼8%, highlighting the significant public health impact of this understudied condition. Additional research should clarify the gender distribution of TTM in epidemiological samples.

### Trichotillomania and skin-picking: a phenomenological comparison [^116hPEiv]. Depression and Anxiety (2002). Low credibility.

Although trichotillomania and pathological skin-picking are both characterized by repetitive self-injurious stereotypic behaviors, the former is classified as an impulse control disorder, while the latter is not given a specific diagnostic category in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition) [APA, 1994]. There are, however, few empirical data on phenomenological similarities and differences between these disorders. Patients with trichotillomania and pathological skin-picking were compared in terms of several demographic (age, gender), clinical (comorbid axis I and II disorders), and personality variables. Trichotillomania and pathological skin-picking were very similar in demographics, psychiatric comorbidity, and personality dimensions. Dissociative symptoms may be more common in trichotillomania than in pathological skin-picking. These data support the concept of phenomenological overlap between trichotillomania and pathological skin-picking. Future work to assess the implications of overlap for clinical evaluation and intervention in the two conditions may be useful.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^115bWcDs]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) psychiatric evaluation highlights include "Assess the patient's current symptoms", "Consider rating symptom severity", "Evaluate the effects of symptoms on well-being, functioning, and quality of life", and "Evaluate the safety of the patient and others". It includes "Be alert to the presence of co-occurring conditions, especially" depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, other anxiety disorders, tics or Tourette's disorder, eating disorders, alcohol or substance abuse or dependence, impulse-control disorders such as skin-picking and trichotillomania, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. It includes "Record the past psychiatric history, especially" course of symptoms, treatment history (including hospitalizations and trials of medications and psychotherapies with details of treatment adequacy, duration, response, and side effects), and past histories of co-occurring disorders that may influence treatment (e.g., mood or substance use disorders; panic attacks). It further lists "Record the general medical history, especially" current general medical conditions, hospitalizations, history of head trauma, loss of consciousness, or seizures, current medications (including hormonal therapies, herbal remedies, vitamins, other over-the-counter medications, and other alternative or complementary therapies), and allergies or drug sensitivities, and "Elicit a review of systems, especially" symptoms that could be confused with medication side effects. It also lists "Record the developmental, psychosocial, and sociocultural history, especially" developmental transitions in childhood and adulthood, capacity to achieve stable and gratifying familial and social relationships, sexual history, educational and occupational history, primary support group and sociocultural supports, potential psychosocial stressors, effects of OCD on schooling, work, and relationships, and the role of social supports in facilitating treatment or in maintaining or exacerbating symptoms, plus "Record the family history, especially" OCD, other psychiatric disorders, and tics and/or Tourette's disorder.

### Clinical presentation of body-focused repetitive behaviors in minority ethnic groups [^113VWFUv]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Our finding that minorities were less likely to receive treatment for their BFRB is important. Interestingly, the percentage of BAME participants in the study (14.1%) do not reflect the percentage of ethnic minorities in the urban area from which they were recruited (approximately 55%) and this may reflect a general lack of treatment seeking on the part of minorities with BFRBs, a lack of treatment seeking more specifically from large academic medical centers, and/or poor outreach from clinicians and researchers to minority communities. Neal-Barnett and colleagues have suggested that black individuals with trichotillomania are more likely to seek assistance from their hair care professionals than psychologists and psychiatrists. Mansueto and colleagues further hypothesized that perhaps black individuals with trichotillomania seek treatment less frequently because they might actually be better able to mask the cosmetic consequences of hair pulling. Whether these explanations apply here or equally across racial categories remains unclear. Also, why this lack of treatment seeking would also apply to those with skin picking disorder remains unanswered. The lower levels of having received treatment in people from BAME backgrounds raises issues around access to care and whether there are health inequalities that affect such individuals, which is important for healthcare providers and clinicians to be aware of. There are other potential explanations for these disparities in treatment utilization, such as mistrust and stigma which need further examination. Further research should continue exploring BFRBs in ethnic minorities as it would be valuable to learn more about treatment approaches that may be best suited for BAME individuals. Neal-Barnett and colleagues suggested that treatment for trichotillomania should consider the psychological aspects of being in a minority group. Whether these culture-based interventions should also develop novel cognitive and behavioral strategies remains unknown but could be a useful future target.

### Salivary sex hormones in adolescent females with trichotillomania [^112kE1HQ]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

Although these limited studies shed some light on the topic of the possible role of sex hormones in trichotillomania, many unanswered questions remain. Understanding the role of hormones in repetitive behaviors such as trichotillomania may allow for a greater understanding of the pathophysiology and therefore treatment. Based on the extant literature, we hypothesized that sex hormones would be abnormal in young woman with trichotillomania (i.e. lower progesterone levels, higher estradiol levels, and normal testosterone levels). By examining the relationship between hormones and trichotillomania we hope to determine a possible deeper understanding of the biology of this potentially disabling disorder.

### Motor inhibition and cognitive flexibility in obsessive-compulsive disorder and trichotillomania [^113fzfp7]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Problems with inhibiting certain pathological behaviors are integral to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), trichotillomania, and other putative obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders. The authors assessed and compared motor inhibition and cognitive flexibility in OCD and trichotillomania for the first time, to their knowledge.

Method

The Stop-Signal Task and the Intradimensiona/Extradimensional Shift Task were administered to 20 patients with OCD, 17 patients with trichotillomania, and 20 healthy comparison subjects.

Results

Both OCD and trichotillomania showed impaired inhibition of motor responses. For trichotillomania, the deficit was worse than for OCD, and the degree of the deficit correlated significantly with symptom severity. Only patients with OCD showed deficits in cognitive flexibility.

Conclusions

Impaired inhibition of motor responses (impulsivity) was found in OCD and trichotillomania, whereas cognitive inflexibility (thought to contribute to compulsivity) was limited to OCD. This assessment will advance the characterization and classification of obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders and aid the development of novel treatments.

### Eyebrow and eyelash alopecia: a clinical review [^116ZP5Xj]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Traumatic

As no pharmacologic therapy has been FDA-approved for trichotillomania, the mainstay treatment remains psychotherapy. N -acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutathione and glutamate modulator, at a dosage of 1200–1800 mg/day has been used to treat scalp trichotillomania, but there are no reports of its efficacy in treating eyebrow and eyelash trichotillomania.

Hair transplantation by follicular unit extraction (FUE) has been successfully performed for eyebrow alopecia from burn injury using pretreatment with combined non-ablative fractional laser (NAFL) and microfat injection. A strip micrograft using FUE technique, with eyebrow hairs as the donor site, has also been successfully conducted for traumatic madarosis of the upper and lower eyelid in one case report.

Primary Dermatoses

In atopic dermatitis, treatment with emollients and topical corticosteroids have been reported to result in partial eyebrow regrowth in one case report. Partial eyebrow regrowth was also observed in one patient treated with subcutaneous dupilumab.

Seborrheic dermatitis is associated with colonization with Malasezzia spp. and treatment with a topical antifungal, low-potency corticosteroid cream, or topical calcineurin inhibitor to the eyebrows has been found to be both safe and effective.

Other

Because eyelash follicles express prostaglandin F2α receptors, prostaglandin analogs can affect their growth. LATISSE ® (bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03%) once daily was approved by the US FDA in 2008 for eyelash hypotrichosis and has been shown to increase eyelash pigmentation, length, and thickness.

In one randomized controlled trial including 357 patients with idiopathic or unspecified eyebrow loss, the efficacy of topical bimatoprost 0.03% applied once or twice daily was compared to a non-medicated control. Improvements in eyebrow fullness and thickness were noted in both bimatoprost groups when compared to the control (p < 0.001). Another randomized trial with 39 participants used 2% minoxidil lotion applied to the eyebrows twice daily for 16 weeks and found significant improvement in both global photographic scores and hair count with the use of minoxidil when compared to vehicle.

### Suicidal ideation and attempts in trichotillomania [^112ACY5F]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Based on our data, trichotillomania appears to have a lower rate of both lifetime suicidal ideation and suicide attempts compared to certain other obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders. One possible explanation for these differences could be that the symptoms of trichotillomania, while impairing, are less likely to result in suicidal ideation or attempts as compared to the symptoms of OCD or BDD. Given the reported low quality of life and depression, however, it will be important to determine what protective factors against suicidality people with trichotillomania possess that others in the OCD spectrum may not have.

Suicidal ideation in trichotillomania was significantly associated with having comorbid major depressive disorder. Having said that, it is also important to note that approximately 40% of those with suicidal ideation did not have comorbid major depressive disorder. It is likely that those with greater general psychopathology who have both depression and trichotillomania are also more likely to have suicidal ideation. It is not possible to unentangle the complex relationship between suicidality, depression and hair pulling based on our limited data. Some of these participants might have been depressed and suicidal due to their pulling, others may have been depressed and suicidal independent of their pulling, and others may have had suicidal ideation independent of pulling and of depressive symptoms. Another way of interpreting these results, however, is not that depression is a risk factor but instead suicide is an independent problem and thus a shared outcome of a subset of trichotillomania patients and a subset of some depressed patients. Regardless, these data do suggest that everyone with trichotillomania should be screened for major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation. There are important limitations to this study. First, the sample for the present study was recruited from a diverse group of research studies and the recruitment method may have varied slightly. Second, the findings of this study may not be generalizable to people with trichotillomania in the general community, or to specific clinical practice situations, since all participants were part of various research studies. Third, we only used the Columbia Suicide Rating Scale to examine suicidality, and did not include a measure of disability, and therefore future research may consider adding other measures of interest. Fourth, we did not ask what if any relationship hair pulling had to suicidal ideation. Finally, the study enrolled 80% Caucasians and therefore minority racial-ethnic groups were underrepresented, relative to the general population, which may affect the generalizability of the results. Prior work indicates that suicidality in general maybe higher in particular minority racial-ethnic groups, notably in relation to indigenous populations, highlighting the need to study this issue in future trichotillomania research.

### The genetics of trichotillomania and excoriation disorder: a systematic review [^112tDmVK]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Though understudied, both conditions are relatively common with estimated pooled prevalence ratios (current or lifetime) of 1.14% for TTM and 3.45% for ED based on recent meta-analyses. These conditions typically onset in childhood with an average onset age of 11–15 years, although for some individuals they may present later in adulthood. Several studies, but not all, suggest that these BFRB conditions may impact females more than males [reviewed in 5–6]. The natural history of these conditions is characterized by a chronic course of waxing-and-waning symptom severity throughout the lifetime. Therefore, the impact of these conditions on children and adults may be substantial across the lifespan, and both TTM and ED have been associated with impairments in occupational, academic, and social functioning as well as financial burdens. Studies have also demonstrated that individuals with either condition have high rates of psychiatric comorbidities, including depression (12–65%), anxiety (8–32%), and substance use disorders (14–36%). TTM and ED can also lead to medical consequences, including infections and repetitive hand-use injuries from pulling and picking for hours a day. Currently, available estimates indicate that 2 in 10 individuals with TTM engage in trichophagia, or eating of their hair, which puts them at risk for developing trichobezoars and other possibly serious gastrointestinal complications. The considerable prevalence of TTM and ED in the general population, their impacts on psychosocial functioning across the lifespan, and the plethora of psychiatric and physical conditions associated with these BFRBs underscore their public health importance.

### Clinical presentation of body-focused repetitive behaviors in minority ethnic groups [^113s5g1s]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Trichotillomania and skin picking disorder are characterized by excessive grooming leading to hair loss or excoriations, respectively, as well as causing clinically significant impairment or distress. These two disorders have been grouped together in a category referred to as body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs). Trichotillomania and skin picking disorder both appear to be fairly common psychiatric disorders with current prevalence rates of 1.7% and 2.1%, respectively.

Trichotillomania and skin picking disorder are characterized by the repetitive pulling out of one's own hair or picking one's own skin resulting in distress or functional impairment. Most people with trichotillomania commonly pull from the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes but any bodily site with hair may be the focus. People with skin picking most frequently pick from their face but as with trichotillomania they may picking from any part of the body. Pulling and picking from multiple sites is common and pulling and picking episodes are usually daily and can last from a few minutes to several hours. Many people report not being fully aware of their pulling or picking behaviors (referred to as "automatic" pulling/picking), whereas "focused" pulling and picking generally occurs when the person intends to correct a hair or skin problem (e.g. remove a hair that is "not right" or picking a perceived bump on the skin as not feeling "smooth enough"). Both behaviors are frequently associated with reduced self-esteem, and increased avoidance of social situations due to shame and embarrassment. Even though trichotillomania and skin picking interfere with a person's quality of life, the majority (about 65% or higher) of individuals never seek treatment. Psychiatric comorbidity is common in BFRBs with anxiety/depressive disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder being the most common and often the reason people seek treatment.

### "N-acetylcysteine for obsessive-compulsive and related disorders in children and adolescents: a review" [^117WMyXe]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate clinical data using oral n-acetylcysteine (NAC) in obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCDRD) treatment.

Data Sources

PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE (1946-July 2022), and the Cochrane Library database were searched using the terms NAC, children, adolescent, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), trichotillomania (TTM), excoriation, hoarding disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder. Bibliographies were reviewed for relevant trials and case studies.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English language, clinical trials, or case studies analyzing NAC use in patients aged 3 to 21 years old with OCDRD as determined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition.

Data Synthesis

Three randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials of NAC in children and adolescents studied 121 patients with OCDRD. Trials assessed symptom severity from baseline to 10 to 12 weeks of NAC therapy. Two OCD trials identified statistically significant improvements, with only 1 trial demonstrating a clear clinically relevant difference from placebo. One trial in TTM found no difference between the NAC and placebo. Adverse effects were mild and included nausea, blurred vision, fatigue, tremor, and sweats. N-acetylcysteine titrated to 2400 or 2700 mg/day in divided doses was the most studied regimen.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Many OCDRD patients fail to completely respond to first-line treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) leaving practitioners with few additional treatment options. Preliminary efficacy and safety data are presented in this review.

Conclusions

Limited evidence suggests children and adolescents with OCD refractory to SSRIs or CBT may benefit from NAC augmentation.

### Trichotillomania with gastric trichobezoar [^116C35Pk]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Bezoars are collections or concretions of indigestible foreign material in the gastrointestinal tract. Trichotillomania is an impetuous disorder of pulling out one's own hair, whereas trichobezoar is the formation of a hairball after trichophagia, which contains a large quantity of hair, varying in length, matted together.

A 13-year-old patient presented with abdominal pain beginning 1 month ago. During this period the patient had reported pain intensity to be from mild to moderate and localized to epigastrium. The patient experienced non-projectile vomiting, containing undigested food particles.

General physical examination exposed patchy alopecia as shown in Fig. 1. Abdominal examination revealed an irregular and non-tender lump overlying a part of the epigastrium. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed an echogenic area with dense acoustic shadow in the stomach region. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, revealing a large ball of hair in the body as well as pylorus of the stomach, as shown in Fig. 2A displaying the trichobezoar. Considering the size, the trichobezoar was removed laproscopically (Fig. 2B) and the patient was referred to a psychiatrist for treatment of trichotillomania.

Trichobezoar is the most common form of bezoars reported, with hairballs extending to the small intestine causing Rapunzel syndrome in a few cases. Trichophagia is equated to pica syndrome. Abdominal pain, anemia, and weight loss are the most common complaints. Evaluation involves ultrasonography, computed tomography and endoscopy. Endoscopic removal has been tried in few cases, however surgical elimination remains the preferred choice. Treatment of trichotillomania is behavioral therapy. The importance and severity of trichotillomania should not be underrated and alertness of these disorders should be encouraged at primary health care level.

### Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder), skin picking disorder, and stereotypic movement disorder: toward DSM-V [^1169w1Hh]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

In DSM-IV-TR, trichotillomania (TTM) is classified as an impulse control disorder (not classified elsewhere), skin picking lacks its own diagnostic category (but might be diagnosed as an impulse control disorder not otherwise specified), and stereotypic movement disorder is classified as a disorder usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence. ICD-10 classifies TTM as a habit and impulse disorder, and includes stereotyped movement disorders in a section on other behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence. This article provides a focused review of nosological issues relevant to DSM-V, given recent empirical findings. This review presents a number of options and preliminary recommendations to be considered for DSM-V: (1) Although TTM fits optimally into a category of body-focused repetitive behavioral disorders, in a nosology comprised of relatively few major categories it fits best within a category of motoric obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, (2) available evidence does not support continuing to include (current) diagnostic criteria B and C for TTM in DSM-V, (3) the text for TTM should be updated to describe subtypes and forms of hair pulling, (4) there are persuasive reasons for referring to TTM as "hair pulling disorder (trichotillomania)", (5) diagnostic criteria for skin picking disorder should be included in DSM-V or in DSM-Vs Appendix of Criteria Sets Provided for Further Study, and (6) the diagnostic criteria for stereotypic movement disorder should be clarified and simplified, bringing them in line with those for hair pulling and skin picking disorder.

### The role of compulsivity in body-focused repetitive behaviors [^116WS7Y1]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study that we are aware of that has used a validated, trans-diagnostic measure of compulsivity to better understand BFRBs. Our findings were that compulsivity correlates with worse psychosocial functioning (medium effect size) and quality of life (small-medium effect size). This may have relevance for treatment. In the few treatments studies which have assessed psychosocial functioning with the Sheehan Disability Scale, even when BFRB symptoms significantly improved with therapy or medication, disability was found to be unchanged. This may suggest that even promising treatments for BFRBs do not necessarily appear to ameliorate the psychosocial dysfunction associated with BFRBs, which could be contributed to partly by untreated compulsivity. In the current study, we did not find a link between conventional symptom severity measures for BFRBs and disability or quality of life, whereas trans-diagnostic compulsivity did correlate with these clinically important parameters. These findings might suggest the current symptom measures for BFRBs are not including an important aspect of the disease and that a fuller understanding of these symptoms requires measurement of compulsivity. Including validated measures of compulsivity in clinical trials of therapy or medication would also seem to be important for future work.

It is important to note that by 'compulsivity' we refer to a broad construct, not specifically to compulsions in OCD. Data indicate that OCD treatments such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appear to be ineffective for trichotillomania, whereas opioid antagonists or certain glutamate modulators, show promise in clinical trials for trichotillomania. Evaluating effects of such non-SSRI treatments on trans-diagnostic compulsivity in BFRBs would be interesting in future work. Current psychological approaches to trichotillomania often involve habit reversal therapy, which could be regarded as partly targeting compulsivity: again it would be interesting to include a trans-diagnostic compulsivity measure in future clinical trials using such therapies, to examine whether it is ameliorated, or requires a different psychological approach.

### DSM-5 field survey: hair-pulling disorder (trichotillomania) [^113HU5mx]. Depression and Anxiety (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this multisite field survey was to examine the DSM-IV-TR criteria, proposed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, as well as a number of possible additional diagnostic criteria, in patients with hair-pulling disorder (HPD, or trichotillomania).

Methods

Four sites were involved. Participants older than 10 years of age, male or female, with hair-pulling symptoms in the last 4 weeks were included. Participants were assessed with two modules based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID-I/P), which addressed the DSM-IV-TR criteria set as well as proposed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for HPD, respectively. Additional questions were established to test other possible diagnostic criteria.

Results

Eighty-four (79 female, 5 male, 83 adult) participants with current hair-pulling symptoms were included. All of these participants had recurrent hair-pulling and most (n = 82 [98%]) reported repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair-pulling, and 70 (n = 70 [83%]) met the clinical significance criterion. Diagnostic criteria focused on "urge", "tension", "need", "drive", or "impulse" to pull, or pleasure, gratification or relief during or after pulling, were endorsed by many, but not all. Individuals who did endorse such criteria had significantly more severe hair-pulling symptoms.

Conclusions

These data support the proposed diagnostic criteria for HPD in adults. Although most adult patients have urges to pull or experience a sense of relief on pulling, as in the case of skin-picking disorder, such phenomena are not universal and so should not be included in the diagnostic criteria. An additional criterion focused on repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair-pulling seems warranted.

### The genetics of trichotillomania and excoriation disorder: a systematic review [^114AHYJG]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

4.1. Limitations

Overall, the strengths of the present review include the search criteria as we comprehensively reviewed the available literature on the genetics of TTM and ED to examine the most updated genetic findings for these disorders. However, the strengths of this study should be considered in the context of its limitations. First, many of the genetic findings in this review were based on candidate gene approaches which are limited by the small effect sizes of common variants and the polygenic nature of psychiatric disorders, and historically often do not replicate in large-scale genome-wide studies. Second, many of the genetic findings in this review were based on single studies of animal models, which have not been replicated in additional studies or human models. Lastly, we acknowledge that many of the studies included did not have TTM or ED as the primary focus of the genetic analyses, limiting our conclusions about the genetics of these disorders.

### Recurrent trichobezoar due to trichophagia: a case report [^113tCNpd]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Trichobezoar, a hair ball in the gastrointestinal tract, is usually the result of the urge to pull out one's own hair (trichotillomania) and swallow it (trichophagia). It is almost exclusively seen in young females and may cause serious medical complications. This case report will describe an adult female patient with recurrent trichobezoars.

Method

Data for this case report was collected from peer-reviewed literature and treatment encounters by the consultation-liaison psychiatry unit; subsequent to obtaining informed consent.

Results

The personality characteristics, familial structure and domestic stress found in this case mirror the literature. We initiated behavioral interventions including habit reversal training and patient education in combination with pharmacologic therapy with clomipramine.

Conclusion

Left untreated, trichophagia can cause a life-threatening emergency, requiring surgery. Recurrence of tichobezoars can be anticipated when the underlying emotional disorder is not addressed using multimodal management including psychiatric evaluation and treatment combined with surgical procedures.

### Habit-reversal training: a psychotherapeutic approach in treating body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders [^115vPzLT]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Body-focused repetitive behaviours (BFRBs) are recurrent, compulsive, destructive behaviours directed towards the body. Although studies have demonstrated a 12–14% prevalence rate, researchers found that dermatologists and psychiatrists show a lack of knowledge regarding psychodermatology resources and information about BFRB disorders (BFRBDs) such as trichotillomania (TTM). There is limited research about treatments including ones investigating the clinical applications of various self-help training such as decoupling (DC) and DC in sensu (DC-is) as well as about habit-reversal training (HRT). HRT is a five-component behavioural intervention that aims to develop a competing response to a specific unwanted behaviour. Studies have found substantial support for HRT's efficacy in treating a variety of maladaptive repetitive behaviours including onychotillomania, TTM, skin-picking disorder and chronic cheek biting. Additionally, many psychotherapies can augmented HRT. Psychotherapies include acceptance and commitment therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, mindfulness mediation and the cognitive psychophysiological model. A recently investigated variant of HRT, DC-is, resulted in consistently satisfactory objective and subjective improvement for treating BFRBDs, and HRT showed good subjective but poor objective improvement compared with standard DC. HRT and HRT variants are effective therapeutic treatments for BFRBDs; however, further randomized double-blinded and placebo-controlled trials are required to examine HRT's therapeutic profile.

### Identifying subtypes of trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin picking) disorder using mixture modeling in a multicenter sample [^114sCm2y]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Based on these data, one could perhaps imagine formulating different treatment plans based on the subgroups of BFRB. For example, those individuals who fit Subtypes 1 and 2 might benefit from learning to increase awareness through either habit reversal training or awareness enhancement devices, whereas those individuals with TTM who fit into Subtype 3 might benefit from psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy focusing on emotional dysregulation. Similarly, those with SPD who fit into Subtype 1 may benefit from interventions that focus on enhancing coping skills/resilience, ADHD, mood or personality (perfectionism), and perhaps may benefit from a medication targeting mood or perfectionism for their BFRB.

Neurocognitive deficits have been demonstrated in patients with TTM and SPD in the literature, compared to controls. Here, the classes did not differ overall in terms of set-shifting or response inhibition performance. It is important to note that, due to the statistical methods used, the control group for the TTM subtypes included SPD cases; and that the control group for the SPD subtypes included TTM cases (as people with picking would answer "no" to all questions about pulling and vice versa). Hence, failure to detect group differences on cognition does not indicate that TTM and SPD as disorders are free from such deficits; rather, just that they are not detectable when groups are defined using the current statistical methodology. It would be valuable in future work to explore cognition in more detail, including in comparison to healthy control reference group(s); and to examine whether TTM/SPD subtypes can be identified based on cognition and imaging markers. At the same time, group differences were found in terms of Barratt Impulsivity Scale scores. This may suggest that self-report measures may be more sensitive to differences in such latent subtypes than these neurocognitive tasks (prior work indicates self-report measures may link more directly with psychopathologies than cognitive tests.

### Neurodermatitis of the scalp associated with trichotillomania treated with roflumilast cream 0.3 [^113eCRyT]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neurodermatitis of the scalp is a chronic skin condition that results in lichenification of the skin secondary to excessive scratching or excoriations. It affects mostly women over the age of 35. Treatment options include topical and intralesional steroids, topical capsaicin, or topical tacrolimus. Systemic treatments such as sedative antihistamines or antipsychotics have also been used. Roflumilast cream 0.3% is a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 for the treatment of psoriasis, and later in its foam form for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. We report the case of a 76-year-old female with neurodermatitis of the scalp associated with trichotillomania that was successfully treated with roflumilast cream 0.3%.

### Patient advocacy and DSM-5 [^114R5p6w]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In considering these viewpoints, our subworkgroup noted that there were both overlaps and distinctions between OCD and a range of other putative obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and that this was the case in other DSM-5 chapters as well. We also noted that a tic specifier for obsessive-compulsive disorder was important, as OCD patients with tics have particular clinical characteristics, and that adding a tic specifier to obsessive-compulsive disorder would emphasize the clinically important relationship between tic disorders and OCD. Finally, our subworkgroup noted that it would be important to use the DSM-5 text to emphasize to readers how disorders in the chapters on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders had both similarities and differences.

Our subworkgroup reviewed the literature on hoarding disorder and excoriation (skin picking) disorder and concluded that there was sufficient scientific evidence to support the utility and validity of these diagnostic entities. (We should note that all changes proposed by the subworkgroup received extensive review by other DSM-5 committees to ensure that the proposed changes had adequate scientific support, as changes for DSM-5 were heavily based upon available scientific evidence.) There was again considerable feedback from the public, including members of the Trichotillomania Learning Center, on these questions. In particular, hundreds of patients and patient advocates commented that excoriation (skin picking) disorder and hoarding disorder should be included in the nomenclature. Such feedback usefully complemented available scientific data in emphasizing the clinical importance and the clinical utility of these diagnostic entities.

### The genetics of trichotillomania and excoriation disorder: a systematic review [^1142LbDU]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

Despite these limitations, the present study contributes to our understanding of the current state of genetics research of TTM and ED as it attempts to comprehensively summarize genetic findings for these disorders. The most notable conclusions of our review is that there is a paucity of genetic risk factors known to be associated with TTM or ED, and few studies used genome-wide approaches to examine the genetics of these disorders as compared to other, related disorders. In recent years, genome-wide analyses have contributed significantly to our understanding of the genetics of psychiatric conditions, and it is our suggestion that more research should leverage these approaches in TTM and ED.

### N-acetylcysteine in depressive symptoms and functionality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1148vyoL]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the utility of N-acetylcysteine administration for depressive symptoms in subjects with psychiatric conditions using a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

A computerized literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, SciELO, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge. No year or country restrictions were used. The Boolean terms used for the electronic database search were (NAC OR N-acetylcysteine OR acetylcysteine) AND (depression OR depressive OR depressed) AND (trial). The last search was performed in November 2014.

Study Selection

The literature was searched for double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials using N-acetylcysteine for depressive symptoms regardless of the main psychiatric condition. Using keywords and cross-referenced bibliographies, 38 studies were identified and examined in depth. Of those, 33 articles were rejected because inclusion criteria were not met. Finally, 5 studies were included.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted independently by 2 investigators. The primary outcome measure was change in depressive symptoms. Functionality, quality of life, and manic and anxiety symptoms were also examined. A full review and meta-analysis were performed. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated.

Results

Five studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis, providing data on 574 participants, of whom 291 were randomized to receive N-acetylcysteine and 283 to placebo. The follow-up varied from 12 to 24 weeks. Two studies included subjects with bipolar disorder and current depressive symptoms, 1 included subjects with MDD in a current depressive episode, and 2 included subjects with depressive symptoms in the context of other psychiatric conditions (1 trichotillomania and 1 heavy smoking). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine improved depressive symptoms as assessed by Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale when compared to placebo (SMD = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.55; P < .001). Subjects receiving N-acetylcysteine had better depressive symptoms scores on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale at follow-up than subjects on placebo (SMD = 0.22; 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.41; P < .001). In addition, global functionality was better in N-acetylcysteine than in placebo conditions. There were no changes in quality of life. With regard to adverse events, only minor adverse events were associated with N-acetylcysteine (OR = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.01 to 2.59; p = 0.049).

Conclusions

Administration of N-acetylcysteine ameliorates depressive symptoms, improves functionality, and shows good tolerability.

### DSM-5 obsessive-compulsive and related disorders: clinical implications of new criteria [^111cK4Y4]. Depression and Anxiety (2014). Low credibility.

For the publication of DSM-5, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was the subject of significant revisions to its classification and diagnostic criteria. One of these significant changes was the placement of OCD in a new category, "Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders (OCRDs)", which also includes body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, hoarding disorder, substance/medication-induced OCRD, OCRD due to another medical condition, and other specified OCRDs. Changes in the diagnostic criteria and grouping of these disorders may have significant clinical implications, and will be reviewed in this article.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders [^11193mTy]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Table 1 — repetitive movements of childhood — outlines key distinctions useful for differential diagnosis. Tics are described as sudden rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic vocalization or motor movement, with typical disorders where present including transient tics, Tourette's disorder (TD), and chronic tic disorders (CTD). Dystonia is defined as involuntary, sustained, or intermittent muscle contractions that cause twisting and repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or both, and is associated with DYT1 gene, Wilson's, myoclonic dystonia, and extrapyramidal symptoms due to dopamine blocking agents. Stereotypies are stereotyped, rhythmic, repetitive movements or patterns of speech with lack of variation over time, associated with autism, stereotypic movement disorder, and intellectual disability. Compulsions are a repetitive, excessive, meaningless activity or mental exercise that a person performs in an attempt to avoid distress or worry, associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anorexia, body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, trichotillomania, and excoriation disorder.

### Clinical presentation of body-focused repetitive behaviors in minority ethnic groups [^111pYn8c]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Although the data on BFRBs and racial-ethnic status are limited and somewhat mixed, racial differences may be particularly relevant to BFRBs. BFRBs often result in noticeable physical or cosmetic problems (e.g. hair loss or thinning, excoriations). Consequently, those with BFRBs often avoid social settings due to appearance-related embarrassment. While skin conditions such as acne, vitiligo, and psoriasis are not psychiatric in nature, they also create noticeable visual abnormalities on those afflicted. Within these conditions, ethnicity has been shown to play a role in self-consciousness (a component of psychosocial impairment). As such, these studies suggest that ethnicity may play a role in both symptom severity and psychosocial impairment associated with BFRBs.

One approach to more precisely tailor BFRB treatments might be to explore the relationship between ethnicity and clinical presentation of both trichotillomania and skin picking disorder. Are there unique racial differences that should be better understood and ultimately be incorporated into education programs to promote treatment utilization as well as refine and improve treatment approaches? The goal of this study was to better understand how ethnicity may relate to symptom severity and psychosocial impairment in a sample of adults with trichotillomania or skin picking disorder. In light of the current literature including for other disorders, we hypothesized that there would be a difference in symptom severity, co-occurring disorders, and rates of treatment utilization, between BAME and non-BAME individuals.

### Treatment of trichotillomania with behavioral therapy or fluoxetine… [^111U1JFX]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Forty-three patients with trichotillomania entered a 12-week randomized, WL-controlled study of BT and fluoxetine. Forty patients completed the trial. Treatment effects were evaluated using the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale, and severity of hair loss was rated by independent assessors. In addition, we measured general symptoms of psychopathologic abnormalities and depression. Results For reducing the symptoms of trichotillomania, BT was superior. Patients in the BT group showed a significantly greater reduction in trichotillomania symptoms, higher effect sizes, and more clinically significant changes than patients in the fluoxetine and WL groups. For severity of hair loss, a similar trend was also found in favor of the BT group.

No significant differences between groups were established for general psychopathologic and depressive symptoms. Conclusions Behavioral therapy is highly effective for reducing symptoms of trichotillomania in the short term, whereas fluoxetine is not. Forty-three outpatients with trichotillomania were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: 6 sessions of BT during a 12-week period, a 12-week fluoxetine treatment, or 12 weeks on a WL. The cell size needed for a statistical power of 80% for BT and WL was estimated at 8 based on a mean ± SD pretreatment-posttreatment improvement score on the severity scale of 8. 6 ±
4. 2 and on the impairment scale of 3. 3 ± 2.
3. Fluoxetine treatment was shown to be ineffective in reducing trichotillomania symptoms.

The low improvement rates for fluoxetine treatment found in this study confirm the results of 2 previous controlled studies15, 16 but contradict those from another controlled study14 and from several open-trial studies. 9–12 One reason for the contradictory effects of fluoxetine treatment in trichotillomania may be that dosages and treatment durations differ in the various studies.
