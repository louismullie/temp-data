Metformin in ckd patients

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about metformin use in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory framework and how it has evolved from creatinine-based cutoffs to eGFR-based thresholds. Then, I should verify the current guideline recommendations across KDIGO, ADA, and AACE. Next, I will examine the safety signal for lactic acidosis and how it varies by eGFR. After that, I need to review the evidence for kidney and cardiovascular outcomes, including observational and randomized data. Finally, I will translate this into practical dosing, monitoring, and special situations like contrast, surgery, and transplant, and close with a concise clinical recommendation summary.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory evolution, because I need to ensure I'm not anchoring on outdated creatinine thresholds. Historically, metformin carried boxed warnings and creatinine-based contraindications, but the FDA revised labeling in 2016 to adopt eGFR-based guidance, allowing use down to eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m² with dose adjustments and discontinuation below 30, which materially expanded access in CKD [^12be802f] [^191d3848].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines to align the clinical stance. KDIGO 2020 and 2022 recommend initiating metformin in T2DM with CKD when eGFR is at least 30 mL/min/1.73 m², with dose reduction when eGFR is below 45 and discontinuation if eGFR falls below 30, and they endorse metformin as foundational therapy alongside SGLT2 inhibitors when indicated [^e83ab58b] [^3878cc53] [^62aac289]. The ADA/KDIGO 2022 consensus similarly supports metformin as first-line in CKD with eGFR ≥ 30, integrated with SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiorenal benefit, and AACE 2022 aligns with these eGFR thresholds and dose-modification rules [^69725d55] [^7d1f0b31].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without quantifying the lactic acidosis risk. I should double-check the incidence data. Contemporary systematic reviews and large observational cohorts show metformin-associated lactic acidosis is exceedingly rare, on the order of 3–10 per 100,000 person-years, and not clearly increased in mild-to-moderate CKD when appropriately dosed and monitored, though risk may rise in advanced CKD or acute kidney injury contexts [^5f128656] [^764ae3f8]. Mechanistically, metformin is renally cleared and can accumulate, but lactate levels generally remain within normal limits unless there is significant renal impairment or hypoxic stress, reinforcing the eGFR 30 threshold and vigilance during acute illness [^5f128656].

> I will now examine kidney outcomes, and I need to be careful to distinguish signal from noise. Observational studies in diabetic CKD suggest metformin use is associated with slower eGFR decline and lower risks of ESRD and mortality, but these are nonrandomized and susceptible to confounding, so I should not overstate causality [^6632d190] [^d7cec300]. Randomized data are sparse; a 2024 Cochrane review found a small attenuation in eGFR decline versus placebo but very low certainty, and no clear effect on kidney failure, underscoring the need for larger, dedicated RCTs in CKD populations [^f2cb5342]. Let me reconsider the clinical implication: while the signal is encouraging, I should frame metformin's renal benefits as possible rather than proven, and prioritize agents with definitive cardiorenal protection when appropriate [^f2cb5342].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular outcomes, because in CKD these often drive net clinical benefit. Metformin has longstanding evidence for reduced cardiovascular events and mortality in overweight T2DM from UKPDS, and observational data in CKD suggest lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, though contemporary cardiovascular outcome trials are limited and heterogenous, so I must be cautious in extrapolation [^5226d0a5] [^d7cec300]. But wait, what if newer agents eclipse metformin's cardiovascular effect size in CKD? Indeed, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists have robust, modern RCT evidence for reducing kidney endpoints, heart failure, and cardiovascular death, which is why guidelines now layer these therapies with metformin rather than replace it outright [^3a2b4cee] [^69725d55].

> Let me translate this into practical dosing and monitoring, and I should confirm the specifics. For eGFR ≥ 45, standard dosing is acceptable with routine renal monitoring. For eGFR 30–44, initiate at half the usual dose and titrate cautiously, with closer eGFR checks every 3–6 months. For eGFR < 30, discontinue and do not initiate. These steps align with KDIGO and AACE and reflect the pharmacokinetics and safety profile in CKD [^953eec6a] [^7d1f0b31]. I need to ensure I also address special situations: hold metformin peri-contrast when eGFR is 30–60, during acute illness with risk of hypoxia or dehydration, and around surgery or procedures with fasting, with a clear plan to restart once renal function stabilizes to avoid therapeutic inertia [^191d3848] [^304993af] [^609685f7].

> But wait, what about kidney transplant recipients and those with eGFR near 30? I should confirm the stance. KDIGO supports metformin in transplant recipients with eGFR ≥ 30, using the same principles, and some guidance allows case-by-case consideration of very low-dose metformin in stable stage 4 CKD with explicit counseling and monitoring, though this remains off-label and evidence-limited, so I should document shared decision-making if pursued [^e83ab58b] [^f1045941]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating approval below 30; the FDA label still contraindicates use below eGFR 30, so any use in that range should be exceptional and risk-mitigated rather than routine [^12be802f].

> I should also integrate metformin within the broader CKD treatment framework. In T2DM with CKD, first-line therapy is metformin plus an SGLT2 inhibitor when eGFR permits, with addition of a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist if glycemic targets are unmet or metformin/SGLT2 inhibitors are not tolerated, while also maximizing RAAS blockade and statins for cardiorenal protection, which is consistently endorsed by KDIGO and ADA/KDIGO consensus [^62aac289] [^69725d55] [^3a2b4cee]. Let me double-check that this aligns with outcome data: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce kidney failure and cardiovascular events independent of HbA1c, and GLP-1 RAs add glycemic and cardiovascular benefit with low hypoglycemia risk, supporting this layered approach in CKD [^3a2b4cee] [^bfc7d683].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical bottom line is precise. Metformin remains first-line in T2DM with CKD when eGFR is at least 30 mL/min/1.73 m², with dose reduction below 45 and discontinuation below 30, coupled with periodic renal function monitoring and situational holds during acute illness or procedures. While definitive renal-outcome RCTs are limited, observational data suggest potential slowing of CKD progression and mortality benefits, and metformin's favorable safety profile supports its continued foundational role alongside modern cardiorenal agents in appropriate patients [^e83ab58b] [^5f128656] [^6632d190] [^69725d55].

Metformin is **safe and recommended** for patients with CKD when eGFR is ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², with dose reduction at eGFR 30–44 and discontinuation if eGFR falls below 30 or during acute kidney injury risk states [^e83ab58b] [^953eec6a]. It is **not associated with increased lactic acidosis risk** in CKD stages 1–3 and offers cardiovascular and mortality benefits [^5f128656] [^d7cec300]. For eGFR 15–29, use is controversial and generally avoided; if considered, use low doses with close monitoring. Always reassess renal function before initiation and during therapy, and hold metformin peri-contrast or during acute illness [^191d3848] [^304993af].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action

Metformin is **renally cleared** and accumulates as eGFR declines, increasing lactic acidosis risk in advanced CKD [^5f128656]. It reduces hepatic glucose production, increases insulin sensitivity, and has anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects that may slow CKD progression [^3753b510].

---

## Clinical evidence for metformin use in CKD

### Safety and efficacy in mild to moderate CKD (stages 1–3)

- **Safety**: Metformin is safe in CKD stages 1–3 (eGFR ≥ 30) with no significant increase in lactic acidosis [^5f128656] [^44288f6b].
- **Efficacy**: Reduces all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, and may slow CKD progression [^d7cec300] [^6632d190].
- **Guidelines**: KDIGO and ADA recommend metformin as first-line therapy in T2DM with CKD when eGFR ≥ 30 [^e83ab58b] [^43f95899].

---

### Controversy in advanced CKD (stages 4–5)

- **Risk**: Lactic acidosis risk rises as eGFR falls below 30; evidence is limited and mixed [^5f128656] [^405d8f5f].
- **Observational data**: Some studies suggest mortality benefit even in advanced CKD, but confounding is likely [^6632d190] [^ad4869cb].
- **Current stance**: Most guidelines advise against use when eGFR < 30; if considered, use low doses with close monitoring [^e83ab58b] [^f1045941].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

| **Guideline** | **Egfre threshold for metformin use** | **Recommendations** |
|-|-|-|
| KDIGO 2020 | ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² | Initiate or continue metformin; dose reduce if eGFR 30–44; discontinue if < 30 [^e83ab58b] [^953eec6a] |
| ADA 2025 | ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² | First-line therapy in T2DM with CKD; monitor renal function regularly [^191d3848] |
| AACE 2022 | ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² | Contraindicated if < 30; dose reduce if 30–44 [^7d1f0b31] |

---

## Risks and benefits

### Benefits

Benefits include **improved glycemic control** with low hypoglycemia risk, **cardiovascular benefits** — reduced mortality and cardiovascular events [^d7cec300] — and potential **renoprotective effects**, with possible slowing of CKD progression [^f2cb5342].

---

### Risks

Risks include **lactic acidosis**, which is rare but increases as eGFR declines below 30 [^5f128656], and **gastrointestinal intolerance**, which is common but usually mild [^f2cb5342].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Baseline assessment**: Check eGFR before starting metformin and monitor at least annually, or every 3–6 months if eGFR < 60 [^953eec6a] [^d7699c4a].
- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce dose by 50% when eGFR 30–44; discontinue if eGFR < 30 [^953eec6a] [^d7699c4a].
- **Temporary discontinuation**: Hold during acute illness, dehydration, or before iodinated contrast if eGFR 30–60 [^191d3848] [^304993af].
- **Patient education**: Teach patients to stop metformin and seek care if they develop vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration [^aef101fb].

---

## Special considerations

- **Dialysis**: Metformin is generally contraindicated in dialysis; if used, extreme caution and low doses are advised [^e83ab58b] [^f1045941].
- **Transplant**: Can be used if eGFR ≥ 30 with close monitoring [^e83ab58b] [^bf98f525].
- **Combination therapy**: Often used with SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for added cardiorenal benefit [^62aac289] [^3a2b4cee].

---

Metformin is **safe and beneficial in CKD stages 1–3** (eGFR ≥ 30) and should be first-line in T2DM with CKD. Use is generally avoided in stages 4–5; if considered, apply low doses with close monitoring. Regular renal function checks and patient education are essential to safe use.

### Metformin for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease [^f2cb5342]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin has been used in the management of diabetes for decades. It is an effective, low-cost intervention with a well-established safety profile. Emerging evidence suggests that metformin targets a number of pathways that lead to chronic kidney damage, and long-term use may, therefore, slow the rate of kidney function decline and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of metformin therapy on kidney function decline in patients with CKD with or without diabetes mellitus and assess the safety and dose tolerability in this population.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 19 July 2023 with assistance from an Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported kidney-related outcomes with a minimum duration of 12 months delivery of the metformin intervention and whose eligibility criteria included adult participants with either i) a diagnosis of CKD of any aetiology and/or ii) those with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Comparisons included placebo, no intervention, non-pharmacological interventions, other antidiabetic medications or any other active control. Studies that included patients on any modality of kidney replacement therapy were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently carried out data extraction using a standard data extraction form. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

This review included 11 studies reporting on 8449 randomised participants. Studies were conducted in patient populations with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) (four studies) or diabetes mellitus (seven studies). Six studies compared metformin with no active control, four studies compared metformin with active controls (rosiglitazone, glyburide, pioglitazone, or glipizide), and one study included treatment arms that randomised to either metformin, diet and lifestyle modifications, or other antidiabetic therapies. The risk of bias in included studies varied; two studies were abstract-only publications and were judged to have a high risk of bias in most domains. Other included publications were judged to have a low risk of bias in most domains. Across comparisons, GRADE evaluations for most outcomes were judged as low or very low certainty, except for those relating to side effects, tolerance, and withdrawals, which were judged as moderate certainty. The evidence suggests that compared to placebo, metformin may result in i) a slightly smaller decline in kidney function (3 studies, 505 participants: MD 1.92 mL/min, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.51; I² = 0%; low certainty), ii) very uncertain effects on the incidence of kidney failure (1 study, 753 participants: RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.17 to 8.49), iii) little or no effect on death (3 studies, 865 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.32; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), iv) little or no effect on the incidence of serious adverse events (3 studies, 576 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.72; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), and v) likely higher incidence of intolerance leading to study withdrawal than placebo (4 studies, 646 participants: RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.27; I² = 0%; moderate certainty). The certainty of the evidence for proteinuria was very uncertain. Compared to other active controls (rosiglitazone, glyburide, pioglitazone, or glipizide), metformin i) demonstrated very uncertain effects on kidney function decline, ii) may result in little or no difference in death (3 studies, 5608 participants: RR 0.95 95% CI 0.63 to 1.43; I² = 0%; low certainty), iii) probably results in little or no difference in intolerance leading to study withdrawal (3 studies, 5593 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.08; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), iv) probably results in little or no difference in the incidence of serious adverse events (2 studies, 5545 participants: RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.71; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), and v) may increase the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (2 studies, 3836 participants: MD 14.61, 95% CI 8.17 to 21.05; I² = 0%; low certainty). No studies reported the incidence of kidney failure.

Authors' Conclusions

This review highlights the lack of RCTs reporting on the effects of metformin on kidney function, particularly in patients with CKD. Future research in this field requires adequately powered RCTs comparing metformin to placebo or standard care in those with CKD. Seven ongoing studies were identified in this review, and future updates, including their findings, may further inform the results of this review.

### Could metformin be used in patients with diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease? [^25b305f9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes is an important cause of end stage renal failure worldwide. As renal impairment progresses, managing hyperglycaemia can prove increasingly challenging, as many medications are contra-indicated in moderate to severe renal impairment. Whilst evidence for tight glycaemic control reducing progression to renal failure in patients with established renal disease is limited, poor glycaemic control is not desirable, and is likely to lead to progressive complications. Metformin is a first-line therapy in patients with Type 2 diabetes, as it appears to be effective in reducing diabetes related end points and mortality in overweight patients. Cessation of metformin in patients with progressive renal disease may not only lead to deterioration in glucose control, but also to loss of protection from cardiovascular disease in a cohort of patients at particularly high risk. We advocate the need for further study to determine the role of metformin in patients with severe renal disease (chronic kidney disease stage 4–5), as well as patients on dialysis, or pre-/peri-renal transplantation. We explore possible roles of metformin in these circumstances, and suggest potential key areas for further study.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, metformin, ERBP 2015 guidelines recommend to initiate metformin in a dose adapted to renal function as a first-line agent when lifestyle measures alone are insufficient to get HbA1c in the desired range.

### The treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with chronic kidney disease: what to expect from new oral hypoglycemic agents [^72f197ea]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Worldwide, an estimated 200 million people have chronic kidney disease (CKD), whose most common causes include hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and diabetes. About 40% of patients with diabetes develop CKD and intensive blood glucose control through pharmacological intervention can delay CKD progression. Standard therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus include metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. While these drugs have an important role in the management of type 2 diabetes, only the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone can be used across the spectrum of CKD (stages 2–5) and without dose adjustment. Newer therapies, particularly dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, are increasingly being used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes; however, a major consideration is whether these newer therapies can also be used safely and effectively across the spectrum of renal impairment.

### The impact of metformin on kidney disease progression and mortality in diabetic patients using SGLT2 inhibitors: a real-world cohort study [^6ed878e2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are the leading causes of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and significantly contribute to ongoing morbidity. For the past two decades, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has recommended metformin as the first-line therapy for T2D, owing to its efficacy, affordability, weight neutrality, and benefits in cardiovascular outcomes as well as its potential role in slowing kidney disease progression. However, the latest 2022 consensus on Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease, joint issued by ADA and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), also advocates for the inclusion of sodium-glucose -cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in all diabetes patients as part of the comprehensive approach to managing glucose levels and reducing cardiovascular and renovascular risk. Specifically, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors is recommended for all T2D patients with diabetic kidney disease and an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) above 20 ml/min/1.73 m 2, to mitigate CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events, regardless of baseline HbA1c, or metformin use. These recommendations are particularly crucial for patients with multiple atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors, established ASCVD, or diabetic kidney disease.

Substantial evidence indicates that inadequate glycemic control within the initial years following T2D diagnosis is strongly correlated with a higher risk of future microvascular and macrovascular complications, as well as increased mortality. This "glycemic legacy" effect, consistently observed in both randomized controlled trials and real-world observational studies, underscores the critical importance of selecting first-line medications or combination therapies for T2D that not only optimize glycemic control but also provide significant cardiovascular and renal protective benefits.

In recent years, accumulating data has reinforced the benefits of metformin in improving cardiovascular and renal outcomes, even in patients with progressive CKD and eGFR levels below 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Nevertheless the 2022 joint ADA and KDIGO guidelines, while recognizing metformin's superior efficacy in glycemia control, highlight a reduced efficacy in cardiovascular and renal protection when compared with SGLT2 inhibitors. Whether metformin offers additional renal protection and survival benefits when combined with SGLT2 inhibitors remains uncertain.

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the real-world impact of a combined metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors regimen, compared to treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors alone, on renal progression outcomes and all-cause mortality in T2D patients.

### Metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease: a systematic review [^5f128656]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Metformin is widely viewed as the best initial pharmacological option to lower glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the drug is contraindicated in many individuals with impaired kidney function because of concerns of lactic acidosis.

Objective

To assess the risk of lactic acidosis associated with metformin use in individuals with impaired kidney function.

Evidence Acquisition

In July 2014, we searched the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases for English-language articles pertaining to metformin, kidney disease, and lactic acidosis in humans between 1950 and June 2014. We excluded reviews, letters, editorials, case reports, small case series, and manuscripts that did not directly pertain to the topic area or that met other exclusion criteria. Of an original 818 articles, 65 were included in this review, including pharmacokinetic/metabolic studies, large case series, retrospective studies, meta-analyses, and a clinical trial.

Results

Although metformin is renally cleared, drug levels generally remain within the therapeutic range and lactate concentrations are not substantially increased when used in patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rates, 30–60 mL/min per 1.73 m2). The overall incidence of lactic acidosis in metformin users varies across studies from approximately 3 per 100,000 person-years to 10 per 100,000 person-years and is generally indistinguishable from the background rate in the overall population with diabetes. Data suggesting an increased risk of lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients with chronic kidney disease are limited, and no randomized controlled trials have been conducted to test the safety of metformin in patients with significantly impaired kidney function. Population-based studies demonstrate that metformin may be prescribed counter to prevailing guidelines suggesting a renal risk in up to 1 in 4 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus — use which, in most reports, has not been associated with increased rates of lactic acidosis. Observational studies suggest a potential benefit from metformin on macrovascular outcomes, even in patients with prevalent renal contraindications for its use.

Conclusions and Relevance

Available evidence supports cautious expansion of metformin use in patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease, as defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate, with appropriate dosage reductions and careful follow-up of kidney function.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease — glycemic management and cardiovascular risk: Emerging data indicate that intensive glycemic control reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and death, with benefits primarily in long-term intensive glycemia management; in type 2 diabetes, insulin‑sensitizing agents may be beneficial for reducing CVD event rates, although prospective controlled trials should confirm these observations. Observational signals include that pioglitazone may reduce all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke in type 2 diabetes, and metformin use was associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction and death in people with type 2 diabetes; however, caution is advised with use of metformin in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although studies regarding intensive glycemic control and CVD in people with diabetes and CKD are nonexistent, patients with diabetes and CKD should strive to achieve glucose control as close to normal as possible without excessive episodes of hypoglycemia.

The FDA states that metformin is contraindicated with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, eGFR should be monitored while taking metformin, benefits and risks should be reassessed when eGFR falls to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, metformin should not be initiated if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and it should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or before iodinated contrast imaging when eGFR is 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Table 1
Proposed recommendations for use of metformin based on eGFR

Without question, such a treatment program could not be implemented without meticulous clinical follow-up, clear communication with patients regarding risks and benefits of therapy, and adherence to frequent monitoring. The plan, therefore, should be modified in patients with suboptimal adherence to medical instructions or regular follow-up. It is clear that vigilance would be required so that cases of lactic acidosis do not emerge because of inappropriate use of metformin in patients with more advanced and/or unstable CKD.

Given the frequency with which clinicians must decide whether to continue or initiate metformin in mild-to-moderate CKD, these recommendations would have a profound impact on clinical practice. Such proposals, being consistent with the sentiments of several well-respected national guideline committees, should be reviewed by professional medical organizations in the U.S. such as the American Diabetes Association. If a consensus emerges, perhaps the Food and Drug Administration might reconsider the current metformin-prescribing guidelines, which, like those of other nonbranded compounds, tend to remain static despite emerging evidence and changes in clinical care.

In the future, more research in this important area is needed, including prospective, randomized trials of metformin at varying degrees of renal impairment and/or closer examination of registries of CKD patients receiving metformin.

3 METFORMIN IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

3.1 Kidney disease markedly increases CV risk in patients with type 2 diabetes

A recent study in 687 732 patients with type 2 diabetes showed that 18% had a first adverse cardiorenal event during 4 years of follow‐up. 28 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) accounted for 36% of these events, and was the earliest and most common CV complication of diabetes in this population. Moreover, the appearance of CKD was associated with a 1.8‐fold increase in the risk of all‐cause or CV death. Other data from the nationally representative US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) confirm the severe adverse impact of a diagnosis of CKD on clinical outcomes in people with diabetes. 29 In this cohort, the age‐standardized mortality rate was only 4.1% higher for people with type 2 diabetes without CKD than for controls without either condition. However, the difference from the control group in age‐standardized mortality increased by 17.8% where albuminuria was present, by 23.9% where glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was abnormal, and by 47.0% where subjects had both albuminuria and abnormal GFR. Thus, the excess mortality associated with diabetes was mostly accounted for by people with CKD.

3.2 Renal safety of metformin

Intensive glycaemic control per se is widely considered to reduce the risk of end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) in type 2 diabetes, largely on the basis of a 65% reduction in this outcome in patients randomized to intensive versus standard blood glucose control policies in the ADVANCE trial (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.83, P = 0.01). 30 However, it should be noted that the confidence intervals are wide, as even in this large trial with 11 140 patients randomized, there were only 27 events over 5 years of follow‐up. 30

Metformin was contraindicated in people with CKD (estimated GFR [eGFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2) for many years, however, with the intention of mitigating a perceived association between the use of metformin and an increased risk of lactic acidosis. Metformin increases serum lactate levels modestly with serum lactate concentrations usually remaining well within the normal range. 31 However, as metformin is excreted unchanged via the kidney, 32 a cautious approach to labelling of metformin has been adopted in the setting of CKD by international regulators in order to reduce the potential for accumulation and the possibility of developing lactic acidosis.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes: guidelines from KDIGO… [^0099d2ad]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Structured diabetes self-management education programs are recommended because they improve self-efficacy and clinical outcomes.
- First-line antiglycemic treatment for type 2 diabetes and CKD with eGFR as low as 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 should include metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor to improve cardiovascular outcomes and limit CKD progression. Glycemic Treatment For people with type 2 diabetes and CKD with an eGFR 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 or higher, metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, in combination, are recommended for first-line medical treatment because they improve glycemic control outcomes. Metformin limits weight gain and reduces cardiovascular events, whereas the SGLT2 inhibitor improves cardiovascular outcomes and limits kidney disease progression. Metformin is safe in patients with an eGFR above 45 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 unless risk for acute kidney injury is high.

The dose of metformin should be reduced when eGFR is less than 45 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 and discontinued when eGFR is less than 30 mL per minute per

1. 73 m 2 or in people treated with dialysis. The guidelines recommend treatment with a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not achieved glycemic goals despite use of metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor or who are unable to use those medications. Some of the GLP-1 receptor agonists have a beneficial effect in reducing cardiovascular events. GLP-1 receptor agonist trials are safe with an eGFR as low as 15 mL per minute per 1. 73 m. Medications should be reduced or discontinued for symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia, creatinine increase of greater than 30%, or acute kidney injury. Combination therapy with ACE inhibitors and ARBs may be harmful and should be avoided.

Women prescribed an ACE inhibitor or an ARB should be offered contraceptive advice because of adverse fetal and neonatal effects, especially during the second and third trimesters. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as spironolactone and eplerenone are useful for resistant hypertension and are being studied in trials evaluating CKD and CVD outcomes.

### Metformin use and mortality in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: national, retrospective, observational, cohort study [^405d8f5f]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin is recommended as a first-line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes. However, use of this drug has been contraindicated in individuals with impaired kidney function because of the perceived risk of lactic acidosis. Evidence now supports cautious use of metformin in people with mild-to-moderate chronic kidney disease. However, studies examining the use of metformin in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease are lacking. We aimed to assess the safety of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced (approximately stage 5) chronic kidney disease.

Methods

We did a retrospective, observational, cohort study of patients with type 2 diabetes who were enrolled prospectively in Taiwan's national health insurance research database between Jan 1, 2000, and June 30, 2009, and had follow-up data until Dec 31, 2009. We included individuals with a serum creatinine concentration greater than 530 μmol/L, which is approximately equivalent to stage 5 chronic kidney disease. From a consecutive sample of 12350 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, 1005 used metformin and 11345 were non-users. We matched users and non-users of metformin by propensity score in a 1:3 ratio. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality.

Findings

813 metformin users were matched by propensity score to 2439 non-users. The two groups of patients did not differ significantly by 30 baseline clinical and socioeconomic variables. Median follow-up in the matched cohort was 2·1 years (range 0·3–9·8). All-cause mortality was reported in 434 (53%) of 813 metformin users and in 1012 (41%) of 2439 non-users. After multivariate adjustment, metformin use was an independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1·35, 95% CI 1·20–1·51; p < 0·0001). The increased mortality risk was dose-dependent and was consistent across all subgroup analyses. However, metformin use compared with no use was associated with a higher but non-significant risk of metabolic acidosis (1·6 vs 1·3 events per 100 patient-years; adjusted hazard ratio 1·30, 95% CI 0·88–1·93; p = 0·19).

Interpretation

Use of metformin in people with type 2 diabetes and a serum creatinine concentration greater than 530 μmol/L is associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with non-users. Metformin use should not be encouraged in this patient group.

Metformin has been used as a first‐line oral drug for people with type 2 diabetes for over 60 years. The dose of metformin should be decreased to 500 mg twice a day if eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and omitted in the majority of circumstances if eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Of note limitations of eGFR measurements need to be appreciated especially in those at extremes of body weight and individualised treatment decisions may need to be considered in people with eGFR 25–30 mL/min/1.73m 2.

The guidelines acknowledge that there is a lack of high‐quality clinical trial evidence for the use of metformin as a cardio‐renal protective agent in people with CKD but in most countries worldwide it remains the most widely used first‐line agent for type 2 diabetes.

### Metformin in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: experimental hypothesis or clinical fact? [^f9ba934c]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) accounts for 8–10% of end-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients worldwide. In the last decade, the advanced knowledge in genetics and molecular pathobiology of ADPKD focused some aberrant molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of the disease leading to controlled clinical trials aimed to delay its progression with the use of mTOR inhibitors, somatostatin or tolvaptan. Preclinical studies suggests an effective role of metformin in ADPKD treatment by activating AMPK sensor. Clinical trials are currently recruiting participants to test the metformin use in ADPKD patients.

Methods

We retrospectively examined the records of our ADPKD patients, selecting 7 diabetic ADPKD patients under metformin treatment and 7 matched non-diabetic ADPKD controls, to test the effect of metformin on renal progression during a 3 year follow-up.

Results

During the first year, the GFR decreased by 2.5% in Metformin Group and by 16% in Controls; thereafter, renal function remained stable in Metformin Group and further decreased in Controls, reaching a 50% difference after 3 years of observation. Accordingly, the overall crude loss of GFR, estimated by a linear mixed model, resulted slower in the Metformin than in Control Group (− 0.9; 95% C. I.: -2.7 to 0.9 vs - 5.0; 95% C. I.: -6.8 to − 3.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year, p = 0.002).

Conclusions

Our data are suggestive of a beneficial effect of metformin on progression of ADPKD. Large, randomized, prospective trials are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

### How to individualize renoprotective therapy in obese patients with chronic kidney disease: a commentary by the diabesity working group of the ERA [^d5bd6be2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

LESSONS FROM 2022 (DKD) AND 2024 (CKD) KDIGO GUIDELINES: WHAT ROLE DO GLP-1RAS PLAY IN THE KDIGO CKD GUIDELINES?

Published in 2022, the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guidelines for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease provided recommendations for non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions in patients with diabetes and CKD. Following lifestyle measures, and with some specific considerations regarding remaining/residual kidney function, the KDIGO guidelines emphasized that the first-line pharmacological treatments for patients with kidney disease associated with T2DM should include metformin, SGLT2is, RAASis, ACEis or ARBs and statins.

At the time of guideline publication in the pre-FLOW trial era, GLP-1RAs remained a second-line option that may be a preferred treatment for patients with T2DM and CKD at high risk for cardiovascular events, with residual albuminuria or in need of intensification of glycaemic control or assistance with intentional weight loss efforts. The guidelines appropriately delineated the common side effects of GLP-1RAs, which are predominantly GI and largely dose dependent. To minimize GI side effects, it is advised to slowly up-titrate GLP-1RAs. Injection site reactions are also recognized with subcutaneous formulations of these drugs. The risk of hypoglycaemia is low, but attention to concomitant glucose-lowering therapies with a higher propensity for hypoglycaemia (insulin, sulphonylureas) is critical when starting GLP-1RAs, particularly in patients with CKD. Guidelines do not support combining dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors with GLP-1RAs due to a lack of additional clinical benefit.

The KDIGO 2024 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease was published in April 2024. At the time of publication, the FLOW trial had not yet been published. Therefore, available information regarding the use of GLP-1RAs in patients with DKD was not substantially different from when the 2022 diabetes and CKD update was published.

In view of the FLOW trial, GLP-1RAs will be front and centre alongside RAASis, SGLT2is and nsMRAs as the four pillars for cardiovascular and kidney protection in future CKD guidelines.

### Should restrictions Be relaxed for metformin use in chronic kidney disease? No, we should never again compromise safety! [^19686943]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Metformin is and has been considered as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes for over a quarter of a century. Like other biguanides, metformin can cause a lactic acidosis that is exceptionally rare but fatal. The likelihood of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is substantially higher in patients with kidney impairment and also among those with seemingly normal kidney function who are at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Hence, regulatory agencies in many industrialized nations have maintained strict renal restrictions surrounding metformin. However, there have been millions of people exposed to metformin for many years, many of them with serum creatinine values at or close to 1.5 mg/dL with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) much below 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) who have not developed lactic acidosis. Thus, there clearly remains controversy in this area, and there has been heightened pressure to remove the renal restrictions of metformin. To provide a discussion on the pros and cons of relaxing the renal restrictions for metformin use, we provide a Point-Counterpoint. In the point narrative below, Drs. Kalantar-Zadeh and Kovesdy provide their argument that although there is little evidence of the potential benefits of metformin in kidney disease, just considering the sheer numbers of metformin users and the high fatality rate of its associated lactic acidosis, the most appropriate practice is to avoid metformin use in people with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or in those who are at high risk of AKI irrespective of underlying eGFR. In the following counterpoint narrative, Drs. Bakris and Molitch argue that the data from a very large analysis demonstrate clearly that serum creatinine should be supplanted with eGFR as the criteria for metformin use and that the incidence of lactic acidosis is only elevated in those with a reduced eGFR who become dehydrated for various reasons or in those exposed to some toxin resulting in AKI. Otherwise the data clearly support the use of metformin under normal circumstances down to eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)-William T. CefaluEditor in Chief, Diabetes Care.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis: moving towards a new paradigm? [^205e46ce]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Recent publications 7, 8 have advocated broadening the use of metformin in patients with more advanced CKD, including patients on dialysis and/or awaiting renal transplant. Treatment options for these patients are limited, and metformin has generally not been widely used for the reasons stated earlier. Although these publications acknowledge the need for controlled clinical trial data, which is currently lacking, they propose that patients with advanced renal disease could be treated with lower doses of metformin to improve glycaemic control without excessive plasma accumulation. Dose reduction in renally impaired patients is a common strategy for renally cleared drugs that act systemically, and while such a strategy would probably result in acceptable exposure in the context of safety, the relationship between metformin plasma exposure and efficacy is not that simple. There is increasing evidence that a substantial contribution to the glycaemic effect of metformin is mediated through the intestine rather than primarily through systemic exposure. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Given that the bioavailability of metformin increases with decreasing dose, 14 it is unlikely that the low doses of metformin required to maintain acceptable plasma concentrations would deliver sufficient metformin to the intestine to leverage the gut‐based mechanisms of action. 15

In summary, classification of LA in metformin‐treated patients should acknowledge the complexity of the contributing factors and weigh the potential roles of both metformin accumulation and underlying hypoxic diseases/conditions based on all the information available. This is particularly important in patients at inherently higher risk of MALA, such as the elderly and those with advanced CKD.

### Comparative effectiveness of incident oral antidiabetic drugs on kidney function [^dff86855]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a major cause of chronic kidney disease, and oral antidiabetic drugs are the mainstay of therapy for most patients with Type 2 diabetes. Here we evaluated their role on renal outcomes by using a national Veterans Administration database to assemble a retrospective cohort of 93,577 diabetic patients who filled an incident oral antidiabetic drug prescription for metformin, sulfonylurea, or rosiglitazone, and had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 60 ml/min or better. The primary composite outcome was a persistent decline in eGFR from baseline of 25% or more (eGFR event) or a diagnosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The secondary outcome was an eGFR event, ESRD, or death. Sensitivity analyses included using a more stringent definition of the eGFR event requiring an eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 in addition to the 25% or more decline; controlling for baseline proteinuria thereby restricting data to 15,065 patients; and not requiring persistent treatment with the initial oral antidiabetic drug. Compared to patients using metformin, sulfonylurea users had an increased risk for both the primary and the secondary outcome, each with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.20. Results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main findings. The risk associated with rosiglitazone was similar to metformin for both outcomes. Thus, compared to metformin, oral antidiabetic drug treatment with sulfonylureas increased the risk of a decline in eGFR, ESRD, or death.

### The impact of metformin on kidney disease progression and mortality in diabetic patients using SGLT2 inhibitors: a real-world cohort study [^3753b510]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Beyond its anti-glycemic effects and role in achieving tight glucose control in the early stages following diabetes diagnosis, experimental studies indicate that metformin may exert antifibrotic effects, offering potential benefits for kidney and cardiovascular health independently of its direct glycemic impact. CKD is now assumed to be a process involving glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, driven by the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, regardless of the underlying cause. Metformin may mitigate this process by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and downregulating transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), as well as by AMP-independent mechanisms including the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduction of oxidative stress, and inhibition of apoptosis. Various animal models have highlighted metformin's potential in improving both diabetic and non-diabetic CKD through these pleotropic mechanisms.

While metformin has been associated with cardioprotective and nephroprotective effects, recent large-scale, high quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have highlighted the superior cardiovascular and renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors compared with all other treatments for T2D. Collectively, these landmark trials have influenced recent guidelines updates, repositioning SGLT2 inhibitors as a recommended second-line therapy after metformin or as first-line option in patients with ASCVD, CKD, heart failure or high/very high cardiovascular risk. Given that significant proportion of patients with newly diagnosed T2D are likely to develop ASCVD and renal complications in the future, there is pressing question whether a combined first-line therapy of metformin and SGLT2i might be beneficial to maximize the therapeutic advantages of both medications.

In the current study, we demonstrated that patients treated with a combination of metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors have significantly lower risk of mortality and kidney disease progression compared to those treated with SGLT2 inhibitors alone. Notably, we defined kidney disease progression based on stringent criteria including a decline in eGFR by at least 40% or the development of ESRD. Even after a thorough PSM with adjustment for multiple covariates and validation through several sensitivity analyses, the addition of metformin to SGLT2 inhibitors therapy was associated with a nearly 33% reduction in the risk of kidney disease progression and almost 30% reduction in all-cause mortality. This risk reduction remained consistent across all patient subgroups, regardless of age, sex, CKD stage, glycemic control or other risk factors and comorbidities.

People with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for kidney failure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and premature mortality. Recent clinical trials support new approaches to treat diabetes and CKD. The 2022 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease each provide evidence-based recommendations for management. A joint group of ADA and KDIGO representatives reviewed and developed a series of consensus statements to guide clinical care from the ADA and KDIGO guidelines. The published guidelines are aligned in the areas of CKD screening and diagnosis, glycemia monitoring, lifestyle therapies, treatment goals, and pharmacologic management. Recommendations include comprehensive care in which pharmacotherapy that is proven to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes is layered on a foundation of healthy lifestyle. Consensus statements provide specific guidance on use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, and a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. These areas of consensus provide clear direction for implementation of care to improve clinical outcomes of people with diabetes and CKD.

Guideline-Directed Care for the Treatment of People With CKD and T2D

Historical Stepwise Approach

A linear or stepwise approach involving the initiation of one drug after the other on the basis of efficacy and tolerability has been the traditional approach to the pharmacologic management of CKD in people with T2D. Advantages of this approach were simplicity, easy identification of drug-related side effects, and the potential for a lower pill burden. However, this approach may delay introduction of important medications and may not be beneficial for individuals at high risk of CKD progression.

Following a diabetes diagnosis, first-line monotherapy with metformin may be initiated, followed by sequential treatment intensification targeting an HbA1c level < 7.0%. In people with T2D and CKD or severely elevated HbA1c, the American Diabetes Association recommends simultaneous initiation of metformin and an SGLT2i. Individuals with an elevated HbA1c (> 8.0%) may require many months or years to achieve target glycemic levels and will be at risk of ensuing complications because any duration of glycemic control improves long-term clinical outcomes, particularly if sustained control is implemented early. In addition, this approach can encourage a cycle of treatment failure from delayed treatment advancement (therapeutic inertia). A study of 5239 people with newly diagnosed T2D treated with metformin found that the median time until the next intervention was approximately 14 months, with 38% of people with an HbA1c level > 7%, 31% with an HbA1c level > 7.5%, and 28% with an HbA1c level > 8% not receiving an intervention within 6 months of an elevated HbA1c level.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in chronic kidney disease [^958fbedd]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

The management of patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) encompasses lifestyle modifications, glycemic control with individualized HbA1c targets, and cardiovascular disease risk reduction. Metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors are first-line agents. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are second-line agents. The use of other antidiabetic agents should consider patient preferences, comorbidities, drug costs, and the risk of hypoglycemia. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors are strongly recommended for patients with diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria. Non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which pose less risk of hyperkalemia than steroidal agents, are undergoing further evaluation among patients with diabetic kidney disease. Here, we discuss important advancements in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors with and without metformin: a meta-analysis of cardiovascular, kidney and mortality outcomes [^88ce3874]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Almost all clinical practice guidelines recommend metformin as first‐line pharmacotherapy for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In light of clear evidence of benefit for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in large‐scale randomized trials of sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, 1, 2 these agents are now recommended as the preferred second‐line therapy in people who do not achieve sufficient glucose control on metformin alone, particularly for those with heart failure or chronic kidney disease. 3

The central role of metformin in clinical practice recommendations is based largely on its tolerability, effects on body weight and low cost, as well as the beneficial effects on myocardial infarction and mortality outcomes demonstrated in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). 4 However, that study was conducted over two decades ago, prior to the widespread use of renin‐angiotensin system blockade, statins, and other cardioprotective therapies, therefore, direct comparisons with treatment effects observed in contemporary cardiovascular outcome trials of newer glucose‐lowering agents are challenging. Nevertheless, meta‐analyses of randomized trials have not demonstrated clear benefits with metformin for cardiovascular outcomes in people with T2DM, with very limited data on effects on kidney outcomes. 5, 6, 7 In the context of robust evidence of benefit with SGLT2 inhibitors (and glucagon‐like‐peptide‐1 receptor agonists), there have been some calls for a reappraisal of the role of metformin as the first‐line oral pharmacotherapy for all patients with T2DM. 8

New guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology, developed in collaboration with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors be used in patients with T2DM who are at high or very high cardiovascular risk, irrespective of whether they are treatment‐naïve or already receiving metformin. 9 Whether the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular, kidney and mortality outcomes are consistent when used with versus without metformin is uncertain.

We therefore conducted a meta‐analysis of the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular, kidney and mortality outcomes by baseline metformin use, hypothesizing that the benefits of treatment for clinical outcomes would be similar regardless of metformin use.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^3a2b4cee]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

### Metformin and other antidiabetic agents in renal failure patients [^94de4a0e]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

This review mainly focuses on metformin, and considers oral antidiabetic therapy in kidney transplant patients and the potential benefits and risks of antidiabetic agents other than metformin in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In view of the debate concerning lactic acidosis associated with metformin, this review tries to solve a paradox: metformin should be prescribed more widely because of its beneficial effects, but also less widely because of the increasing prevalence of contraindications to metformin, such as reduced renal function. Lactic acidosis appears either as part of a number of clinical syndromes (i.e., unrelated to metformin), induced by metformin (involving an analysis of the drug's pharmacokinetics and mechanisms of action), or associated with metformin (a more complex situation, as lactic acidosis in a metformin-treated patient is not necessarily accompanied by metformin accumulation, nor does metformin accumulation necessarily lead to lactic acidosis). A critical analysis of guidelines and literature data on metformin therapy in patients with CKD is presented. Following the present focus on metformin, new paradoxical issues can be drawn up, in particular: (i) metformin is rarely the sole cause of lactic acidosis; (ii) lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin therapy is erroneously still considered a single medical entity, as several different scenarios can be defined, with contrasting prognoses. The prognosis for severe lactic acidosis seems even better in metformin-treated patients than in non-metformin users.

Practice Point 2 — metformin-treated patients with chronic kidney disease — estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) monitoring and dose adjustment are specified as follows: "Monitor eGFR in patients treated with metformin. Increase the frequency of monitoring when eGFR is < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m^2". If "eGFR < 30", "Stop metformin; do not initiate metformin". For dose initiation at eGFR ≥ 60 or eGFR 45–59, immediate release may start with "Initial 500 mg or 850 mg once daily" and be "Titrate upwards by 500 mg/d or 850 mg/d every 7 days until maximum dose"; for gastrointestinal intolerance, extended release uses "Initial 500 mg daily" and "Titrate upwards by 500 mg/d every 7 days until maximum dose". For eGFR 30–44, "Initiate at half the dose and titrate upwards to half of maximum recommended dose". Vitamin B12 monitoring is "Annually if on metformin for more than 4 years or at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency". Kidney function monitoring intervals are "At least annually" or "At least every 3–6 months" depending on eGFR category. For subsequent dose adjustment, at eGFR ≥ 60 "Continue same dose"; at eGFR 45–59 "Continue same dose. Consider dose reduction in certain conditions (see text)"; and at eGFR 30–44 "Half the dose". The figure notes rationale for the practice point, including "Limited evidence to support the guidance" and "No systematic review was conducted".

### What next after metformin? Thinking beyond glycaemia: are SGLT2 inhibitors the answer? [^ebb992b2]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to increase, along with a proliferation of glucose-lowering treatment options. There is universal agreement in the clinical community for the use of metformin as the first-line glucose-lowering therapy for the majority of patients. However, controversy exists regarding the choice of second-line therapy once metformin is no longer effective. The most recent treatment consensus focuses on the presence of cardiovascular disease, heart failure or kidney disease as a determinant of therapy choice. The majority of patients in routine practice, however, do not fall into such categories. Heart failure and kidney disease represent significant clinical and cost considerations in patients with type 2 diabetes and have a close pathophysiological association. Recent data has illustrated that sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor therapy can reduce the burden of heart failure and the progression of renal disease across a wide range of patients including those with and without established disease, supported by an increased understanding of the mechanistic effects of these agents. Furthermore, there is growing evidence to illustrate the overall safety profile of this class of agents and support the benefit-risk profile of SGLT2 inhibitors as a preferred option following metformin monotherapy failure, with respect to both kidney disease progression and heart failure outcomes.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^9d517385]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

A common clinical conundrum faces all U.S. practitioners treating patients with type 2 diabetes. Today's U.S. Food and Drug Administration prescribing guidelines for metformin contraindicate its use in men and women with serum creatinine concentrations ≥ 1.5 and ≥ 1.4 mg/dL (≥ 132 and ≥ 123 µmol/L), respectively. In a patient tolerating and controlled with this medication, should it automatically be discontinued as the creatinine rises beyond these cut points over time? Stopping metformin often results in poorly controlled glycemia and/or the need for other agents with their own adverse-effect profiles. Moreover, is the now widespread use of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in lieu of serum creatinine levels creating even more confusion, especially in those with abnormalities in one but not the other indirect measure of renal function? Indeed, more than a decade and a half after metformin became available in the U.S. debate continues over the best approach in these settings. How many patients are unable to receive this medication on the basis of guidelines which, although well intentioned, are somewhat arbitrary and outdated based on modern assessments of renal status?

### Clinical outcomes of metformin use in populations with chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, or chronic liver disease: a systematic review [^ad4869cb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recent changes to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration boxed warning for metformin will increase its use in persons with historical contraindications or precautions. Prescribers must understand the clinical outcomes of metformin use in these populations.

Purpose

To synthesize data addressing outcomes of metformin use in populations with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD), congestive heart failure (CHF), or chronic liver disease (CLD) with hepatic impairment.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (via PubMed) from January 1994 to September 2016, and Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from January 1994 to November 2015.

Study Selection

English-language studies that: 1) examined adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD (with estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), CHF, or CLD with hepatic impairment; 2) compared diabetes regimens that included metformin with those that did not; and 3) reported all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and other outcomes of interest.

Data Extraction

2 reviewers abstracted data and independently rated study quality and strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

On the basis of quantitative and qualitative syntheses involving 17 observational studies, metformin use is associated with reduced all-cause mortality in patients with CKD, CHF, or CLD with hepatic impairment, and with fewer heart failure readmissions in patients with CKD or CHF.

Limitations

Strength of evidence was low, and data on multiple outcomes of interest were sparse. Available studies were observational and varied in follow-up duration.

Conclusion

Metformin use in patients with moderate CKD, CHF, or CLD with hepatic impairment is associated with improvements in key clinical outcomes. Our findings support the recent changes in metformin labeling.

2.3 Metformin

Metformin is eliminated by the kidneys and has historically been considered unsuitable for use in patients with advanced CKD because of concerns about development of lactic acidosis attributed to metformin accumulation. 31, 32 These concerns were largely based on case reports, and observational studies have not shown the predicted increase in the risk of metformin‐associated lactic acidosis. 33 Consequently, changes to recommendations for metformin use occurred in 2016 when the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relaxed its restrictions for metformin use in CKD following a review of the safety of this agent in patients with impairment of kidney function. 34 For patients with CKD, the guidance states that starting metformin in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30–45 mL/min/1.73m 2 is not recommended. For patients taking metformin whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73m 2, the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be evaluated, and metformin should be discontinued in patients whose eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73m 2. 34

Recent evidence suggests that low‐dose metformin (500 mg once‐daily) may be used in patients with an eGFR of 15–30 mL/min/1.73m 2, provided the dosage is adjusted on an individual patient basis and that the drug is stopped during acute illness. 35, 36 However, the FDA has not approved metformin use in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73m 2. 37

ERA AND KIDNEY DISEASE IMPROVING GLOBAL OUTCOMES (KDIGO) GUIDELINES

The first mention of SGLT2i was in the ERBP Clinical Practice Guideline on management of patients with diabetes and CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR < 45 ml/min), published in 2015. There, SGLT2i were used as anti-hyperglycaemic drugs. The recommendation of use for SGLT2i was for CKD stage 3B or less, but the authors mention a 'limited experience'. On this topic, this guideline is outdated and undergoing revision.

In 2019 the EURECA-m and the DIABESITY working groups of the ERA-EDTA made a consensus statement recommending that patients with T2DM and CKD, that are not on HbA1c target on recommended Metformin therapy or for whom Metformin is not tolerated or is contraindicated, to use SGLT2i with evidence for cardio and renal protection. Therefore, SGLT2i were historically recommended for patients with T2DM and CKD with eGFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 but above the licensed range who have either micro- or macro-albuminuria who do not achieve glycaemic targets under Metformin or do not tolerate Metformin. While these guidelines emphasized the role of SGLT2i in glycaemic control, we have moved to an era of SGLT2i for kidney protection rather than glycaemic control in isolation, and, in reality, the effect of SGLT2i on glycaemia is limited when eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2.

KDIGO published an updated guideline on Diabetes Management in CKD in 2022 in which it recommends a comprehensive treatment of patients with diabetes and CKD to reduce risks of kidney disease progression and CV disease. SGLT2i are now considered a first line drug for patients with T2DM and CKD. The target population for SGLT2i were people with T2DM and CKD who have eGFR ≥ 20 ml/min/1.73 m 2. The level of recommendation for the SGLT2 administration was '1A'.

### The role of vildagliptin in the therapy of type 2 diabetic patients with renal dysfunction [^aef101fb]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, intensive glucose control reduces not only the risk for microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria but it may also decrease the rate of decline of GFR.

Patients with diabetes of long duration more frequently present with multiple comorbidities, especially chronic renal disease. Although insulin therapy is widely used in patients with T2DM and renal failure, metabolic control is particularly difficult to achieve and manage because of the limited therapeutic options and the frequent comorbidities seen in this population.

Treatment goals should be individualized and not be prescriptive, accounting for the needs of each patient, as outlined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) position statement. Although metformin is the first-line treatment for glycemic control in patients with T2DM, there is a theoretical risk for lactic acidosis in patients with CKD, since metformin is excreted unchanged by the kidney. Thus, US prescribing guidelines contraindicate metformin in patients with moderate (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) to severe (< 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2) renal insufficiency for this reason. However, there is ongoing debate, and a recent critical review of the literature supports the safe use of appropriate doses of metformin in patients with chronic stable renal impairment. The recommendation from the ADA/EASD position paper is that metformin can be used down to an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, but the dose of metformin should be reduced when eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Kidney function should be checked regularly (every 6 months) and metformin should be discontinued if eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Metformin should be prescribed with caution in patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 which is rapidly deteriorating. All patients taking metformin should be warned that if they develop a condition that can lead to dehydration (e.g. vomiting or diarrhea), then they should stop metformin and seek medical advice. The risk for lactic acidosis is increased in such a scenario and applies irrespective of their baseline eGFR. It should be noted that metformin is part of some fixed-dose combinations, and the same risks apply.

However, note that failure to restart these medications after the event or procedure may lead to unintentional harm (see Practice Point 4.3.2)". Additional stewardship strategies are to "Educate and inform people with CKD regarding the expected benefits and possible risks of medications so that they can identify and report adverse events that can be managed" and to "Establish collaborative relationships with other healthcare providers and pharmacists and/or use tools to ensure and improve drug stewardship in people with CKD to enhance management of their complex medication regimens".

labeling strongly recommends against use of metformin in some patients whose kidneys do not work normally. We were asked1, 2 to review numerous medical studies regarding the safety of metformin use in patients with mild to moderate impairment in kidney function, 3–14 and to change the measure of kidney function in the metformin drug labeling. kidney damage, and heart disease. Metformin-containing medicines are available as single-ingredient products and also in combination with other drugs used to treat diabetes. The current drug labeling strongly recommends against metformin use in some patients whose kidneys do not work normally because use of metformin in these patients can increase the risk of developing a. serious and potentially deadly condition called lactic acidosis, in which too much lactic acid builds up in the blood.

We have concluded from the review of studies published in the medical literature that metformin can be used safely in patients with mild impairment in kidney function and in some patients with moderate impairment in kidney function. 3–6 We are requiring changes to the metformin labeling to reflect this new information and provide specific recommendations on the drug's use in patients with mild to moderate kidney impairment. We are also recommending that the measure of kidney function used to determine whether a patient can receive metformin be changed from one based on a single laboratory parameter to one that provides a better estimate of kidney function in patients with kidney disease (i.e., glomerular filtration rate. addition to blood creatinine concentration, the glomerular filtration rate takes into account additional parameters that are important, such as the patient's age, gender, race and/or weight.

- Before starting metformin, obtain the patient's eGFR.
- Metformin is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/minute/1. 73 m2. renal function should be assessed more frequently.
- In patients taking metformin whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1. 73 m2, assess the benefits and risks of continuing treatment. Discontinue metformin if the patient's eGFR later falls below 30 mL/minute/1. 73 m2.

Treatments for CKD in People Living with T2DM

Findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that improved renal outcomes can be achieved through obesity management, intensive glycemic control using glucose-lowering medications, and anti-hypertension drugs. A caveat of using these medications is that many have reduced renal clearance due to declining kidney function or are contraindicated and often require careful dose adjustments. Furthermore, several of these therapies have only a modest glucose-lowering effect in people with reduced glomerular filtration. For these reasons, limited treatment options exist for this patient population.

Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA), in conjunction with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and KDIGO provide clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in CKD. These guidelines recommend a comprehensive strategy be followed to reduce risks of CKD in people living with T2DM and are summarized in Fig. 2. In the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes — 2021, the ADA recommend that for people with indications of high risk or established CKD either a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) be considered as a treatment option, independently of metformin use. Guidelines provided by KDIGO similarly recommend SGLT2i for people with an eGFR of ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 due to the vascular and renal benefit, despite its modest effect on glucose control. The current KDIGO guidelines do not recommend SGLT2i for people in more advanced stages of CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2), as the efficacy for lowering glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is blunted. This is indicated in the label information for empagliflozin and canagliflozin, with both of these SGLT2i not recommended for individuals with an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. For dapagliflozin, recently updated prescribing information indicates that initiation of treatment with this SGLT2i is not recommended in individuals with an eGFR < 25 ml/min/1.73 m 2. In people with T2DM and CKD, who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets despite use of metformin and SGLT2i, or are unable to use those medications due to contraindications, long-acting GLP-1 RAs are recommended. The use of GLP-1 RAs in this population is not only due to the limited use of SLGT2i in more severe stages but also because the glycemic lowering efficacy of SLGT2i is reduced in individuals with moderate renal impairment and likely absent in those with severe renal impairment. These anti-hyperglycemic therapies have shown promise in directly improving renal outcomes and reducing CKD progression independently of glycemic control. The use of GLP-1 RAs is also associated with a low risk for hypoglycemia, which is a limiting factor for many other diabetes medications in people with renal impairment.

### Clinical outcomes following discontinuation of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease in hong kong: a territory-wide, retrospective cohort and target trial emulation study [^607b8142]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing global health challenge. In 2021, 10% of the world's population is affected by diabetes, which is one of the primary causes of CKD. The burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) also increases continuously as kidney function declines, and patients with both diabetes and CKD have an exceptionally high risk of CVD. Metformin is the first-line oral glucose-lowering drug (GLD) for individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Traditionally, metformin was contraindicated in patients with reduced kidney function due to the paucity of randomised controlled trial (RCT) data and early reports of lactic acidosis, primarily associated with phenformin. However, increasing real-world evidence supports its safety in patients with a broad range of kidney function. In 2016, the labelling of metformin was changed to include its use in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30–60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (CKD stage G3). In 2020, a consensus statement recommended continuing metformin at half maximum dose and increased frequency of eGFR monitoring in patients with eGFR of 30–44 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (CKD stage G3b) with its discontinuation when eGFR falls below 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2.

Use of metformin in CKD stage G4 (eGFR 15–29 ml/min/1.73 m 2) has been controversial. Metformin is renally cleared and the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) might be increased when eGFR fell below 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 as compared with preserved kidney function. In observational studies, the incidence rates of MALA varied from 3.0 to 138 per 100, 000 person-years amongst metformin users, though not necessarily higher than non-metformin treated controls. Discontinuation of metformin in patients with T2D was associated with increased glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 0.92–1.09%. The loss of insulin-sensitizing effects of metformin can be pronounced in patients with advanced CKD who are generally insulin-resistant due to uremia, obesity and chronic inflammation. Most patients who discontinued metformin required addition or intensification of alternative GLDs such as insulin, which is associated with weight gain, high-risk of hypoglycaemia and often multiple daily injections. Loss of putative anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of metformin may worsen cardiovascular-renal outcomes.

### The impact of metformin on kidney disease progression and mortality in diabetic patients using SGLT2 inhibitors: a real-world cohort study [^e888201e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study found that combination therapy with metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2D was associated with significantly improved survival rates and kidney disease outcomes, compared to treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors alone. We investigated the associations between metformin use and both kidney disease progression and mortality within a large cohort of 45,545 T2D patients over an extended follow-up period. After comprehensive propensity-score matching that included multiple covariates, we retained two well-matched groups of 6774 patients each. Compared to the regimen excluding metformin, the combined therapy of SGLT2 inhibitors plus metformin was associated with a significantly reduced risk of composite kidney disease outcome as well as all-cause mortality. The renal and survival benefits of metformin use remained robust after adjusting for established clinical and demographic risk factors. Furthermore, the therapy was associated with lower rates of adverse events, including hospitalizations, severe AKI episodes, and metabolic acidosis.

CKD is highly prevalent among patients with T2D, affecting up to 61% of U.S. diabetic patients aged 65 years and older. Since its approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (UAS-FDA) in 1994, metformin has been the recommended first-line therapy for T2D. Metformin is a biguanide diabetic drug that reduce hepatic glucose production and intestinal glucose absorption while enhancing insulin sensitivity, making it a preferred treatment for T2D owing to its efficacy, affordability, and favorable safety profile. Research indicates that beyond glycemic control, metformin is associated with improved cardiovascular, and survival outcomes in patients with T2D. The FDA initially recommended against the use of metformin in patients with serum creatinine levels above 1.5 mg/dL due to concerns regarding drug accumulation and potential risk of lactic acidosis. Nevertheless, recent data suggests a low risk of lactic acidosis in patients with moderate CKD (eGFR 30–60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) and indicates potential reno-protective benefits of metformin, leading to more flexible guideline recommendations. The 2022 consensus on Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease, from the ADA and KDIGO recommends metformin for all T2D patients with an eGFR above 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, with a dose adjustments suggested for eGFR below 45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2.

### Metformin use and cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^d7cec300]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Metformin could have benefits on cardiovascular disease and kidney disease progression but is often withheld from individuals with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) because of a concern that it may increase the risk of lactic acidosis.

Materials and Methods

All-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, cardiovascular events (death, hospitalization for heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke or myocardial ischemia), end stage renal disease (ESRD) and the kidney disease composite (ESRD or death) were compared in metformin users and non-users with diabetes and CKD enrolled in the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp (darbepoeitin-alfa) Therapy (TREAT) (NCT00093015). Outcomes were compared after propensity matching of users and non-users and in multivariable proportional hazards models.

Results

There were 591 individuals who used metformin at baseline and 3447 non-users. Among propensity-matched users, the crude incidence rate for mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events and the combined endpoint was lower in metformin users than in non-users, but ESRD was marginally higher (4.0% vs 3.6%). Metformin use was independently associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.36–0.69), cardiovascular death (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32–0.74), the cardiovascular composite (HR, 0.67, 95% CI, 0.51–0.88) and the kidney disease composite (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61–0.98). Associations with ESRD (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.65–1.55) were not significant. Results were qualitatively similar in adjusted analyses of the full population. Two cases of lactic acidosis were observed.

Conclusions

Metformin may be safer for use in CKD than previously considered and may lower the risk of death and cardiovascular events in individuals with stage 3 CKD.

### Metformin in non-diabetic patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^fdffc3a9]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis of four RCTs, including 213 non-diabetic patients with ADPKD, revealed no significant effect of metformin on slowing the decline in the eGFR or on limiting htTKV. Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the metformin group, though generally mild, and no increased risk of hypoglycemia was observed, supporting a favorable safety profile in patients with preserved kidney function. However, the relatively short and inconsistent follow-up durations across trials, which are not well matched to the chronic course of ADPKD, limit the ability to assess long-term outcomes such as the annual decline in eGFR, long-term htTKV growth, and risk of progression to kidney failure. Larger, well-powered studies with extended follow-up are needed to better define the potential therapeutic role of metformin in non-diabetic patients with ADPKD.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^4ecc97b3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — drug therapy and hypoglycemia risk is summarized as follows: An overall glycemic goal for people with diabetes of less than 7.0% is very strongly supported, but the major risk for patients attaining HbA1c levels less than 7.0% is increasing hypoglycemia. In CKD stages 3 to 5, hypoglycemia risk increases due to decreased clearance of insulin and some oral agents and impaired kidney gluconeogenesis; about one third of insulin degradation is carried out by the kidney and kidney impairment prolongs insulin half-life. In type 1 diabetes receiving insulin with significant creatinine elevations (mean, 2.2 mg/ dL) there was a 5-fold increase in severe hypoglycemia; therefore, it is imperative that intensively treated patients monitor glucose closely and reduce insulin and oral agent doses as needed to avoid hypoglycemia. For pharmacotherapy, first-generation sulfonylureas (chlorpropamide, tolazamide, tolbutamide) generally should be avoided in CKD, whereas among second-generation agents glipizide and gliclazide are preferred agents because they do not have active metabolites and do not increase hypoglycemia risk in CKD. Within the meglitinides, nateglinide has increased active metabolites with decreased kidney function, whereas increased active metabolites do not occur with repaglinide. Metformin should not be given to patients with serum creatinine concentrations of 1.5 mg/dL or greater in men and 1.4 mg/dL or greater in women because it is cleared by the kidney and may build up with even modest impairment of kidney function, putting patients at risk of lactic acidosis.

### Metformin therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease [^6ad5b69b]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Metformin therapy is limited in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the potential risk of lactic acidosis. This open-label observational study investigated metformin and lactate concentrations in patients with CKD (n = 22; creatinine clearances 15–40 ml/min) and in two dialysed patients. Patients were prescribed a range of metformin doses (250–2000 mg daily) and metformin concentrations were compared with data from healthy subjects (scaled to 1500 mg twice daily). A subset of patients (n = 7) was controlled on low doses of metformin (250 or 500 mg daily). No correlation between metformin and lactate concentrations was observed. Three patients had high lactate concentrations (> 2.7 mmol/l) and two had high metformin concentrations (3–5 mg/l), but none had any symptoms of lactic acidosis. Reducing metformin dosage and monitoring metformin concentrations will allow the safe use of metformin in CKD, provided that renal function is stable.

Guideline recommendations relating to combination therapy in CKD with T2D

Three treatment guidelines — Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) (2022), American Diabetes Association (ADA) (2024), and American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) (2022) — provide recommendations that relate to drug combinations for specific clinical scenarios in the management of CKD associated with T2D (Fig. 3). The KDIGO also recently published their 2024 update to the Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of CKD.

Fig. 3
Current practice guideline recommendations for combination therapies in patients with T2D at risk of CKD. KDIGO 2022, ADA 2024 Chap. 11, and AACE 2022 and KDIGO 2024 S/R = strong support/recommended by at least one of the practice guidelines; PP = Practice Point (by KDIGO, not a formal recommendation); NG = not graded AACE, American Association of Clinical Endocrinology; ADA, American Diabetes Association; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CV, cardiovascular; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; GLP-1 RA, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; KDIGO, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes; ns-MRA, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; SGLT2i, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor; T2D, type 2 diabetes

Before discussing the specific combinations, the base therapy for the combinations, or first-line drug therapies, needs to be considered. The glucose-lowering agents metformin and SGLT2is are recommended by the KDIGO 2022 guidelines as first-line therapies in patients with T2D, and all three guidelines recommend a RAAS inhibitor, at the maximum tolerated dose, as a standard of care for patients with T2D and albuminuria.

SGLT2is are recommended if eGFR is ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to reduce progression of CKD and risk of CVD, with the KDIGO and ADA guidelines also adding that patients are to have a UACR ≥ 200 mg/g. Where the combination of metformin and SGLT2i is insufficient to control blood glucose or cannot be tolerated by patients, GLP-1 RAs are recommended; AACE guidelines recommend GLP-1 RAs in patients with eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for glycemic control and to reduce risk of atherosclerotic CV disease and progression of albuminuria. GLP-1 RAs are generally preferred after consideration of several factors when selecting additional drugs to manage glycemia, such as patient preferences, comorbidities, eGFR, and cost.

### Antidiabetic medication use in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^ba90e097]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To quantify patterns of conventional and newer antidiabetic medication use in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

We used data from a large claims and integrated dataset that includes employed and commercially insured patients in the US to select patients who had T2DM and CKD with information on laboratory values and prescriptions for antidiabetic medications from January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2015. We stratified the analyses by sociodemographic variables.

Results

In a cohort of 38,577 patients with T2DM and CKD, we found wide variation in the treatment of T2DM by CKD stage as well as by several sociodemographic factors. Although metformin was the most commonly prescribed medication, only about half of patients in the cohort and fewer than two-thirds of patients with early stage CKD were prescribed metformin. Approximately 10.6% of patients with CKD stage 4 and 2.1% of the patients with CKD stage 5 were prescribed metformin. Sulfonylureas with active metabolites that accumulate with impaired kidney function were prescribed in more than one-third of patients with CKD stages 3b, 4, and 5. Only 3.4% and 12.3% of patients were prescribed GLP-1 and DPP-4 respectively.

Conclusions

Prescriptions for metformin were lower than expected among patients with mild to moderate CKD. Prescriptions for newer antidiabetic medications with known safety and efficacy across the spectrum of CKD remained low. Prescriptions for agents contraindicated in advanced CKD continued to be written in a sizeable fraction of patients.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^e013f78d]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Although metformin is eliminated renally, and accumulation may conceivably lead to lactic acidosis, there currently is limited systematic evidence to substantiate continued reliance on the creatinine-based contraindications in use in the U.S. Indeed, in the modern era of eGFR, this measure of glomerular filtration appears to give a more reliable estimate of renal dysfunction. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is exceedingly rare based on the available literature, and even though the use of metformin has not been comprehensively assessed in individuals with CKD, there is extensive evidence that this agent often is used without adverse effects in those with mildly to moderately reduced renal function. In the context of rising concerns regarding other glucose-lowering therapies, safety restrictions over the use of metformin in this population may result in the drug being stopped prematurely and unnecessarily in some patients. This may lead to significant deterioration in glycemic control and/or the need for other glucose-lowering medications, which present their own safety concerns. An evidence-based approach to prescribing metformin in this group appears warranted, taking into account the current pervasive use of eGFR in clinical care.

We therefore suggest that the current guidelines for metformin use in the U.S. be updated. These recommendations should include eGFR thresholds that are generally consistent with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines in the U.K. and those endorsed by the Canadian Diabetes Association and the Australian Diabetes Society (Table 1). Metformin may be continued (or initiated) with eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, but renal function should be monitored closely (every 3–6 months). The dose of metformin should be reviewed and reduced (e.g. by 50% or to half-maximal dose) in those with eGFR < 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, and renal function should be monitored closely (every 3 months). Metformin should not be initiated in patients at this stage, however. The drug should be stopped once eGFR falls to < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. Additional caution is required in patients with anticipated significant fluctuations in renal status or those at risk for abrupt deterioration in kidney function, based on previous history, other comorbidities, albuminuria, and medication regimen (e.g. potent diuretics or nephrotoxic agents).

### Risk of acute kidney injury and survival in patients treated with metformin: an observational cohort study [^5254dbb1]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our large cohort of metformin users provides a reassuring message of the safety of metformin in patients with or without a background of CKD and supports the recent revision of FDA and EMA guidance on metformin prescribing in patients with renal impairment. We have also demonstrated that metformin does not adversely affect survival in patients with AKI.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^21e1ef4d]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Despite these appropriate concerns, most of the available data would suggest that, on average, eGFR declines slowly in diabetes, although it can be accelerated to some degree in the presence of albuminuria. If eGFR is calculated annually (and more frequently in those at high risk for deterioration in renal function), it is unlikely that patients will experience changes in their eGFR levels large enough to rapidly alter the safety of metformin therapy.

### The long-term effects of metformin on patients with type 2 diabetic kidney disease [^6632d190]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Metformin is the first pharmacological option for treating type 2 diabetes. However, the use of this drug is not recommended in individuals with impaired kidney function because of the perceived risk of lactic acidosis. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetic kidney disease (DKD).

Research Design and Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of 10,426 patients with type 2 DKD from two tertiary hospitals. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) progression. The secondary outcome was metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Taking into account the possibility that patients with less severe disease were prescribed metformin, propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted.

Results

All-cause mortality and incident ESRD were lower in the metformin group according to the multivariate Cox analysis. Because the two groups had significantly different baseline characteristics, PSM was performed. After matching, metformin usage was still associated with lower all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.65; 95% CI 0.57–0.73; P < 0.001) and ESRD progression (aHR 0.67; 95% CI 0.58–0.77; P < 0.001). Only one event of metformin-associated lactic acidosis was recorded. In both the original and PSM groups, metformin usage did not increase the risk of lactic acidosis events from all causes (aHR 0.92; 95% CI 0.668–1.276; P = 0.629).

Conclusions

In the present retrospective study, metformin usage in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, especially those with CKD 3B, decreased the risk of all-cause mortality and incident ESRD. Additionally, metformin did not increase the risk of lactic acidosis. However, considering the remaining biases even after PSM, further randomized controlled trials are needed to change real-world practice.

### Metformin: nonglycemic effects and potential novel indications [^ace226b9]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Metformin is the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes because of its apparent robust effects in reducing cardiovascular risk. This review examines the current literature regarding the nonglycemic effects and potential novel indications for metformin.

Methods

Review of the literature, with a focus on metformin use in Stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD-3) and heart failure (HF).

Results

The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study suggests that metformin reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, and more recent retrospective studies have shown an association between metformin use and a reduction in stroke, atrial fibrillation and all-cause mortality. The mechanism(s) explaining these putative benefits are not clear but may involve decreased energy intake (with attendant weight loss), improvement in lipids, and lowering of blood pressure; a literature review suggests that metformin lowers blood pressure when it is elevated, but not when it is normal. Metformin appears to be safe when given to patients with CKD-3. In addition, there is evidence that individuals with CKD-3, who are at increased cardiovascular risk, stand to benefit from metformin therapy. Lactic acidosis is an extremely remote and probably avoidable risk; measurement of plasma metformin levels and more frequent monitoring of renal function may be useful in selected patients with CKD-3 who are treated with metformin. Finally, there is evidence that metformin is safe in patients with HF; metformin therapy is associated with a reduction in newly incident HF and in HF mortality.

Conclusion

Metformin has a dominant position in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that is deserved due to its favorable and robust effects on cardiovascular risk.

### Lactic acidosis incidence with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a retrospective nested case-control study [^764ae3f8]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metformin is the most prescribed medication for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and considered first line therapy by international professional society recommendations. 1, 2, 3 Metformin lowers blood glucose, is associated with a low risk of serious hypoglycaemia and does not promote weight gain. 4 It lowered cardiovascular risk in overweight or obese patients with T2DM in one trial, 5 though some uncertainty persists about its net cardiovascular benefit. 6 Until 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labels for metformin contained a contraindication for men with serum creatinine of ≥ 1.5 mg/dL and women with serum creatinine ≥ 1.4 mg/dL and a boxed warning about the risk of lactic acidosis (LA) associated with renal impairment. 7 The contraindication and warning were implemented due to increased LA risk observed in patients receiving phenformin, the predecessor to metformin in the biguanide class that was removed from the US market in 1977. 8 Since metformin is eliminated unchanged by the kidneys, it was feared that elevated metformin concentrations in patients with CKD might also increase the risk for LA. 9

Small randomized studies indicate that thiazolidinediones reduce albuminuria more than insulin, other oral agents (metformin or sulfonylureas), or dietary treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, and albuminuria was decreased or trended downward in all such studies. The mechanism is uncertain because thiazolidinedione therapy was associated with larger decreases in glycemia or correlated with decreases in blood pressure.

Antidiabetic therapy in patients with impaired renal function

Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, accounting for 44% of all new cases of kidney failure in 2008 in the United States. The clearance of antidiabetic drugs is decreased and results in prolonged exposure to higher levels of the drug or its metabolites that may trigger adverse events. Observational data suggest that mortality risk in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal dysfunction increases with HbA1c levels < 6.5% and > 8.0%. Accordingly, HbA1c levels between 6.5% and 7.5% may be a reasonable target for these patients.

A number of antidiabetic drugs are contraindicated in patients when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below variable thresholds, such as 25 ml/min for acarbose, 30 ml/min for exenatide and SU, 50 ml/min for DPP-4 inhibitors and 60 ml/min for metformin and liraglutide. There are scant data on the actual efficacy and safety of diabetes medications depending on patients' renal function. Furthermore, contraindications do not necessarily match with available evidence. This is exemplified with metformin: The label of metformin in the U.S. allows the prescription of metformin at or above 1.4 mg/dl serum creatinine in women and 1.5 mg/dl in men. In Germany, metformin is contraindicated in patients with a GFR < 60 ml/min. In the U.K. prescribing guidelines consider both creatinine and GFR for assessing treatment eligibility. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends reviewing prescriptions when serum creatinine exceeds 1.5 mg/dl or GFR falls below 45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and to stop treatment at a serum creatinine of 1.7 mg/dl or a GFR of below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. The uncertainty is mirrored in clinical practice when metformin is prescribed despite full knowledge of the relevant cut-offs. Nevertheless, there is no evidence from prospective comparative or observational studies that metformin confers an increased risk of lactic acidosis. This was shown in a meta-analysis from 347 comparative trials and cohort studies.

### Cardiorenal outcomes with ertugliflozin assessed according to baseline glucose-lowering agent: an analysis from VERTIS CV [^2005c1f6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

International guidelines for patients with T2DM have been updated over recent years not only to reflect the greater choice of therapies but also to recognize the results from the recent CVOTs of SGLT2 inhibitors and glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists. Some differences in the role of metformin as first‐line therapy exist between the recommendations from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and the 2019 guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). While current clinical practice recommendations from the ADA propose a patient‐centric approach to guide the choice of pharmacological agents, with considerations such as CV and kidney comorbidities, hypoglycaemia risk, impact on weight, cost, risk of side effects and patient preferences, metformin is still the preferred initial pharmacological agent for the treatment of patients with T2DM. However, the results from the present analyses, together with data from the analyses of the EMPA‐REG OUTCOMEand DECLARE TIMI 58 15 trials by baseline glucose‐lowering agent, suggest no difference in outcomes with or without metformin use and therefore add support to the use of SGLT2 inhibitors earlier in the treatment paradigm. On the basis of CVOTs of SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP‐1 receptor agonists, the 2019 ESC guidelines on diabetes and CV diseases recommended a shift in focus from a glucose‐centric to a cardio‐centric approach for patients with ASCVD or at high/very high CV risk with the initiation of a GLP‐1 receptor agonist or a SGLT2 inhibitor in drug‐naïve patients or the addition of a GLP‐1 receptor agonist or a SGLT2 inhibitor in patients already on metformin. From a kidney perspective, the 2020 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines recommend metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor as first‐line treatment in patients with T2D and chronic kidney disease. The body of scientific evidence, along with updated guidelines, will help ensure that patients with T2DM, CV disease, heart failure or chronic kidney disease are treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP‐1 receptor agonist when appropriate, independent of background therapy, to optimize cardiorenal health.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease in children and adolescents — type 2 diabetes management indicates that in patients with type 2 diabetes, therapeutic lifestyle changes should be the initial interventions for hyperglycemia, and if lifestyle changes do not succeed in achieving a goal of near-normal glycemia (HbA1c < 7%), drug therapy should be initiated. For children or adolescents with type 2 diabetes, only metformin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this use — and only in children older than 10 years; however, metformin should be avoided in children and adolescents with diabetes and CKD. Cautions regarding the use of other oral agents in children and adolescents with diabetes and CKD are the same as those described for adults, and TZDs should not be used because of concerns about liver toxicity due to the experience with troglitazone.

14.4 Chronic Kidney Disease

The Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD, NCT03036150) was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR between 25 and 75 mL/min/1.73 m2) and albuminuria [urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) between 200 and 5000 mg/g] who were receiving standard of care background therapy, including a maximally tolerated, labeled daily dosage of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). The trial excluded patients with autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, lupus nephritis, or ANCA-associated vasculitis and patients requiring cytotoxic, immunosuppressive, or immunomodulatory therapies in the preceding 6 months.

The primary objective was to determine whether dapagliflozin 10 mg reduces the incidence of the composite endpoint of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (defined as sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic dialysis treatment or renal transplant), CV or renal death.

A total of 4304 patients were randomized equally to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo and were followed for a median of 28.5 months. The trial included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 2906) and patients without diabetes (n = 1398). The mean age of the trial population was 62 years and 67% were male. The population was 53% White, 4% Black or African American, and 34% Asian; 25% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline, mean eGFR was 43 mL/min/1.73 m2, 44% of patients had an eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73m2 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73m2, and 15% of patients had an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2. Median UACR was 950 mg/g. The most common etiologies of CKD were diabetic nephropathy (58%), ischemic/hypertensive nephropathy (16%), and IgA nephropathy (6%). At baseline, 97% of patients were treated with ACEi or ARB. Approximately 44% were taking antiplatelet agents, and 65% were on a statin.

Metformin in T2DM — effect sizes, role, and cautions: In a UKPDS substudy, "metformin, compared with conventional therapy (i.e., lifestyle modifications alone), resulted in a 32% reduction in microvascular and macrovascular diabetes-related outcomes, a 39% reduction in MI, and a 36% reduction in all-cause mortality rate". A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis "supported the use of metformin as first-line therapy for T2DM" due to benefits in HbA1c, weight, and ASCVD outcomes; however, "a separate systematic review found no evidence of reduced CVD events or CVD deaths with metformin". Safety notes include that "Metformin carries a small risk of lactic acidosis and must be used with caution in patients with CKD", and for initial management "clinicians can consider a trial of lifestyle therapies for 3 to 6 months before reconsideration of metformin" in younger or mildly elevated HbA1c cases.

Type 2 diabetes with or at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure, or chronic kidney disease (CKD) — people should be treated with a cardioprotective SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1 RA as part of the comprehensive approach to cardiovascular and kidney risk reduction, and these agents should be included in the plan of care irrespective of the need for additional glucose lowering and irrespective of metformin use. Adoption of these agents should be reasonably straightforward in people with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular or kidney disease, and close collaboration between primary and specialty care clinicians with the patient is indicated to ensure successful uptake of these therapies.

### Chronic kidney disease: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment [^b1234fc5]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 15% of the U.S. population, and many people are unaware of their diagnosis. Screening may be considered for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, age 60 years and older, family history of kidney disease, previous acute kidney injury, or preeclampsia. Diagnosis and staging of CKD are based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), excessive urinary albumin excretion, or evidence of kidney parenchymal damage lasting more than three months. eGFR should be determined using the CKD-EPI creatinine equation without the race variable. Risk calculators are available to estimate the risk of progression to end-stage renal disease. When possible, serum cystatin C should be measured to confirm eGFR in patients with CKD. Blood pressure should be maintained at less than 140/90 mm Hg, with a systolic blood pressure target of 120 mm Hg or less for patients tolerant of therapy, using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and metformin should be considered in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes who have not reached their glycemic goal. Intravenous iodinated contrast media temporarily reduces eGFR and should be avoided in patients with advanced CKD. Interdisciplinary management of patients with CKD is important for reducing morbidity and mortality, and patients at high risk of progression to end-stage renal disease should be referred to a nephrologist.

### Use of insulin and oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus and advanced kidney disease [^baa708d9]. Seminars in Dialysis (2004). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is recognized as a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States. There is a vast array of medications used to treat diabetes, including insulin and the sulfonylureas, as well as newer classes of drugs such as the thiazolidinediones and biguanides. In patients with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), it is necessary to decrease the dosage of some of these drugs, while others are best avoided altogether. Accumulation of either the parent compound or its metabolites can result in symptomatic hypoglycemia, or in the case of metformin, significant lactic acidosis. In this article we will review the use of insulin and the various classes of oral medications used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, focusing on their pharmacokinetic properties and dosing in patients with advanced kidney disease.

### Cardiorenal protection with the newer antidiabetic agents in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^bfc7d683]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health problem, resulting in significant cardiovascular and kidney adverse outcomes worldwide. Despite the widespread use of standard-of-care therapies for CKD with T2D over the past few decades, rates of progression to end-stage kidney disease remain high with no beneficial impact on its accompanying burden of cardiovascular disease. The advent of the newer classes of antihyperglycemic agents, including SGLT2 (sodium glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists, has changed the landscape of therapeutic options for patients with CKD with T2D, with demonstration of significant reductions in cardiovascular adverse events and progression to end-stage kidney disease. Several potential mechanisms exist through which these beneficial effects are achieved in both drug classes, which may be independent of their antihyperglycemic effects. This scientific statement summarizes the current literature on the cardiorenal protective effects with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with CKD and T2D. It reviews potential mechanistic pathways that may drive these benefits and summarizes the literature on adverse effects in patients with CKD and T2D at risk for or with established cardiovascular disease. Last, it provides practical guidance on a proposed collaborative care model bridging cardiologists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, and primary care physicians to facilitate the prompt and appropriate integration of these therapeutic classes in the management of patients with T2D and CKD.

### Metformin and cardiorenal outcomes in diabetes: a reappraisal [^2cb42064]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

The whole field of clinical trials in diabetes has changed dramatically since 2008, leading to a number of evaluations of newer glucose‐lowering therapies that are comparatively homogenous in design, and amenable to meta‐analysis. Accordingly, it is difficult to compare the actions of an older therapy such as metformin with the results of these recent trials. Nevertheless a variety of lines of evidence exist to support an antiatherosclerotic effect of metformin in people with diabetes and a reduced risk of adverse CV outcomes in type 2 diabetes. Although those data were collected in an earlier era of clinical trial design, they must be taken into account in any balanced view of the evidence. Recent evidence from clinical trials has shown that metformin is effective and safe in people with CKD, as long as appropriate dose adjustments are used, and use is restricted to patients with eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73m 2. Although we have now seen more than 6 decades of continuous therapeutic use of metformin, further data that will better define its cardioprotective and renoprotective effects and mechanisms of metformin are set to emerge over the next 5 years.
