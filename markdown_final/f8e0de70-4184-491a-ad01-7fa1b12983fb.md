## Question

28 year old male with total testosterone 211, repeat check total testosterone 248, Lh 0.9, fsh 1.9, normal CBC and cmp. what is next in diagnosis and treatment of patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do next in diagnosis and treatment for a 28‑year‑old man with low total testosterone, low‑normal LH/FSH, and normal CBC/CMP. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming that the testosterone results meet guideline sampling conditions. Then, I should verify the pattern of gonadotropins to localize the defect. Next, I will screen for common reversible or systemic causes and obtain a fasting morning prolactin. After that, I need to decide whether to add SHBG and possibly free testosterone, consider iron studies, and determine if pituitary imaging is indicated. Finally, I will address reversible contributors, define when to initiate testosterone therapy, and set up a monitoring plan with safety parameters and targets.

> Let me first confirm the sampling conditions for the two total testosterone values of 211 ng/dL and 248 ng/dL, because diurnal variation and feeding status can materially depress results; diagnosis requires two early‑morning fasting measurements on separate days using a reliable assay, and testing should be deferred during acute illness or immediately after it, so I need to check timing, fasting status, assay quality, and recent health events before I label this as hypogonadism [^111zq8AY] [^115LrmTB] [^114Pw7bk] [^117KjQL3] [^1124R92x].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the axis level by interpreting gonadotropins next. With LH 0.9 mIU/mL and FSH 1.9 mIU/mL in the low‑normal range, this pattern fits secondary (hypothalamic‑pituitary) hypogonadism rather than primary testicular failure, but I should confirm there are no assay interferences or transient suppressors before I anchor on a central etiology [^112UQRiA] [^1147zhsd] [^114p1mj1].

> I will now examine common reversible or systemic causes of secondary hypogonadism, because addressing them may normalize testosterone without lifelong therapy. I need to check BMI and features of obstructive sleep apnea, review medications such as opioids, glucocorticoids, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants, assess glucose or HbA1c if risk factors exist, and obtain TSH given its effects on SHBG and total testosterone; I should also avoid testing during acute systemic illness and repeat when the patient is back to baseline health [^1132LYjC] [^111EbdnM] [^1132LYjC] [^114BQU8J].

> Wait, let me verify whether hyperprolactinemia is present, because that is a treatable cause of secondary hypogonadism and drives imaging decisions. I should obtain a single fasting morning prolactin; if elevated, I will proceed to pituitary MRI, whereas if prolactin is normal and there are no mass‑effect symptoms or very low testosterone, imaging can be deferred for now, especially in a young man without red flags [^112rBVkd] [^114BQU8J] [^111EbdnM].

> I need to check iron status next, because iron overload can damage the pituitary and cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; ferritin and transferrin saturation are reasonable when secondary hypogonadism is otherwise unexplained, and I can escalate to a hemochromatosis work‑up if these are elevated [^1132LYjC].

> Let me think about SHBG and free testosterone. At first I thought free testosterone was unnecessary here because total testosterone is clearly subnormal, but wait, I should verify whether SHBG is altered by obesity or comorbidities, which can confound total testosterone interpretation; free testosterone estimation is advised when total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal, although in this case, with values around 211–248 ng/dL, the diagnosis does not hinge on free testosterone, yet measuring SHBG and considering calculated FT could refine severity assessment [^114mNUJU] [^116yTpN9] [^1145zyce] [^111EbdnM] [^112Cpy5a].

> I should confirm whether pituitary imaging is indicated now. But wait, I need to apply thresholds carefully; MRI is generally reserved for men with secondary hypogonadism who have elevated prolactin, mass‑effect symptoms, very low total testosterone, or severe gonadotropin deficiency, and guidelines suggest thresholds such as total testosterone < 6 nmol/L or < 150 ng/dL for imaging triggers, so with a nadir of 211 ng/dL and no red flags, deferring MRI until after prolactin results and clinical surveillance is reasonable in this 28‑year‑old [^115Nrmsu] [^114BQU8J].

> Next, I should review and address reversible contributors before committing to testosterone therapy. I need to ensure structured weight loss if BMI is elevated, screen and treat obstructive sleep apnea, optimize comorbidities, and rationalize medications that suppress the HPT axis; then I should recheck fasting morning testosterone in 3–6 months, because functional hypogonadism often improves with health optimization [^111RhFZX] [^1132LYjC] [^114tZLyY].

> I should confirm symptomatic status and persistence of biochemical hypogonadism before initiating testosterone therapy. If symptoms consistent with androgen deficiency persist and two properly collected morning tests remain unequivocally low after addressing reversible factors, shared decision‑making about TRT is appropriate, with transdermal formulations favored initially for ease of titration, mid‑normal serum testosterone as the target, and explicit counseling on fertility suppression and contraindications such as active prostate cancer, baseline hematocrit > 54%, and uncontrolled heart failure; baseline PSA with DRE, hematocrit, and liver enzymes should be obtained before starting [^111zq8AY] [^11592cGr] [^111HqSMM] [^1124R92x] [^111SoYaH] [^114TwRZc].

> Hold on, I should verify on‑treatment monitoring and safety cut‑offs. I will plan follow‑up at 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually to assess symptoms, check trough testosterone to titrate toward mid‑normal, monitor hematocrit with action at or above 54% including dose reduction, phlebotomy, or switching formulations, and follow PSA and DRE according to age and risk, with closer hematocrit surveillance in those at risk of erythrocytosis [^117LiYSf] [^1115bG2d] [^112YEy14] [^114KeVjE] [^112vsjzY] [^115trkQz] [^114Q8Rbn] [^117LiYSf].

> But wait, what if fertility is desired now or soon. I need to ensure we do not suppress spermatogenesis with exogenous testosterone, so if fertility is a priority, I should consider alternatives such as hCG with or without FSH, or defer TRT while addressing reversible factors and considering sperm banking if therapy cannot be delayed [^111zq8AY] [^117LiYSf].

> Let me reconsider the immediate next steps for this specific 28‑year‑old. I should double‑check that both testosterone measurements were early‑morning fasting and repeat if not, confirm secondary hypogonadism with the low‑normal LH/FSH pattern, obtain fasting prolactin and iron studies, screen aggressively for obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes, and suppressive medications, and hold imaging unless prolactin is elevated or severe biochemical or neurologic red flags emerge; after optimizing reversible factors for 3–6 months, I should re‑evaluate symptoms and testosterone to decide on TRT using transdermal initiation and guideline‑driven monitoring if deficiency persists [^117KjQL3] [^112UQRiA] [^112rBVkd] [^112MVWjG] [^111RhFZX] [^115Nrmsu] [^117LiYSf].

This 28-year-old male with **confirmed low testosterone** and **low-normal LH/FSH** has biochemical secondary hypogonadism [^114p1mj1]. The next steps are to **repeat fasting morning total testosterone** [^117KjQL3] with SHBG and calculated free testosterone [^1145zyce] to confirm the diagnosis and assess androgen status [^1124R92x]. Concurrently, order **prolactin** [^112rBVkd], TSH, and morning cortisol to screen for pituitary or systemic causes [^111EbdnM]. If prolactin is elevated or testosterone remains low with low/normal gonadotropins, obtain a **pituitary MRI** [^114BQU8J] to exclude structural lesions [^115Nrmsu]. Management depends on etiology: treat reversible causes (e.g. hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, obesity), and consider testosterone therapy if persistent symptoms and low testosterone after addressing reversible factors [^1124R92x], with monitoring of hematocrit, PSA, and testosterone levels [^117LiYSf].

---

## Confirmatory testing

Repeat fasting morning total testosterone [^113ss2Ag] using a reliable assay to confirm persistent low levels [^1124R92x] with a **third early morning (7–11 AM) fasting sample** [^117KjQL3] [^111zq8AY]. Also obtain **SHBG** [^1145zyce] and **calculated free testosterone** [^114mNUJU] to assess bioavailable androgen, especially when total testosterone is borderline or SHBG may be altered [^116yTpN9].

---

## Additional hormonal evaluation

Measure **prolactin** to exclude hyperprolactinemia, a common reversible cause of secondary hypogonadism [^112rBVkd]. Evaluate thyroid function with **TSH and free T4** [^111EbdnM] to identify hypothyroidism that may suppress the HPT axis. Check **morning cortisol** [^111EbdnM] to assess for adrenal insufficiency or Cushing syndrome, which can affect the HPT axis.

---

## Imaging studies

A **pituitary MRI** [^114BQU8J] is indicated if prolactin is elevated, testosterone remains persistently low with low/normal gonadotropins, or other pituitary hormone deficiencies are suspected, to exclude structural lesions (e.g. adenoma, infiltrative disease) [^115Nrmsu].

---

## Evaluation for reversible causes

- **Medications**: Review for opioids, glucocorticoids, anabolic steroids, or other agents that suppress the HPT axis [^111EbdnM].

- **Lifestyle factors**: Assess for obesity [^113G9JSF], chronic illness, excessive alcohol use, or anabolic steroid abuse, which can cause functional hypogonadism [^1132LYjC].

- **Sleep apnea**: Screen for obstructive sleep apnea, a common reversible cause of secondary hypogonadism [^113Y6q86].

---

## Management strategy

### Address reversible causes

- **Hyperprolactinemia**: Treat with dopamine agonists (e.g. cabergoline, bromocriptine) [^116yoGUs].

- **Hypothyroidism**: Initiate thyroid hormone replacement.

- **Obesity and lifestyle factors**: Implement weight loss, exercise, and lifestyle modifications to improve testosterone levels [^113G9JSF] [^111RhFZX].

- **Sleep apnea**: Treat with CPAP or other appropriate interventions [^113Y6q86].

---

### Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)

- **Indications**: Consider TRT if testosterone remains persistently low with symptoms after reversible causes are addressed [^111zq8AY].

- **Contraindications**: Avoid TRT in men desiring fertility, with prostate or breast cancer, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, uncontrolled heart failure, or hematocrit > 54%.

- **Monitoring**: Monitor hematocrit, PSA [^111SoYaH], and testosterone levels regularly during therapy [^115trkQz].

## Summary of recommended next steps

| **Step** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Repeat fasting morning total testosterone [^111zq8AY] with SHBG and calculated free testosterone [^1145zyce] |
| 2 | Measure prolactin [^111EbdnM], TSH, free T4, and morning cortisol |
| 3 | Perform pituitary MRI if indicated [^114BQU8J] |
| 4 | Evaluate and address reversible causes (medications, lifestyle [^113G9JSF], sleep apnea) |
| 5 | Consider TRT if persistent symptoms and low testosterone after reversible causes addressed [^113DZd9u] |

---

The patient has biochemical secondary hypogonadism [^112UQRiA]. The next steps are to **confirm the diagnosis, identify reversible causes, and consider testosterone therapy** if symptoms persist after addressing reversible factors [^111zq8AY] [^111RhFZX] [^113DZd9u].

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114BQU8J]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

In the absence of clinically suspected hypothalamic-pituitary disease, measurement of serum prolactin is the only diagnostic test that is routinely recommended for the evaluation of causes of secondary hypogonadism in men aged 50 years and older. Men with secondary hypogonadism and clinical or biochemical findings suggestive of a sellar mass or hypothalamic-pituitary disease, an elevated serum prolactin concentration, a very low serum total testosterone concentration, or serum gonadotropin concentration below the lower limit of normal should undergo sellar imaging.

There is no well-defined threshold of total testosterone concentration for determining when to perform sellar imaging. The published literature, summarized by Hirsch et al, included 313 middle-aged and older men (mean age 57 years) with sexual symptoms and a mean total testosterone concentration of 190 ng/dL (6.6 nmol/L). Only 6 patients (1.9%) had a macroadenoma, all of whom had total testosterone concentrations of 104 ng/dL (3.6 nmol/L) or less.

The Endocrine Society guidelines recommend pituitary imaging for men with symptoms of tumor mass effect (e.g. visual impairment, visual field defect, or new-onset headache), panhypopituitarism, persistent hyperprolactinemia, or a serum total testosterone < 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L). Of note, if prolactin is not elevated, a pituitary lesion has to be relatively large to cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and therefore sellar computed tomography (CT) has sufficient sensitivity. A sellar CT involves a modest radiation exposure but is less likely to detect an incidental pituitary microadenoma.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations.

Clinicians are faced with the question of whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1132LYjC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Men with low serum testosterone concentrations can be characterized as having classic hypogonadism (sometimes called organic hypogonadism) due to an identifiable pathology or disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT, gonadal) axis, or they can be characterized as eugonadal with suppression of the gonadal axis due to a systemic disorder or condition. A low serum testosterone due to suppression of the gonadal axis by a systemic disorder is analogous to the changes in thyroid function seen in euthyroid sick syndrome and is sometimes described as functional hypogonadism.

Similar to euthyroid sick syndrome (or nonthyroidal illness), men with low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis by systemic disease might have underlying normal HPT function. Because the serum testosterone might normalize if the underlying disorder is treated and health is restored, "eugonadal sick syndrome" or "nongonadal illness" might be more accurate terms than functional hypogonadism. These terms have the advantage of identifying the underlying gonadal axis as normal and do not conflate functional with reversible. Pathologies and disorders associated with classic hypogonadism are also potentially reversible, such as hyperprolactinemia and iron overload syndromes.

Classic pathologic hypogonadism is relatively uncommon, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of less than 1%. Low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis is common and increases with age and body mass index (BMI). Some experts use the term late-onset hypogonadism for functional hypogonadism in older men.

The EAA 2020 guidelines regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, particularly concerning testosterone levels, recommend measuring or calculating free testosterone in addition to total testosterone. This is suggested for patients with conditions that alter sex hormone-binding globulin and when total testosterone concentrations are in the borderline range (~8–12 nmol/L), especially if the clinical suspicion of hypogonadism is strong.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114tZLyY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

In the population-based European Male Ageing Study, the prevalence of the syndromic association of symptoms of hypogonadism plus low serum testosterone without an identifiable classic HPT axis pathology was determined in men aged 40 to 79 years. Symptoms of hypogonadism were defined as a constellation of low libido, decreased sexual function, and low serum testosterone. The overall prevalence of this syndrome of androgen-deficiency-associated sexual symptoms plus low serum testosterone was 2.1%, increasing from 0.6% in men 50 to 59 years of age to 5.1% in men 70 to 79 years. Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m²) was associated with a 13-fold increased prevalence compared with normal weight. Likewise, the presence of ≥ 2 comorbidities was associated with a 9-fold increase in the prevalent syndrome of hypogonadism-associated sexual symptoms plus low serum testosterone. In the longitudinal follow-up, weight loss was associated with the resolution of this syndrome in a significant percentage of the men.

The management of older men with low serum testosterone concentrations is hampered by the fact that many clinical features of androgen deficiency are nonspecific and similar to those associated with obesity or comorbid disease, conditions that are associated with low serum testosterone concentrations. In such men, the conundrum lies in determining the degree to which the (often nonspecific) clinical symptoms are predominantly due to hypogonadism or instead due to obesity and other chronic systemic disorders that suppress the HPT axis, i.e. reverse causality. Of note, this assessment is complex and requires careful clinical evaluation.

### Approach to the patient: Low testosterone concentrations in men with obesity [^113G9JSF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Pathologic hypogonadism occurs when serum testosterone is significantly and persistently reduced by irreversible organic (structural, genetic) disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis. Men with pathologic hypogonadism require lifelong testosterone replacement. In contrast, mild or moderate reductions in serum testosterone frequently accompany obesity and its numerous co-morbidities in men and are best considered as non-gonadal illness syndromes, wherein reduction in serum testosterone is usually reversible upon amelioration of the underlying non-gonadal illness.

Obesity can result in non-specific symptoms in conjunction with reduced serum testosterone and serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Obesity-related reductions in SHBG, testosterone's principal circulating carrier protein, are primarily responsible for measured reductions in testosterone. However, obesity is not a cause of pathological hypogonadism, and proportionately reduced testosterone and SHBG concentrations accompanied by normal serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations confirm a eugonadal state, best described as the pseudo-hypogonadism of obesity.

Herein, we demonstrate how clinically significant weight loss substantially reverses obesity-related reductions in serum testosterone and ameliorates non-specific symptoms resembling, but not due to, androgen deficiency. The important reversible steps include:

- **Weight reduction**: This is a primary step in reversing symptoms.
- **Optimizing management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other comorbidities**: Proper management can enhance testosterone levels.
- **Obstructive sleep apnea and depression management**: These conditions should be addressed to improve overall health.
- **Rationalizing concomitant drug regimens**: Review and adjust medications as necessary.

In the absence of pathologic hypogonadism, these steps can lead to significant improvement in serum testosterone levels and associated symptoms.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114Pw7bk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Although this man's initial serum total testosterone concentration was very low, he had a recent severe illness (hospitalization for pneumonia 2 weeks prior to the initial testosterone measurement). Any significant acute systemic illness or flare of chronic systemic illness can transiently suppress the HPT axis and serum testosterone. Assessment for hypogonadism should not be done in men who are acutely unwell (and below their baseline health) or during hospital admission. Although there are no prospective data on the timeframe of HPT axis recovery after an acute systemic illness, clinical experience indicates that the time to recovery is inversely related to the severity and duration of the illness. Because making a diagnosis of hypogonadism is not urgent, we recommend deferring testosterone measurements until the patient has recovered to their baseline health for at least 2 months. In patients with a protracted systemic illness lasting more than a few weeks, serial measurements of testosterone over several months are helpful; a pattern of increasing serum testosterone suggests that the HPT axis might fully recover.

In our patient, the initial measurement of serum testosterone was done on a nonfasting afternoon sample. Serum testosterone has a circadian rhythm with the highest concentrations in the morning, and the normal range of serum testosterone is based on early morning blood samples. Although this circadian rhythm might be attenuated in many older men, male hypogonadism should be diagnosed based on an early morning testosterone concentration.

### Pituitary evaluation in patients with low prostate-specific antigen [^113KkG3f]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The objective was to evaluate pituitary function in men with a low screening prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of ≤ 0.1 ng/mL and to test the hypothesis that low PSA is associated with hypogonadism alone or other hormone deficiencies.

- **Methods**: This was a case-control study evaluating the rates of hypogonadism and low insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 in a cohort of men with low or normal screening PSA levels. Sixty-four men over 40 years old without known prostate disease were divided into a low-PSA group (PSA ≤ 0.1 ng/mL) and a normal-PSA group (PSA 1 to 4 ng/mL). Hormonal evaluation included total testosterone, prolactin, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, IGF-1, growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, morning cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. The difference between each patient's observed IGF-1 and the IGF-1 age-specific lower limit was calculated. The odds ratios (ORs) for having hypogonadism and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.

- **Results**: The rate of hypogonadism was significantly higher in the low-PSA group (n = 44) compared with the normal-PSA control group (n = 20) (45.5% vs. 15.0%; OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 18.4; p = 0.027). The total testosterone in the low-PSA group was significantly lower compared with the control group (181.7 ng/dL vs. 263.7 ng/dL; p = 0.008). IGF-1 values were below their lower bound in 18.6% of subjects in the low-PSA group, compared with 0% in the control group.

The conclusion was that men with low PSA have significantly higher rates of hypogonadism and low IGF-1 compared to those with normal PSA levels.

### The practical management of testosterone deficiency in men [^114Hq3p8]. Nature Reviews Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite increased global interest in testosterone deficiency in men and its treatment with testosterone therapy, practical aspects of care remain confusing to many practitioners. Testosterone deficiency can result from testicular dysfunction (primary hypogonadism) or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (secondary hypogonadism), and can be congenital or acquired. Sexual and nonsexual symptoms of testosterone deficiency can negatively affect quality of life and cause considerable general health concerns.

Investigation of testosterone deficiency should be undertaken in men with symptoms of reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, depression, fatigue, poor concentration, and poor memory. Total and free testosterone are the most frequently used tests, and evaluating serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone aids in the determination of primary versus secondary testosterone deficiency. Multiple formulations of testosterone therapy are available, but symptomatic benefits might not manifest for several weeks to many months; long-acting formulations are convenient and improve compliance.

Concerns regarding cardiovascular and prostate cancer risks are not supported by evidence; however, monitoring during therapy is mandatory. On balance, testosterone therapy can be considered a safe and effective treatment for testosterone deficiency.

### Society for endocrinology guideline for understanding, diagnosing and treating female hypogonadism [^115wHh7i]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Female hypogonadism (FH) is a relatively common endocrine disorder in women of premenopausal age; however, there are significant uncertainties and a wide variation in its management. Most guidelines are monospecialty and only address premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Some allude to management in very brief and general terms, and most rely on the extrapolation of evidence from studies relating to physiological estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women. The Society for Endocrinology commissioned new guidance to provide all care providers with a multidisciplinary perspective on managing patients with all forms of FH. It has been compiled using expertise from endocrinology, primary care, gynaecology, and reproductive health practices, with contributions from expert patients and a patient support group. This guidance aims to help clinicians best manage FH resulting from both POI and hypothalamo-pituitary disorders, whether organic or functional.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115qUems]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

A free testosterone result is most useful in the assessment of a man with intermediate pretest probability of hypogonadism, a condition associated with low serum SHBG and a serum total testosterone that is moderately low to low-normal (i.e. 200–275 ng/dL or 6.94–9.55 nmol/L). Some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone because of the limitations discussed above and recommend focusing on the interpretation of total testosterone concentrations in conjunction with SHBG concentrations. This approach aligns with the assessment of serum free testosterone using an accurate method. Overall, there is no consistent evidence that free testosterone concentrations are a better measure of androgen status than total testosterone. Further studies are needed to establish more accurate and uniform methods for assessing free testosterone concentrations and to determine its clinical utility in diagnosing hypogonadism. For further discussion about the debate over the clinical value of free testosterone and the accuracy of its calculation/measurement, there are several recent reviews.

Some hypogonadal men with markedly elevated serum SHBG concentrations may have normal or even high serum total testosterone concentrations. Significantly elevated serum SHBG concentrations occur most commonly in the context of anti-epileptic treatment, chronic liver disease, or chronic daily ingestion of large quantities of alcohol, even in the absence of significant elevation of serum hepatic transaminases.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^111EbdnM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

- **Approach to diagnosis and management**: For possible hypogonadism in men ≥ 50 years, evaluate recent onset of declining libido and/or erectile function, new onset or tender gynecomastia, and osteoporosis. Patients are often referred for consultation about low serum total testosterone (TT) that was measured in the absence of high clinical suspicion of hypogonadism. It is generally useful to repeat the measurement in this clinical setting. Measure TT when the patient is at baseline health and confirm low TT with a second fasting sample. The confirmatory measurement should be done on a fasting sample drawn between 7 and 10 am.

- **Assessment of serum free testosterone (FT)**: Assess FT on a confirmatory sample using an accurate method if the serum TT is 220–264 ng/dL (7.6–9.2 nmol/L) or if abnormalities in serum SHBG are suspected. Although some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone due to the limitations discussed in the manuscript, focusing instead on the interpretation of SHBG along with total testosterone, this approach is congruent with assessing serum FT with an accurate method.

- **Investigation for cause of HPT disorder**: This includes clinical assessment for Cushing syndrome, review of medications that affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis, and measurement of serum prolactin. Measurement of serum T4 might be useful if panhypopituitarism is suspected. Sellar imaging is indicated if serum prolactin is elevated. Evaluation of hyperprolactinemia also includes review of medications and measurement of TSH.

### Association of free testosterone with hypogonadal symptoms in men with near-normal total testosterone levels [^115atxss]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between hypogonadal symptoms and free testosterone (FT) levels in men with near-normal total testosterone (T) levels, ranging from 250 to 350 ng/dL, and to determine if there is a discriminatory threshold for FT below which hypogonadal symptoms become more prevalent.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the charts of 3167 men who presented to an outpatient men's health clinic. Among them, 231 men had symptoms of "low testosterone" and serum testosterone levels between 250 and 350 ng/dL. Hypogonadal symptoms were evaluated using the Androgen Deficiency in the Adult Male (ADAM) and quantitative ADAM (qADAM) questionnaires. Serum levels of T and sex hormone-binding globulin were collected on the same day the questionnaires were completed. Linear regression was used to determine if a threshold of FT exists for hypogonadal symptoms. Further, univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to evaluate factors predicting a low FT level.

- **Results**: The median age was 43.5 years, with median testosterone and FT levels at 303 ng/dL and 6.3 ng/dL, respectively. The prevalence and severity of hypogonadal symptoms (ADAM and qADAM) were similar between men with low (< 6.4 ng/mL) and normal FT levels. An association between age and 3 of the 10 hypogonadal symptoms (decreased enjoyment in life, sadness, and deterioration of work performance) was observed with low FT in univariate analysis. However, only younger age was positively associated with FT in multivariable analysis.

- **Conclusion**: We did not observe a relationship between hypogonadal symptoms and FT in men with near-normal testosterone levels.

### Optimizing sexual and reproductive health across the lifespan in people with cystic fibrosis [^115fmc2H]. Pediatric pulmonology (2022).

After establishing a diagnosis and etiology of hypogonadism, treatment of hypogonadism in CF should be individualized. Potentially reversible causes of low testosterone should target the primary cause, such as prolactinoma, medications, illness, or nutritional status. When hypogonadism results from stress or illness (hypothalamic hypogonadism), serum testosterone levels may recover when health stabilizes. However, in some cases, testosterone levels may remain chronically low, and initiation of testosterone therapy may be indicated to reverse symptoms of hypogonadism and/or improve bone health.

Long-term data are limited in CF regarding the impact of testosterone therapy on improving sexual and reproductive health (SRH), increasing bone density, and reducing fractures in men with CF. It is important to discuss the impact of testosterone therapy on fertility potential, as testosterone therapy will reduce spermatogenesis. Considering the potential long-term risks of testosterone therapy, the duration of treatment needs to be individualized. Furthermore, the impact of highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT) on restoring testosterone levels in hypogonadal men with CF is not yet understood.

Despite these limitations in our knowledge, it is clear that men with CF desire more discussions surrounding SRH concerns, and thus care providers should routinely initiate such conversations.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113Y6q86]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The patient does not exhibit unexplained anemia that might suggest hypogonadism. His osteopenia is consistent with, but not specific for, sex steroid deficiency. Observational and experimental studies consistently indicate that bone health is typically compromised at serum total testosterone concentrations of < 200 ng/dL (6.9 nmol/L).

The initial assessment identifies comorbidities that could be partially responsible for his clinical presentation. Reduced pedal pulses and erectile dysfunction indicate likely atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular risk. The clinical history suggests uncontrolled sleep apnea could be the primary cause of his fatigue, contributing to a suppressed HPT axis and a factor in his erectile dysfunction. Notably, hypoxemia in older men with sleep apnea can be associated with increases in hematocrit, potentially masking testosterone deficiency–associated anemia in this patient.

There are no clinical features suggesting classic organic causes of hypogonadism, such as Klinefelter syndrome, hypopituitarism, pituitary mass effect, or endogenous Cushing syndrome. He is not taking medications that can suppress the HPT axis, such as opioids or glucocorticoids. Furthermore, there is no history of common risk factors for primary and secondary hypogonadism, including testicular trauma, radiation to the pelvis, chemotherapy, significant head trauma, or radiation to the head or neck. In summary, his clinical probability of classic pathologic hypogonadism is low to moderate. His symptoms might be due to depression (with a false negative result in the Patient Health Questionnai).

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114XKuPY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The first step in evaluating the patient is to determine his pretest probability of hypogonadism. There is significant overlap between the nonspecific symptoms of hypogonadism and depression. Due to his report of depressed mood and fatigue, the patient was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 screening tool, which screened negative for major depression.

Careful assessment for symptoms and signs that are more specific for hypogonadism is a key initial step in the evaluation. In the initial cross-sectional report from the European Male Ageing Study, three sexual symptoms — low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections — were the only symptoms (out of a total of 19 candidate symptoms) that were consistently associated with low serum testosterone in a syndromic fashion. Diminished libido had the highest odds ratio for a low serum testosterone concentration. Of note, this epidemiology study cannot determine causality. Since reduced sexual activity has been proposed to lower serum testosterone, the observed association of sexual symptoms with low serum testosterone concentrations in the European Male Ageing Study might reflect reverse causation. In this study, the prevalence of these sexual symptoms was 25% to 35% even in men with normal serum testosterone. His symptoms of fatigue and low mood are nonspecific and have low diagnostic value. They may be caused by systemic disease. However, the constellation of symptoms of sexual dysfunction and low serum testosterone concentration remains a critical factor in the evaluation process.

### Testosterone replacement therapy for male hypogonadism [^117KbkG9]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Testosterone deficiency, or male hypogonadism, is a clinical syndrome characterized by persistently low serum testosterone levels alongside symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency. Studies suggest that testosterone replacement therapy may improve sexual function, depressive symptoms, bone density, and lean body mass. Evidence is conflicting regarding its effect on cardiovascular events and mortality. Although prior studies suggested that testosterone replacement therapy increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, a large randomized trial demonstrated that it does not increase the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, even in patients at high risk.

After a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks through shared decision-making, testosterone replacement therapy should be considered for men with testosterone deficiency to correct selected symptoms and induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics. Treatment methods should take into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, potential for medication interactions, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving testosterone replacement therapy for symptom improvement, potential adverse effects, and adherence. Serum testosterone, hematocrit, and prostate-specific antigen levels should be measured at baseline and at least annually in men 40 years or older receiving testosterone replacement therapy.

He began transdermal testosterone therapy at a typical replacement dosage, and the dosage was adjusted to achieve a serum total testosterone in the normal range. At 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations, he reported an improved sense of well-being and sexual function. His serum hemoglobin and hematocrit had increased 5% above baseline, but both remained in the normal range. With diet and exercise, he lost another 4.3 kg and now weighs 93.0 kg. He had lost a total of 6.3 kg (∼6% of body weight since his initial evaluation). At the 12-month follow-up, he reported that the "testosterone therapy does not seem to be working as well for sexual function". His bone density (2 years after the last bone densitometry) was not significantly changed.

After discussion, he agreed to discontinue testosterone therapy and reassess serum testosterone. Two months after discontinuation, his serum total testosterone was 260 ng/dL (9.02 nmol/L; reference range, 264–916 ng/dL or 9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in a validated, harmonized assay, and his serum free T was 75 pg/mL (259 pmol/L; reference range, 66–272.3 pg/mL or 229–710 pmol/L). Repeat testing 3 months after discontinuation demonstrated a serum total testosterone of 266 ng/dL (9.2 nmol/L) and a serum calculated free T of 77 pg/mL (267 pmol/L). He noticed no change in symptoms after the discontinuation of testosterone therapy. He inquired about a higher dosage of testosterone.

### Performance of total testosterone measurement to predict free testosterone for the biochemical evaluation of male hypogonadism [^116p18DP]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend serum total testosterone measurement as the initial test to evaluate male hypogonadism, reserving free testosterone assessment for men with suspected sex hormone-binding globulin abnormalities or total testosterone near the lower limit of normal. We determined the performance of total testosterone measurement as a test to identify men with normal vs. low free testosterone.

- **Materials and methods**: We examined the electronic medical records of all 3,672 men evaluated for hypogonadism by a serum testosterone panel, including total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, albumin, and calculated free testosterone, from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2007, in a network that serves veterans in Washington.

- **Results**: The sensitivity and specificity of low total testosterone (less than 280 ng/dl) to rule out and predict low calculated free testosterone were 91.0% and 73.7%, respectively. At thresholds of less than 350 and less than 400 ng/dl, the sensitivity of total testosterone for low calculated free testosterone increased to 96.8% and 98.2%, and at thresholds of less than 150 and less than 200 ng/dl, specificity increased to 98.9% and 92.6%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Total testosterone between 280 and 350 ng/dl is not sensitive enough to reliably exclude hypogonadism. Total testosterone must exceed 350 to 400 ng/dl to reliably predict normal free testosterone. Except when levels are less than 150 ng/dl, total testosterone measurement has low specificity for the biochemical diagnosis of hypogonadism.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^112rVxjX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question of whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, the 2018 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend determining free testosterone concentrations either directly from equilibrium dialysis assays or by calculations using total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and albumin concentrations. This approach should be used in patients with conditions that alter SHBG, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, use of corticosteroids, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, SHBG gene polymorphisms, older age, HIV, cirrhosis, hepatitis, hyperthyroidism, certain anticonvulsants, and estrogens. It is also recommended when initial total testosterone concentrations are at or near the lower limit of the normal range (200–400 ng/dL). Do not use direct analog-based free testosterone immunoassays.

### Evaluation of the impact of functional hypogonadism in body composition and weight loss in men undergoing bariatric surgery [^113CvWVz]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Obesity and hypogonadism are linked in a vicious cycle: low testosterone levels favor weight gain, and adiposity induces hypogonadism. We aimed to investigate if low levels of testosterone in the pre-operative period of bariatric surgery impact postoperative weight loss (WL) and body composition (BC).

- **Material and methods**: A prospective, observational study included male patients who qualified for bariatric surgery. Patients underwent clinical evaluation, hormonal evaluation, and assessment of body composition measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in both pre-operative and postoperative periods.

- **Results**: We evaluated 36 patients with a mean age of 37.1 ± 10.2 years, weight of 131.3 ± 14.3 kg, and BMI of 44.4 ± 4.95 kg/m². Considering total testosterone (TT) < 264 mg/dL and free testosterone < 6.5 mg/dL (when TT was borderline), hypogonadism was found in 18 patients (50%). Among the 20 patients who underwent the total evaluation in the pre-operative period, the excess weight was greater in hypogonadal men (58.1 ± 16 vs. 51.1 ± 13.5 kg) as well as the body fat percentage (BFP) (46.1 ± 4.3 vs. 45.1 ± 4.5%), however, without statistical significance. After surgery, TT returned to normal in all hypogonadal patients, and patients showed similar WL and BFP. Regarding the relationship between visceral fat and testosterone, a moderate correlation was observed between the change in TT levels and the reduction in visceral fat.

- **Conclusions**: Although frequently observed, low levels of TT in the pre-operative period do not impact post-surgical outcomes in terms of WL or BC. The normalization of TT.

### Low free testosterone is associated with hypogonadal signs and symptoms in men with normal total testosterone [^114XFAuG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

During aging, total testosterone (TT) declines and SHBG increases, resulting in a greater decrease in calculated free T (cFT). Currently, guidelines suggest using TT to diagnose androgen deficiency and to reserve cFT only for men with borderline TT.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to investigate if either low cFT or low TT is more strongly associated with androgen-related clinical endpoints.

- **Methods**: A total of 3334 community-dwelling men, aged 40–79 years, were included in this study. Differences in clinical variables between the referent group of men with both normal TT (≥ 10.5 nmol/liter) and normal cFT (≥ 220 pmol/liter) and those who had normal TT/low cFT, low TT/normal cFT, and low TT/low cFT were assessed by regression models adjusted for age, center, body mass index, and comorbidities.

- **Results**: A total of 2641 men had normal TT (18.4 ± 5.5 [mean ± SD] nmol/liter)/normal cFT (326 ± 74 pmol/liter), 277 men had normal TT (14.2 ± 3.7)/low cFT (194 ± 23), 96 men had low TT (9.6 ± 0.7)/normal cFT (247 ± 20), and 320 men had low TT (7.8 ± 2.5)/low cFT (160 ± 55). Men with normal TT/low cFT were older and in poorer health. They had higher SHBG and LH and reported more sexual and physical symptoms, whereas hemoglobin and bone ultrasound parameters were lower compared to the referent group. Men with low TT/normal cFT were younger and more obese. They had lower SHBG, but LH was normal, whereas features of androgen deficiency were lacking.

- **Conclusions**: Low cFT, even in the presence of normal TT, is associated with androgen deficiency-related symptoms. Normal cFT, despi

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^112vveXt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

In the T-Trials, while testosterone therapy had no significant effects on vitality and mood in the primary analyses focusing on the subgroup of men with reduced vitality and mood at baseline, secondary analyses showed a small benefit on vitality and mood in the entire group of men randomized in the T-Trials. There was no measured effect on cognitive function; however, cognitive function tests used in the trial might have been too insensitive. Overall, in men meeting the inclusion criteria of the T-Trials, testosterone treatment improves most aspects of sexual function and might lead to small improvements in vitality, mood, and depressive symptoms. Numerous tools have been utilized to measure the effects of testosterone on quality of life. A recent meta-analysis suggested a potential benefit, but the effect size was small, with low-to-moderate-certainty evidence.

- **Muscle strength and physical function**: Increased lean mass (by about 1.6 to 4.7 kg) is one of the most consistent effects of testosterone treatment. In older men with mobility limitations, testosterone improves leg-press strength and stair-climbing power. In the T-Trials, testosterone treatment improved walking distance (assessed by the 6-minute walking test) and enhanced self-reported walking ability, but it did not reduce the risk of falls.

- **Glucose metabolism**: Testosterone therapy reduces fat mass by about 1.6 to 4.3 kg but does not consistently improve measures of insulin resistance or glycemic control in men with low serum testosterone and established T2D.

### Etiology and treatment of hypogonadism in adolescents [^114D3jkq]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Adequate functioning at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is necessary for normal gonadal development and subsequent sex steroid production. Deficiencies at any level of the axis can lead to a hypogonadal state. The causes of hypogonadism are heterogeneous and may involve any level of the reproductive system. This review discusses various causes of hypogonadism, describes the evaluation of hypogonadal states, and outlines treatment options for the induction of puberty in affected adolescents. Whereas some conditions are clearly delineated, the exact etiology and underlying pathogenesis of many disorders is unknown.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115LrmTB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Reproducibly low serum total testosterone concentrations measured by an accurate testosterone assay on a sample drawn in the early morning (7–10 AM) in the fasting state are a cornerstone of the diagnosis of male hypogonadism. It is optimal to use a total testosterone assay that has been validated by an accuracy-based standardization or quality control program with a normal range of 264–916 ng/dL (9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in healthy, young men. Use of such an assay facilitates application of findings from the T-Trials, the largest randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing testosterone versus placebo with clinically important outcomes in men with low serum testosterone concentrations, and the soon-to-be-reported TRAVERSE study, a large RCT with cardiovascular outcomes; these trials used a standardized, harmonized total testosterone assay with this normal range.

If the initial serum total testosterone is low, confirmation is required. Without compelling evidence (e.g. specific clinical features such as very small testes and high serum gonadotropin concentrations), androgen deficiency should not be diagnosed with a single low testosterone concentration due to significant diurnal and day-to-day variation. Up to 30% of older men with a low serum testosterone concentration have a normal value on repeat testing. Overnight fasting increases serum testosterone by 9% to 16% and reduces the significant diurnal variability of serum testosterone concentrations. Most experts prefer to err in underdiagnosing rather than overdiagnosing.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113BvEFr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

This patient might have experienced a placebo effect from testosterone therapy that typically abates after approximately six months. The sense of well-being and sexual function are complex and depend upon multiple factors beyond serum sex steroid hormone concentrations and the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis. About 60% to 70% of men discontinue testosterone therapy within 12 months of the initial prescription; this high discontinuation rate is consistent with the conclusion that most eugonadal men fail to have a clinically significant and durable benefit from testosterone therapy at conventional dosages used for hypogonadal men.

The high discontinuation rate is also reassuring because most men who meet the criteria for the diagnosis of hypogonadism after attempts to treat reversible causes are likely to stop unbeneficial testosterone therapy, especially if the duration of testosterone treatment is 12 months or less. An alternative explanation is that this patient had a benefit in sense of well-being and sexual function, which has now been sustained by the restoration of normal HPT axis function as a result of weight loss.

With either explanation, there is no rationale for continuing testosterone therapy for this man. There is also no evidence of benefit from an increased dosage of testosterone in this clinical setting. Extensive anecdotal clinical experience suggests that most men fail to benefit from an increase in dosage when their regimen is sufficient to keep their serum testosterone concentration in the normal range.

### Baseline testosterone levels as a predictor of hypogonadism resolution in male patients with isolated hyperprolactinemia [^116yoGUs]. Pituitary (2025). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and timing of gonadal axis restoration in men with hypogonadism secondary to hyperprolactinemia after prolactin (PRL) normalization, and to identify factors associated with testosterone (TT) recovery to normal values.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed clinical records of male patients with central hypogonadism who were successfully treated for isolated hyperprolactinemia. Data on PRL, TT, and gonadotropin levels were retrieved for different time points: diagnosis, PRL normalization, gonadal axis restoration (if achieved), and last follow-up. Testosterone replacement therapy within 6 months of PRL normalization was an exclusion criterion.

- **Results**: Twenty-nine patients, with a median age of 50 years (IQR 41–58), were included. The etiology of hyperprolactinemia included prolactinoma (n = 23, 79%), non-functioning pituitary adenoma causing stalk effect (n = 5, 17%), and idiopathic cause (n = 1, 4%). After successful treatment of hyperprolactinemia, 20 patients (69%) spontaneously recovered the gonadal axis, achieving normal TT levels. Ten patients normalized PRL and TT values concurrently, while the other 10 exhibited a median delay of 6.5 months (4–9.25) after PRL normalization; the former group showed lower baseline PRL levels at diagnosis compared to the latter (p = 0.007). Patients who recovered the gonadal axis had higher baseline TT values compared to those with persistent hypogonadism (p = 0.02). At ROC curve analysis, baseline TT was a good predictor of spontaneous gonadal axis recovery after PRL normalization (AUC 0.869, p = 0.002).

- **Conclusion**: This study concludes that, in patients with isolated hyperprolactinemia, baseline testosterone levels serve as a reliable predictor of gonadal axis recovery following PRL normalization.

### Practice patterns in the diagnosis and management of hypogonadism: A survey of Sexual Medicine Society of North America members [^116vyEgc]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

To describe practice patterns in the diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism, as the optimal approaches are controversial. Multiple therapeutic options are currently available for hypogonadal men, and treatment patterns vary considerably. The safety of testosterone therapy (TTh) remains understudied.

- **Materials and methods**: A 23-question survey regarding the diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism was sent to all members of the Sexual Medicine Society of North America. Subgroup analyses compared responses between sexual medicine fellows and non-fellows, as well as between academic and non-academic physicians, using a chi-squared analysis.

- **Results**: A total of 101 responses were included for analysis. The most common cutoff value used to diagnose hypogonadism was 300 ng/dL (55%, range = 200–400 ng/dL), and 31% felt comfortable giving TTh to a symptomatic patient with normal serum testosterone levels. No respondents felt that TTh increased the risk of cardiovascular events. Of those surveyed, 68% would prescribe TTh to a hypogonadal man with severe lower urinary tract symptoms, and 64% would offer TTh to a man with low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance. Fellowship-trained physicians were more likely to prescribe TTh to a man with hypogonadism but normal serum testosterone (P = 0.038). They differed in the types of therapy they would use for men with hypogonadism who wish to preserve or regain fertility.

- **Conclusion**: Significant variety exists in the diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism. The majority of physicians will only prescribe TTh in the setting of subnormal serum testosterone levels.

### Diagnosis and treatment of testosterone deficiency: Recommendations from the Fourth International Consultation for Sexual Medicine (ICSM 2015) [^115ZjqfJ]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Testosterone deficiency (TD), also known as hypogonadism, is a condition affecting a substantial proportion of men as they age. The diagnosis and management of TD can be challenging, and clinicians should be aware of the literature on this condition.

- **Aim**: To review the available literature concerning the diagnosis and management of TD and to provide clinically relevant recommendations from the Fourth International Consultation for Sexual Medicine (ICSM) meeting.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed using the PubMed database for English-language original and review articles published or e-published up to January 2016.

- **Main outcome measures**: Levels of evidence (LoEs) and grades of recommendations are provided based on a thorough analysis of the literature and committee consensus.

- **Results**: Recommendations were given for 12 categories of TD: definition, clinical diagnosis, routine measurement, screening questionnaires, laboratory diagnosis, threshold levels for the biochemical diagnosis of TD, prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, fertility, testosterone (T) formulations, alternatives to T therapy, and adverse events and monitoring. A total of 42 recommendations were made: of these, 16 were unchanged from the Third ICSM, and 26 new recommendations were made during this Fourth ICSM. Most of these recommendations were supported by LoEs 2 and 3. Several key new recommendations include the following: the clinical manifestations of TD occur as a result of decreased serum androgen concentrations or activity.

### Clinical practice update on testosterone therapy for male hypogonadism: Contrasting perspectives to optimize care [^111WJUkJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

The US Endocrine Society (ES) has published a clinical practice guideline on testosterone therapy for men with hypogonadism. Similarly, the Endocrine Society of Australia (ESA) released a position statement on managing male hypogonadism. Both documents emphasize diagnosing men who are androgen deficient due to organic (classical or pathological) hypogonadism arising from disorders of the hypothalamus, pituitary, or testes, as they assuredly benefit from testosterone therapy.

- **Diagnosis and treatment recommendations**: Both ES and ESA recognize that men with an intact gonadal axis may have low testosterone concentrations, such as older men or those with obesity or other medical comorbidities. The ES guidelines classify these symptomatic men as having organic (advanced age) or functional (obesity, medical comorbidities) hypogonadism, and suggest that testosterone therapy could be offered through shared decision-making between clinicians and patients. In contrast, the ESA does not recommend testosterone therapy for these men.

- **Diagnostic criteria**: The ES offers a reference range for total testosterone established in young men, while the ESA cites age-standardized reference ranges. The ES recommends using both free testosterone and total testosterone to identify hypogonadism when sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels are altered or when total testosterone is borderline. On the other hand, the ESA recommends confirmatory biochemical testing with total testosterone, acknowledging that this may be lower than expected if SHBG concentrations are low.

- **Safety considerations**: Both societies emphasize the importance of identifying pre-existing prostate and cardiovascular disease prior to initiating testosterone therapy, with ES providing specific recommendations.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113BAEvt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

There is evidence that lifestyle changes might increase mean serum testosterone by 10% to 30%, which could normalize testosterone concentrations and improve many symptoms overlapping with hypogonadism. However, the data primarily stem from cohort studies of supervised lifestyle interventions. These studies typically involved small numbers of participants who were younger (30–50 years of age), had relatively short follow-ups (< 1–2 years), and employed variable methodologies for assessing serum testosterone concentrations. Some evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions might be less successful in normalizing serum testosterone concentrations and improving function in older, frailer men. The extent to which the increase in serum testosterone is responsible for improvements seen in androgen deficiency-like features (e.g. erectile function, physical performance) remains uncertain. Whether concomitant testosterone treatment enhances the efficacy of lifestyle interventions needs further study, although preliminary evidence suggests that testosterone therapy preserves lean mass compared to placebo during caloric restriction.

In summary, the most important intervention for our patient and many older men with a high BMI and low serum testosterone concentration may be lifestyle changes, such as increased exercise, caloric restriction, and improved diet, to reduce weight.

### Late-onset male hypogonadism: Clinical and laboratory evaluation [^112Uxunn]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Late-onset male hypogonadism (LOH) is a clinical and biochemical syndrome associated with advancing age and characterized by low serum testosterone concentrations. An understanding of the physiology of androgens in the aging man is essential for the appropriate diagnosis of LOH. Clinical assessment of androgen status relevant to clinical biochemists and chemical pathologists is outlined in this review. Laboratory investigations of androgen status in men are not without pitfalls, and the authors highlight problems associated with measuring and calculating serum testosterone and its fractions, the interpretation of which can be problematic. Clinical guidelines and recommendations regarding the diagnosis and monitoring of LOH are also summarized.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1176zTxe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

In this article, we use a case-based approach to outline the assessment and management of men older than 50 years presenting with features of androgen deficiency and a low testosterone level, based on a review of the literature (PubMed), using the search terms "male hypogonadism", "testosterone deficiency", "androgen deficiency", "functional hypogonadism", and "late-onset hypogonadism", as well as the clinical experience of the authors. We will focus on the diagnosis and management of possible androgen deficiency (Fig. 1). Fertility will not be discussed.

Many of the principles and recommendations that we discuss are pertinent to men under age 50. However, we focus on men ≥ 50 years old in this manuscript because of the following reasons:

1. The prevalence of low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology increases significantly in men starting at age 40–50.
2. Most of the high-quality epidemiological and randomized controlled studies of men with low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology were performed in men ≥ 50 years old.
3. The diagnostic evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years old differ from younger men because:
	a) Evaluation for hypothalamic and pituitary disease with sellar imaging and evaluation for iron overload syndromes is often unnecessary in older men.
	b) Infertility due to HPT dysfunction is less commonly important for men ≥ 50 years old.
	c) Long-term suppression of the HPT axis (iatrogenic androgen deficiency) is much more likely to occur with exogenous testosterone therapy in men ≥ 50 years old.

### Male hypogonadism: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^111SfpQr]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). Low credibility.

Organic male hypogonadism due to irreversible hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) pathology is easily diagnosed and treated with testosterone-replacement therapy. However, controversy surrounds the global practice of prescribing testosterone to symptomatic men with low testosterone and non-gonadal factors reducing health status, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and aging (i.e. functional hypogonadism), but without identifiable HPT axis pathology. Health optimization remains the gold-standard management strategy. Nevertheless, in the last decade, large clinical trials and an individual patient data meta-analysis of smaller clinical trials confirmed that testosterone therapy induces modest, yet statistically significant, improvements in sexual function without increasing short-term to medium-term cardiovascular or prostate cancer risks in men with functional hypogonadism. Although testosterone improves bone mineral density and insulin sensitivity in these men, trials from the last decade suggest insufficient evidence to determine the safety and effectiveness of using this hormone for the prevention of fractures or type 2 diabetes. This review discusses the pathogenesis and diagnosis of male hypogonadism and appraises the evidence underpinning the management of this condition.

### Recent advancement in the treatment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism [^116eqaTc]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

The concept of male hypogonadism is often associated with low testosterone production by the testes. This notion derives from adult endocrinology; indeed, during adulthood, testosterone is the most conspicuous testicular hormone because of its circulating levels and target organ actions. Conversely, in pediatric endocrinology, basal serum testosterone determination is helpful only during the first months following birth and after mid-puberty. During the rest of infancy and childhood, serum testosterone is physiologically below the detectable levels using classical assays. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B are more adequate biomarkers to initially screen testicular function.

- **Ontogeny of the anatomical changes and serum levels of reproductive axis hormones in males**: In the early stages of the fetal period, testicular hormones begin to be produced before gonadotrophins and are responsible for the virilization of the internal and external genitalia. From the second trimester of fetal life onwards, luteinizing hormone (LH) regulates testosterone (T) secretion by Leydig cells, whereas follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) controls Sertoli cell proliferation and AMH and inhibin B secretion. FSH induces testicular enlargement while T is involved in testicular descent to the scrotum and penile enlargement. During the 3–6 months following birth (also known as 'mini-puberty'), the reproductive axis remains active, but then LH and T decline to undetectable levels during childhood. Conversely, Sertoli cells remain functional.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11798Y7c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

To update the "Testosterone Therapy in Men With Androgen Deficiency Syndromes" guideline published in 2010, a task force appointed by the Endocrine Society, consisting of 10 medical content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist, participated in the development of this guideline.

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. This approach describes the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and utilized the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus development was achieved through one group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications. Endocrine Society committees and members, along with the cosponsoring organization, were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline.

The conclusions recommend diagnosing hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency, combined with unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. It is recommended to measure fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. Confirmation of the diagnosis should be done by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone-binding globulin, obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimation using an accurate method is recommended.

### Female hypogonadism: Evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis [^112tfS8z]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Female hypogonadism refers to deficient or abnormal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, which clinically presents with menstrual cycle disturbances. It can result from a congenital or acquired cause, with the defect present at the level of the hypothalamus, pituitary, or ovary. A careful history, physical exam, and selected laboratory testing can often determine the locus of the defect and whether it results from a structural or hormonal problem. Laboratory testing generally relies on basal hormone levels; however, timing of blood sampling in relation to menses is important for interpretation of the data.
