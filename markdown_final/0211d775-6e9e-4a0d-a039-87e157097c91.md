## Question

What liver labs show obstructive pattern

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which liver laboratory tests show an obstructive (cholestatic) pattern. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the cholestatic pattern and its pathophysiologic basis. Then, I should verify the primary biochemical markers, especially alkaline phosphatase and how to confirm hepatic origin with GGT. Next, I will review bilirubin fractionation and visibility thresholds for jaundice. After that, I need to examine the behavior of AST/ALT and note exceptions. I will then integrate the overall profile to recognize the pattern, correlate it with clinical etiologies, and decide on ancillary tests including imaging and disease-specific serologies. Finally, I should consider diagnostic performance thresholds, special populations, and synthesize management implications with clear next steps.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: a cholestatic or obstructive pattern reflects impaired bile formation or flow involving bile ducts and cholangiocytes, producing a lab signature that differs from hepatocellular injury; conceptually, cholestatic injury is defined by a disproportionate elevation in alkaline phosphatase compared with aminotransferases, whereas hepatocellular injury shows the opposite pattern, and in DILI the pattern can be formally classified as cholestatic using the R-ratio framework, which I need to remember to apply when appropriate [^117MpALN] [^115HFR5J].

> I will now examine the primary biochemical marker and ask, is alkaline phosphatase the cornerstone here; wait, let me verify that the hepatic isoenzyme is indeed what we're capturing: ALP is produced predominantly by the biliary epithelium, and in cholestasis the rise should be clearly disproportionate to AST/ALT, which distinguishes a cholestatic pattern from hepatitic patterns, though I need to keep in mind that ALP also comes from bone and other tissues and thus requires source confirmation before anchoring on a biliary diagnosis [^117MpALN] [^113Fviv2].

> Hold on, I should verify hepatic origin so I don't ascribe a bone source to the liver: GGT is abundant in liver but not in bone, so concurrent elevation of GGT with ALP supports a hepatic source; however, let me reconsider the specificity issue because GGT can be induced by alcohol, obesity, and drugs, meaning that while it helps confirm source, it does not, by itself, specify the disease, and I should avoid over-interpreting an isolated GGT rise without an ALP partner [^113Fviv2] [^115eFu7U].

> Next, I should review bilirubin fractionation because I need to ensure I'm recognizing obstructive hyperbilirubinemia correctly: most circulating bilirubin is unconjugated, and an elevation of conjugated bilirubin suggests hepatocellular disease or cholestasis; clinically apparent jaundice generally occurs when total bilirubin exceeds about 3 mg/dL, but wait, let me verify a potential pitfall — early or partial obstruction may not yet elevate bilirubin markedly, so fractionation remains crucial even when scleral icterus is absent [^117MpALN] [^115Txxj6] [^112SbFyr].

> I will now examine AST and ALT because I need to check whether I'm seeing a hepatocellular overlay or a purely cholestatic process: in cholestasis, AST/ALT are usually normal or only mildly elevated compared to ALP, reflecting secondary hepatocyte injury from retained bile acids rather than the primary injury; but wait, what if there is a dramatic transaminase spike — rarely, choledocholithiasis can present with AST/ALT in the thousands, so I should double-check clinical context and imaging rather than excluding obstruction solely on very high transaminases [^117MpALN] [^1143Kinu].

> Let me integrate the biochemical profile so I don't miss the pattern amid the details: the classic obstructive pattern comprises a clearly disproportionate elevation in ALP accompanied by elevated GGT indicating hepatic origin, a rise in conjugated bilirubin when obstruction is more advanced, and AST/ALT that are normal or only modestly elevated; I should confirm this aligns with the patient's presentation and avoid over-reliance on a single analyte in isolation [^117MpALN] [^112XLmib].

> Next, I should review likely etiologies to localize the problem and guide tests: intrahepatic cholestasis includes PBC, PSC, drug-induced cholestasis, and infiltrative disease such as hepatic sarcoidosis, whereas extrahepatic causes include choledocholithiasis, malignant biliary strictures, pancreatic head cancer, and benign strictures; I need to ensure the clinical context supports the short list and remember that jaundiced patients with dilated ducts on imaging often have extrahepatic obstruction, while autoimmune markers and cholangiography guide intrahepatic cholangiopathies like PSC and PBC [^112SbFyr] [^1111f7Ba] [^113iwSYZ] [^1143cLzt] [^117Te9tm].

> I should confirm the ancillary tests that refine diagnosis and avoid premature closure: assess synthetic function with PT/INR and albumin, look for leukocytosis if cholangitis is suspected, obtain AMA and PBC-specific antibodies if PBC is on the table, and prioritize right-upper-quadrant ultrasound as the first-line imaging to distinguish intra- from extrahepatic processes, escalating to MRCP or CT when further delineation is needed; if the pattern and serology are suggestive of PSC, cholangiographic imaging is essential, and I should reserve biopsy for equivocal serologies or suspected overlap [^113EquiN] [^113iwSYZ] [^117GpgkE] [^112SbFyr].

> Hold on, let me verify diagnostic performance so I don't misinterpret a normal panel: in suspected choledocholithiasis and acute cholecystitis contexts, normal liver tests carry a high negative predictive value, around 97%, whereas any abnormal test has a poor positive predictive value, so I should not overcall stones based solely on mild biochemical changes; also, the literature hasn't conclusively shown that serum ALP or bilirubin outperform ultrasound for stone detection, reinforcing the need for imaging rather than relying on labs alone; for chronic cholestasis like PBC, rising bilirubin has prognostic significance and should trigger transplant evaluation when thresholds rise, so I need to track bilirubin trajectories carefully [^112Bus4P] [^116A5Ru9] [^1161DgWK].

> I need to ensure I account for special populations and exceptions so I don't miss time-sensitive diagnoses: in pregnancy, physiologic ALP elevation complicates interpretation, so I should use GGT and bile acids to evaluate intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and use ultrasound as first-line imaging; in infants, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia beyond two weeks mandates urgent evaluation for biliary atresia; and I must remember that normal aminotransferases do not exclude significant liver disease, particularly metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, so clinical suspicion should still drive workup when risks are high [^116DNUgZ] [^115noHSV] [^111ZSiUL] [^116bPbMD].

> Final synthesis, but let me double-check alignment with guidelines before concluding: an obstructive cholestatic pattern is best recognized by ALP elevation that is disproportionate to AST/ALT, supported by a concurrent rise in GGT confirming hepatic origin, with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia strengthening the case in more complete obstruction; exceptions such as stone-related aminotransferase spikes and early obstruction with normal bilirubin must be kept in mind, and classification frameworks like the DILI R-ratio can help formalize the pattern; this biochemical signature should immediately trigger targeted imaging, principally ultrasound followed by MRCP as indicated, and disease-specific serologies when intrahepatic cholangiopathies are suspected, such as AMA and PBC-specific antibodies for PBC, with subsequent risk stratification and management based on etiology and severity [^117MpALN] [^115HFR5J] [^112SbFyr] [^113iwSYZ].

---

The obstructive (cholestatic) pattern on liver labs is defined by **ALP and GGT predominance** with **conjugated hyperbilirubinemia** and only mild transaminase elevations [^117MpALN] [^112RBbyZ]. This pattern **strongly suggests biliary obstruction** and should **prompt imaging** to confirm and localize the cause [^112SbFyr] [^113EquiN].

---

## Key laboratory findings in obstructive liver disease

### Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)

- **ALP elevation**: Disproportionately elevated (typically 3–5× ULN or higher) in cholestasis/obstruction [^117MpALN].
- **Source**: biliary epithelium; elevation reflects impaired bile flow [^113Fviv2].
- **Specificity**: Not specific; confirm hepatic origin with GGT [^113Fviv2] [^115eFu7U].

---

### Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)

- **GGT elevation**: Typically elevated with ALP in obstruction [^115eFu7U] [^117MpALN].
- **Role**: Confirms hepatic origin of ALP when both are elevated [^115eFu7U].
- **Specificity**: Low; can be elevated with alcohol, obesity, or drugs [^115eFu7U] [^113EquiN].

---

### Bilirubin

- **Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia**: Elevated direct bilirubin is characteristic of obstruction [^113EquiN] [^117MpALN].
- **Total bilirubin**: Often elevated due to increased direct fraction [^112RBbyZ].
- **Unconjugated bilirubin**: Typically normal or mildly elevated [^112RBbyZ].

---

### Aminotransferases (ALT and AST)

Aminotransferases (ALT and AST) typically show **mild elevation** (≤ 2–3× ULN) in obstruction [^117MpALN], with ALP and GGT elevations **predominating** over ALT/AST [^115Txxj6] [^115HFR5J].

---

### Other laboratory findings

Other laboratory findings include **Prothrombin time (PT)/INR**, which may be prolonged due to vitamin K malabsorption in ongoing obstruction, and **Serum bile acids**, which are often elevated in cholestasis [^112RBbyZ] [^116DNUgZ].

---

## Laboratory pattern summary

| **Laboratory test** | **Typical findings in obstructive pattern** |
|-|-|
| ALP | Markedly elevated (3–5× ULN or higher) [^117MpALN] |
| GGT | - Elevated <br/> - Confirming hepatic origin of ALP [^115eFu7U] |
| Total bilirubin | - Elevated <br/> - Predominantly conjugated [^112RBbyZ] |
| ALT/AST | Mildly elevated (≤ 2–3× ULN) [^117MpALN] |
| PT/INR | May be prolonged in prolonged obstruction [^113EquiN] |
| Serum bile acids | Elevated [^116DNUgZ] |

---

## Clinical implications and next steps

Imaging with **ultrasound, CT, or MRCP** confirms and localizes obstruction [^112XLmib] [^112SbFyr] [^117Te9tm], and **management** addresses the underlying cause (e.g. stones, strictures, tumors) to relieve obstruction and prevent complications.

---

The obstructive pattern is defined by **ALP and GGT predominance** with **conjugated hyperbilirubinemia** and only **mild transaminase elevations**, which should prompt imaging and targeted management [^117MpALN].

### ACR appropriateness criteria® abnormal liver function tests [^112SbFyr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Liver function tests are commonly obtained in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Various overlapping laboratory patterns can arise due to the derangement of hepatocyte and bile duct function. Imaging tests are pursued to identify the underlying etiology and guide management based on lab results. Liver function tests may reveal mild, moderate, or severe hepatocellular predominance, which can be observed in alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease, acute hepatitis, and acute liver injury due to other causes. A cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase, with or without elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, can be seen in various causes of obstructive biliopathy. Acute or subacute cholestasis with conjugated or unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can occur due to prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic causes.

### The British Society of Gastroenterology/UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^112pZnZn]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Increased awareness of the serological associations of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and the widespread use of blood test-based screening in the community have led to an evolution in the mode of presentation. There has been a shift away from clinically overt disease (e.g. advanced liver disease) towards presentation following identification of liver biochemical abnormality on screening. Increasing awareness of PBC as a cause of chronic fatigue and pruritus may have led to more diagnoses following symptomatic presentation. Given the efficacy of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment in slowing disease progression, early diagnosis may facilitate better outcomes. Treatment failure is more common in those presenting with cirrhosis and in the ductopenic variant of PBC. Despite awareness of PBC and its target demographic, some patients still present with very advanced disease at the point of needing liver transplantation.

- **Consensus care pathways**: The BSG/UK-PBC consensus care pathway for patients with PBC highlights the need for personalized care while emphasizing important pathways. These encompass the crucial 'pillars' of care believed to provide optimal management of disease and its complications.

- **Blood tests**: The diagnostic accuracy of combining cholestatic serum liver tests with PBC-specific serological markers is high (> 95% for both sensitivity and specificity), making blood tests central to PBC diagnosis.

Overall, these guidelines underscore the importance of early detection and individualized care for optimal management of PBC.

### Cholestasis and cholestatic syndromes [^115Zegry]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Cholestatic liver injury is encountered across a wide variety of clinical scenarios ranging from toxin-induced, genetic, to autoimmune in nature. This review summarizes recent findings from what is a burgeoning clinical field.

- **Recent findings**: We highlight observations from cell biology (intracellular signaling molecules), genetics (biliary transporters), and clinical studies (predictors of outcomes) that provide new directions for laboratory and clinical research.

- **Summary**: Treatments for cholestasis and cholestatic syndromes remain largely nonspecific and often ineffective. With the increased precision with which the cell biology of the cholangiocyte and the clinical description of associated diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis and sclerosing cholangitis are understood, new approaches are likely to arise.

### Prolonged, but transient, elevation of liver and biliary function tests in a healthy infant affected with breast milk jaundice [^115uWmRq]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is a common finding in newborns. When it is exaggerated, it is usually investigated in order to exclude several diseases, such as newborn haemolytic diseases, infections, or hypothyroidism. Breast milk jaundice is a form of neonatal jaundice related to breastfeeding, and it is not usually associated with any clinical issue or other laboratory abnormalities. In this case, we describe breast milk jaundice being unexpectedly associated with a significant elevation of plasmatic liver and biliary enzymes. Despite the infant's good clinical condition and growth, several investigations were performed, which ruled out metabolic, infectious, and autoimmune liver diseases. All liver function tests normalized by 6 to 7 months of life. We suggest that the finding of hypertransaminasaemia and hyper-γ-glutamyl transpeptidase in a benign clinical context, as described here, should be followed for 6 to 7 months before pursuing sophisticated and expensive diagnostic investigations aimed at excluding unlikely and severe diseases in a completely asymptomatic infant.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113iwSYZ]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for primary biliary cholangitis" serves as a valuable tool for identifying and diagnosing this chronic liver disease. These criteria provide a systematic approach to diagnosis, focusing on specific biochemical, serological, and histological markers.

- **Biochemical evidence**: Elevated alkaline phosphatase levels indicate cholestasis.
- **Serological markers**: These include antimitochondrial antibodies and primary biliary cholangitis-specific autoantibodies, such as anti-SP100 or anti-GP210.
- **Histological evidence**: Nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and the destruction of interlobular bile ducts are observed when a biopsy is performed.

The diagnostic criteria are considered met if there is biochemical evidence of cholestasis and either the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies or histological evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts. Alternatively, the criteria are met if there are primary biliary cholangitis-specific autoantibodies and either biochemical evidence of cholestasis or histological evidence. If these combinations of markers are not present, the diagnostic criteria for primary biliary cholangitis are not met.

This diagnostic tool is crucial for the accurate identification of primary biliary cholangitis, enabling appropriate treatment and management strategies.

- **OCA postmarketing experience**: A postmarketing, retrospective study of 319 patients found that the proportions of patients with a biochemical response to OCA treatment according to Toronto criteria (ALP > 1.67 × ULN after 2 years on UDCA) were 48% after year 1, 58% after year 2, and 55% at the end of the follow-up period. According to Paris I criteria (ALP ≥ 3 × ULN or AST ≥ 2 × ULN or bilirubin > 1.0 mg/dL), the proportions were 68%, 76%, and 69%, respectively. The authors concluded that the OCA treatment response in PBC is sustained for up to 3 years.

	- In a separate study, 191 patients in the Italian PBC Registry were prospectively analyzed for at least 12 months using the POISE criteria. At 12 months, significant median reductions of ALP (−32.3%), ALT (−31.4%), and bilirubin (−11.2%) were observed, and response rates were 42.9%. Furthermore, premature discontinuation of OCA due to adverse events occurred in 17% of patients, with treatment-induced pruritus as the leading cause of OCA discontinuation (67%). The authors concluded that the efficacy and safety of OCA postmarketing mirror those in the POISE trial.

	- Finally, a postmarketing international study analyzed the effects of OCA in 290 OCA-naive patients within the Global PBC Study Group. In this study, OCA demonstrated biochemical effectiveness comparable to the trial data, with significant reductions from baseline to month 20 in ALP, GGT, and ALT. The study also confirmed safety and acceptable tolerability, with pruritus being the most relevant complaint leading to discontinuation.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1133f5Yq]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood or function tests (LFTs), which are perceived to be inexpensive, are checked ever more frequently in both primary and secondary care in an attempt to exclude liver disease, monitor potential adverse effects of drugs on the liver such as statins, and investigate the generally unwell patient. These tests often produce an abnormal result, the clinical significance of which is unclear. In many cases, they are requested in response to non-specific symptoms where there is little potential link between symptoms and the likelihood of liver disease, or the blood tests are performed for unrelated reasons such as chronic disease monitoring. This commonly leads to a cycle of additional liver blood testing in an otherwise asymptomatic individual. Notably, most patients referred to hospitals with abnormal liver tests do not have any evidence of significant liver disease.

For example, University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust received 130,849 requests for liver blood tests in 2016 from 82 general practices, and of these, 38,636 (30%) contained at least one abnormal result, defined as being outside the stated reference range. The Abnormal Liver Function Investigations Evaluation (ALFIE) study from Tayside in Scotland showed that over a 10-year period, 25% of the community population aged over 16 had liver blood tests, with about a third having at least one abnormal value. Although an abnormal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was predictive of liver disease (HR = 4.2), the rate of detection was remarkable.

### Cholbam [^11788Sry]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

**Hepatic impairment**: Discontinue treatment with Cholbam if liver function does not improve within 3 months of the start of treatment. Discontinue treatment with Cholbam at any time if there are clinical or laboratory indicators of worsening liver function or cholestasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Overdosage (10), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]. Continue to monitor laboratory parameters of liver function and consider restarting at a lower dose when the parameters return to baseline.

### The British Society of Gastroenterology/UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^112qkKck]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendation 19

In patients with an inadequate response to UDCA (or UDCA intolerance) as defined by ALP > 1.67 x ULN and/or elevated bilirubin < 2 x ULN, the addition of OCA (initial dose 5 mg/day, titrating to 10 mg/day at 6 months if tolerated) has been associated with improvements in biochemical surrogates of disease activity reasonably likely to predict improved outcomes. We recommend, in keeping with the NICE evaluation of OCA, that the addition of OCA for patients with an inadequate response to UDCA, or those intolerant of UDCA, is considered. We recommend dose adjustment in patients with advanced liver disease as per the drug label, and careful evaluation of potential benefits and risks, as well as monitoring, in patients with very advanced liver disease (Child Pugh A liver disease with portal hypertension; Child Pugh B and C liver disease).

### Comparative histologic features among liver biopsies with biliary-pattern injury and confirmed clinical diagnoses [^114UTNSH]. Human Pathology (2024). Low credibility.

Biliary-pattern injury in the liver (e.g. duct injury, ductular reaction, cholestasis) can occur in several conditions, including primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), large duct obstruction (LDO), and drug-induced liver injury (DILI). While the histologic changes in these conditions have been individually well described, distinguishing among them often remains challenging, particularly when biopsy samples are limited in size, robust clinical information is unavailable, and/or the pathologist does not feel confident in evaluating liver disease.

This study evaluated histologic features that could aid the diagnosis of biliary-pattern injury on biopsy. We reviewed 121 liver biopsies from clinically confirmed cases of PBC, PSC, chronic LDO, or DILI for multiple clinical and histologic parameters. The rates of these histologic findings were then compared among different entities.

- **Onion-skin fibrosis**: Observed in 14% of PSC in comparison to 0%, 5%, and 0% of PBC, DILI, and chronic LDO, respectively (P = 0.031).

- **Florid duct lesions**: Identified in 21% of PBC compared to 2% of PSC and 0% of DILI and LDO (P = 0.0065).

- **Lobular granulomas**: Present in 42% of PBC, compared to 7% of PSC, 11% of DILI, and 33% of chronic LDO (P = 0.0001).

- **Cholestasis**: More commonly seen in DILI (42%) and chronic LDO (83%) than in PBC (4%) and PSC (16%) (P < 0.0001).

- **Lobular chronic inflammation**: Found in a significantly higher percentage of PBC and LDO than of PSC and DILI (P = 0.0009).

There were significantly fewer cases of PBC showing neutrophils in ductular reaction.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The extent of abnormality is a significant consideration in clinical practice. It is commonly assumed that the degree to which liver blood test results deviate from normal correlates with prognosis. Consequently, threshold values exceeding the upper limit of the reference interval are often used to determine the need for further investigation. However, this assumption lacks support from existing literature. In reality, prognosis is more accurately determined by diagnosis and the context in which tests are requested.

Consider two patients as an example: one with acute hepatitis A infection may have ALT values exceeding 1000 U/L, while another with hepatitis C may have ALT levels within the normal reference interval. Despite this, ten years later, the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be healthy, regardless of management strategy. In contrast, if the patient with hepatitis C is not investigated and diagnosed, they are at significant risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease.

Indeed, the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests that lead to chronic liver disease — non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease, and hepatitis C — often present with only mild to moderate abnormalities. Despite the increased use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable with earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the upper limit of normal for many liver enzymes, such as ALT, may be set too high. This is likely a result of including patients with occult non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on acute-on-chronic liver failure [^111Nwrax]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute-on-chronic liver failure, specifically in relation to evaluating precipitants, the EASL 2023 guidelines recommend a systematic evaluation to identify the most common precipitants. These include proven bacterial infection, alcohol-related hepatitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage with hemodynamic instability, flare of HBV infection, HEV infection, recent use of drugs known to cause cerebral failure, and recent use of drugs known to cause kidney failure. This evaluation should be conducted for all patients admitted for ACLF or developing ACLF during their hospital stay.

### Involvement of the liver in COVID-19: A systematic review [^1171BpVY]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

The management of liver involvement in COVID-19 reveals that the majority of patients experience no or mild liver function abnormalities. In cases of mild COVID-19, hepatic damage may be transient and often returns to normal without special measures. Management primarily involves supportive care with monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs).

- **Diagnostic aspects**: Liver function tests and abdominal imaging are the primary investigations for liver involvement in COVID-19 patients. Monitoring liver biochemistry, including liver enzymes (ALT and AST), serum bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time (PT), is essential for diagnosing liver damage. However, the derangement of these tests is often due to multifactorial reasons, with the systemic inflammatory response from COVID-19 potentially playing a significant role rather than direct liver injury. Testing should be conducted upon admission to establish a baseline and to identify patients with known or suspected underlying liver conditions. Additional biochemical investigations may be warranted for patients with conditions such as hepatitis B or C. The optimal interval for LFTs is unclear, but it is suggested that they be monitored at least twice weekly for COVID-19 patients on potentially liver-toxic medications. Those with abnormal LFT results or preexisting liver disease should undergo more frequent monitoring. Increased serum AST and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) alongside normal ALT should also be noted.

### The British Society of Gastroenterology/UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^116wmcEw]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis, PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease in which a cycle of immune-mediated biliary epithelial cell injury, cholestasis, and progressive fibrosis can culminate over time in an end-stage biliary cirrhosis. Both genetic and environmental influences are presumed relevant to disease initiation. PBC is most prevalent in women and those over the age of 50, but a spectrum of disease is recognized in adult patients globally. Male sex and younger age at onset (1.67× upper limit of normal and/or elevated alanine aminotransferase levels) have been associated with worse outcomes.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^113EquiN]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice in adults can be an indicator of significant underlying disease. It is caused by elevated serum bilirubin levels in the unconjugated or conjugated form. The evaluation of jaundice relies on history and physical examination. The initial laboratory evaluation should include fractionated bilirubin, complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time and/or international normalized ratio, albumin, and protein. Imaging with ultrasonography or computed tomography can differentiate between extrahepatic obstructive and intrahepatic parenchymal disorders. Ultrasonography is the least invasive and least expensive imaging method.

A more extensive evaluation may include additional cancer screening, biliary imaging, autoimmune antibody assays, and liver biopsy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with increased bilirubin production caused by red blood cell destruction, such as hemolytic disorders, and disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs in disorders of hepatocellular damage, such as viral and alcoholic hepatitis and cholestatic disorders like choledocholithiasis and neoplastic obstruction of the biliary tree.

### 2016 WSES guidelines on acute calculous cholecystitis [^112Bus4P]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

- **Elevation of liver biochemical enzymes and/or bilirubin levels**: These are not sufficient to identify acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) patients with choledocholithiasis, and further diagnostic tests are needed.

Liver biochemical tests have historically demonstrated utility in determining the presence of common bile duct stones (CBDS). However, most published studies are not focused on patients with ACC and often include cases of asymptomatic cholelithiasis. Normal liver biochemical tests have a negative predictive value of 97%, whereas the positive predictive value of any abnormal liver biochemical test result is only 15%. The positive predictive value of liver function studies is a poor tool for the prediction of CBDS, even in non-ACC cases, with results ranging from 25 to 50%. In fact, in ACC, liver biochemical tests may be altered due to the acute inflammatory process of the gallbladder and the biliary tree, with 15 to 50% of patients with ACC showing elevation in liver enzymes without choledocholithiasis.

Song et al. demonstrated that of 1178 patients with ACC, 424 had increased liver tests (alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) greater than twice normal levels). Of these, only 246 (58%) had choledocholithiasis. Chang et al. showed that 51% and 41% of ACC patients without choledocholithiasis had elevated ALT and AST, respectively. However, increased bilirubin levels with leukocytosis may predict gangrenous cholecystitis. Padda et al. demonstrated that approximately 30% of patients with ACC without choledocholithiasis had abnormal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and/or bilirubin, and 50% had abnormal ALT.

### Unexplained common bile duct dilatation with normal serum liver enzymes: Diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound and follow-up of this condition [^113Neuy9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

There is scant literature about common bile duct (CBD) dilatation with normal liver function tests (LFTs).

- **Aims**: The aims of this study were to assess the diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in patients with CBD dilatation, normal LFTs, and prior inconclusive imaging tests, and to assess the natural history of these subjects.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed our EUS database for patients referred for evaluation of CBD dilatation, normal LFTs, and prior inconclusive imaging. We excluded patients with a prior endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or a history of biliary obstruction, pancreatitis, or jaundice. Follow-up data were retrieved from medical records or by calling the general practitioners, referring specialists, patients, or their closest relatives.

- **Results**: A total of 57 patients were enrolled. The mean CBD diameter was 12.5 ± 3.6 mm. The majority of patients (50.8%) were asymptomatic. Abnormal EUS findings were recorded in 12 (21%) subjects: 6 patients had a periampullary diverticulum, 2 had ampullary adenoma, 2 had signs of chronic pancreatitis, 1 had a cancer of the pancreatic head, and 1 had a 7 mm CBD stone. Neither age, sex, prior cholecystectomy, clinical presentation, CBD diameter, nor a dilated main pancreatic duct were predictors of abnormal EUS findings. None of the patients complained of biliary symptoms or showed abnormal LFTs on long-term follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: CBD dilatation with normal liver chemistry is not always a benign condition. Even when prior imaging tests are negative, EUS may allow for diagnosis.

### The liver in COVID-19: Prevalence, patterns, predictors, and impact on outcomes of liver test abnormalities [^116mgxHL]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic unprecedented in over a century, with approximately 35 million cases and more than 1 million deaths globally. Although predominantly a lower respiratory illness, other organ injuries are well-recognized. Among these, liver injury is of major interest.

- **Objective**: To define prevalence, pattern, predictors, and impact of liver injury among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

- **Methods**: Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were collected retrospectively among patients admitted to St. Luke's University Hospital with COVID-19 between March 1 and April 18, 2020. The association of liver tests (LTs) with mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and biochemical predictors, was examined.

- **Results**: Data were available on 551 patients. The prevalence of any or ≥ 3 × upper limit of normal transaminase elevation was 61.2% and 9.4% on admission, and 72.1% and 22.4% at peak. Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase elevations were less common on admission (11.4% and 12.6%, respectively) and at peak (17.7% and 22%, respectively). All liver test (LT) elevations were consistently predicted by inflammatory markers. Hyperbilirubinemia predicted mortality on admission and at peak. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had opposite impacts on mortality, with AST positively and ALT negatively associated with mortality. Hence, besides hyperbilirubinemia, the AST:ALT ratio emerged as the best marker for mortality among the LTs.

Conclusion: LT elevations among patients presenting…

### ACG clinical guideline: Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most commonly ordered liver chemistries are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. These tests should be referred to as liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase levels as compared with AST and ALT levels.

The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin, and elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that an elevated ALT is associated with increased liver-related mortality. A truly healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males and 19 to 25 IU/l for females; levels above these should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and/or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation.

For the evaluation of hepatocellular injury, testing includes viral hepatitis A, B, and C. Assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency should be conducted. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be performed.

### The British Society of Gastroenterology/UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^111nZuVs]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis, PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease. In this condition, a cycle of immune-mediated biliary epithelial cell injury, cholestasis, and progressive fibrosis can culminate over time in end-stage biliary cirrhosis. Both genetic and environmental influences are presumed relevant to disease initiation. PBC is most prevalent in women and those over the age of 50, but a spectrum of disease is recognized in adult patients globally. Factors such as male sex and younger age at onset are significant in the context of the disease.

### Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction and portal vein thrombosis in special situations: Need for a new classification [^114DQC5p]. Saudi Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on extrahepatic portal vein obstruction:

- **Definition**: Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction is a vascular liver disorder characterized by variceal dilation, ascites, and portal hypertension.

- **Pathophysiology**: Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction is caused by portal vein thrombosis and portal cavernoma.

- **Disease course**: Acute manifestations include abdominal pain, fever, nausea, postprandial fullness, anorexia, general malaise, splenomegaly, and ascites. Progression may lead to variceal bleeding, bowel infarction, perforation, peritonitis, sepsis, metabolic acidosis, renal and respiratory failure, shock, and death due to multiorgan failure. Chronic manifestations range from asymptomatic presentation to complications of portal hypertension such as variceal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and jaundice. Other symptoms include transient ascites, early satiety, abdominal discomfort, intestinal ischemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and portal biliopathy (jaundice, coagulation disturbances, cholangitis, gallstones, hemobilia, and secondary biliary cirrhosis).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The 1-year mortality rate for liver transplantation patients with portal vein thrombosis is 15%.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests, such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations.

The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

### Ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosis of common bile duct stones [^116A5Ru9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Ultrasound and liver function tests, specifically serum bilirubin and serum alkaline phosphatase, are utilized as screening methods for diagnosing common bile duct stones in individuals suspected of having these stones. Currently, there is no systematic review available that evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound and liver function tests.

- **Objectives**: To determine and compare the accuracy of ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosing common bile duct stones.

- **Search methods**: We conducted searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, BIOSIS, and Clinicaltrials.gov up to September 2012. We also examined the references of included studies to identify additional studies and systematic reviews from various databases, including the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Health Technology Assessment, Medion, and ARIF (Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility). There were no restrictions based on language, publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies that provided data on the number of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives for ultrasound, serum bilirubin, or serum alkaline phosphatase. Studies were only accepted if they confirmed the presence of common bile duct stones by extraction (using surgical or endoscopic methods) for a positive result, or confirmed the absence of stones by surgical or endoscopic negative exploration of the common bile duct, or through a symptom-free follow-up of at least six months for a negative result.

In regard to follow-up and surveillance for liver transplantation, especially concerning post-transplant monitoring of liver function, the AASLD/AST 2013 guidelines recommend individualizing the frequency of follow-up laboratory tests. This should be based on the time elapsed since liver transplantation, prior complications, the stability of serial test results, and the underlying cause of hepatic disease.

### Biliary atresia: Clinical lessons learned [^111ZSiUL]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia is a rare disease of unclear etiology, in which obstruction of the biliary tree causes severe cholestasis, leading to cirrhosis and ultimately death if left untreated. It is the leading cause of neonatal cholestasis and the most frequent indication for pediatric liver transplantation. Any infant with persistent jaundice beyond two weeks of life needs to be evaluated for biliary atresia with fractionation of the bilirubin into conjugated and unconjugated portions. Early performance of a hepatoportoenterostomy in the first 45 days of life to restore bile flow and lessen further damage to the liver is thought to optimize outcomes. Despite surgery, progressive liver scarring occurs, and 80% of patients with biliary atresia will require liver transplantation during childhood.

### Optimizing diagnosis from the medical liver biopsy [^1114y3Y5]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

The histologic assessment of acute and chronic liver disease is based on an accurate description of the pattern of injury within the tissue specimen. Interpretation of the injury pattern requires a review of the associated clinical and laboratory features. The morphologic interpretation achieves relevance only if it satisfactorily explains the clinical syndrome. Clinical characterization of liver disease as having a hepatitic or cholestatic nature is useful in focusing the histologic assessment. The principal histologic patterns have hepatitic, steatotic, biliary, granulomatous, vascular, and metabolic designations, and mixed clinical and histologic patterns are possible.

The goal of this review is to optimize the yield from the liver biopsy examination by indicating the importance of a systematic analysis of the tissue specimen and the crucial need for correlating the clinical and histologic patterns of liver injury. Meaningful histologic interpretations reflect the collaborative effort of the pathologist and the clinical physician. Neoplastic changes typically are cytologic transformations rather than injury patterns, and they are not discussed here.

### Application of the latest advances in evidence-based medicine in primary biliary cholangitis [^1114DbRe]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

When evaluated after 12 months of treatment with UDCA, serum ALP and bilirubin levels correlate closely with the risk of liver transplant or death. Guideline documents do not recommend a specific cutoff value for serum ALP or bilirubin beyond which a second drug should be initiated, although it is important to remember that long-term survival of patients with PBC whose serum ALP is < 1.5 × ULN and bilirubin is normal is similar to that of the general population. However, more recent data suggest that there is additional survival benefit in obtaining normalization of serum ALP and achieving a bilirubin level ≤ 0.6 mg/dL.

Of note, the response to UDCA has been characteristically assessed at 12 months; however, there is growing evidence that the response can be reliably predicted following a shorter period of UDCA treatment. A recent study presented at the 2021 AASLD annual meeting, which included 3,516 UDCA-treated patients with PBC, was performed by the Global PBC Study Group to assess the pattern of biochemical response to treatment. POISE criteria were used to assess the response to treatment. Of those with an inadequate response at 1 year (n = 313, 42%), 210 (67%) would already be identified at 6 months and 103 (33%) after 1 year. In their conclusion, the authors propose an ALP cutoff value of 1.9 × ULN at 6 months as a threshold for adding a second-line therapy. By using this cutoff at 6 months, a 90% negative predictive value is achieved, indicating only a 10% risk of over-treating patients who may not need a second-line therapy.

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^112Rymzo]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

The toll of liver disease continues to rise, and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies, including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

### Ocaliva [^115t7mCP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Hepatic decompensation and failure, sometimes fatal or resulting in liver transplant, have been reported with Ocaliva treatment in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) patients with either compensated or decompensated cirrhosis [see warnings and precautions (5.1)]. Ocaliva is contraindicated in PBC patients with decompensated cirrhosis, a prior decompensation event, or with compensated cirrhosis who have evidence of portal hypertension [see contraindications (4)]. Permanently discontinue Ocaliva in patients who develop laboratory or clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation; have compensated cirrhosis and develop evidence of portal hypertension; or experience clinically significant hepatic adverse reactions while on treatment [see dosage and administration (2.3), warnings and precautions (5.1)].

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113Fviv2]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver (from the biliary epithelium) but is also found in abundance in bone and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys, and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone disease (e.g. metastatic bone disease and bone fractures) and cholestatic liver disease, such as primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases), and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis (elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin).

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin. While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency or a normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget's disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

AST and ALT are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the bloodstream in response to hepatocyte injury or death (hepatitis). Elevations in either of these enzymes are the most common abnormality seen on liver blood tests.

### FIGO guideline on liver disease and pregnancy [^116DNUgZ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is diagnosed in women who present with: (1) pruritus during pregnancy; (2) elevated serum bile acids, or hypercholanemia, often associated with high liver transaminases; and (3) exclusion of other causes of liver dysfunction or itching. ICP is confirmed retrospectively when serum liver tests and pruritus completely normalize within three months after delivery. Elevated concentrations of reproductive hormones during pregnancy are likely to unmask symptoms and biochemical features of ICP in genetically susceptible individuals. This can also lead to gestational cholestasis in those with previously asymptomatic underlying liver diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, or chronic hepatitis C.

ICP affects approximately 0.7% of women of European ancestry, twice as many women of Asian origin and in Scandinavian countries, and up to six times as many women from the Andean nations in Latin America. Heterozygous pathogenic mutations in the biliary transporter genes ABCB4, ABCB11, and ATP8B1, as well as a smaller proportion in other genes involved in bile secretion, have been identified in about 25% of women with ICP.

Most women with ICP present with pruritus in the third trimester, though symptoms may start in the first trimester. Itching is commonly localized to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet but may affect other parts of the body. Variable degrees of elevated serum transaminase activities, in addition to increased serum bile acid concentrations (≥ 19 µmol/L in the non-fasted state), are seen in ICP. Mild hyperbilirubinemia is occasionally observed.

### Reduction of hepatocellular injury after common bile duct ligation using omega-3 fatty acids [^116VFkgU]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Bile duct obstruction and subsequent cholestasis produce hepatocellular injury and an inflammatory response. The fatty acid constitution of cell membranes plays a major role in the inflammatory cascade, with omega-3 fatty acids being recognized for their anti-inflammatory properties. This study proposes that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation would mitigate hepatocellular damage and cell death in a murine model of common bile duct ligation.

- **Methods**: Mice underwent bile duct ligation and were administered either a control soy diet (omega-6) or a Menhaden diet (omega-3). Parameters of liver injury were measured at postoperative days 1, 4, and 8. Serum was analyzed for liver function tests, and liver tissue was assessed for histologic necrosis and inflammation, with apoptosis qualitatively measured.

- **Results**: At day 8, no significant differences in liver function tests were observed between the control and Menhaden groups. Histologic examination showed:
	- **H&E slides**: At day 4, mean necrosis scores were 0.01 ± 0.028 for the Menhaden-fed group and 0.46 ± 0.108 for the soy-fed group (P = .001). At day 8, scores were 0.420 ± 0.107 and 1.22 ± 0.132, respectively (P < .001).
	- **Portal inflammation scores**: At day 4, both Menhaden-fed and soy-fed mice had a score of 1.40 ± 0.245 (P = 1.00). At day 8, scores were 1.80 ± 0.200 and 2.80 ± 0.200, respectively (P = .008).
	- **TUNEL scores for apoptosis**: At day 1, median scores were 6.0 for Menhaden-fed mice and 0.0 for soy-fed mice (P < .001); day 4 scores were 24.0 and 3.0 (P < .001), and day 8 scores were 0.0 and 3.0 (P < .001), respectively.

Although there appears to be a trend toward biochemical protection, further investigation is required to confirm these findings.

### Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis: Partial biliary diversion normalizes serum lipids and improves growth in noncirrhotic patients [^112eHCXt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2000). Low credibility.

Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) usually presents with symptoms such as pruritus, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and growth failure. A subtype of PFIC is characterized by a marked elevation of total serum bile acids, decreased serum apolipoprotein A-1, and high-density lipoprotein levels, but normal gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and cholesterol values. Despite the general ineffectiveness of medical therapy, partial external biliary diversion (DIV) has shown promising outcomes for cholestasis; however, there is limited data on its effects on linear growth, synthetic liver function, and lipid metabolism.

DIV was performed on six noncirrhotic children with PFIC, all suffering from severe pruritus and cholestasis resistant to medical treatment. The children's height was below -1 (median, -2.3) standard deviation score (SDS) for stature across all cases. Bile acids were markedly elevated (307 ± 72 µL/L), while high-density lipoprotein (20 ± 7 mg/dl) and apolipoprotein A-1 (58 ± 37 mg/dl) levels were notably decreased. Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and cholesterol levels remained normal. Synthetic liver function, assessed by cholinesterase activity, the monoethylglycinexylidide test, and Fischer's ratio, was significantly reduced in all subjects except the youngest.

Following DIV, all patients experienced consistent relief from pruritus and normalization of all liver function tests, including cholinesterase activity, the monoethylglycinexylidide test, and Fischer's ratio, as well as the serum lipid profile within one year. Additionally, a significant catch-up growth (median, ± 1.3 SDS) was observed after one year.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115eFu7U]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) is abundant in the liver and also present in the kidney, intestine, prostate, and pancreas but not in bone. Therefore, it can be useful in confirming that an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is of liver and not bony origin. GGT is most commonly elevated as a result of obesity, excess alcohol consumption, or may be induced by drugs. Although an elevated GGT has a low specificity for liver disease, it is one of the best predictors of liver mortality. It is particularly useful in children to establish the likelihood of biliary disease when ALP is not a reliable indicator. Predominant causes of cholestasis in children include congenital abnormalities of the biliary tract and genetic disorders affecting bile synthesis and excretion.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1176q1x8]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The presence of lifestyle risk factors associated with the development of NAFLD, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, is notable. Commonly, non-alcoholic fatty liver is questioned following the incidental observation of abnormal liver blood tests or an echobright liver on an ultrasound scan (USS). The case finding or screening to identify patients with NAFLD remains controversial, with conflicting advice from American and European guidelines. Currently, recent NICE guidance does not advocate for this, although the introduction of new diagnostics and treatments, along with cost-effectiveness analyses, may influence future recommendations.

- **Research recommendation 1**: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for NAFLD in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)

### Jaundice in the adult patient [^116MrcMJ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Jaundice in an adult patient can be caused by a wide variety of benign or life-threatening disorders. Organizing the differential diagnosis by prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic causes may help make the work-up more manageable.

- **Prehepatic causes**: Prehepatic causes of jaundice include hemolysis and hematoma resorption, which lead to elevated levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin.

- **Intrahepatic disorders**: Intrahepatic disorders can lead to unconjugated or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The conjugated (direct) bilirubin level is often elevated by alcohol, infectious hepatitis, drug reactions, and autoimmune disorders.

- **Posthepatic disorders**: Posthepatic disorders also can cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gallstone formation is the most common and benign posthepatic process that causes jaundice; however, the differential diagnosis also includes serious conditions such as biliary tract infection, pancreatitis, and malignancies.

The laboratory work-up should begin with a urine test for bilirubin, indicating that conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is present. If the complete blood count and initial tests for liver function and infectious hepatitis are unrevealing, the work-up typically proceeds to abdominal imaging by ultrasonography or computed tomographic scanning. In a few instances, more invasive procedures such as cholangiography or liver biopsy may be needed to arrive at a diagnosis.

### The British Society of Gastroenterology/UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^116U4UfV]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Opportunities exist to implement the BSG/UK-PBC PBC guidelines into clinical practice through audit and future clinical care. We propose that the following service standards and targets be adopted by clinical teams caring for patients with PBC, with the goal of improving and providing more effective and uniform care for these patients:

- **To exclude alternative aetiologies for cholestasis**: All patients with suspected PBC should have an abdominal ultrasound as part of their baseline assessment (standard 90%).

- **Therapy with UDCA**: All patients should be offered therapy with UDCA. UDCA at 13–15 mg/kg/day is recommended for first-line use in all patients with PBC (standard 90% of patients receiving therapy at an adequate dose or documented to be intolerant).

- **Individualised risk stratification**: To facilitate the identification of patients at risk of progressive disease, individualised risk stratification using biochemical response indices is recommended following 1 year of UDCA therapy (standard 80% of patients receiving UDCA therapy should have their response status recorded in the notes and the criteria used recorded).

- **Evaluation of symptoms**: To highlight the impact on quality of life and to ensure appropriate investigation and treatment, all patients should be evaluated for the presence of symptoms, particularly fatigue and itch (standard 90% of patients should have the presence or absence of fatigue and pruritus recorded in the notes in the last year).

### Severe elevation of liver tests in choledocholithiasis: An uncommon occurrence with important clinical implications [^1143Kinu]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Choledocholithiasis is not commonly associated with dramatic elevations in aminotransferase or total serum bilirubin, and our study presents the largest case series to date exploring this association.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with choledocholithiasis diagnosed via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography at a tertiary referral hospital over 7 years. A total of 740 patients with available liver tests were identified, and we determined the prevalence of aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels greater than 1000 IU/L and total serum bilirubin levels exceeding 10 mg/dL. Clinical characteristics of these two non-overlapping groups were compared.

- **Results**: Of the 740 patients, 45 (6.1%) exhibited AST and/or ALT values greater than 1000 IU/L. On average, AST and ALT levels decreased by 79% and 56% respectively at discharge, which occurred 1 to 8 days later. Total serum bilirubin levels greater than 10 mg/dL were observed in 35 (4.7%) patients, with a decrease of 64% on average at discharge. Compared to the group with elevated bilirubin levels, the group with elevated aminotransferases had significantly more females (93% vs. 43%, P < 0.001), a smaller mean common bile duct diameter (8.5 mm vs. 10.6 mm, P = 0.04), and were more likely to have a history of cholecystectomy (40% vs. 14%, P = 0.01). These 80 patients demonstrated higher utilization of healthcare resources, with half undergoing additional laboratory studies and one-fourth receiving additional imaging studies.

Although severe deficiencies of canalicular transporter enzymes due to biallelic mutations are well known as causes of progressive cholestatic liver disease in children, it is increasingly recognized that milder disease may occur if a single, heterozygous gene mutation is present. This mild disease, generally presenting initially in adulthood, may have a variety of clinical and histological appearances. Bland canalicular cholestasis is the prototypic change, but it is now clear that some gene mutations, particularly in ABCB4 (encoding MDR3), can cause other patterns that include early cholesterol calculus formation, bile duct injury and disappearance, ductular reactions mimicking large duct obstruction, and, in rare cases, progressive fibrosis.

Because the features can be subtle and not diagnostic in isolation, it is generally the combination of a biliary pattern of injury with a suggestive clinical and family history that allows the diagnosis to be suspected. Increased awareness and improved access to genetic testing are likely to result in more frequent diagnosis of these disorders.

Stratification of future risk and prognostic scoring systems

PBC is primarily a biliary disease. When signs of failure of hepatocyte function develop, such as coagulopathy (not corrected by vitamin K) or jaundice, these usually indicate advanced and typically irreversible disease (assuming there is no additional reversible element such as drug injury). There are no symptoms present in patients with purely compensated disease that correlate with outcome. Neither fatigue nor pruritus correlates with the severity of disease as judged by serum bilirubin or the Mayo risk score; indeed, pruritus frequently diminishes as the disease progresses. In one report of the development of advanced disease features in 770 patients, ascites was present in 20% and bleeding varices in 10.5% after 10 years of follow-up. The outlook for patients who develop these complications is worse, and new portal hypertension complicated by ascites is an indicator of poor short-term prognosis. In 143 patients who first developed ascites or peripheral oedema, the mean time to death was 3.1 years. Once a patient develops jaundice, the natural history of the disease in the absence of treatment is more predictable, with the degree of bilirubin elevation correlating strongly with survival. The liver insufficiency phase is characterized by worsening jaundice and is typically pre-terminal; mean survival once the bilirubin is 34 μmol/L is 4 years, and when the bilirubin reaches 102 μmol/L, mean survival is only 2 years. This underpins the concept of considering liver transplantation once a patient has a bilirubin level indicating advanced disease.

### Ocaliva [^115k7UKk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ocaliva® is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis who do not have evidence of portal hypertension. It can be used either in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for those with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on a reduction in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

### Lobar and segmental liver atrophy associated with hilar cholangiocarcinoma and the impact of hilar biliary anatomical variants: A pictorial essay [^1154Q7JT]. Insights into Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

The radiological features of lobar and segmental liver atrophy and compensatory hypertrophy associated with biliary obstruction are important to recognize for diagnostic and therapeutic reasons. Atrophied lobes and segments reduce in volume and usually contain crowded dilated bile ducts extending close to the liver surface. There is often a "step" in the liver contour between the atrophied and non-atrophied parts.

Hypertrophied right lobe or segments enlarge and show a prominently convex or "bulbous" visceral surface. The atrophied liver parenchyma may show lower attenuation on pre-contrast computed tomography (CT) and CT intravenous cholangiography (CT-IVC), and lower signal intensity on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Hilar biliary anatomical variants can have an impact on the patterns of lobar and segmental atrophy. The cause of obstruction, such as cholangiocarcinoma, often commences in one branch, leading to atrophy in that drainage region before progressing to complete biliary obstruction and jaundice. Such variants are common and can result in unusual but explainable patterns of atrophy and hypertrophy. Examples of changes seen with and without hilar variants are presented that illustrate the radiological features of atrophy and hypertrophy.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115L7iqZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

While the number of deaths from other common conditions is falling in the UK, those due to liver disease have been increasing dramatically, with a 400% increase in the standardized mortality rate over the period 1970–2010. Notably, for those patients younger than 65, the rise in standardized mortality rate for liver disease is greater than 500%, such that it now constitutes the fifth biggest cause of premature mortality, with 64,000 years of working life lost every year. For morbidity, in England as well as Wales, 57,682 hospital admissions and 10,948 deaths were due to liver disease in 2012. This rising burden of liver disease is mainly a reflection of the three most common causes: alcohol-related liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and viral hepatitis, although autoimmune liver disease is also a significant contributor.

The burden of liver disease in children differs from that in adults. Although non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is seen in all ages, reflecting the rise in childhood obesity, diseases associated with injecting drug use and alcohol are rarely encountered. However, viral hepatitis is seen as a consequence of perinatal transmission, and its chronicity contributes to the disease burden seen in adults. Other causes of liver disease, such as biliary atresia or metabolic disorders, present almost exclusively in infancy or childhood but progressive liver disease continues to evolve throughout childhood and into adulthood. There are concerted efforts to deal with this rising tide of liver disease, such as the Lancet Commission on Liver Disease.

### Cholbam [^115GF9PH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Monitor liver function during treatment with Cholbam. If liver function worsens, discontinue its use.

- **Exacerbation of liver impairment**: In clinical trials, liver impairment was evident before treatment with Cholbam in approximately 86% (44/51) of patients with bile acid synthesis disorders due to SEDs and in about 50% (14/28) of patients with PDs, including those with Zellweger spectrum disorders. Among these patients, five (three with SED and two with PD) who had pre-existing liver impairment showed worsened serum transaminases, elevated bilirubin levels, or worsening cholestasis on liver biopsy during treatment. Additionally, five patients (two with SED and three with PD) without baseline cholestasis experienced an exacerbation of their liver disease while on treatment. Cases of severe hepatotoxicity have also been observed in postmarket use of Cholbam among cirrhotic patients, and an exacerbation of liver impairment cannot be ruled out.

Six patients with SEDs underwent liver transplantation, comprising four diagnosed with AKR1D1 deficiency, one with 3β-HSD deficiency, and one with CYP7A1 deficiency.

Elevations in serum GGT and ALT may indicate a Cholbam overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Overdosage (10)]. Monitor liver function and discontinue Cholbam in patients with worsening liver function indicators or if there are clinical or laboratory signs of worsening liver function or cholestasis [see Dosage and Administration].

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117J7mYC]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease, such as features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests, and/or a Fibroscan reading greater than 16 kPa (if available).

Patients flagged with the AUDIT-C but drinking less than the threshold for harmful drinking should be considered for assessment of liver fibrosis, particularly if there are risk factors. If transaminases are elevated (e.g. alanine transaminase > 100 U/L), then assessment of liver fibrosis should be considered, similar to the higher-risk group.

Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) who are at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary sclerosing cholangitis, particularly in relation to the evaluation of liver fibrosis, WFUMB 2024 guidelines recommend considering vibration-controlled transient elastography liver stiffness measurements. This approach assesses advanced parenchymal damage in patients with PSC, provided there is no biliary obstruction. It is suggested to use a threshold of 8 kPa in the absence of validated cutoffs.

### Hepatic sarcoidosis resembling primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1143cLzt]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 29-year-old man who presented with progressive weight loss, night sweats, abdominal pain, and pruritus, who was found to have obstructive jaundice and a cholestatic pattern of liver injury on laboratory workup. Though findings on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography were initially concerning for primary sclerosing cholangitis, he was ultimately diagnosed with biliary sarcoidosis following a liver biopsy. This case brings attention to the rare phenomenon of hepatic sarcoidosis causing hyperbilirubinemia and highlights the importance of reaching the correct diagnosis early, as the patient's symptoms improved after the initiation of steroids.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^116bPbMD]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Liver blood tests, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), are frequently tested as part of routine clinical investigation in primary care. Whilst unexplained persistently abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated, normal liver blood tests do not exclude NAFLD or significant fibrosis. In a study of 223 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, ALT more than two times the upper limit of normal (> 70 IU/L) had a sensitivity of just 50% and specificity of 61% for NASH, and sensitivity 40% and specificity 58% for advanced fibrosis. Moreover, the serum ALT level typically falls as liver fibrosis progresses, and patients with cirrhosis frequently have a normal range ALT level. Therefore, do not rely on abnormal liver blood tests to prompt consideration of liver disease. However, persistently unexplained abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated.

Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be evaluated in line with national recommendations, with a focused history eliciting risk factors for chronic liver disease including unhealthy alcohol consumption, the presence of metabolic risk factors, and a detailed drug history. Automated systems, such as intelligent liver function tests (iLFT), can streamline the investigation of abnormal liver blood tests by providing a full panel of results, suggested diagnoses, and advice for further management. This approach increases the diagnosis of liver disease and is highly cost-effective.

### Chronic liver disease in an ageing population [^114nec2p]. Age and Ageing (2009). Low credibility.

The prevalence of chronic liver disease is increasing in the elderly population. With a mostly asymptomatic or non-specific presentation, these diseases may easily go undiagnosed. Abnormal liver function tests of unknown cause are a common reason for referral to secondary care. Investigating the older person with abnormal liver function is important; even with mild abnormalities, the same vigilance should be applied to an older person as in a young person. Liver biopsy is safe but often overlooked in this age group and may provide useful information to diagnose, direct therapy, and prognosticate. Treatment options are similar for all age groups, with a few subtle differences, although further evidence is frequently required for the older population. Morbidity and age-adjusted mortality are often more severe in older people; therefore, early diagnosis and intervention are important. Presented here are the most common chronic liver diseases that geriatricians are likely to encounter in clinical practice. Their epidemiology, clinical features, investigation, treatment, and mortality are described with a particular focus on the elderly population.

### Ctexli [^1159ubSN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Hepatotoxicity: Obtain baseline liver transaminase and total bilirubin levels in all patients and monitor yearly and as clinically indicated. Interrupt treatment until the levels have returned to baseline values. For persistent or reliver test abnormalities, consider discontinuing CTEXLI.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Chenodiol, including CTEXLI, has been associated with hepatotoxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In Trial 1, one CTEXLI-treated patient (7%) had increased ALT levels > 3 times ULN, which led to treatment interruption. Patients with pre-existing liver disease or bile duct abnormalities may be at higher risk for hepatotoxicity during treatment with CTEXLI. Published reports suggest patients who are poor sulfators of lithocholic acid are more likely to develop chenodiol-induced serum aminotransferase elevations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Obtain baseline liver transaminase (ALT, AST) and total bilirubin levels in all patients prior to treatment initiation with CTEXLI. If liver transaminase levels are elevated > 3 times ULN or total bilirubin level is > 2 times ULN, interrupt treatment with CTEXLI until the levels have returned to baseline values. Monitor liver transaminase and total bilirubin levels yearly and as clinically indicated. For persistent or reliver test abnormalities, consider discontinuing CTEXLI.

Inform the patient of the symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g. abdominal pain, bruising, dark-colored urine, fatigue, bleeding, jaundice, nausea, and pruritus).

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason, this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation, convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin, and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline, an abnormal liver blood test is defined as a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is emerging literature suggesting that the reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation, whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions.

### Bylvay [^115mhst3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The recommended dosage for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in patients aged 3 months and older is 40 mcg/kg taken orally once daily in the morning with a meal. If there is no improvement in pruritus after 3 months, the dosage may be increased in 40 mcg/kg increments up to 120 mcg/kg once daily, not to exceed a daily dosage of 6 mg/day. BYLVAY oral pellets are intended for use by patients weighing less than 19.5 kilograms, while BYLVAY capsules are intended for use by patients weighing 19.5 kilograms or above.

The recommended dosage for Alagille syndrome (ALGS) in patients aged 12 months and older is 120 mcg/kg taken orally once daily in the morning with a meal. BYLVAY oral pellets are intended for use by patients weighing less than 19.5 kilograms, and BYLVAY capsules are intended for use by patients weighing 19.5 kilograms or above.

- **Dose modification for management of adverse reactions**:
	- **Tolerability for Alagille syndrome (ALGS)**: Dose reduction to 40 mcg/kg/day may be considered if tolerability issues occur in the absence of other causes. Once tolerability issues stabilize, increase to 120 mcg/kg/day.
	- **Liver test abnormalities**: Establish the baseline pattern of variability of liver tests prior to starting BYLVAY, so that potential signs of liver injury can be identified. Monitor liver tests (e.g. ALT [alanine aminotransferase], AST [aspartate aminotransferase]) regularly to ensure safety.

### Odevixibat and partial external biliary diversion showed equal improvement of cholestasis in a patient with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis [^116z2M1S]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Throughout the odevixibat clinical study, the patient demonstrated elevations in eosinophils and neutrophils; however, only the values at screening (8.9% and 12.1%, respectively) were considered clinically significant by study investigators. The patient experienced two adverse events of mild intensity (nasopharyngitis and vomiting); neither was considered related to odevixibat or to laboratory abnormalities. Stool consistency and frequency did not change from baseline during treatment with odevixibat or following PEBD. Liver function tests other than serum bile acids were normal before and after both odevixibat treatment and PEBD, except for mild and transient elevations during the post-operative phase and during viral upper airway infections.

### Cholbam [^114CPj49]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The trials, labeled as Trials 1 and 2, indicated that the majority of patients (80%, 25 out of 31) were less than 2 years of age at the start of CHOLBAM treatment, with ages ranging from 3 weeks to 10 years. Most of these patients were treated for an average duration of 254 weeks, which amounts to approximately 4.8 years.

Sufficient data were available to assess baseline liver function and the effects of CHOLBAM treatment in 23 patients from Trial 1 and in one new patient from Trial 2. A responder analysis was performed on patients who had received at least one dose of CHOLBAM and had sufficient data available to assess baseline liver impairment.

- **Response to CHOLBAM treatment was assessed using laboratory criteria**:
	- ALT or AST values reduced to less than 50 U/L, or a reduction from baseline levels by 80%.
	- Total bilirubin values reduced to less than or equal to 1 mg/dL.
	- No evidence of cholestasis on liver biopsy.

- **And using clinical criteria**:
	- Body weight increased by 10% or stable at greater than the 50th percentile.
	- Survival for more than 3 years on treatment or being alive at the end of Trial 2.

CHOLBAM responders were defined as patients who either met at least two laboratory criteria and were alive at the last follow-up, or who met at least one laboratory criterion, had increased body weight, and were alive at the last follow-up.

Overall, 11 of 24 patients (46%) were responders. The breakdown by disorder is as follows:

- **Among responsive patients with PDs**:
	- 38% of the responders met the two clinical criteria plus one to three laboratory criteria, and 63% met the weight criteria.
	- There were no PD patients who underwent liver transplant.

No evidence of improvement was noted beyond these results.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112XLmib]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests involves identifying three common patterns of abnormal liver test results, which can aid in diagnosis.

- **Isolated raised bilirubin**: This condition is most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 5–8% of the population. Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample alongside a full blood count and direct and indirect bilirubin tests. The total bilirubin should rise further due to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting a reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, and haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L), then rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome should be considered, and genetic testing should be undertaken.

- **Cholestatic pattern**: Predominantly raised ALP and GGT levels indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion, and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and may not be liver-related, or it may relate to elevated values during periods of rapid growth in childhood. Therefore, the presence of concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, GGT is characteristic.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^115Txxj6]. American Family Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Jaundice is an indication of hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by derangements in bilirubin metabolism. It is typically apparent when serum bilirubin levels exceed 3 mg/dL and can indicate serious underlying disease of the liver or biliary tract. A comprehensive medical history, review of systems, and physical examination are essential for differentiating potential causes such as alcoholic liver disease, biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, drug-induced liver injury, hemolysis, or hepatitis.

Initial laboratory evaluation should include assays for bilirubin (total and fractionated), a complete blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio. Measuring fractionated bilirubin allows for determination of whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated.

Ultrasonography of the abdomen, computed tomography with intravenous contrast media, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are first-line options for patients presenting with jaundice, depending on the suspected underlying etiology. If the etiology of jaundice is unclear despite laboratory testing and imaging, liver biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the disease.
