## Question

does erythema nodusum cause fever and leukocytosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether erythema nodosum causes fever and leukocytosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical definition and pathophysiology of erythema nodosum. Then, I should verify how often systemic symptoms, especially fever, accompany erythema nodosum in cohorts and case series. Next, I will examine whether leukocytosis is a recognized feature and in what contexts it appears. After that, I need to distinguish erythema nodosum from mimics that characteristically have fever and leukocytosis, like Sweet syndrome. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically grounded conclusion and outline the implications for workup and interpretation of abnormal labs if they are present.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Erythema nodosum is a septal panniculitis presenting as tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules, classically on the pretibial shins, and it is generally considered a hypersensitivity reaction to diverse antigenic stimuli rather than a primary systemic inflammatory disease per se, which already hints that fever and leukocytosis are not universal or defining features [^114SFc7U] [^112ezHfy].

> Wait, let me verify the frequency of fever. In a prospective series of 100 patients, fever occurred in 34% and arthralgia in 45%, indicating that systemic symptoms can accompany erythema nodosum but are not invariant, and they often reflect an underlying trigger rather than the panniculitis itself [^116aGQCV]. In a Finnish registry of 142 cases, systemic symptoms were common overall, with fever the most frequent systemic symptom in men, again underscoring variability by population and demographics [^1112Ywfw]. Pediatric reports similarly note that fever and malaise may accompany erythema nodosum, though less consistently than in adults, reinforcing that fever is a possible but not obligatory feature [^116v5Ts2].

> I need to check the leukocytosis question carefully. The Turkish cohort identified leukocytosis as a predictor of secondary erythema nodosum, meaning it can occur and may signal an underlying disease rather than primary idiopathic erythema nodosum, but it is not a core diagnostic feature of erythema nodosum itself [^116oEN6c]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I initially thought leukocytosis might be uncommon in erythema nodosum, but case-based literature shows it does occur in selected contexts, such as concurrent Sweet syndrome or hematologic disease, so I should correct that impression and frame leukocytosis as an associated, not defining, abnormality that warrants evaluation for secondary causes [^116dTwgp] [^1147pvvN].

> Let me consider the pathophysiologic basis to ensure internal consistency. Erythema nodosum is a delayed-type hypersensitivity panniculitis with septal inflammation and Miescher radial granulomas; systemic cytokine activation sufficient to drive consistent fever and leukocytosis is not inherent to the histology, which helps explain why these features are variable and often attributable to the precipitating cause rather than the panniculitis itself [^112ezHfy].

> Next, I should review mimics and differentials to avoid misattribution. Sweet syndrome classically presents with fever and leukocytosis and can overlap or evolve in patients who also have erythema nodosum, particularly in the setting of myelodysplastic syndrome or other hematologic disorders; in such cases, the fever and leukocytosis belong to Sweet syndrome rather than erythema nodosum per se, so I need to ensure I am not conflating entities [^116dTwgp] [^113WR2rZ] [^117W1iSi]. But wait, what if the labs are driven by infection or drug reaction rather than the panniculitis itself; indeed, infectious triggers like streptococcal pharyngitis or Yersinia can produce both erythema nodosum and systemic inflammatory labs, and medications can provoke erythema nodosum with fever, so I should double-check for these precipitants before attributing systemic signs to erythema nodosum alone [^112ezHfy] [^113UDXYv] [^113b4R2C].

> I will now examine specific scenarios where fever and leukocytosis are expected with erythema nodosum–like presentations. Löfgren syndrome, an acute sarcoidosis phenotype, presents with erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, arthritis, and often fever; here, fever is part of the systemic sarcoidosis complex rather than a direct effect of erythema nodosum itself, which fits the broader pattern that systemic symptoms in erythema nodosum usually reflect the underlying disease [^112spRxp] [^116ySDRt]. Similarly, erythema nodosum leprosum is a systemic immune reaction in leprosy characterized by painful nodules and fever, again indicating that the fever is a feature of the systemic process, not the panniculitis mechanism per se [^115MR4kR].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. Erythema nodosum does not inherently cause fever and leukocytosis; however, fever occurs in a minority to moderate proportion of cases depending on the series and population, and leukocytosis, while not a defining feature, may be present and is particularly concerning as a predictor of secondary erythema nodosum due to infection, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, medications, or hematologic disease, warranting a targeted workup when present [^116oEN6c] [^114SFc7U] [^112ezHfy]. Hold on, I should verify that this framing aligns with practical guidance; indeed, reviews emphasize ruling out underlying systemic diseases when erythema nodosum is accompanied by abnormal inflammatory labs or systemic symptoms, which operationalizes the notion that fever and leukocytosis should prompt evaluation for secondary causes rather than being ascribed to erythema nodosum alone [^114SFc7U] [^112ezHfy].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical implications are clear. If a patient with erythema nodosum has fever and leukocytosis, I should confirm the diagnosis clinically, obtain inflammatory markers and a complete blood count with differential, assess for common triggers such as streptococcal infection, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, medications, and malignancy, and consider whether overlapping Sweet syndrome or another neutrophilic dermatosis could explain the systemic features, tailoring further testing to pretest probabilities and evolving findings [^114SFc7U] [^112ezHfy] [^117W1iSi].

Erythema nodosum (EN) **can be associated with fever and leukocytosis** [^116oEN6c], but these are not universal or defining features [^116v5Ts2] [^112ezHfy]. Fever occurs in about **one-third of cases** [^116oEN6c] and is more common when EN is secondary to infection, sarcoidosis, or inflammatory bowel disease [^116oEN6c]. Leukocytosis is less frequent and usually reflects an underlying systemic process rather than EN itself [^notfound]. When fever and leukocytosis are present, evaluate for secondary causes such as streptococcal infection, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, or inflammatory bowel disease [^114SFc7U] [^112ezHfy].

---

## Frequency of fever in erythema nodosum

Fever is a recognized but **inconsistent systemic manifestation** of EN [^115xKBLP]. Its frequency varies with the underlying cause:

- **General frequency**: Fever occurs in approximately 34% of EN cases [^116aGQCV].
- **Secondary EN**: Fever is more common in secondary EN, particularly when associated with infections (e.g. streptococcal, tuberculosis), sarcoidosis, or inflammatory bowel disease [^116oEN6c] [^112spRxp] [^113UMPQu].
- **Idiopathic EN**: Fever is less common in idiopathic cases, which are typically self-limited and benign [^116oEN6c] [^112ezHfy].

---

## Frequency of leukocytosis in erythema nodosum

Leukocytosis is **less common than fever** in EN and is usually secondary to the underlying systemic disease rather than EN itself [^116oEN6c]. It is more likely in secondary EN — especially with infections, sarcoidosis, or inflammatory bowel disease — whereas idiopathic EN typically lacks significant leukocytosis [^116oEN6c].

---

## Clinical significance of fever and leukocytosis in EN

Fever and leukocytosis in EN are important because they suggest a **secondary systemic process** [^116oEN6c]. Their presence should prompt evaluation for underlying causes:

- **Infections**: Streptococcal infections, tuberculosis, and other bacterial or viral infections are common triggers of EN with systemic symptoms [^112ezHfy] [^116oEN6c].
- **Sarcoidosis**: EN is a hallmark of Löfgren's syndrome, an acute sarcoidosis presentation characterized by fever, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and arthralgia [^112spRxp] [^116ySDRt].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: EN is a recognized extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, often accompanied by systemic symptoms [^113UMPQu] [^111SD2KS].
- **Medications**: Certain drugs, such as sulfonamides and nevirapine, have been associated with EN and systemic symptoms [^113b4R2C].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

EN is a **hypersensitivity reaction** involving immune complex deposition and cytokine release, leading to inflammation of subcutaneous fat septa [^116v5Ts2]. Fever and leukocytosis likely reflect systemic immune activation rather than direct skin involvement. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) are implicated in the inflammatory cascade, contributing to systemic symptoms [^1147pvvN].

---

## Diagnostic approach

When evaluating a patient with EN and systemic symptoms, a **comprehensive diagnostic approach** is recommended:

- **Clinical history**: Detailed history to identify potential triggers, including recent infections, medications, and systemic symptoms [^112ezHfy].
- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and specific tests based on suspected underlying causes (e.g. streptococcal serology, tuberculosis testing, sarcoidosis workup) [^112ezHfy].
- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) to evaluate for sarcoidosis or other pulmonary involvement [^112spRxp].
- **Skin biopsy**: Not routinely required but may be considered in atypical cases to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other panniculitides [^116v5Ts2].

---

## Management implications

The presence of fever and leukocytosis in EN influences management by prompting a **search for underlying causes** and guiding therapy. Supportive care with NSAIDs and rest is often sufficient for idiopathic EN, whereas secondary EN requires targeted treatment of the underlying condition — such as antibiotics for infections, corticosteroids for sarcoidosis, or immunosuppressive therapy for inflammatory bowel disease [^114SFc7U] [^112ezHfy] [^116oEN6c].

---

EN can be associated with fever and leukocytosis, but these are not universal and usually reflect an underlying systemic process. Their presence should prompt **evaluation for secondary causes** such as infection, sarcoidosis, or inflammatory bowel disease [^114SFc7U].

### Concurrent Sweet's syndrome and erythema nodosum [^116dTwgp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

A 29-year-old Mexican man was admitted to the hospital with fever, cough, sore throat, and red, tender leg nodules suggestive of erythema nodosum (Fig. 1). The white blood cell count was 35,000. Several days later, annular plaques and pustules developed on his face, neck, and forearms (Figs. 2 and 3). Facial skin biopsy showed neutrophilic dermatitis without evidence of infection or vasculitis consistent with Sweet's syndrome. Biopsy of the thigh was non-diagnostic, but showed a mixed neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis.

Figure 1
The patient's legs show red, tender nodules suggestive of erythema nodosum.

Figure 2
Annular plaques and pustules developed on the patient's face.

Figure 3
Annular plaques developed on the patient's hands.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is a form of panniculitis characterized by painful red nodules over the pretibial area. Sweet's syndrome (SS) is an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by fever, leukocytosis, and erythematous plaques involving the arms, trunk, and neck. Vesiculopustules, nodules, and ulcers may also occur. Simultaneous occurrence of EN and SS has been increasingly reported, and both appear to be reactive dermatoses with overlapping clinical and histopathologic features. Although often idiopathic, both disorders have been associated with upper respiratory infections, medications, hematologic malignancies, and autoimmune disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease). Treatment includes corticosteroids, potassium iodide, or colchicine. SS generally responds well to therapy, but recurs in up to 25% of patients; 15% have a chronic relapsing course.

Extensive evaluation was unrevealing, including chest and abdominal imaging, bone marrow biopsy, endoscopy, and serologies for hepatitis, syphilis, recent Streptococcal infection, and rheumatologic disorders. He responded well to oral prednisone. The underlying cause was presumed to be an antecedent upper respiratory tract infection.

### Erythema nodosum: an evaluation of 100 cases [^116oEN6c]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

In this study, we investigated the clinical features, etiology, and also predictive factors of secondary erythema nodosum (EN) in patients with EN.

Methods

A total of 100 patients (mean age: 37 years) diagnosed with EN between 1993 and 2004 in our clinic were included in the study prospectively. A skin biopsy was performed in 46 of the patients. Patients were considered to have secondary EN when an underlying condition was found, and to have primary EN when no such condition was found. For the diagnosis of the underlying diseases, the pertinent diagnostic criteria and/or diagnostic methods were used. Categorical and continuous variables were compared by using chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests respectively. Multiple regression analysis was applied to the significantly different variables.

Results

The majority of the patients were female (female/male: 6/1) and nearly half (47%) of the cases had a determined etiology. The leading etiology was poststreptococcal (11%), followed in decreasing order by primary tuberculosis (10%), sarcoidosis (10%), Behçet's syndrome (BS) (6%), drugs (5%), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (3%), and pregnancy (2%). Fifteen (15%) patients complained of cough; the diagnosis was primary tuberculosis in eight cases and sarcoidosis in seven. Four patients with arthritis were diagnosed as having BS (in 3) and Crohn's disease (in 1). All the patients were followed for a mean duration of 4.5 years. The nodosities relapsed annually in 62% (33/53) of idiopathic EN patients but in only one (BS) in the secondary EN group. The histology was consistent with EN in all biopsied patients. Our study revealed that fever, leukocytosis, elevated CRP level, accelerated ESR, presence of cough, sore throat, diarrhea, arthritis, and pulmonary pathology were predictors of secondary EN. Recurrence in EN significantly predicted primary EN. All of the patients had bed rest and the majority was given an anti-inflammatory agent (naproxen sodium). The outcomes were usually favorable within 7 days. The patients with an underlying disease were given the specific treatment.

Conclusion

EN has been associated with numerous diseases. In order to reduce cost and duration of diagnosis, every centre should determine its own most frequent etiologic factors. Predictive variables for secondary EN should also be determined and an optimum management for such patients should be clarified. Our study revealed streptococcal pharyngitis, primary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, IBD, and BS as the main etiologies of EN.

### Erythema nodosum: a practical approach and diagnostic algorithm [^114SFc7U]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Erythema nodosum is the most common form of panniculitis and is characterized by tender erythematous nodules mainly in the lower limbs on the pretibial area. The exact cause of erythema nodosum is unknown, although it appears to be a hypersensitivity response to a variety of antigenic stimuli. Although the etiology is mostly idiopathic, ruling out an underlying disease is imperative before diagnosing primary erythema nodosum. Erythema nodosum can be the first sign of a systemic disease that is triggered by a large group of processes, such as infections, inflammatory diseases, neoplasia, and/or drugs. The most common identifiable causes are streptococcal infections, primary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel disease, drugs, and pregnancy. We propose a diagnostic algorithm to optimize the initial work-up, hence initiating prompt and accurate management of the underlying disease. The algorithm includes an initial assessment of core symptoms, diagnostic work-up, differential diagnosis, and recommended therapies. Several treatment options for the erythema nodosum lesions have been previously reported; nevertheless, these options treat the symptoms, but not the triggering cause. Making an accurate diagnosis will allow the physician to treat the underlying cause and determine an optimal therapeutic strategy.

### Erythema nodosum: a sign of systemic disease [^112ezHfy]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum, a painful disorder of the subcutaneous fat, is the most common type of panniculitis. Generally, it is idiopathic, although the most common identifiable cause is streptococcal pharyngitis. Erythema nodosum may be the first sign of a systemic disease such as tuberculosis, bacterial or deep fungal infection, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or cancer. Certain drugs, including oral contraceptives and some antibiotics, also may be etiologic. The hallmark of erythema nodosum is tender, erythematous, subcutaneous nodules that typically are located symmetrically on the anterior surface of the lower extremities. Erythema nodosum does not ulcerate and usually resolves without atrophy or scarring. Most direct and indirect evidence supports the involvement of a type IV delayed hypersensitivity response to numerous antigens. A deep incisional or excisional biopsy specimen should be obtained for adequate visualization. Erythema nodosum represents an inflammatory process involving the septa between subcutaneous fat lobules, with an absence of vasculitis and the presence of radial granulomas. Diagnostic evaluation after comprehensive history and physical examination includes complete blood count with differential; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, or both; testing for streptococcal infection (i.e., throat culture, rapid antigen test, antistreptoly-sin-O titer, and polymerase chain reaction assay); and biopsy. Patients should be stratified by risk for tuberculosis. Further evaluation (e.g., purified protein derivative test, chest radiography, stool cultures) varies based on the individual. Erythema nodosum tends to be self-limited. Any underlying disorders should be treated and supportive care provided. Pain can be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### The cat did it: erythema nodosum and additional atypical presentations ofinfection in immunocompetent hosts [^1161Lnko]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A healthy patient presented with painful skin lesions on the anterior surface of her legs. Erythema nodosum was diagnosed but all the usual causes were ruled out. The finding of bilateral enlarged axillary lymph nodes with necrosis and granulomas led to the diagnosis of Bartonella infection, an unusual cause of erythema nodosum. Imaging also revealed splenomegaly and small para-aortic lymph nodes. Up to one quarter of the patients with cat-scratch disease present atypically, a considerably higher prevalence than previously reported. A comprehensive review of the literature (PubMed, since inception, all languages) revealed a remarkable array of unusual presentations which are summarised and briefly discussed.

### Erythematous patches and nodules in a neutropenic patient [^113QbFML]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

A 54-year-old man with progressed high-grade myelodysplastic syndrome admitted for chemotherapy developed several painful skin lesions on day 15 of treatment with daunorubicin and cytarabine. Exam demonstrated several erythematous plaques with induration, warmth, and tenderness on the legs and a tender, erythematous nodule on the forearm (Fig 1). Labs were notable for severe pancytopenia, including a leukocyte count of 2.6 × 10 3 cells/uL and absolute neutrophil count of 730 cells/mL. Biopsies were obtained for histopathology (Figs 2 and 3). Tissue culture was sterile.

Question 1: Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH)
B. Leukemia cutis
C. Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet Syndrome)
D. Subcutaneous mycosis
E. Erythema nodosum

Answers:

A. NEH – Correct. NEH is a rare and self-limiting neutrophilic dermatosis that presents with tender, erythematous, and edematous plaques and nodules developing 1–2 weeks following chemotherapy, most commonly cytarabine. Histopathology reveals a perieccrine inflammatory infiltrate with neutrophils and lymphocytes, as well as edema, necrosis, and squamous metaplasia of eccrine coils. In neutropenic patients, inflammation may be sparse, but characteristic eccrine changes are maintained.
B. Leukemia cutis – Incorrect. Leukemia cutis often presents as asymptomatic nodules and papules favoring the trunk, extremities, and head. Histopathology shows infiltration of neoplastic leukocytes or their precursors into the dermis and subcutis.
C. Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet Syndrome) – Incorrect. Sweet syndrome is the most common neutrophilic dermatosis and is associated with malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome. However, an abrupt onset of multiple, tender, erythematous plaques, or nodules is characteristic, and histopathology would reveal marked edema and a significant dermal neutrophilic infiltrate without eccrine gland pathology.
D. Subcutaneous mycosis – Incorrect. The development of a solitary, indurated, subcutaneous nodule following transcutaneous trauma warrants concern for a deep fungal infection, and eccrine gland necrosis can be seen. However, fungal organisms would be identified on histopathology and tissue culture.
E. Erythema nodosum – Incorrect. While clinical findings may imitate NEH, erythema nodosum mainly localizes on the extensor surface of the legs. Histopathology would reveal a septal granulomatous panniculitis without vasculitis.

### Painful plaques in a woman with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma [^114RbowF]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG)
B. Erythema nodosum (EN)
C. Sweet syndrome (SS)
D. Acute inflammatory edema (AIE)
E. Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH)

Answers:

A. PG – Incorrect. Although PG is consistent with the histopathology and history of malignancy presented here, PG is more commonly characterized by the presence of nonhealing ulcers, which were not observed in this case.
B. EN – Incorrect. EN typically manifests as tender, erythematous nodules or plaques on the bilateral shins, although it can rarely be observed on the thighs and buttocks, as observed here. Septal panniculitis is typically the predominant feature on EN histopathology.
C. SS – Correct. SS is the most likely diagnosis. This case meets both major diagnostic criteria for SS, including the acute onset of painful erythematous plaques and histologic evidence of a dense neutrophilic infiltrate without vasculitis, as well as all 4 minor criteria, including fever, elevated inflammatory marker levels, appropriate response to systemic treatment and occurrence with an associated disease. More specifically, the widespread and relapsing giant lesions in this patient with an elevated body mass index are most consistent with the giant cellulitis-like variant of SS, as previously described.
D. AIE – Incorrect. AIE is consistent with this case in that it typically involves areas of dependence while sparing those of pressure, with laboratory findings of leukocytosis and neutrophilic infiltrates on histopathology. However, AIE is more commonly bilateral, edematous, and associated with fluid overload.
E. NEH – Incorrect. The association with malignancy is consistent with NEH; however, NEH is more likely to present on the extremities, trunk, or face in patients receiving chemotherapy, and histopathology characteristically reveals neutrophilic infiltration of eccrine glands.

A33 Severe Kawasaki disease caused by parvovirus B19 infection?

Merle Claßen, Tobias Krickau

Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany

Pediatric Rheumatology 2025, 23(1): A33

Introduction: Parvovirus B19 infection and Kawasaki disease may overlap. Parvovirus can cause severe (atypical) Kawasaki disease (1). Two thirds of patients with Kawasaki disease have a concomitant parvovirus infection (2). Other authors describe that parvovirus infection itself can mimic atypical Kawasaki disease with persistent fever and rash (3).

Methods: A case report of a four-year-old boy with atypical Kawasaki disease is presented. The clinical disease course and challenges are described.

Results: The four-year-old boy presented with five-week history of fever without focus, refractory to antibiotics, cervical lymphadenopathy and coronary aneurysms. Three months prior to the onset of Kawasaki's disease, the boy had a parvovirus infection, resulting in a low haemoglobin level (8.8 g/dl) at first presentation. No active infection was detected at that time. He received two courses of IVIG (2g/kg KG), which resulted in clinical and biochemical improvement. However, three weeks later, he had a relapse of fever and new erythema nodosum, haemoglobin dropped to a low of 7.7 g/dl, and haemolysis parameters increased. Leukocytes increased to 45×10³/µl. Parvovirus DNA was again found in the blood. Treatment with prednisolone was started. Reduction of prednisolone was tried twice, resulting in flares of erythema nodosum, decrease in haemoglobin and increase in leukocytes. Differential diagnoses for hyperleucocytosis were excluded. A very slow tapering of prednisolone two months after the onset of Kawasaki disease was tolerated. The erythema nodosum resolved slowly after a total of 8 weeks.

### Histiocytoid sweet syndrome recalcitrant to prednisone causing severe scarring [^114kvXia]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Sweet syndrome is in the category of neutrophilic dermatoses. It is usually accompanied by fever, neutrophilia, leukocytosis, and tender erythematous papules, nodules, or plaques. The disease is extremely responsive to systemic steroids. The differential diagnoses include rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatosis, bullous pyoderma gangrenosum, neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis, erythema multiforme, leukemia cutis, erythema elevatum diutinum, and erythema nodosum (if lesions are only on the lower extremities). The classic Sweet syndrome pathology findings show a predominantly neutrophilic dermal infiltrate without vasculitis.

Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is a rare variant that presents with a clinical picture similar to that of classic Sweet syndrome but is differentiated by its pathology. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is characterized by a predominate infiltrate of mononuclear cells that have a histiocytic appearance and stain positive for CD68 and myeloperoxidase. A variable number of neutrophils may be present.

This patient was unusual in that the course of her disease was persistent with new lesions over two years despite adequate therapy with prednisone during this time. According to the criteria of Su and Liu, one of the minor criteria of Sweet syndrome is an excellent response to systemic corticosteroids. The recommended normal dose is prednisone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/d. Sweet syndrome usually has an excellent response to oral corticosteroids, as was confirmed by a recent study that showed 100% of patients had significant clinical improvement. Although unusual, there have been reports of cases in which patients did not respond to systemic corticosteroids. Her case was also complicated by numerous scars. Mild scarring has been reported rarely in classic Sweet syndrome. Cutis laxa and anetoderma have also been described. This is the first patient, to our knowledge, reported to have severe hypertrophic scar formation caused by histiocytoid Sweet syndrome.

### Erythema nodosum-like panniculitis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: two cases reporting a rare cutaneous adverse event [^115xKBLP]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythema nodosum (EN) is the most common form of panniculitis and typically presents as painful erythematous nodules on the shins, and may be associated with systemic symptoms including fever and arthralgia. Histopathology demonstrates septal panniculitis with an inflammatory infiltrate, which includes neutrophils in the early stage and lymphocytes and multinucleated giant cells in the late stage. A wide variety of etiologies are associated with EN, including infections, sarcoidosis, rheumatologic disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune disorders, medications, and malignancies. Recently EN-like panniculitis has been reported as a rare cutaneous adverse effect in association with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPis). In this report, we present 2 additional patients who developed EN-like panniculitis in the setting of ipilimumab and nivolumab and pembrolizumab treatment, respectively, and review the clinical and histologic presentations, impact on cancer therapy, and response to treatment.

### Recurrent erythema nodosum: a red flag sign of hidden systemic vasculitis [^115nse5B]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Takayasu's arteritis is a rare, systemic vasculitis with varied presentations across multiple medical specialities. Here, we present a young woman who had recurrent episodes of erythema nodosum on the background of a low-grade fever and no vascular manifestations. The presence of a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate generated a high index of suspicion for underlying vasculitis, and radioimaging confirmed the suspicion of Takayasu's arteritis. The patient was found to have type III diseases in the vasculitic stage and was managed with systemic corticosteroids.

### Rapidly progressive purpuric plaques in an infant [^112mvDwD]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythema multiforme minor
B. Polyarteritis nodosa
C. Sweet Syndrome
D. Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Infancy
E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura

Answers:

A. Erythema multiforme minor – Incorrect. Erythema multiforme minor, a self-limited immune-mediated reaction to infections, is characterized by the acute onset of target, maculopapular lesions on extremities. It is not associated with edema of the face.
B. Polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is a leukocytoclastic medium-sized vessel vasculitis associated with cutaneous lesions such as livedo, subcutaneous nodules and annular purpura commonly on the arms and legs. Although cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is the most common form in children, no subcutaneous nodules nor livedo were present here.
C. Sweet Syndrome – Incorrect. SS is characterized by acute purple and erythematous plaques on the face and extremities. Constitutional signs such as fever, malaise, arthralgia and leukocytosis, which are minor criteria for SS, were absent in this patient.
D. Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Infancy – Correct. AHEI is a rare cutaneous vasculitis, seen in children between 4 and 24 months of age. Initially small erythematous papules or macules progress within 48 hours to sharply demarcated, targetoid, indurated purpuric plaques involving the face, the upper and lower extremities and sparing the trunk. The children appear otherwise well. AHEI is associated with facial edema and low-grade fever.
E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura – Incorrect. HSP and AHEI, both small-vessel vasculitis, have clinical and prognostic distinctive features. HSP mainly affects older children from 3 to 6 years of age, the palpable purpura in HSP is distributed on the buttocks and extensor surface of the legs, sparing the face.HSP's diagnostic criteria include this characteristic rash and at least 1 other than skin system involvement; it may be associated with renal and gastrointestinal risks.

### Mucosal ulcers, extremity nodules, and fevers [^115FTjLU]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Sweet syndrome
B. Behçet's disease
C. Primary EBV infection
D. Erythema multiforme
E. Primary Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection

Answers:

A. Sweet syndrome – Incorrect. Sweet syndrome presents with neutrophilia, fevers, and typically edematous plaques or vesiculobullous lesions. Histology would show a dense neutrophilic infiltrate and papillary dermal edema without evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
B. Behçet's disease – Correct. The oral and genital ulcers, neutrophilic vasculitis on histology of erythema nodosum-like skin lesions, as well as ocular, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and joint symptoms with an otherwise unremarkable infectious and inflammatory workup led to a diagnosis of Beçhet's disease.
C. Primary EBV infection – Incorrect. EBV infection may have been both an inciting trigger for Behçet's disease and the cause of her initial presentation consistent with infectious mononucleosis. Associations between EBV infection and Behçet's disease have been well demonstrated. While EBV itself can have dermatologic manifestations, EBV alone was improbable, particularly given evidence of neutrophilic vasculitis on biopsy and subsequent EBV viral load and IgM testing were negative.
D. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. The rash associated with erythema multiforme typically consists of targetoid plaques on the distal extremities. Skin biopsy findings here are also not compatible with erythema multiforme, which would show a vacuolar interface dermatitis with a lymphocytic infiltrate, rather than a neutrophilic vasculitis as pictured.
E. Primary HSV infection – Incorrect. Erythema-nodosum like skin lesions would be highly unusual for primary HSV infection. HSV serologies and PCR were obtained and negative.

### Dapsone tablets (dapsone 25 mg) [^114et69h]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

The patient should be warned to respond to the presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura or jaundice. Deaths associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be done weekly for the first month, monthly for six months and semi-annually thereafter. If a significant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patient followed intensively. Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of hematologic reactions; if co-administered with Dapsone the patient should be monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have developed agranulocytosis during the second and third month of therapy.

Severe anemia should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin monitored. Hemolysis and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease.

Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include exfoliative dermatitis and are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include toxic erythema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, urticaria and erythema nodosum. If new or toxic dermatologic reactions occur, sulfone therapy must be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Leprosy reactional states, including cutaneous, are not hypersensitivity reactions to Dapsone and do not require discontinuation. See special section.

### Gemcitabine-associated acute lipodermatosclerosislike eruption: an underrecognized phenomenon [^114qsZHp]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine analogue that blocks progression of cells through the G1/S phase. It is active against many solid organ malignancies including breast, ovarian, non–small cell lung, transitional cell bladder, pancreatic, and biliary tract cancers, as well as various sarcomas and hematologic malignancies. Like other chemotherapeutics, it may be associated with alopecia, mucositis, and cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions. It is also important to be familiar with the less common cutaneous adverse effects.

Gemcitabine-associated ALDS-like eruption is likely an underrecognized condition that is often mistakenly treated as cellulitis. The differential diagnosis includes infectious cellulitis, drug hypersensitivity, toxic erythema of chemotherapy, and other panniculitides such as erythema nodosum. It commonly presents with a sudden onset of erythematous and tender plaques of the lower extremities (often bilateral). In addition, patients usually have lower extremity edema and slight induration of the involved sites. Unlike cellulitis, fever and leukocytosis are usually absent; however, gemcitabine may cause a drug-induced fever and myelosuppression, which can complicate the diagnosis. Historically, the term pseudocellulitis has been used to describe reactions to gemcitabine that presented as radiation recall, erysipeloid eruptions, sclerodermalike changes, and ALDS; however, for cases such as ours, we encourage the diagnosis ALDS-like eruption to more accurately depict the etiology and clinical findings, while guiding the appropriate management. In addition, unlike cutaneous sclerosis, which may warrant discontinuation of therapy, patients with ALDS-like eruption can generally continue treatment without dose adjustment.

### Fever and rash [^1176aEnF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious causes of fever and rash pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency provider. It is often difficult to discern rashes associated with rapidly progressive and life-threatening infections from benign exanthems, which comprise the majority of rashes seen in the emergency department. Physicians must also consider serious noninfectious causes of fever and rash. A correct diagnosis depends on an exhaustive history and head-to-toe skin examination as most emergent causes of fever and rash remain clinical diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment with antimicrobials and supportive care are usually required prior to the return of confirmatory laboratory testing.

### A case report of COVID-19-associated erythema nodosum: a classic presentation with a new trigger [^115CMZ5p]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the course of the pandemic, cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been increasingly characterized, yet only a few cases of erythema nodosum (EN) are reported in the literature and international registries.

Case Presentation

In this report, we describe a case of tender, erythematous nodules that appeared acutely on the distal legs in a 48-year-old female with renal transplant following SARSs-CoV-2 infection complicated by prolonged fevers and pneumonia. The patient was diagnosed with a classic presentation of EN arising from a new and emerging trigger-COVID-19 infection. The cutaneous lesions resolved with conservative management.

Conclusions

This report highlights the importance of clinician awareness of the potential association of COVID-19 with a classic clinical presentation of EN and underscores that these cases can be managed with the same therapeutic repertoire as EN due to other aetiologies. Of note, use of systemic agents was not employed in this case, as our patient improved with conservative therapy alone.

### Utility of the erythema nodosum leprosum international study severity scale for erythema nodosum leprosum: a clinically supported critical appraisal [^114UzBjP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immune-mediated complication of leprosy. A standardized severity scale based on the clinical signs associated with ENL was developed, piloted, and validated by the Erythema Nodosum Leprosum International Study (ENLIST) group. We conducted a critical appraisal of the ENLIST ENL severity scale using the visit data of eight borderline or lepromatous patients diagnosed with ENL from an outpatient dermatology clinic over a 3-year period. The three most commonly recorded tool criteria observed in the patients were the number, inflammation, and extent of ENL lesions. Fever (including in the preceding 7 days), lymphadenopathy, and inflammation of the joints or digits were rarely encountered (< 10%). Score changes reflected treatment progression, with a mean net change of -4.6 over the study period. Most ENLIST scores decreased after immunosuppression was increased (58.5%). Our results suggest that ENLIST accurately reflects ENL severity and treatment. The three tool criteria were not frequently recorded as observed in the patients (< 10%). Future studies may be conducted to confirm whether the low frequency of these tool criteria indicates true clinical variability.

### Sweet syndrome in infancy [^113xXH6F]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Sweet syndrome, or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is characterized by the presence of fever, peripheral leukocytosis, painful erythematous plaques and nodules, and a predominately neutrophilic dermal infiltrate. We report a case occurring in a 10-week-old male child, with preceding upper respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal infection symptoms. Sweet syndrome occurring in an infant should prompt a work-up for immunodeficiency, as well as a review of the peripheral blood smear to rule out the rare case of malignancy.

### Erythema nodosum and granulomatous lesions preceding acute myelomonocytic leukemia [^1147pvvN]. The Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

A 65-year-old female with a one-month history of painful eruptions on her lower extremities was admitted to our hospital. Histological examination revealed erythema nodosum (EN), and the patient was treated with oral prednisolone (PSL; 20 mg daily). The eruptions subsided in two weeks. One month later, painful reddish eruptions recurred on her upper limbs and abdomen in addition to her lower extremities. A skin biopsy from an abdominal erythematous plaque revealed a non-caseating granuloma without microorganisms or foreign-body materials. These eruptions also disappeared with treatment with oral PSL (20 mg daily). No underlying disease, including sarcoidosis, diabetes mellitus, or rheumatoid arthritis, was found. However, five months later, the patient developed conspicuous leukocytosis. She was diagnosed with acute myelomonocytic leukemia (M4) and treated with chemotherapy. After complete remission had been achieved, the EN reappeared, in association with an increase in blastic cells in the bone marrow. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta, which are thought to be essential for granuloma formation and induction of EN, were markedly elevated. Physicians must remember that recurrent EN and granulomatous lesions can be a prodromal sign of leukemia.

### Histiocytoid neutrophilic dermatoses and panniculitides: variations on a theme [^115Asrif]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2007). Low credibility.

Requena et al, in their article titled "Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome", in 2005, established that the dermal infiltrate in some patients with Sweet's syndrome is composed of histiocyte-like immature myeloid cells, not polymorphonuclear leukocytes as is the norm. With this premise in mind, we report on 6 cases of inflammatory skin disease in which the common denominator was a dermal and/or subcutaneous infiltrate of histiocytoid myeloid cells in patients with new-onset cutaneous eruptions and systemic symptoms. The cases were diverse clinically and microscopically, fell short of the criteria necessary for a diagnosis of classical Sweet's syndrome, and were difficult to categorize at the outset. The systemic manifestations ranged from malaise alone to a combination of fever, chills, night sweats, and polyarthralgia. The clinical morphology of the cutaneous eruptions varied from being papulovesicular in 1 patient to mainly consisting of erythematous plaques and nodules in the remainder. The dermatologists' differential diagnoses included Sweet's syndrome in 3 cases, a drug eruption in 2, and other entities such as erythema nodosum and Well's syndrome. Biopsies in all cases revealed a dermal and/or subcutaneous infiltrate composed predominantly of mononuclear histiocytoid cells of myeloid origin. With the benefit of detailed clinicopathologic correlation, the cases were classified for the purpose of this report as follows: Sweet's-like neutrophilic dermatosis, histiocytoid (3 cases); subcutaneous Sweet's syndrome, histiocytoid (2 cases); histiocytoid neutrophilic dermatosis, unspecified (1 case). In addition, we describe a further instructive case that exhibited overlap with those in the series but proved ultimately to represent leukemia cutis. The spectrum of observations in this report supports and expands the original concept of histiocytoid Sweet's syndrome.

### Erythema nodosum masking nephrogenic systemic fibrosis as initial skin manifestation [^113ARX67]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Case presentation

The patient was a 23-year-old lady with end stage renal failure (ESRF) secondary to glomerulonephritis. She had been receiving automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) for 5 years before presenting to the emergency department with an asymptomatic right sided clavicular lump. The lump was treated conservatively by the attending emergency physician. During one of the subsequent APD clinic follow-ups, she again raised the concerns of the persistent right clavicular lump. She was referred to the orthopaedic surgeon for a second clinical opinion. Ultrasound scan of the clavicle was carried out. It reported the lump as an isoechoic lesion in which the possibility of an abscess formation cannot be ruled out. In order to further clarify the nature of the lump, a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan with gadodiamide (Omniscan, GE Health Diagnostics, Amersham, UK) at a dose of 0.1 ml/kg was carried out. 2 days after the MRI scan, she experienced a febrile illness which lasted for more than two weeks. The illness was associated with migratory joint pains, a feeling of malaise and fatigue. Concurrently, she was noted to have multiple dusky erythematous nodules over her lower limbs with corresponding pitting edema up until the ankles (Fig. 1). A skin biopsy of the lesion revealed erythema nodusum (EN) in which the lymphocytes and histocytes were reported to have infiltrated the subcutaneous layers, mainly involving the fibro adipose septa and also the lower part of the dermis. There was also necrosis of the adipose tissues. Perivascular lymphocytic infiltration was seen in the upper dermis. Blood chemistry panel showed moderate aneamia without leukocytosis. Rheumatic fever screening, Anti-Streptomycin O Titre (ASOT) and mycoplasma antibody tests were negative. Similarly, the echocardiogram showed good ejection fraction without any vegetation or valvular lesion. She was provisionally treated as having possible streptococcal infection with EN. She responded well with intravenous antibiotic and subsequently discharged well. However, three months later, she complained of gradual skin tightening over her fingers, dorsum of the hands and feet (Fig. 2). Soon she became semi wheelchair-bound due to the worsening contracture of her joints. A repeated skin biopsy over her shin showed changes compatible with NSF with CD 34 positive cells in the dermis. The diagnosis was explained to the patient and family. A permanent catheter was inserted and she was started on hybrid therapy (APD supplemented by twice per week high-flux hemodialysis). Her Kt/V improved (2.25 to 2.94) after a period of intensive hybrid therapy. A trial of low dose prednisolone was initiated and she was referred to occupational and physiotherapist for rehabilitation of her stiff joints.

### Erythema nodosum after COVID-19 vaccination in a pediatric patient [^116v5Ts2]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

EN is a septal panniculitis thought to be a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. EN may be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and arthralgias, though this is less common in pediatric patients. EN is often idiopathic but is also known to occur in the setting of infections, systemic inflammatory conditions, medication use, pregnancy, and malignancy, among other conditions. In the pediatric population, group A β -hemolytic streptococcal infection is the most common trigger. Regardless of etiology, the condition is generally self-limiting within 3–6 weeks and resolves without long-term sequelae such as scarring or atrophy. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, but if presentation is atypical, skin biopsy can be considered. We based our diagnosis of EN on the classic clinical presentation and discussion with an on-site pediatric dermatologist. Biopsy was deferred in our pediatric patient given the typical clinical findings and course, and following consideration that biopsy would not likely change management.

The workup involves evaluating for common underlying etiologies including tuberculosis (chest x-ray or interferon-gamma release assays), Streptococcus (antistreptolysin-O titers), and malignancy (complete blood count). In the case of our patient, none of these tests revealed an identifiable cause. Since vaccine-related reactions may occur up to 6 weeks following inoculation according to the Center for Disease Control's timeline for monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine safety, we considered our patient's recent COVID-19 vaccination to be the most likely underlying etiology of her EN. Furthermore, vaccine-associated EN has been described previously up to 30 days after the administration of other vaccines.

Although the majority of EN cases are idiopathic, EN has been described following several different vaccinations. EN has occurred following tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis; bacille Calmette-Guérin; hepatitis B; human papillomavirus; rabies; small pox; typhoid; and cholera vaccines. More recent reports have noted EN following COVID-19 vaccination in the adult population. Vaccine-related EN is generally assumed to represent a reaction to the infectious antigen present in the vaccine, but it could theoretically also represent a response to vaccine adjuvants. To the best of our knowledge, EN following COVID-19 vaccination has not yet been described in the pediatric population.

### Erythema nodosum leprosum as the initial presentation of lepromatous leprosy [^115MR4kR]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), also known as type 2 immunologic reaction or Lepra reaction, is an immunologic complication of leprosy. ENL presents with painful subcutaneous nodules, vesicles, pustules, or ulcers. ENL is a systemic reaction that includes fever, neuritis, and involvement of other organs. This report describes ENL as the initial presentation of lepromatous leprosy (LL), without prior lepromatous symptoms, skin findings, or treatment. This presentation is uncommon, as ENL typically occurs after treatment for LL or borderline lepromatous leprosy (BL).

### Erythema nodosum in Northern Finland between 1996 and 2019: a register-based study [^1112Ywfw]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

A data query returned 170 cases with an L52 code. When the uncertain cases were excluded, there was a total of 142 cases of EN included in this study with a female predominance (n = 112; 78.9%). Mean age at the time of EN diagnosis was 35.9 years (median 33.0 [range, 1–82 years]) and 11.8 years (median 14.0 [range, 1–19 years]) among children and adolescents. There were five cases diagnosed with EN in those younger than 2 years of age. Most commonly, the diagnosis of EN was made at the department of internal medicine (n = 61, 43.0%) followed by the dermatology department (n = 50, 35.2%). In children or adolescents, the diagnosis was most often given at the pediatric clinic (n = 17, 58.6%). (Tables 1 and 2).

TABLE 1
Baseline characteristics of patients diagnosed with erythema nodosum.

TABLE 2
Characteristics of patients with erythema nodosum by age groups.

The occurrence of systemic symptoms was more common in men than in women (p = 0.014). Fever was the most common systemic symptom in men (p < 0.01), whereas it was arthralgia among women. (Table 1). The occurrence of joint pain was most common in people aged 40–64 years, and least common in people over 65‐year‐olds (p < 0.01) (Table 2).

As an etiological factor, gastroenteritis caused by 'Yersinia, Salmonella or Campylobacter' was found more often in males than in females (p = 0.01) (Table 1), and more often in the youngest age groups compared to the older ones (p = 0.026) (Table 2). Malignancy was found in four cases (2.8%): three were internal carcinomas and one leukemia; all the patients were ≥ 40 years.

### Sweet's syndrome evolved from recurrent erythema nodosum in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome [^113WR2rZ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

A 63-year-old man had painful nodules on his lower legs. Microscopic examination showed septal and lobular panniculitis composed of lympho-histiocytic infiltrates. Based on the clinical and histopathological findings, the diagnosis of erythema nodosum (EN) was made. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were temporarily effective, but the eruptions had repeated to the present, and 16 months later, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was diagnosed. Then, 6 months later, he developed a high fever and edematous fresh red-colored nodules on his neck, arm and upper trunk. Histopathologically, a diffuse, dense, dermal infiltrate of neutrophils was seen, and Sweet's syndrome (SS) was diagnosed. SS is known to develop in patients with MDS, and EN is one of the dermatoses that occur in conjunction with hematoproliferative disorders. Furthermore, SS evolving from recurrent EN and the simultaneous occurrence of SS and EN have been reported in some patients. In our case, we suggest that some mediators such as cytokines associated with MDS might have first induced EN, and then, as the MDS developed, they were replaced by others that caused SS.

### Late diagnosis of severe colchicine intoxication [^113zqQpo]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

A 4-year-old Turkish girl was referred to our hospital with the findings of encephalopathy and pancytopenia. She had a history of severe abdominal cramps and gastrointestinal bleeding. A confused state, muscle pain and weakness, erythema-bullous and erythema-nodosum-like skin lesions, and alopecia were observed at her hospitalization. All of these symptoms resolved on follow-up. On laboratory investigation severe thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, mild anemia, a moderate increase in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were detected. After reevaluating her medical history, it was learned that she had accidentally taken 1.3 to 1.5 mg/kg of colchicine 3 to 4 days before her first hospitalization. The possibility of misdiagnosis of colchicine intoxication should be borne in mind, and pediatricians must be aware of its toxic effects, especially in areas where patients with familial Mediterranean fever are present.

### Erythema nodosum in Northern Finland between 1996 and 2019: a register-based study [^115rkh5r]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

In 18.3% (n = 26) of cases a skin biopsy was taken to confirm the diagnosis, most commonly among those ≥ 40 years (p < 0.01). At the time of diagnosing EN, a chest X‐ray was performed in most cases (89.4%), but least often in the youngest age group (p = 0.039). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was analyzed in 127/142 (89.4%) of the cases, the mean (SD, min‐max) value being 39.3 mm/h (28.9, 2.0–104.0) in children (normal range, 1–15 mm/h) and 44.4 mm/h (28.0, 2.0–107.0) in adults (normal range, varying from < 10 to < 45 depending on age and sex).

### Panniculitis [^116Emyo6]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

The classification of inflammatory disorders of the subcutaneous tissue has mystified dermatologists for decades. Overlapping clinical and histologic features, and a lack of specific treatments have added to the confusion. This article initially classifies the various panniculititides by their primary histopathologic pattern: (1) septal panniculitis without vasculitis, (2) septal panniculitis with vasculitis, (3) lobular panniculitis without vasculitis, and (4) lobular panniculitis with vasculitis. Subsequently, we describe the key clinical findings in the most important forms of panniculitis. We begin with the most common form of panniculitis, erythema nodosum. Indeed, in many patients suspected of having panniculitis, a worthwhile question to consider initially might be, "Is this, or is this not, erythema nodosum?" before engaging in an elaborate (and expensive) exercise in differential diagnosis.

### Erythema nodosum-like panniculitis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: two cases reporting a rare cutaneous adverse event [^112QBV9g]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ICPis enhance the immune system's antitumor activity but may also cause immune-related adverse events, of which dermatologic toxicities are among the most common ones. Dermatologic immune-related adverse events may manifest as vitiligo-like leukoderma and various inflammatory eruptions, including lichenoid, eczematous, immunobullous, exanthematous, psoriasiform, and granulomatous patterns, and, although uncommonly, severe cutaneous adverse reactions. To the best of our knowledge, only a few other cases of panniculitis associated with ICPis have been reported in the literature.,

EN-like panniculitis associated with ICPis clinically resembles EN with erythematous plaques favoring the anterior aspects of the lower extremities as seen in this report, consistent with other cases in the literature. Interestingly, 1 patient with ocular melanoma developed EN-like panniculitis while receiving nivolumab and later developed a sarcoidosis-like syndrome. Additionally, 2 other patients with ovarian cancer and melanoma developed EN-like panniculitis without sarcoidosis-like syndrome, mimicking disease recurrence while being treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab. Two additional cases of granulomatous lobular panniculitis have been reported in melanoma patients receiving ICPi therapy, 1 of whom had systemic symptoms, including fever and oligoarthritis, which resolved with systemic corticosteroid therapy. EN-like panniculitis may flare on ICPi rechallenge as seen in case 2, but several reported cases demonstrated clinical resolution without recurrence when immunotherapy was recommenced.

### Fever and indurated subcutaneous plaques [^117SQ7fp]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 2: What systemic complication may be present in this patient?
A. Miliary tuberculosis
B. Sarcoidosis
C. Systemic PAN
D. Acute SLE
E. Hemophagocytic syndrome
Answers:
A. Miliary tuberculosis – Incorrect. Erythema induratum may be an immunologic hypersensitivity reaction to antigenic components of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and has been associated with miliary tuberculosis. However, miliary tuberculosis is unrelated to SPTCL.
B. Sarcoidosis – Incorrect. Sarcoidosis may be associated with erythema nodusum.
C. Systemic PAN – Incorrect. Fever, myalgia, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and bowel and renal ischemia are manifestations, but the histopathology is not consistent with that of PAN.
D. Acute SLE – Incorrect. There is significant overlap of clinical and histologic features in SPTCL and SLE with both conditions often presenting with a constellation of fever, constitutional symptoms, hepatitis, cytopenia, similar cutaneous manifestations, and associated autoimmune disorders. However, the skin biopsy result is not consistent with that of lupus panniculitis.
E. Hemophagocytic syndrome – Correct. Approximately 15% of SPTCL cases have underlying systemic involvement or hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS). These patients have a reduced 5-year overall survival rate of 46% compared with 80% in patients without HPS. HPS is diagnosed by at least 5 features including fever greater than 38.5°C; splenomegaly; blood cytopenia; hypertriglyceridemia or hypofibrinogenemia; hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, or liver; low natural killer cell activity; elevated ferritin; and elevated soluble CD25 (soluble interleukin-2 receptor α). Bone marrow aspiration is important to detect marrow involvement. Our patient had a constellation of fever, splenomegaly, cytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, high ferritin, and bone marrow involvement, thereby confirming the presence of HPS. For systemic involvement, positron emission tomography-fludeoxyglucose body scan and computerized tomographic scans of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis are useful to characterize the location, size and depth of extracutaneous lesions.

### Association of Sweet's syndrome and acute sarcoidosis: report of a case and review of the literature [^1122kQeB]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, SS) may be considered a reactional dermatosis with numerous associated diseases. We describe a rare association between SS and acute sarcoidosis in a 55-year-old woman. The atypical feature of positive tuberculin reaction is discussed. In this association, diagnosis may be challenging with coexistent skin lesions of both diseases. Acute sarcoidosis should be considered when SS is accompanied with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, uveitis or erythema nodosum. Deep-seated nodular lesions in the context of SS are not always 'deep' SS lesions.

### Visual diagnosis: pinpoint, nonfollicular, sterile pustules on edematous erythema in a 15-year-old [^113fn3ib]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility.

AGEP is a rare skin reaction that causes the formation of numerous aseptic pustules on an erythematous base. In most cases, it presents after exposure to drugs, more often antibiotics. Fever and leukocytosis are common. The history, clinical appearance, and histology of the pustules confirm the diagnosis of AGEP. Pustular psoriasis, SJM, and EM must be ruled out. The lesions heal spontaneously within 2 weeks after discontinuation of the offending agent, an occurrence that further supports the diagnosis. Immediate withdrawal of the causative agent and supportive therapy is the mainstay of treatment for AGEP.

### Autoinflammatory syndromes [^114VqwvE]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

Autoinflammatory syndromes comprise a diagnostically challenging group of systemic inflammatory disorders uniquely related by (1) dysregulation of innate immunity, (2) inflammasome activation, (3) dramatic clinical features (high fevers, neutrophilic rashes, and bone or synovial involvement), (4) impressive acute phase responses, and (5) effective treatment with cytokine inhibitors. This review details some of the more common autoinflammatory disorders, their distinguishing features and dermatologic manifestations, and how an accurate diagnosis can be established in patients presenting with periodic or intermittent febrile disorders.

### Fever of unknown origin: clinical overview of classic and current concepts [^111237hy]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) refers to disorders that present with prolonged and perplexing fevers that are difficult to diagnose. This article presents a clinical overview of classic and current causes of FUOs, which may be due to infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, neoplastic, or miscellaneous disorders. Comprehensive but nonfocused diagnostic testing is ineffective and should be avoided. The FUO workup should be directed by the key history, physical, and laboratory findings in clinical presentation. The clinical syndromic approach in the differential diagnosis of FUOs is emphasized, and the diagnostic importance and significance of fever patterns are discussed.

### Erythema nodosum in Northern Finland between 1996 and 2019: a register-based study [^116aGQCV]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

In previous studies, the most common causative factor of EN in children has been bacterial infections and especially, β‐hemolytic Streptococcus. Our findings are consistent with those of other studies; however, in our study, gastroenteritis‐related EN was even more common. We also reported four cases with IBD in children. However, as reported previously, EN was not associated with any other chronic diseases, such as Bechet's disease or malignancies, in the children in our population.

In this study, the typical clinical feature of EN was multiple nodules (95%) seen in both lower limbs (64.8%). Nevertheless, those of advanced age also presented with single nodules (14.3%). We also found that systemic symptoms, especially fever and arthralgia, were common (81%). These findings are in line with the Turkish study (n = 100, mean age 37 years) by Mert et al. In their study, 99% of the cases presented with bilateral, pretibial nodules, 34% with fever, and 45% with arthralgia. An interesting finding of our study was that men presented more systemic symptoms in comparison to women and were more likely to have fever when examined. The oldest and youngest group also reported less arthralgia than the other age groups.

A strength of this study is that all patients were diagnosed in OUH, and diagnosis was based on the patient history and physical examination. However, a skin biopsy was taken in an atypical presentation of EN (i.e. if typical clinical findings, such as the acute onset of tender nodules or plaques, was lacking). Further, all the patient records were reviewed by a medical doctor and uncertain cases (miscoding/diagnoses were further confirmed to other than EN) were not included.

We admit some limitations to our study. As a retrospective study, it was not possible to standardize the diagnostic procedures. Further, not all the data, such as smoking status, were available. Because the study was conducted in hospital setting, some cases with less severe symptoms might be missing since they were treated in primary healthcare.

### VEXAS syndrome presenting as erythema nodosum and pancytopenia: diagnostic utility of 18F-FDG PET / CT in systemic inflammation [^115kg1BQ]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

VEXAS syndrome (Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, Auto-inflammatory, Somatic) is a recently identified adult-onset auto-inflammatory disorder caused by somatic mutations in the UBA1 gene. This syndrome can mimic infections, hematologic malignancies, and autoimmune diseases, making diagnosis challenging. We present a case involving a 47-year-old man with hyperthyroidism who experienced prolonged fever, painful nodules, and pancytopenia. Initial evaluations suggested erythema nodosum and vasculitis. An 18F-FDG PET/CT scan revealed diffuse hypermetabolism in the lungs, bone marrow, spleen, and lower limb muscles, indicating systemic inflammation. A bone marrow biopsy showed vacuolated precursors, and subsequent testing confirmed the presence of a somatic UBA1 mutation, diagnosing him with VEXAS syndrome. This case emphasizes the crucial role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in evaluating unexplained systemic inflammation and assisting in diagnosing rare auto-inflammatory disorders.

### Painful nodules on the lower legs [^117MVF3B]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

History

A 44-year-old man with no prior medical history presented with 2 days of dyspnea and painful, non-pruritic nodules on the bilateral pretibial areas and dorsal feet. The patient was tachypneic and hypoxic and was admitted to the hospital. Laboratory studies were notable for amylase and lipase levels of > 1302 U/L (ref range, 1–105 U/L) and 10,287 U/L (ref range, 73–393 U/L), respectively. Computed tomography scans showed a large right-sided pleural effusion and an epigastric fluid collection.

### Erythematous patches and nodules in a neutropenic patient [^114z8njP]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following treatments is initially preferred?
A. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
B. Corticosteroids
C. Dapsone
D. Colchicine
E. Adalimumab

Answers:

A. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs – Correct. NEH is generally a self-limiting condition that does not require therapy, with most cases resolving within a month of chemotherapy cessation. However, supportive care, including symptomatic management of fever and or pain with NSAIDs, is recommended.
B. Corticosteroids – Incorrect. Corticosteroids, both systemic and topical, have been shown to shorten the duration of lesions and relieve pain in patients with refractory disease. However, the need for systemic steroids in NEH is debatable, and high-dose systemic steroids should be used with caution in neutropenic patients.
C. Dapsone – Incorrect. Case reports have shown that dapsone, which decreases neutrophil migration, can be beneficial in treating NEH, but this is generally reserved for recurrent disease.
D. Colchicine – Incorrect. Colchicine decreases neutrophil chemotaxis, adhesion, and degranulation and has successfully treated neutrophilic dermatoses including Behcet disease and Sweet syndrome. Colchicine has been efficacious in some cases of NEH but is not a first-line therapy.
E. Adalimumab – Incorrect. Adalimumab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that is often utilized for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa, pyoderma gangrenosum, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. It is not an appropriate therapy for NEH.

### Atypical erythema nodosum triggered by COVID-19 infection [^114iv4zH]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

EN is characterized by the clinical and histopathologic findings of acute onset of erythematous, painful, subcutaneous nodules on the anterior "pretibial" area of the lower extremities with a biopsy showing septal panniculitis.EN is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that can be idiopathic or associated with underlying autoimmune conditions or infectious etiology, most commonly reported following streptococcal infection. EN has also been associated with various viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B and C, HIV, and herpes simplex virus. Workup includes a chest x-ray to exclude pulmonary infections such as tuberculosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and sarcoidosis; antistreptolysin O titers; and complete blood counts to rule out malignancy. Our patient presented with the classic characteristics of EN but also had significant involvement of the posterior aspects of her lower extremities, which is atypical. Given the time course of the presentation and lack of other identifiable causes, her EN was likely secondary to her COVID-19 viral infection; however, it may have also been idiopathic. Of the 3 other reported cases of EN secondary to COVID-19, 1 also describes an atypical distribution involving the arms, face, and lower portion of the back. In the documented cases of EN associated with COVID-19 infection, 1 patient reported symptoms of painful tender nodules developing as early as 72 hours after being diagnosed with COVID-19, whereas the other 2 cases experienced symptoms of the lower portion of the leg such as pain, tenderness, swelling, and redness 1 to 2 weeks after their respiratory symptoms started. The pathophysiology leading to typical and atypical presentations of EN in the setting of COVID-19 remains unclear. However, Ordieres-Ortega et alhave postulated that the development of EN in COVID-19 may be due to the dysregulated immune response caused by the virus, specifically including the case of elevated interleukin (IL) 1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-7 in predisposed patients with polymorphisms of IL-1 and IL-6 promoter genes. Future studies are required to investigate this further. Although there are only 3 other known reports of EN triggered by COVID-19 infection, cutaneous manifestations are estimated to occur at a rate of 20.4% and include erythematous papular, vascular, vesicular, and urticarial eruptions. Other atypical skin presentations following COVID-19 infection include generalized pruritis, Sweet syndrome, Kawasaki disease-like presentation, polymorphic patterns, and in our case, atypical EN. Our understanding of cutaneous reactions following COVID-19 infection continues to expand, and this case emphasizes that COVID-19 infection should be included among the list of triggers for EN.

### A case of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis associated with erythema nodosum, arthritis, and reactive cough [^113WizAv]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Given the above findings, a diagnosis of IGM associated with erythema nodosum, arthritis, and reactive cough was made. Tuberculosis infection was ruled out based on a normal chest radiograph and an absence of caseation and acid-fast staining on breast biopsy. Sarcoidosis was considered unlikely given the normal chest radiograph and absence of the more typical diffuse noncaseating granuloma pattern on breast biopsy.

The patient was started on prednisone, 80 mg daily, which led to prompt resolution of her fever, cough, and arthritis. Within a few weeks, her left breast mass showed significant softening and symptomatic improvement. After a 3-month course of tapering prednisone, she was transitioned to azathioprine, 100 mg daily, which she continues to take to maintain the improvement and control over her disease.

We report a 74-year-old woman who presented to hospital with fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and 2 weeks later developed erythema nodosum (EN) on the legs, and was diagnosed with Yersinia enterocolitica infection based on her clinical course and microbiological examination of the stool. She also had a complication of pancreatitis, which made the diagnosis challenging. We should suspect infection by Y. enterocolitica when diagnosing cases of EN with gastrointestinal symptoms. We assume EN is likely to appear 2 weeks after the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms from our case and other case reports.

### Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases in children: single center experience with clinical, genetic, and imaging review [^112HjvSn]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Imaging findings

Neuroimaging typically confirms the clinical diagnosis of stroke. The reported infarctions in these patients can involve the subcortical white matter and deep gray matter. Features of PAN in this disease include areas of infarction of the affected part of the organ and pruning and irregularity of the medium and small arteries in angiogram with development of microaneurysms in the distal branches.

Our study patient presented with recurrent fever, history of left thalamic stroke, livedo reticularis, and with radiologic and histological features of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) on abdominal angiogram and skin biopsy, respectively, at 5 years of age (Fig. 10).

Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome

Underlying gene defect

Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS) is an early-onset encephalopathy that can be caused by a gene mutation in one of 7 discovered genes so far (TREX1, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, RNASEH2A, SAMHD1, ADAR1, and IFIH1). This leads to an increase in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alpha-interferon, CSF leukocytosis, and calcifying cerebral microangiopathy.

### Papules developing in an old tattoo [^112yd6Qh]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Two months later, this patient suddenly developed a low-grade fever and 2- to 4-cm tender, erythematous swollen areas on the shins. There was no scarring or atrophy.

Question 3: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythema nodosum
B. Necrobiosis lipoidica
C. Nodular vasculitis
D. Pretibial myxedema
E. Factitial disease

Answers:

A. Erythema nodosum – Correct. Of the nonspecific manifestations of sarcoidosis, erythema nodosum is the most common. It is a hypersensitivity reaction in fat septae, but the pathophysiologic basis of this condition in sarcoidosis is unknown. It manifests as tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules, most often on the anterior tibia. It can be accompanied by fever, malaise, and polyarthralgia.
B. Necrobiosis lipoidica – Incorrect. This condition is associated with diabetes mellitus and presents with atrophy, which was not seen in this patient.
C. Nodular vasculitis – Incorrect. Nodular vasculitis involves medium-sized arteries in the reticular dermis and can appear much like the nodular swellings of erythema nodosum. It is not associated with sarcoidosis.
D. Pretibial myxedema – Incorrect. Pretibial myxedema is the result of the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the dermis. It is most commonly associated with Graves disease. It is typically asymptomatic and is characterized by swelling and induration of the lower legs. It is not associated with sarcoidosis.
E. Factitial disease – Incorrect. This would be a consideration if the nodules in the tattoo were thought to be of factitial origin. Histopathology for factitial disease would be nonspecific with acute inflammation and scattered erythrocytes.

### Löfgren syndrome on 18F-FDG PET / CT: an acute manifestation of sarcoidosis [^112spRxp]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A 58-year-old man presented with fever, erythema nodosum, and arthralgia of knee and ankle joints. Laboratory data showed signs of inflammation, and chest x-ray revealed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. 18F-FDG PET/CT was acquired to analyze the underlying causes and revealed FDG accumulation in thoracic lymphadenopathy and in subcutaneous lesions and periarticular uptake. This typical triad is known as Löfgren syndrome, an acute manifestation of sarcoidosis and which, as this case shows, can be visualized on 18F-FDG PET/CT. It is important to recognize this syndrome and to discriminate it from the classic presentation of sarcoidosis because of its different diagnostic and therapeutic consequences.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113f6rEF]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis — pediatric clinical manifestations and dissemination patterns are described, including hospitalization and demographics in endemic regions; among 64 children, those with disseminated disease (n = 27) were more likely to be hospitalized, and in extrapulmonary cases 65% were Hispanic, 85% were without comorbid conditions, and 6% were immunocompromised. Primary pulmonary infection may present with fever, malaise, chest pain, and intermittent cough with rare hemoptysis, and the illness is commonly mistaken for bacterial pneumonia; erythema nodosum may be a key clinical finding in endemic regions. Musculoskeletal disease presents with limb swelling and bone and joint pain, and 29% had multiple bones involved. Children with meningitis may have headaches, altered sensorium, vomiting, and focal neurologic deficits; fever may be absent, meningismus occurs in only 50%, and hydrocephalus occurs in most (83% to 100%) children with coccidioidal meningitis. Disseminated disease may also involve generalized lymphadenopathy, skin nodules, plaques or ulcers, peritonitis, and liver abnormalities.

### The causal relationship between inflammatory bowel diseases and erythema nodosum: a bidirectional two-sample mendelian randomization study [^113UMPQu]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The term "inflammatory bowel disease" (IBD) refers to a group of chronic immune-mediated intestinal illnesses that include Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Typical clinical symptoms of IBD include abdominal pain, diarrhea, chronic stomach pain, fatigue, and weight loss. In addition, IBD may present with several kinds of extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) that impact multiple systems, primarily the musculoskeletal, skin, and eyes. According to reports, the frequency of EIMs in IBD patients varies between 6–47%, with approximately a quarter of patients experiencing EIMs prior to being diagnosed with IBD. EIMs dramatically raise the disease burden and negatively impact the quality of life (QoL) of IBD patients, often even more so than the intestinal illness itself.

A clinically prevalent recurring panniculitis, erythema nodosum (EN) is typified with painful subcutaneous nodules and non-ulcerative erythema around the front part of both shins. Systemic symptoms like fever, headaches, and gastrointestinal issues are often present in conjunction with the skin lesions. Although the precise etiology of EN is yet unknown, the most frequent causes of EN are infections caused by streptococci, primary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Behcet's disease, medicines, pregnancy, and IBD. About 4–15% of people with CD and 3–10% of those with UC experience EN, the most prevalent cutaneous symptom of IBD. In most of the research, EN develops following an IBD diagnosis. However, a sizable cohort study found that 14.3% of individuals had an EN diagnosis prior to an IBD diagnosis. IBD and EN have certain genetic, environmental, and pathophysiology variables in common. However, there isn't any proof linking this correlation to causality. In terms of therapy and medicine, causation is more valuable clinically than association. there is no evidence to attribute this association to causation.

Mendelian randomization (MR), a genetic epidemiology technique, has gained popularity as a helpful instrument for assessing the causality between exposures and outcomes. This strategy avoids confounding variables and reverse causation by taking advantage of the random allocation of genetic variation, much like a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Using statistics from the extensive genome-wide association study (GWAS), our research used a two-sample MR analysis to ascertain the causal link between IBD, its subtypes (CD and UC) and EN.

### Treatment of refractory yao syndrome with canakinumab [^116W1n6d]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

YAOS often presents with recurrent and remitting flu-like symptoms followed by fever and erythematous plaques or patches. Our patient experienced symptoms that are commonly reported with YAOS: gastrointestinal manifestations (bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), arthritis and arthralgias, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, headache, weight loss, and chronic pain causing physical impairment.,

Other reported features of YAOS include sicca-like symptoms, most commonly periorbital swelling, lower extremity swelling, oral ulcers, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate/C-reactive protein, leukocytosis, pericarditis, and pleuritis. Cerebral infarction has also been reported in the context of a YAOS-associated fever attack. Eyelid swelling is especially common, seen in > 50% of patients with YAOS. Its absence in our case highlights disease variability and emphasizes recognizing its full spectrum of manifestations. Although 90% of Caucasians experience dermatitis, no Chinese patients with dermatitis have been reported, suggesting possible human leuokocyte antigen-mediated differences in disease expression.

A broad differential should include other systemic autoinflammatory diseases, a group of disorders caused by chronic activation of the innate immune system. In contrast with classic autoimmune disorders, autoinflammatory conditions lack identifiable autoantibodies but rather comprise periodic fever syndromes with evanescent urticarial papules, plaques, figurate erythema, erysipelas-like eruptions, and sterile pustules, typically in association with. fever Elevated acute phase reactants, rash, serositis, arthritis, and lymphadenopathy are present in both autoinflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Yao et aldeveloped a 6-gene panel to screen for periodic fever syndromes that may mimic YAOS (Table I). Typically, recurrent patchy erythema, distal extremity swelling, and eyelid swelling are more suggestive of YS than other hereditary periodic fever syndromes.

### Acral manifestations of sweet syndrome (neutrophilic dermatosis of the hands) [^112eV96A]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Neutrophilic dermatosis of the hand (NDH) is a rare localized variant of the syndrome, originally described two decades ago by Strutton et al. The lesions of NDH and Sweet syndrome are similar, as indicated in the first report of NDH. Both diagnoses are characterized by an acute onset of fever, leukocytosis, and tender, erythematous infiltrated plaques. There are also bullae and ulceration in NDH, in contrast to Sweet syndrome, in which bullae are quite uncommon, especially at the early stages. Similar to Sweet syndrome, the majority of NDH patients are women (69%). Patients with NDH present with fever, peripheral neutrophilia, leukocytosis, and/or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level, but at a significantly lower rate than those in Sweet syndrome (33%). Similar to Sweet syndrome, NDH has been associated with the following conditions: Malignancies (particularly hematological [21%], most common of which is acute myelogenous leukemia, but many other malignancies as well), inflammatory bowel disease (19%), medication and vaccination-related eruptions, bacterial and viral infections, rheumatologic diseases, and others. The clues to the diagnosis of NDH are the same as for Sweet syndrome. Awareness of this diagnosis is important not only to avoid unnecessary medical and surgical therapy and to expediently initiate the administration of steroids for this highly responsive dermatosis, but also to conduct an appropriate workup to exclude associated diseases, especially malignancies.

### Commentary: cutaneous presentation of cardiac myxoma [^115aYacR]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

Rebecca M. Gerlach, MD, FRCPC

Central Message

Autoimmune-like skin changes caused by immunomodulatory cytokines may accompany a cardiac myxoma.

See Article page.

Diagnosing a cardiac myxoma can be challenging, because affected patients frequently present with nonspecific findings, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, or fever. The case report presented here serves as an important reminder to continue to seek alternative diagnoses in the setting of unexplained symptoms such as these. Ajira and associatesfrom Japan present a unique narrative, describing an elderly female patient who initially reported fever, erythema of the legs, and skin changes that were resistant to conventional treatment, Blood tests produced negative culture results yet revealed a neutrophil-dominant leukocytosis and elevated interleukin 6. A skin biopsy revealed neutrophilic infiltration without evidence of vasculitis. Ajira and associatesdo not elucidate what led them to perform echocardiography; however, the transthoracic examination unexpectedly revealed a left atrial mass suggestive of a cardiac myxoma. After surgical removal, pathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of myxoma. Further differentiation by immunostaining was positive for interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. After myxoma removal, the previous neutrophilic dermatosis and fever immediately resolved, and the patient remained free of symptoms at 65 months of follow-up.

A cardiac myxoma may masquerade as an autoimmune disease through the secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines. Secretion of interleukin 6 by cardiac myxomas is a frequent finding, with higher levels correlated with increased tumor size, although this is not always associated with constitutional findings. Cytokine secretion can also lead to a host of paraneoplastic syndromes attributable to the cardiac myxoma, such as Raynaud's phenomenon, erythema and petechiae of hands and feet, leukocytosis, anemia, fever of unknown origin, acute renal failure, or peripheral demyelinating neuropathy. In this case, the neutrophilic dermatosis may have resulted from a common pathway of cytokines related to the cardiac myxoma. Neutrophil-mediated skin diseases are a group of disorders that include pyoderma gangrenosum and Sweet syndrome. As Ajira and associatespoint out, the rapid resolution of the patient's neutrophilic dermatosis and lack of recurrence support the conclusion that it was caused by cytokine release from the myxoma.

### Urticarial rash with leukocytosis and monoclonal gammopathy [^111XLkQE]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 58-year-old man is being evaluated for a 4-year history of a diffuse, intermittent, nonpruritic rash associated with intermittent arthralgia, myalgia, generalized lymphadenopathy, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds over 8 months. The symptoms did not appear in a predictable pattern each day or week. The rash was not responsive to oral antihistamines. Laboratory tests over the 4 years showed persistent leukocytosis (range 13,000–20,200/μL[13.5–20.2×10 9 /L]) with neutrophilia (range 11.2–17.3×10 3 /μL [11.2–17.3 10 9 /L]), worsening anemia (hemoglobin concentrations of 13.2–11.0 g/dL [132–110 g/L]), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (92 mm/h), C-reactive protein (154 mg/L), and ferritin (494 ng/mL [494 μg/L]), and monoclonal IgM-κ gammopathy. Workup for Lyme disease, hepatitis B and C, HIV, tuberculosis, and syphilis was negative. Antinuclear antibody, anti–double- and single-stranded DNA, rheumatoid factor, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB were negative, and complement levels were within normal limits. Bone marrow and excisional lymph node biopsies were unrevealing. Physical examination revealed erythematous wheals coalescing into plaques scattered symmetrically on the trunk and extremities (Fig 1). A punch biopsy of the left arm was performed (Fig 2).

### Diagnosis of generalized pustular psoriasis [^1139XAN4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a severe rare skin disease characterized by widespread eruptions of sterile pustules with or without systemic inflammation. Because of the extracutaneous manifestations of the disease, which include fever, leukocytosis, general malaise, and may include multiorgan involvement, GPP flares can be life threatening if not diagnosed accurately and treated promptly. However, there is a lack of international consensus on the diagnosis and management of patients with GPP, and the rarity of the disease and absence of consistent diagnostic criteria and methodologies are substantial hurdles to achieving an accurate diagnosis. Although there are similarities among the available guidelines, recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of GPP offer new opportunities to develop internationally standardized guidelines and adopt new methodologies for accurate and rapid diagnosis of the disease. In this article, we highlight the clinical spectrum of GPP and the diagnostic challenges due to the lack of standardized guidelines, provide an overview of the current methods for the diagnosis of GPP, and describe the available differential diagnostic strategies.

### A dermatologic emergency; Sweet's syndrome [^1172M8mx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sweet's syndrome (SS), also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is a rare condition characterized by recurrent erythematous skin lesions. Skin lesions appear as papules, nodules and plaques located on the upper extremity, trunk, neck and face.

Case Report

A 72-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with a 10-day history of generalized rash, generalized muscle and joint pain and high fever. He had a history of upper respiratory tract infection. He presented with painful erythematous plaques on both lower and upper extremities and the trunk as well as serohemorrhagic bullous lesions on the feet. The laboratory results revealed WBC count of 20.6 × 10³/mm³ (76.9% neutrophils), CRP (c-reactive protein) of 33 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation of 110/h. The patient was referred to a dermatologist with prediagnosis of SS due to the presence of typical painful skin lesions, high fever and neutrophilic leukocytosis. A systemic corticosteroid therapy was initiated. The diagnosis for SS was confirmed after the skin biopsy revealed the presence of dense dermal infiltrate of neutrophils and leukocytoclasis in the upper dermis. The patient responded rapidly to corticosteroids and the skin lesions improved.

Conclusion

We reported this case as it was a rare life-threatening dermatosis diagnosed in the emergency department, which is generally difficult to diagnose therein, and the skin lesions appeared on the lower extremities.

### Panniculitis with fever of unknown origin [^1166zKwc]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Based on aetiology, panniculitis is a relatively rare process in children and is among many diseases that cause panniculitis. Other forms of childhood panniculitis include, poststeroidal panniculitis, neonatal scleroderma, cold panniculitis, newborn subcutaneous fat necrosis among others. There are very few reports of panniculitis in children that are well described in adults. The most common type is erythema nodosum, a septal panniculitis without vasculitis, which is clinically defined as the appearance of painful and inflammatory cutaneous nodules that primarily affect the pretibial region of the lower limbs. These nodules typically resolve on their own in 1–6 weeks without ulceration or cutaneous atrophy. It is a pluriaetiological condition that usually develops because of a hypersensitivity response linked to paediatric enteric, tuberculosis or streptococcal infections, as well as beta-lactam and macrolide use. The patient in this instance had subcutaneous nodules, a fever and systemic symptoms, all of which were clinical signs of panniculitis and called for a thorough diagnostic evaluation. Clinically, panniculitis manifests as deep plaques or nodules, irrespective of the aetiology. To arrive at an accurate diagnosis, it is thus important to supplement its investigation with a histological study. Nevertheless, given the restricted capacity of adipose tissue to respond with various patterns, its histology is not easily interpreted. It is the physician's responsibility to decide when to do a skin biopsy, which is the most effective diagnostic tool. It is important to perform the biopsy early on to prevent the lesion from evolving into one with less specific histological changes.

### From acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis to neutrophilic disease: forty years of clinical research [^112qEJCd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

In 1964, Sweet described an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis. It is now widely accepted that Sweet's syndrome belongs to a group of associated neutrophilic dermatoses. Although clinically dissimilar, Sweet's syndrome, pyoderma gangrenosum, subcorneal pustular dermatosis, erythema elevatum diutinum, and a few other conditions can be considered a part of this same pathologic spectrum of inflammatory disorders because of (1) the existence of transitional and overlap forms; (2) the similar histopathologic feature of an infiltrate by normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes; (3) the possible occurrence of extracutaneous neutrophilic infiltrates, defining the neutrophilic disease; and (4) the frequent association with systemic diseases. According to the localization of the neutrophilic infiltrate, we describe neutrophilic dermatoses en plaques (dermal), superficial (epidermal), and deep (dermal and hypodermal). Almost every organ of the body may be involved by a neutrophilic aseptic inflammation. The main systemic diseases associated with neutrophlic dermatoses are hematologic, gastrointestinal, and rheumatologic diseases. Although the pathophysiology of these conditions is still poorly understood, treatment with systemic anti-inflammatory agents is usually efficacious.

### Fever, joint pain, and systemic inflammation in a young adult: recognising adult-onset Still's disease [^116L3RVJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A young man presented with recurrent high-spiking fevers, diffuse arthralgia, hepatomegaly and a transient salmon-coloured rash. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis, markedly elevated inflammatory markers and extreme hyperferritinaemia. Extensive infectious and autoimmune workups were negative. The patient met Yamaguchi criteria for adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) and responded well to corticosteroids and biologic therapy with canakinumab. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of AOSD and the importance of early consideration in patients with systemic inflammation and prolonged fever who have negative infectious and autoimmune testing.

### An unusual presentation of vilanova disease (erythema nodosum migrans) with superficial histologic changes [^114KHt6j]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Erythema nodosum migrans (ENM) is a rare clinical variant of erythema nodosum (EN). It is a septal panniculitis characterized by asymmetrical, mildly tender, nodules that migrate over time.

Fever, sore throat, or arthralgias may also accompany the cutaneous manifestations of the disease; however, this is uncommon. The treatment of choice for ENM is potassium iodide. We present a case of a 77-year-old woman with a 5- month history of ENM that was treated successfully with topical clobetasol.

### A pruritic linear urticarial rash, fever, and systemic inflammatory disease in five adolescents: adult-onset still disease or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis sine arthritis? [^112FfmWS]. Pediatric Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

The characteristic rash of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a transient erythematous eruption associated with a quotidian spiking fever. Usually asymptomatic, it can be pruritic, with dermatographism at sites of scratching or pressure. An illness similar to this entity in adults is designated adult-onset Still disease. The relationship between the pediatric and adult disease is uncertain and differences in case definition have evolved. Specifically, a sustained arthritis for at least 6 weeks is required for a diagnosis of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, whereas transient arthritis and arthralgia are accepted criteria in adult-onset Still disease. We describe five patients less than 16 years of age who presented with an acute illness characterized by fever and a distinctive skin eruption. Intense pruritus and linear erythematous lesions flared with a spiking fever, usually in the late afternoon and evening. Periorbital edema/erythema and nonlinear urticarial lesions were also seen. Two children had splinter hemorrhages of the nail beds and one girl developed a fixed, scaling, pigmented, linear eruption. Severe malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, and leukocytosis were present in every patient. Other systemic manifestations included sore throat, transient arthritis, abdominal pain, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, hyperferritinemia, and hepatic dysfunction. No patient had a sustained arthritis. The course of the disease was variable. One patient, diagnosed with macrophage activation syndrome, recovered on oral naproxen. Two patients responded to systemic corticosteroid therapy. One girl developed status epilepticus and died from aspiration and asphyxia. A boy with severe hepatitis developed renal failure and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and was treated with plasmapheresis, dialysis, and systemic corticosteroids; he had recurrent episodes of rash and fever into adult life. These children did not fulfill the case definition of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis because they lacked a persistent arthritis. Adolescent and adult patients with the same clinical and laboratory findings are described under the rubric of adult-onset Still disease. Recognition of the distinctive urticarial skin eruption and spiking fever is important in the diagnosis of a disease with severe morbidity and potentially life-threatening complications.

### A complication of cosmetic medical tourism [^1165d47g]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Answers:

A: Injection site reaction – Incorrect. Injection site reactions, such as erythema, swelling, pain, and bruising, are common immediate reactions, which generally resolve spontaneously within a week.
B: Acne fulminans – Incorrect. Acne fulminans is a rare disorder presenting as an acute, painful, ulcerating, and hemorrhagic lesions on face and trunk. It usually affects young males. It may be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, polyarthritis, hepatosplenomegaly, leukocytosis, etc. X-rays may show osteolytic bone lesions.
C: Acute facial cellulitis – Incorrect. Acute facial cellulitis is mostly unilateral acute infection, caused by Group A Streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus, and is usually accompanied by systemic symptoms. Routine laboratory tests may show leukocytosis. Fourteen days treatment with systemic amoxicillin-clavulanic acid followed by ciprofloxacin is expected to improve symptoms of this condition.
D: Delayed inflammatory reaction to dermal filler – Incorrect. Delayed inflammatory reactions are immune mediated reactions to dermal fillers. They appear weeks to years after injection of resorbable or permanent fillers. Such reactions are usually not accompanied by regional lymphadenopathy, neither start on day 4 after the injection.
E: Mycobacterium abscessus infection – Correct. Inflammatory nodules, presenting within 3 to 7 days after filler injection are suspected as infection. In spite Staphylococci and Streptococci are the most identified organisms, limited response to first-line antibiotics and lack of growth from routine bacterial culture should raise suspicion of nontuberculous mycobacteria. The most common nontuberculous mycobacteria species causing postcosmetic procedures skin infection are M abscessus, followed by Mycobacterium chelonae and Mycobacterium fortuitum.

### Unexplained recurrent fever: when is autoinflammation the explanation? [^115cW19G]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Recurrent fever can be the sole or leading manifestation of a variety of diseases including malignancies, autoimmune diseases and infections. Because the differential diagnoses are manifold, no formal guidelines for the approach of patients with recurrent fever exists. The newly recognized group of autoinflammatory diseases are often accompanied by repetitive fever attacks. As these episodes are frequently associated by a variety of divergent presentations, the differentiation of other causes for febrile illnesses can be difficult. In this article, we first review disease entities, which frequently present with the symptom of recurrent fever. In a next step, we summarize their characteristic pattern of disease presentation. Finally, we analyse key features of autoinflammatory diseases, which are helpful to distinguish this group of diseases from the other causes of recurrent fever. Recognizing these symptom patterns can provide the crucial clues and, thus, lead to the initiation of targeted specific diagnostic tests and therapies.

### Fever of unknown origin: focused diagnostic approach based on clinical clues from the history, physical examination, and laboratory tests [^112W7EYY]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The causes of fevers of unknown origin (FUOs) are diverse and may be the result of infectious rheumatic or inflammatory, neoplastic, or miscellaneous disorders. This article reviews the focused diagnostic approach to FUOs, emphasizing relevant history, physical examination, and selected laboratory tests using a clinical syndrome approach. Laboratory tests should be guided by the most likely diagnoses based on the presenting clinical syndrome. Considered in concert, nonspecific laboratory tests may provide important diagnostic clues. Using a sequential diagnostic approach, a focused evaluation diagnoses all but the rarest or most obscure causes of FUO.

### Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa in children [^115bv57g]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to present the clinical courses and histologic findings of 4 children with cutaneous vasculitis characterized by tender cutaneous nodules and fever in the absence of major organ involvement. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 4 patients with cutaneous vasculitis followed up for a mean of 68 months (range, 12–114 months). The patients included 3 boys and 1 girl (ages at onset, 2–10 years). Clinical and laboratory manifestations included tender erythematous cutaneous nodules (n = 4/4), fever 39 degrees C or higher (4/4), nondeforming arthritis (3/4), leukocytosis and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (4/4), positive antinuclear antibodies (1/4), and elevated streptococcal enzymes (3/4). Skin biopsy results showed inflammation of medium-sized cutaneous arteries with a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate consistent with cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (4/4). Patients were treated with prednisone with good initial response, but exacerbation occurred once prednisone was tapered. Additional medications given were methotrexate (2/4), dapsone (2/4), colchicine (1/4), and cyclophosphamide (1/4). One patient is in clinical remission after 48 months of disease; the others have continuing disease that requires treatment. Patients with evidence of streptococcal infection received oral penicillin prophylaxis; two of the three patients had recurrent attacks of vasculitis despite penicillin. No patients have developed major organ system involvement after 12 to 114 months of follow-up. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa in children is a recognizable entity characterized by painful nodules, fever, absence of major organ involvement, and chronic or recurrent course. Patients should be screened for streptococcal infection and treated with antibiotics when needed.

Introduction: Back pain is a relatively common presenting symptom in children and adolescents. Typical causes include spinal deformities (such as scoliosis), spondylolysis, bulging or herniated intervertebral disks, functional pain (such as fibromyalgia), spondylodiscitis, post-traumatic injuries, benign or malignant tumors, osteomyelitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Erythema nodosum (EN) is the most common panniculitis in childhood. EN lesions are localized at lower limbs in particular on the pretibial region, upper limbs and trunk are rarely involved. EN can be associated with general symptoms such as fever, weakness, sever pain, but skin lesions resolve without skin damage. EN can be associated with infectious diseases (beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Chlamydia and Mycoplasma Pneumoniae, Epstein-Barr virus, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis), inflammatory bowel diseases, coeliac disease, rheumatologic diseases, malignant tumors.

Objectives: To report the case of a 9-year-old patient with back pain and erythema nodosum. To report the case of a 9-year-old patient with back pain.

Methods: A 9-year-old girl comes to our Department because of back pain and asthenia. Two weeks before the back pain onset the patient got a trauma due to a fall from a swing. Then the patient presented fever (with a temperature up to 38 ° Celsius) for 2–3 days, associated with epistaxis, asthenia and lumbar pain. At first these symptoms were treated with non steroidal antinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Since symptoms got worse she underwent to an orthopedic evaluation that found scoliosis in dorsal and lumbar column and bilateral valgus foot. For the persistence of both back pain and asthenia the patient came to our Department. Our clinical examination revealed: pain in lumbosacral column and on the pressure of the right sacroiliac joint; erythema nodosum on the pretibial region of the left lower limb.

### Clinical course and characteristics of generalized pustular psoriasis [^117RTKSi]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Generalized pustular psoriasis is characterized by recurrent flares of widespread, painful, fiery erythema studded with sterile pustules that may coalesce to form lakes of pus. Mucosal involvement may also occur, and manifests as cheilitis, geographic tongues or fissured tongues, and genital lesions. Severity can range from mild to severe, and an individual patient can experience different disease extent, severity, and cutaneous and extracutaneous symptoms with each flare. Generalized pustular psoriasis flares may or may not be accompanied by systemic symptoms, including fever, general malaise, fatigue, and disabling edema. Common laboratory abnormalities observed in GPP flares include leukocytosis and neutrophilia, elevated CRP levels, hypocalcemia, hypoalbuminemia, and abnormal liver function tests.

High fever has been reported in approximately 24–96% of patients during a GPP flare (Table 1) and approximately 30–70% of patients have leukocytosis with neutrophilia recorded. There is no international consensus on the definition of a severe GPP flare. In a single-center study of 95 patients with acute GPP affecting > 30% of the body surface area (BSA), pain, fever, and leukocytosis were prevalent and documented in 96.8%, 95.8%, and 82.1% of patients, respectively. Hence, a GPP flare affecting > 30% BSA may be classified as a severe or significant flare because of its association with systemic inflammation. Systemic inflammation, defined as a fever > 38 °C with leukocytosis > 12 × 10⁹/L, is more prevalent in patients with IL36RN variants. Patients with homozygous IL36RN variants have a more severe phenotype that is characterized by early onset, low prevalence of plaque psoriasis, and a high risk of systemic inflammation. Extracutaneous manifestations of a GPP flare include arthritis and arthralgia, uveitis and conjunctivitis, and neutrophilic cholangitis. Generalized pustular psoriasis is also associated with multiple comorbidities, such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, anxiety, and depression.

### Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma presented as erythema nodosum: a case report [^112iK5mj]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is an extremely rare subtype of primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas mimicking panniculitis. Clinically, patients are usually presented with subcutaneous nodules, which usually leads to initial misdiagnosis as a benign cutaneous condition. Here, we report a 40-year-old female who presented with subcutaneous erythematous nodules on her extremities with fever. On the basis of the clinical presentations, histopathological features and immunohistochemical findings, a diagnosis of SPTCL was made. The patient was treated with the injection of recombinant human interferon α-1b (30μg) every other day for 3months. The lesions gradually regressed. No new erythema nodules reappeared during the 10-month follow-up.

### Cotton fever: does the patient know best? [^1179z44k]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Fever and leukocytosis have many possible etiologies in injection drug users. We present a case of a 22-year-old woman with fever and leukocytosis that were presumed secondary to cotton fever, a rarely recognized complication of injection drug use, after an extensive workup. Cotton fever is a benign, self-limited febrile syndrome characterized by fevers, leukocytosis, myalgias, nausea and vomiting, occurring in injection drug users who filter their drug suspensions through cotton balls. While this syndrome is commonly recognized amongst the injection drug user population, there is a paucity of data in the medical literature. We review the case presentation and available literature related to cotton fever.

### Fever of unknown origin: a clinical approach [^115ChBjx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Fevers of unknown origin remain one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in medicine. Because fever of unknown origin may be caused by over 200 malignant/neoplastic, infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, and miscellaneous disorders, clinicians often order non-clue-based imaging and specific testing early in the fever of unknown origin work-up, which may be inefficient/misleading. Unlike most other fever-of-unknown-origin reviews, this article presents a clinical approach. Characteristic history and physical examination findings together with key nonspecific test abnormalities are the basis for a focused clue-directed fever of unknown origin work-up.

### Immunodeficiency due to a novel variant in PIK3CD: a case report [^112X2frn]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary immunodeficiencies are immunological disorders caused by gene mutations involved in immune system development and activation. Recently, activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS) due to mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit delta gene (PIK3CD), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1) genes have been reported to induce a combined immunodeficiency syndrome leading to senescent T cells, lymphadenopathy, and immunodeficiency. The exact diagnosis of these deficiencies is essential for treatment and prognosis. In recent years, targeted treatment with selective PI3Kd inhibitors has had a significant effect on controlling the symptoms of these patients.

Case presentation

In this case report, we represent a 27-month-old girl with recurrent fever, an increased level of inflammatory markers, and erythema nodosum, who was referred to the rheumatology clinic. In the course of evaluations, because of the lack of clinical improvement with usual treatments, and a history of frequent respiratory infections, combined immunodeficiency was diagnosed in the immunological investigations. Moreover, whole-exome sequencing was performed for her.

Conclusion

The genetic analysis found a novel variant of PIK3CD (c.1429 G > A) in the patient. Following daily antibiotic prophylaxis and monthly IV therapy, the patient's frequent infections and fevers were controlled.

### Erythema nodosum leprosum as the initial presentation of lepromatous leprosy [^115v4d39]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 22-year-old man emigrated from Cuba via Nicaragua 2 years prior. Shortly after emigration, he experienced recurrent fevers, myalgias, night sweats, and inguinal lymphadenitis. Courses of doxycycline or systemic steroids prescribed by nondermatologists in an urgent care setting produced improvement followed by recurrence. Two months preceding presentation, he developed recurrent fevers peaking at 103.2 °F, inguinal lymphadenitis, paresthesias and weakness affecting the distal upper extremities, and a painful rash. Physical exam demonstrated erythematous, edematous papules and nodules without secondary change on the cheek and distal extremities (Figs 1 and 2). There were also scattered erythematous plaques and postinflammatory changes on the upper extremities. Additional examination revealed hyperlinearity and scaling of the left palm and several digits on the right hand and fullness of the ears without tenderness but no ulnar nerve thickening. Tender bilateral inguinal lymphadenitis was present. Neurologic exam demonstrated diminished grip strength in the left upper extremity, thenar and hypothenar atrophy, and decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch in the distal upper extremities. Fundoscopic exam was normal. Review of systems was notable for night sweats, photophobia, upper extremity weakness, arthralgia, and a single episode of testicular pain 1 month prior.

We report a case of visceral leishmaniasis (VL)/HIV coinfection in a patient undergoing regular antiretroviral therapy and treatment with thalidomide for erythema nodosum leprosum. He presented at a health service with high fever, chills, asthenia, pale skin, lower limb edema, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. Visceral leishmaniasis was confirmed by direct examination, and serological and molecular tests. Serum levels of Th1/Th2 cytokines were measured. The patient began treatment with liposomal amphotericin B, with good clinical response; however, VL recurred 6 months later. Treatment was reinitiated, maintaining secondary prophylaxis with liposomal amphotericin B. The patient showed clinical improvement with important recovery of CD4 + T-lymphocyte count.

### Diffuse granulomatous panniculitis associated with anti PD-1 antibody therapy [^112nvLbd]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Panniculitis, inflammation of the subcutaneous fat, is a relatively rare condition that is generally associated with infection, trauma, malignancy, or inflammatory states. The diagnosis of panniculitis can be difficult to make on physical examination, as the subcutaneous nodules or plaques can resemble other conditions, such as vasculitis or tumors. Although a presumptive diagnosis is frequently made clinically, histologic evaluation is required for a definitive diagnosis. Histologic assessment is especially valuable when malignant conditions, such as metastatic cancers or subcutaneous lymphomas, need to be excluded and distinguished from panniculitis, such as in our patient. Although the exact pathophysiology is unknown, panniculitis is generally considered a type IV delayed hypersensitivity cellular reaction primarily to viruses, bacteria, fungi, or other antigens. The reaction is lymphohistiocytic in part, and granuloma formation is a natural end product of a heightened cellular immune response.

In our case, the finding of the erythematous skin nodules showed a lobular, septal, and paraseptal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate that was overtly granulomatous in nature, with the presence of multinucleate histiocytes (Fig 2, A and B). The findings were reminiscent of those of erythema nodosum, the most common type of panniculitis, which typically involves inflammation of the septa in the subcutaneous tissue, usually without associated vasculitis. However, our sample involved lobular, septal, and paraseptal lymphohistiocytic infiltrates and was not limited to the septa as in erythema nodosum. Furthermore, our patient had nodules extending from his lower extremities to his trunk and upper extremities, and erythema nodosum is typically confined to the lower legs. Our patient also did not have fever or arthralgia, which are commonly associated with erythema nodosum. Lipodermatosclerosis/sclerosing panniculitis, another subtype of panniculitis, is typically confined to the lower extremities and is not granulomatous. Therefore, a diagnosis of erythema nodosum-like granulomatous panniculitis was favored. Corticosteroids can be used successfully to treat panniculitis, as demonstrated in our case.

### Löfgren's syndrome: human leukocyte antigen strongly influences the disease course [^116ySDRt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Rationale

Sarcoidosis may consist of a number of distinct disease entities, one of which could be Löfgren's syndrome. Patients with Löfgren's syndrome have an acute onset of erythema nodosum (EN) and/or periarticular inflammation or arthritis of the ankles, with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (and in some cases parenchymal infiltrates) and usually fever. There is a known association between HLA-DRB1*03 and Löfgren's syndrome.

Objectives

To investigate whether human leukocyte antigen type influences clinical manifestations, including the disease course in Löfgren's syndrome.

Methods

We clinically characterized and HLA-DRB1 typed 301 patients with Löfgren's syndrome. A total of 275 of the patients were followed for more than 2 years and classified as having a nonresolving or a resolving disease.

Measurements and Main Results

Almost every DRB1*03-positive patient had a resolving disease within 2 years, and 49% of the DRB1*03-negative patients developed a nonresolving disease. Mucosal granulomas were identified significantly more often in DRB1*03-negative patients. Among DRB1*03-negative patients who were treated with oral steroids at disease onset, 80% developed a nonresolving disease.

Conclusions

Patients with Löfgren's syndrome have a different disease course depending on whether they are DRB1*03 positive or not. This observation has clinical implications, and by comparing DRB1*03-positive and DRB1*03-negative patients with Löfgren's syndrome, we can search for additional markers of importance for developing a resolving or a nonresolving disease, respectively.

A 7-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, congestion, abdominal pain, myalgias, and morbilliform rash. Several aspects of the patient's history, including recent travel, living on a farm, exposure to sick contacts, and new medications, resulted in a wide differential diagnosis. Initial laboratory testing revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated atypical lymphocytes, but did not reveal any infectious causes of illness. He was discharged from the hospital, but then represented to the emergency department a day later with worsening rash, continued fever, abdominal pain, and poor intake. He was then admitted. A more comprehensive laboratory evaluation was initiated. During this hospital course, the patient's physical examination changed when he developed head and neck edema, and certain laboratory trends became clearer. With the assistance of several specialists, the team was able to reach a more definitive diagnosis and initiate treatment to appropriately manage his condition.

### Complex type 2 reactions in three patients with hansen's disease from a Southern United States clinic [^116M2Hzu]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

In non-endemic countries, leprosy, or Hansen's disease (HD), remains rare and is often underrecognized. Consequently, the literature is currently lacking in clinical descriptions of leprosy complications in the United States. Immune-mediated inflammatory states known as reactions are common complications of HD. Type 1 reactions are typical of borderline cases and occur in 30% of patients and present as swelling and inflammation of existing skin lesions, neuritis, and nerve dysfunction. Type 2 reactions are systemic events that occur at the lepromatous end of the disease spectrum, and typical symptoms include fever, arthralgias, neuritis, and classic painful erythematous skin nodules known as erythema nodosum leprosum. We report three patients with lepromatous leprosy seen at a U.S. HD clinic with complicated type 2 reactions. The differences in presentations and clinical courses highlight the complexity of the disease and the need for increased awareness of unique manifestations of lepromatous leprosy in non-endemic areas.

### A case of giant cellulitis-like sweet syndrome and review [^114DsyJ1]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

The clinical differential diagnosis for GCSS includes cellulitis, erysipelas, Well's cellulitis, erysipeloid plaques of congenital autoinflammatory diseases, reactive angioendotheliomatosis, the localized relapsing form of neutrophilic dermatosis, and other neutrophilic dermatoses. All subtypes of SS, including GCSS, are driven by activation and infiltration of neutrophils into the dermis in the absence of infection and suggest complex mechanisms of autoinflammation. Therefore, laboratory findings in GCSS typically demonstrate neutrophilic leukocytosis along with elevated inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, and potentially mild anemia and thrombocytosis. In malignancy-associated cases, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia can be observed. Clinically, GCSS is similar to cellulitis and erysipelas, presenting with tenderness, swelling, and erythema of the affected skin, fever, and leukocytosis. However, on histopathology, GCSS displays abundant dermal neutrophilic inflammatory infiltration with no evidence of infectious organisms or vascular dilation typical of erysipelas. In addition to fever, GCSS can present with other systemic symptoms like malaise and arthralgias. Similar to GCSS, Well's cellulitis and localized relapsing neutrophilic dermatoses have both been associated with a variety of systemic symptoms. However, localized relapsing neutrophilic dermatoses typically occur in areas of tissue damage or injury. Rather than dermal neutrophilic inflammation, Well's cellulitis is characterized by eosinophilic infiltrates and flame figures, and reactive angioendotheliomatosis features vascular proliferation and thrombi. Finally, erysipeloid plaques in congenital autoinflammatory disease typically present at a younger age, and there is typically a suggestive family history. Overall, a thorough history of potential predisposing factors and frequency of episodes, appropriate clinicopathological correlation, and response to anti-inflammatory treatment allow for distinguishing GCSS from its various mimickers.

There has been an expansion of the autoinflammatory syndromes due to the discovery of new diseases related to mutations in genes regulating the innate immune system and the knowledge gained from these diseases as applied to more common nongenetic inflammatory conditions. Autoinflammatory syndromes are characterized by unprovoked (or triggered by minor events) recurrent episodes of systemic inflammation involving various body systems, which are often accompanied by fever. Inflammation is mediated by polymorphonuclear and macrophage cells through cytokines, particularly interleukin-1. This article reviews the clinical approach to patients with suspected autoinflammatory syndromes, several of the main and new (mostly genetics) syndromes, advances in treatment, and prognosis.

### Papulonecrotic lesions and fever in an adult patient [^1143gHTR]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Presentation

A 40-year-old woman with untreated eczema presented with a fever and a painful eruption. Physical examination revealed numerous crusted papulonecrotic erosions and round plaques on the trunk and extremities (Fig 1, A-C). Laboratory evaluation revealed negative antinuclear and extractable nuclear antigen autoantibodies, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus tests. The complete blood count and liver tests were unremarkable. A punch biopsy revealed an eroded epidermis with numerous necrotic keratinocytes and adjacent psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with a lichenoid and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and numerous neutrophils (Fig 2, A and B).

Fig 2
Histopathology. A, H&E, 5×. Low-power view shows an eroded epidermis with adjacent psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia and lichenoid inflammation. B, H&E, 20×. There are numerous necrotic keratinocytes within the epidermis.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation, laboratory studies, and histopathology?
A. Lues maligna
B. Sweet syndrome
C. Bullous vasculitis
D. Mucha-Habermann disease
E. Guttate psoriasis

Answers:

A. Lues maligna – Incorrect. The negative syphilis IgM/IgG test militates against lues maligna, a severe variant of secondary syphilis.
B. Sweet syndrome – Incorrect. Sweet syndrome would show dense neutrophilic infiltrate on histopathology with papillary dermal edema and absence of lichenoid dermatitis with perivascular lymphocytes.
C. Bullous vasculitis – Incorrect. The histopathology failed to reveal features compatible with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
D. Mucha-Habermann disease – Correct. Mucha-Habermann disease (MHD) is an exuberant and severe febrile form of pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta. MHD is characterized by parakeratosis, interface dermatitis with mainly lymphocytes and neutrophils, and extravasated erythrocytes on histopathology.
E. Guttate psoriasis – Incorrect. Although psoriasiform hyperplasia can be seen in guttate psoriasis, a robust lichenoid inflammatory cell infiltrate with papulonecrotic lesions goes against guttate psoriasis.

### Decitabine-induced sweet syndrome [^117W1iSi]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Sweet syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is a rare inflammatory skin condition associated with the sudden onset of high-grade fever, painful rashes usually on the upper body, leukocytosis and neutrophilia. Approximately 21% of patients with Sweet syndrome have a concurrent malignancy, 80% of which are linked to haematological diseases, especially myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia. This is a case report of a woman in her 50s who was recently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia and was started on decitabine 20mg/m 2 (40mg). She complained of fever, multiple hyperpigmented nodules over her limbs with pus, swelling with erythema over the right eye and erosion over the tongue 2days after her first round of chemotherapy. The condition was diagnosed as Sweet syndrome owing to the presence of fever, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and neutrophil-dense infiltrates on skin biopsy. The patient was symptomatically treated, and decitabine was dechallenged. The patient started recovering after 4days and was discharged. On follow-up, chemotherapy with other agents were not reinitiated because of the adverse reaction which ultimately led to the patient's death.

### Acute arthritis, skin rash and lofgren's syndrome [^116h9MgV]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 44-year-old woman, with a known case of hypertension and hypothyroidism (on amlodipine 5 mg daily and thryoxine replacement therapy), presented with fever, multiple joint pains and skin rash for 1-month duration. Joint pains were bilateral, symmetrical, inflammatory type mainly involving large joints (ankle, knee, elbow and wrist) with no history of morning stiffness, recurrent mouth ulcers, photophobia and Raynaud's phenomenon. On general physical examination, she had fever (101°F) and tachycardia (126 beats/min) with no significant peripheral lymphadenopathy. She had multiple tender erythematous nodules on bilateral shins and forearms, suggestive of erythema nodosum (figure 1). On musculoskeletal examination, bilateral ankle and knee joints were swollen with erythematous overlying skin and tenderness (figure 2), suggestive of acute arthritis. Both passive and active movements were restricted in the affected joints. Examination of her chest, cardiovascular system and abdomen was unremarkable.

### Neurological Sweet's syndrome: a rare but treatable manifestation of an autoinflammatory disease [^116c1kZb]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Sweet's syndrome is an autoinflammatory disease characterised by systemic symptoms and a cutaneous neutrophilic dermatosis. Neurological involvement is rare but important to recognise. Patients may have headache, confusion, seizures, and focal neurological deficits; MR brain scanning may show widespread T2-hyperintense lesions, with a CSF pleocytosis. Clinicians should suspect neurological Sweet's syndrome in patients with central nervous system dysfunction, who have unexplained fever or systemic inflammation, and a pustular neutrophilic dermatosis. The condition responds well to corticosteroids, which can prevent long-term neurological sequalae.

### Erythematous plaques with fever and leukocytosis-diagnosis… [^1162R97S]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

MICHAEL E. MINGMD The skin biopsy specimen revealed a dense inflammatory cell infiltrate throughout the papillary dermis that was composed of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and lymphocytes. There was no evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, such as deposits of fibrinoid material around the capillaries, disruption of the vessel structure, or extravasation of erythrocytes. Oral prednisone therapy was initiated at a dosage of 1 mg/kg. Fifteen days later, only residual erythema was noted, and the fever and conjunctivitis had subsided.

### Red, tender nodules in a child with cellulitis… [^115eHHKD]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

, with several on the forearms. The lesions showed no fluctuance or ulceration. The cellulitis on his trunk was clearing. A rapid polymerase chain reaction test was negative for COVID-19. He had increased platelets, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and streptolysin antibody. White blood cell count and antinuclear antibody findings were negative. The patient's fevers dissipated slowly over two weeks, and the pain resolved over one month of treatment with ibuprofen. Question Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis. A. Atypical pityriasis rosea. B. Erythemainduratum. C. Erythema nodosum. D. Toxic shock syndrome. Discussion The answer is C: erythema nodosum, the most common form of panniculitis.

Streptococcal infection is the most common cause in children. Erythema nodosum is a rare condition that typically presents in individuals in their 20s and is more common in women; however, it can occur in anyone. 1, 2 Erythema nodosum has an acute onset and typically presents as erythematous, tender nodules or plaques that are 1 to 6 cm in diameter. The lesions normally become bruise-like and resolve without scarring. Typical prodromal symptoms of fever, malaise, and upper respiratory tract symptoms are ambiguous and may be related to an underlying etiology. Lesions are bilateral and symmetrical along the knees, shins, and ankles but can occur in other areas. The condition is self-limited and clears without intervention in one to six weeks. 2 Biopsy can confirm the diagnosis but is usually unnecessary. Inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and platelets can support the diagnosis; elevations are proportionate to the level of disease burden.

A complete blood count with differential is helpful in excluding hematologic malignancy and may be suggestive of an active viral or bacterial infection.
