## Question

Is hibiscus tea effective for arrhythmia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hibiscus tea (Hibiscus sabdariffa) is effective for treating or preventing cardiac arrhythmias. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what direct evidence exists for hibiscus and arrhythmias. Then, I should verify whether any cardiovascular effects of hibiscus (like blood pressure lowering) plausibly translate to arrhythmia prevention. Next, I will review broader data on herbal products in cardiovascular disease and safety considerations that might affect arrhythmia risk. After that, I should compare this to evidence-based arrhythmia therapies and lifestyle measures. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and practical recommendation with appropriate cautions and references [^112Wmbz9] [^112NfAkK] [^116qJHxU] [^1176ssdc].

> Let me first confirm the direct evidence base. Wait, let me verify the documents mentioning hibiscus specifically: I see a high-credibility meta-analysis showing antihypertensive effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa and a genomics paper on hibiscus metabolism, but I do not find clinical trials, observational studies, mechanistic electrophysiology, or case reports linking hibiscus tea to arrhythmia treatment or prevention in humans, which suggests a gap in evidence rather than proof of benefit [^112Wmbz9] [^117EqKNH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from general cardiovascular effects. The meta-analysis indicates hibiscus lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which is relevant because hypertension is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, but I should confirm that no study has tested hibiscus for arrhythmia outcomes; indeed, there is no direct link showing hibiscus reduces incident atrial fibrillation, suppresses ectopy, or treats tachyarrhythmias, so extrapolation would be speculative at this point [^112Wmbz9] [^111eorQT]. Hmm, wait a minute — at first glance I thought BP reduction might indirectly support AF prevention, but I need to correct that assumption: absence of trials means no established arrhythmia benefit for hibiscus despite its antihypertensive signal [^112Wmbz9] [^111eorQT].

> Next, I should review the broader herbal medicine context. Herbal products typically reach the market without rigorous preapproval trials, and their efficacy and safety for cardiovascular indications are often unproven, with risks of contamination and drug interactions; so I need to ensure we apply this cautionary framework to hibiscus as well, particularly in arrhythmia populations where proarrhythmia and interactions matter [^112NfAkK].

> I will now examine safety considerations that could be relevant to arrhythmia patients. I should double-check for signals from other teas and supplements: case reports document life-threatening arrhythmias from herb teas causing hypokalemia, and even excessive green tea intake has been linked to hypokalemia, which can precipitate arrhythmias; energy drinks and even grapefruit juice can prolong QTc in some settings, reminding me that "natural" beverages can alter cardiac electrophysiology and interact with QT-prolonging drugs, so I need to ensure patients on QT-liable agents are counseled appropriately [^111MfPLq] [^111GwDt9] [^1132eRoj] [^111hg91V] [^115hg6pc]. But wait, I should verify I'm not overgeneralizing — these are not hibiscus-specific harms; they underscore a principle: in arrhythmia care, untested supplements may carry electrolyte or QT risks that are clinically meaningful in susceptible patients or in combination with QT-prolonging prescriptions like nilotinib or adagrasib, warranting medication reconciliation and ECG/electrolyte vigilance [^111UYh5x] [^1172S5BF].

> Let me consider the comparative, evidence-based landscape for arrhythmia management so we do not substitute unproven tea for effective therapy. For rhythm and rate control, we have labeled antiarrhythmic drugs and acute agents with established efficacy and defined risks, including propafenone, mexiletine, disopyramide, procainamide, dofetilide, and landiolol, guided by careful ECG monitoring and inpatient initiation when indicated, which I should confirm as standard practice rather than relying on herbal adjuncts without data [^116sKuaY] [^11162KGE] [^111X4E6W] [^1142Tsco] [^113rwwk6] [^115VrqFZ]. For ventricular arrhythmias and electrical storm, guideline-directed therapy prioritizes nonselective beta-blockade plus IV amiodarone, with further strategies such as catheter ablation and sympathetic modulation considered in refractory cases, emphasizing that management should follow consensus recommendations, not unproven tea remedies [^116qJHxU] [^1176ssdc] [^116dN2BB].

> I should also confirm lifestyle guidance with actual data relevant to arrhythmias. Alcohol reduction and abstinence demonstrably reduce atrial fibrillation recurrence, whereas large cohort and Holter-monitoring data do not support a link between habitual caffeine-containing beverages and increased ectopy, which helps me advise patients on modifiable factors with evidence rather than assuming tea or caffeine abstention is helpful without data [^114Rzxua] [^112t7Scs] [^1129P1ch] [^116hmb2m] [^117Eo4FM].

> Synthesis and recommendation: Let me reconsider the core question and ensure internal consistency. There are no clinical studies, mechanistic arrhythmia data, or case reports supporting hibiscus tea as a treatment or preventive for arrhythmias in the provided literature, and the only cardiovascular signal is blood pressure lowering, which does not establish arrhythmia efficacy; therefore, hibiscus tea should not be recommended as an antiarrhythmic therapy, and patients should instead use evidence-based treatments and lifestyle measures, while discussing any herbal product use with their clinician to avoid interactions and electrophysiologic risks, particularly in the context of QT-prolonging drugs or electrolyte vulnerabilities [^112Wmbz9] [^112NfAkK] [^111UYh5x] [^1172S5BF] [^116qJHxU] [^114Rzxua].

---

Hibiscus tea is not a proven or recommended therapy for arrhythmia [^112NfAkK]. There is no clinical evidence that it prevents or treats arrhythmias, and it is not included in any guideline for arrhythmia management. While hibiscus tea may lower blood pressure [^112Wmbz9], this does not translate into antiarrhythmic benefit, and excessive intake could cause electrolyte disturbances that increase arrhythmia risk [^111MfPLq]. Patients with arrhythmias should use hibiscus tea cautiously, monitor for symptoms, and consult their clinician before use, especially if taking antiarrhythmic or QT-prolonging drugs [^113pbc4M] [^111whSGF].

## Pharmacological properties of hibiscus tea

Hibiscus tea contains bioactive compounds — such as anthocyanins, flavonoids, and organic acids [^117EqKNH] — associated with cardiovascular effects, including antihypertensive and antioxidant properties [^112Wmbz9]. These compounds may theoretically influence cardiac electrophysiology through the following mechanisms [^114wa3rv]:

- **Antioxidant effects**: Reduction of oxidative stress, which can indirectly influence cardiac ion channels and electrophysiological stability [^114wa3rv].

- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Potential modulation of inflammatory pathways that may affect cardiac function.

- **Ion channel modulation**: Flavonoids have been shown to interact with cardiac ion channels, including HERG channels [^115hg6pc], which are critical for cardiac repolarization.

---

## Evidence regarding hibiscus tea and arrhythmia

Despite the theoretical mechanisms above, there is no direct clinical evidence supporting hibiscus tea for preventing or treating arrhythmias [^112NfAkK]. Most literature focuses on its antihypertensive effects [^112Wmbz9], with limited or no data directly addressing rhythm outcomes. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, but this does not directly translate into antiarrhythmic benefits, as no studies have specifically evaluated hibiscus tea's efficacy in preventing or managing arrhythmias.

---

## Potential risks and side effects

While generally safe for most people, hibiscus tea carries potential risks and side effects relevant to patients with arrhythmias:

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Excessive consumption of herbal teas, including hibiscus, may lead to electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia, which can increase the risk of arrhythmias [^111GwDt9].

- **Drug interactions**: Hibiscus tea may interact with medications commonly used in arrhythmia management, such as antiarrhythmic drugs [^113pbc4M] and anticoagulants, potentially altering their efficacy or increasing the risk of adverse effects [^112NfAkK].

- **QT interval prolongation**: Although not specifically documented for hibiscus tea, flavonoids present in herbal teas have been shown to prolong the QT interval [^115hg6pc], potentially increasing the risk of torsades de pointes and other serious arrhythmias [^113rwwk6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Currently, major cardiovascular societies provide no clinical guidelines or recommendations on using hibiscus tea for arrhythmia management [^1176ssdc]. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines on ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death do not include hibiscus tea or other herbal remedies in standard management strategies [^116qJHxU].

---

## Comparison with conventional antiarrhythmic medications

Conventional antiarrhythmic medications — such as beta-blockers, amiodarone, and propafenone — have well-established efficacy and safety supported by extensive clinical research and regulatory approval [^114Shgrd] [^114hjQJc]. In contrast, hibiscus tea lacks clinical evidence for arrhythmia management and is not recognized as a therapeutic option by regulatory authorities or clinical guidelines.

---

## Patient populations and contraindications

Certain populations should exercise caution — or avoid hibiscus tea — due to potential risks:

- **Patients with electrolyte imbalances**: Individuals with existing electrolyte disturbances, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, should avoid hibiscus tea due to the potential risk of exacerbating arrhythmias.

- **Patients on antiarrhythmic medications**: Patients taking medications that prolong the QT interval [^111whSGF] or interact with herbal products should consult their healthcare provider before consuming hibiscus tea.

- **Pregnant or breastfeeding women**: Safety data regarding hibiscus tea consumption during pregnancy or breastfeeding are limited, and caution is advised.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, there is no clinical evidence supporting hibiscus tea for preventing or treating arrhythmias [^112NfAkK]. Although it may lower blood pressure [^112Wmbz9], its effect on cardiac rhythm disorders remains unproven. Patients with arrhythmias should use hibiscus tea cautiously — particularly if taking medications that interact with herbal products or if electrolyte imbalances are present [^111MfPLq] — and discuss use with their clinician. Healthcare providers should advise patients to prioritize evidence-based medical treatments and consult their healthcare provider before using hibiscus tea or any herbal remedies for arrhythmia management [^1176ssdc].

### Herbal medications in cardiovascular medicine [^112NfAkK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Herbal medications are commonly used for clinical purposes, including the treatment of cardiovascular conditions. Compared with conventional medications, herbal medications do not require clinical studies before their marketing or formal approval from regulatory agencies, and for this reason, their efficacy and safety are rarely proven. In this review, we summarize available evidence on herbal medications mostly used in cardiovascular medicine. We show that the use of these medications for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases is often not supported by scientific evidence.

Despite most of these herbs showing an effect on biological mechanisms related to the cardiovascular system, data on their clinical effects are lacking. Potential relevant side effects, including an increased risk of drug interactions, are described, and the possibility of contamination or substitution with other medications represents a concern. Physicians should always assess the use of herbal medications with patients and discuss the possible benefits and side effects with them.

### Effect of sour tea (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) on arterial hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112Wmbz9]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). High credibility.

Hibiscus sabdariffa L. is a tropical wild plant rich in organic acids, polyphenols, anthocyanins, polysaccharides, and volatile constituents that are beneficial for the cardiovascular system. Hibiscus sabdariffa beverages are commonly consumed to treat arterial hypertension; however, evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has not been fully conclusive. We aimed to assess the potential antihypertensive effects of H. sabdariffa through a systematic review of literature and meta-analysis of available RCTs.

- **Methods**: The search included PUBMED, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and EMBASE (up to July 2014) to identify RCTs investigating the efficacy of H. sabdariffa supplementation on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values. Two independent reviewers extracted data on the study characteristics, methods, and outcomes. Quantitative data synthesis and meta-regression were performed using a fixed-effect model, and sensitivity analysis using the leave-one-out method was conducted. Five RCTs (comprising seven treatment arms) were selected for the meta-analysis. In total, 390 participants were randomized, with 225 allocated to the H. sabdariffa supplementation group and 165 to the control group in the selected studies.

- **Results**: Fixed-effect meta-regression indicated a significant effect of H. sabdariffa supplementation in lowering both SBP (weighed mean difference -7.58 mmHg, 95% confidence interval -9.69 to -5.46, P < 0.00001) and DBP (weighed mean difference -3.53 mmHg, 95% confidence interval -5.16 to -1.89, P < 0.0001). These effects were inversely associated with baseline BP values.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^116qeqVc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Despite a lack of evidence for caffeine abstention or moderation in reducing premature cardiac contractions and arrhythmias, clinicians and treatment guidelines often recommend that such patients avoid caffeine. For example, published guidelines on the management of supraventricular arrhythmias advocate reviewing and eliminating potential exacerbating factors, such as caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine. Popular resources for clinicians, including UpToDate and Medscape, offer similar suggestions for the management of premature beats.

Coffee is among the most commonly consumed beverages in the United States and is the main source of caffeine intake among adults. The biological impact of coffee may be substantial and is not limited to the effects of caffeine. Regular coffee consumption has been associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity and depression. Furthermore, large observational studies have found that habitual coffee drinkers have lower rates of coronary artery disease (CAD) and of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. However, not all evidence favors a protective effect of coffee on CAD. Specifically, one case–control study found an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in the hour after coffee consumption. Interestingly, this effect was stronger in light/occasional coffee drinkers (< 1 cup/day) as compared to moderate coffee drinkers (2–3 cups/day) and absent among heavy coffee drinkers (≥ 4 cups/day).

In considering these results, it is important to recognize that recall bias may have played a role.

### Tasigna [^111UYh5x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warning: QT prolongation and sudden deaths**: Tasigna prolongs the QT interval. Prior to its administration and periodically, it is crucial to monitor for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia and correct these deficiencies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Obtain ECGs to monitor the QTc at baseline, seven days after initiation, periodically thereafter, and following any dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.7, 5.12)].

Sudden deaths have been reported in patients receiving Tasigna [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Do not administer Tasigna to patients with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or long QT syndrome [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Avoid the use of concomitant drugs known to prolong the QT interval and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. Avoid consuming food 2 hours before and 1 hour after taking the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Refer to the full prescribing information for the complete boxed warning.

### Caffeine consumption and cardiovascular risks: Little cause for concern [^1145f92b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Caffeine consumption is virtually ubiquitous in our society. It is naturally found in coffee, tea, chocolate, and cola drinks. Furthermore, caffeine is often added to beverages, foods, pain relievers, and other products. In the United States, coffee accounts for approximately 70% of the caffeine consumed. A report in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association by Dixit and colleagues describes the relations between the reported intake of caffeinated products and the occurrence of arrhythmias assessed by 24-hour Holter monitoring in the Cardiovascular Health Study. The investigation included more than 1300 adults, all of whom were over 65 years of age at baseline. The authors report no association for atrial or ventricular arrhythmia prevalence and reported intake of caffeinated products. The Dixit article provides an opportunity to briefly review the pharmacology of caffeine related to the cardiovascular system and to share recent information and insights from clinical studies and population reports concerning caffeine intake and cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease outcomes, and arrhythmias.

### Drink, drugs, and the QT interval [^111TZfA8]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The effects of several prescription and illicitly-used drugs on electrocardiographic repolarization are well documented, most frequently manifested as prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval. The combination of multiple repolarization-modulating drugs taken in high dosage can occasionally lead to extreme abnormalities of the QTc interval and ST-segment on the surface ECG, which can lead to the erroneous diagnosis of underlying myocardial ischemia and inappropriate treatment. We report on one such case in which the acute management of a syncopal patient was detrimentally influenced by misinterpretation of a very unusual ECG.

### Tea and flavonoids: Where we are, where to go next [^114wa3rv]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

There is a need to evaluate the evidence about the health effects of tea flavonoids and to provide valid, specific, and actionable tea consumption information to consumers. Emerging evidence suggests that the flavonoids in tea may be associated with beneficial health outcomes, whereas the benefits and risks of tea extracts and supplements are less well known.

The next steps in developing tea science should include a focus on the most promising leads, such as reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke, rather than pursuing smaller, more diffuse studies of many different health outcomes. Future tea research should also include the use of common reference standards, better characterization of intervention products, and the application of batteries of biomarkers of intakes and outcomes across studies, which will allow a common body of evidence to be developed.

Mechanistic studies should determine which tea bioactive constituents have effects, whether they act alone or in combination, and how they influence health. Clinical studies should use well-characterized test products, better descriptions of baseline diets, and validated biomarkers of intake and disease risk reduction. There should be more attention to careful safety monitoring and adverse event reporting.

Epidemiologic investigations should be of sufficient size and duration to detect small effects, involve populations most likely to benefit, use more complete tea exposure assessment, and include both intermediary markers of risk as well as morbidity and mortality outcomes.

### Mexiletine hydrochloride [^11162KGE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Mexiletine Hydrochloride Capsules USP are indicated for the treatment of documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia, that, in the judgment of the physician, are life-threatening. Due to the proarrhythmic effects of mexiletine, its use for less severe arrhythmias is generally not recommended. Treatment should be avoided for patients with asymptomatic ventricular premature contractions.

Initiation of mexiletine treatment, like other antiarrhythmic agents used to treat life-threatening arrhythmias, should be conducted in the hospital. Antiarrhythmic drugs have not been shown to enhance survival in patients with ventricular arrhythmias.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^1129P1ch]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In the largest cohort study to ascertain dietary data and quantify cardiac ectopy using 24-hour Holter monitoring — and the first to do so in a community-based cohort — we found no evidence that chronic consumption of caffeinated products was associated with more PACs or PVCs. Our findings suggest that clinical recommendations advising against the regular consumption of caffeinated products to prevent cardiac ectopy and arrhythmia should be reconsidered. However, whether acute consumption of these caffeinated products affects cardiac ectopy requires further study.

### Propafenone hydrochloride [^116sKuaY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Indications and usage**: Propafenone Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated to prolong the time to recurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF) associated with disabling symptoms in patients without structural heart disease. They also prolong the time to recurrence of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) associated with disabling symptoms in patients without structural heart disease. Additionally, they are used to treat documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia that, in the judgment of the physician, are life-threatening. Initiate treatment in the hospital.

- **Usage considerations**: The use of Propafenone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) or in patients exclusively with atrial flutter or PSVT has not been evaluated. Do not use Propafenone Hydrochloride Tablets to control ventricular rate during AF. Some patients with atrial flutter treated with propafenone have developed 1:1 conduction, producing an increase in ventricular rate; thus, concomitant treatment with drugs that increase the functional atrioventricular (AV) nodal refractory period is recommended. The use of Propafenone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation has not been evaluated. Due to the proarrhythmic effects of Propafenone Hydrochloride Tablets, its use with lesser ventricular arrhythmias is not recommended, even if patients are symptomatic. Any use of the drug should be reserved for patients in whom, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the risks.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^111XKkps]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Estimated percent increase in cardiac ectopy for a serving per week increase in coffee, tea, or chocolate consumption is provided with unadjusted and adjusted estimates. These estimates, represented by white and black squares respectively, are adjusted for:

- **Demographics and lifestyle factors**: Clinic site, age, sex, race, income, education level, body mass index, dietary caloric intake, smoking status, number of alcoholic drinks per week
- **Health conditions**: Diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure
- **Medication use**: Use of β‐blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, class I antiarrhythmics, other antiarrhythmics

Y error bars denote 95% confidence intervals, indicating:

- **Cardiac ectopy components**: Premature atrial contraction, premature ventricular contraction, number of runs of supraventricular tachycardia, number of runs of ventricular tachycardia

Additional analyses adjusting for factors associated with atrial fibrillation, such as fish consumption and physical activity, did not meaningfully alter the results. Similarly, adjusting for the effects of other caffeinated product consumption did not reveal any further associations between coffee, tea, or chocolate and cardiac ectopy. No statistically significant interactions between the presence of cardiovascular disease (defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or atrial fibrillation at baseline) and caffeine on the risk of:

- **Cardiac events**: Premature atrial contractions, premature ventricular contractions, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia

were observed (P = 0.17, 0.13, 0.37, and 0.77, respectively).

### Norpace cr [^111X4E6W]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Norpace and Norpace CR are indicated for the treatment of documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia, that, in the judgment of the physician, are life-threatening. Due to the proarrhythmic effects of Norpace and Norpace CR, their use with lesser arrhythmias is generally not recommended. Treatment of patients with asymptomatic ventricular premature contractions should be avoided.

Initiation of Norpace or Norpace CR treatment, as with other antiarrhythmic agents used to treat life-threatening arrhythmias, should be carried out in the hospital. Norpace CR should not be used initially if rapid establishment of disopyramide plasma levels is desired.

Antiarrhythmic drugs have not been shown to enhance survival in patients with ventricular arrhythmias.

### Alcohol consumption reduction and clinical outcomes of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [^112YDj3m]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Study background**: The impact of alcohol consumption on the clinical outcomes of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation was investigated. The study seeks to determine if reducing alcohol intake can improve ablation outcomes.

- **Methods**: Patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation were enrolled in the study. Their alcohol consumption was recorded and analyzed in relation to their clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: A significant correlation between reduced alcohol consumption and positive clinical outcomes post-ablation was observed. Patients who reduced their alcohol intake experienced fewer recurrences of atrial fibrillation compared to those who did not.

- **Conclusion**: This study highlights the importance of lifestyle modifications, such as alcohol consumption reduction, in improving the outcomes of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. Further investigations are warranted to augment these findings.

### Rapiblyk [^115VrqFZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In 14 clinical studies, including 5 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, treatment of 317 adults with supraventricular tachycardia using landiolol demonstrated significant effects. Landiolol decreased heart rates in 40–90% of treated patients within approximately 10 minutes, compared to 0–11% of patients receiving placebo. A heart rate decrease was defined as more than a 20% reduction in heart rate or a heart rate below 100 bpm, or at least temporary cessation of the arrhythmia. In these studies, the infused dose of landiolol ranged from 9.3 to 74.6 mcg/kg/min, which is equivalent to 10 to 80 mcg/kg/min of landiolol hydrochloride.

### Atrial fibrillation [^111eorQT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The disease atrial fibrillation is associated with various conditions, including COPD, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and alcohol consumption. Additionally, it can be linked to heart failure, palpitations, obstructive sleep apnea, acute ischemic stroke, and obesity. Atrial fibrillation is characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm and may involve cardiac arrhythmias, diabetes mellitus, congenital heart disease, absent P waves, chest pain, fibrillatory waves, hypertension, and syncope. It is also associated with coronary artery disease, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, lightheadedness, dyspnea, pulmonary embolism, dizziness, and hyperthyroidism.

### Tea consumption and risk of ischaemic heart disease [^115fx4ym]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Of 487,375 study participants, 128,280 (26.3%) reported consuming tea almost every day. Compared with participants who never consumed tea during the past 12 months, daily tea consumers who usually used more tea leaves were more likely to be younger, urban residents, and more likely to smoke tobacco and drink alcohol. Green tea was the most common type of tea consumed among daily tea drinkers.

During a median follow-up of 7.2 years, we documented 24,665 (7.19 cases/1000 person-years) incident ischaemic heart disease (IHD) cases and 3,959 (1.13 cases/1000 person-years) major coronary events (MCEs), including 2,601 fatal IHD and 1,358 non-fatal myocardial infarctions. In the whole cohort, compared with participants who never consumed tea during the past 12 months, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] for IHD were 0.97 (0.94 to 1.00) for those who consumed tea less than daily. For those consuming 0.1–2.0, 2.1–3.0, 3.1–5.0, and > 5.0 g of tea leaves daily, the HRs were 0.92 (0.87 to 0.97), 0.91 (0.85 to 0.98), 0.92 (0.87 to 0.98), and 0.91 (0.86 to 0.97), respectively.

The corresponding HRs [95% CIs] for MCE were 0.92 (0.85 to 1.00), 0.83 (0.74 to 0.95), 0.99 (0.85 to 1.15), 0.87 (0.75 to 1.00), and 0.97 (0.84 to 1.11). The HRs across the four groups in daily consumers were statistically similar (p-values for linear trend: 0.465 for IHD and 0.218 for MCE).

### Alcohol abstinence in drinkers with atrial fibrillation [^114Rzxua]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with incident atrial fibrillation and adverse atrial remodeling; however, the effect of abstinence from alcohol on the secondary prevention of atrial fibrillation is unclear.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial at six hospitals in Australia. Adults who consumed 10 or more standard drinks (with 1 standard drink containing approximately 12 g of pure alcohol) per week and who had paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation in sinus rhythm at baseline were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either abstain from alcohol or continue their usual alcohol consumption. The two primary endpoints were freedom from recurrence of atrial fibrillation (following a 2-week "blanking period") and total atrial fibrillation burden (proportion of time in atrial fibrillation) during 6 months of follow-up.

- **Results**: Of 140 patients who underwent randomization (85% men; mean [± SD] age, 62 ± 9 years), 70 were assigned to the abstinence group and 70 to the control group. Patients in the abstinence group reduced their alcohol intake from 16.8 ± 7.7 to 2.1 ± 3.7 standard drinks per week (a reduction of 87.5%), and patients in the control group reduced their alcohol intake from 16.4 ± 6.9 to 13.2 ± 6.5 drinks per week (a reduction of 19.5%). After a 2-week blanking period, atrial fibrillation recurred in 37 of 70 patients (53%) in the abstinence group and in 51 of 70 patients (73%) in the control group. The abstinence group had a longer period before recurrence of atrial fibrillation than the control group.

### Dying for a cup of tea [^111MfPLq]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 70-year-old woman who developed life-threatening arrhythmia as a result of acute and severe hypokalaemia, which she developed after consuming large quantities of a liquorice-rich herb tea. She had no previous heart condition.

We also discuss the legislative discrepancy in both the United States and Europe, whereby consumers are warned about the risk of chronic hypertension whenever they buy a product containing liquorice, yet the risk of hypokalaemia may not be mentioned at all.

### Caffeine consumption and cardiovascular risks: Little cause for concern [^115Gc7su]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Arrhythmias

Considering the effects of caffeine on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and atherosclerotic CVD events, how should the Dixit article be interpreted? The authors report the frequency of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, assessed using 24-hour Holter monitor recordings in older Americans participating in an observational cohort study in 1992. The mean age of participants was 72 years. Approximately 20% of participants had clinical coronary artery disease, while individuals with persistent atrial fibrillation (≈2%) identified on Holter monitoring were excluded from data analysis. Involving 115,000 patients from one case-control study and six cohort studies, the authors found no data to support an increased risk of atrial fibrillation.

### Tikosyn [^113rwwk6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The TIKOSYN clinical program involved approximately 8,600 patients in 130 clinical studies of normal volunteers and patients with supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. TIKOSYN was administered to 5,194 patients, including two large, placebo-controlled mortality trials (DIAMOND CHF and DIAMOND MI), in which 1,511 patients received TIKOSYN for up to three years.

In the following section, adverse reaction data for cardiac arrhythmias and non-cardiac adverse reactions are presented separately for patients included in the supraventricular arrhythmia development program and for patients included in the DIAMOND CHF and MI mortality trials (see CLINICAL STUDIES, Safety in Patients with Structural Heart Disease, DIAMOND studies, for a description of these trials).

In studies of patients with supraventricular arrhythmias, a total of 1,346 and 677 patients were exposed to TIKOSYN and placebo for 551 and 207 patient years, respectively. A total of 8.7% of patients in the dofetilide groups were discontinued from clinical trials due to adverse events compared to 8.0% in the placebo groups. The most frequent reason for discontinuation (> 1%) was ventricular tachycardia (2.0% on dofetilide vs. 1.3% on placebo). The most frequent adverse events were headache, chest pain, and dizziness.

- **Serious arrhythmias and conduction disturbances**: Torsade de Pointes is the only arrhythmia that showed a dose-response relationship to TIKOSYN treatment. It did not occur in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of Torsade de Pointes in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias was significant.

### Alcohol intake reduction for controlling hypertension [^113SdWQN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

High blood pressure is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Heavy drinking increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, including cardiomyopathy, hypertension, atrial arrhythmias, and stroke. Several studies have specifically assessed the relationship between alcohol intake and hypertension. However, the potential effect of alcohol intake reduction interventions on blood pressure is largely unknown.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of any intervention to reduce alcohol intake in terms of blood pressure decrease in hypertensive people with alcohol consumption compared to a control intervention or no intervention at all. Additionally, to determine effects related to mortality, major cardiovascular events, serious adverse events, or quality of life.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to June 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 5, 2020), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), MEDLINE Ovid Epub Ahead of Print, and MEDLINE Ovid In-Process, Embase Ovid (from 1974), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Trial authors were contacted when needed, and no language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials with a minimum duration of 12 weeks and at least 50 subjects per group, with quantitative measurement of alcohol consumption.

### Curcumin, a dietary natural supplement, prolongs the action potential duration of KCNE1-D85N-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes [^1168sA9M]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Curcumin, a polyphenolic dietary natural compound and active ingredient in turmeric, exerts antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anticancer, and antiarrhythmic properties. KCNE1-D85N, present in approximately 1% of white individuals, is a common, potentially proarrhythmic variant that predisposes individuals to drug-induced QT prolongation under certain conditions.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this article was to test the hypothesis that curcumin might cause action potential duration (APD) prolongation in KCNE1-D85N-derived human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs).

- **Methods**: Gene-edited/variant-corrected isogenic control and patient-specific KCNE1-D85N-containing iPSC-CMs were generated previously. Voltage-sensing dye, multielectrode array (MEA), and whole-cell patch clamp technique were used to measure APD without and with 4-hour incubation with 10 nM curcumin.

- **Results**: KCNE1-D85N-derived iPSC-CMs demonstrated significant APD prolongation with treatment of 10 nM curcumin. Using voltage-sensing dye, action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) was 578 ± 7 ms (n = 39) at baseline and was prolonged to 658 ± 13 ms (n = 35) with curcumin incubation (P < .0001). Using MEA, APD90 at baseline was 237 ± 6 ms (n = 24) compared with 280 ± 6 ms (n = 12) with curcumin incubation (P = .0002). The whole-cell patch clamp technique confirmed these results, with APD90 being 544 ± 37 ms at baseline and 664 ± 40 ms with treatment of curcumin (P < .005). However, APD from isogenic control iPSC-CMs remained unchanged with curcumin treatment.

### Krazati [^111whSGF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drugs that prolong QTc interval**: Avoid concomitant use of Krazati with other product(s) known to prolong the QTc interval. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, monitor electrocardiogram and electrolytes prior to starting Krazati, during concomitant use, and as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Withhold Krazati if the QTc interval is greater than 500 ms or the change from baseline is greater than 60 ms [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Adagrasib causes QTc interval prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Concomitant use of Krazati with other products that prolong the QTc interval may result in a greater increase in the QTc interval and adverse reactions associated with QTc interval prolongation, including Torsade de pointes, other serious arrhythmias, and sudden death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Drug therapy for atrial fibrillation: Where do we go from here [^116CQysz]. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical attention, has effects that range from mild symptoms to devastating stroke. Although treatments have evolved since the foxglove plant, later identified as containing digitalis, was first administered to slow the heart rate, satisfactory drug therapy has not been developed. In this review, we describe present-day medical options and developments of future therapies to treat atrial fibrillation and maintain normal sinus rhythm.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^115x8zGf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Several limitations of our study must be acknowledged. First, while insufficient power is a common explanation for negative results, it is important to emphasize that even at the extremes of the 95% CI, there was no evidence of a clinically large effect. We also relied on self-report for the quantification of caffeinated product consumption. While self-report may be less accurate than other methods of tracking dietary intake, food frequency questionnaires are commonly used in dietary assessment, and the picture-sort approach used in CHS has been previously validated. Furthermore, food frequency questionnaires allow for the assessment of habitual dietary patterns over extended periods of time.

A concern is that these data only give us insight into average consumption and not what participants ate immediately prior to and during the Holter monitoring. While this may be a disadvantage, our study remains unique in its rigorous, validated assessment of dietary intake combined with 24-hour ECG monitoring. It would appear unlikely that typical dietary patterns would have changed substantially on the day of the Holter in most participants. In addition, it is improbable that recall bias affected our dietary assessment, given that participants were unaware of how the dietary information would later be used and that those who received baseline Holter monitoring were randomly selected from the total study population. Other limitations surrounding the dietary assessment include the absence of total caffeine quantification and specifically data on caffeinated soda consumption.

### Energy drinks: Another cause of QT prolongation [^111hg91V]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

In the drug development world, the US Food and Drug Administration requires extensive safety testing before approval of a drug that causes a significant degree of QT prolongation in a "thorough QT/QTc study". Whether classified as beverages or dietary supplements, energy drinks require no such safety evaluation. Manufacturers only need to declare that the individual ingredients are "generally recognized as safe". Safety testing is not mandated to establish whether the combination of several individually safe ingredients results in an unsafe mixture.

The electrocardiographic effects of caffeine, the main ingredient in energy drinks, have been extensively studied, and there is no convincing evidence that caffeine alone causes QTc prolongation. Ginseng, added to many of these products for its purported energy-boosting properties, has been reported to cause QT prolongation. However, in a direct comparison of a ginseng-containing energy drink with the same amount of ginseng alone, ginseng had no effect on the QT interval. In the concentration found in energy drinks, none of the other common ingredients such as taurine, guarana, carnitine, yohimbine, sugars, and B vitamins is known to cause QT prolongation.

Although Shah et al. observed that two different energy drinks had the same effect on QTc, suggesting a possible class effect, there are over 100 different products on the market, each with its proprietary combination of ingredients. A conclusion about a possible class effect would at least require understanding the differences in the composition of these products.

### Dangerous mistake: An accidental caffeine overdose [^111afoab]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Given that cardiac arrhythmias are the most frequent cause of death by caffeine overdose, sports practitioners should be informed of the potential health hazards related to excessive caffeine intake. Additionally, dietary supplements should be better regulated and reported on food labels.

In the future, we suggest contacting the regional poison control centre to improve and increase datasets, which can contribute to enhancing federal analysis and the correct legislation of these kinds of products.

- **Learning points**:
	- Caffeine overdose can be fatal.
	- Cardiac arrhythmia is a frequent consequence that needs immediate management.
	- Clinical awareness of caffeine toxicity should be increased.

### Lifestyle management of hypertension: International Society of Hypertension position paper endorsed by the World Hypertension League and European Society of Hypertension [^116oyGmS]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

Coffee and caffeinated drinks such as tea have beneficial effects on blood pressure (BP) and overall cardiovascular health. Drinking coffee shows a consistent nonlinear association with reduced cardiovascular mortality risk, with the greatest benefits observed at three cups a day. A recent study in the UK Biobank revealed a reduced risk of stroke and dementia in those drinking two to three cups per day of coffee or tea, by 32% and 28% respectively, compared to nondrinkers. Consumption exceeding three cups daily appears safe, but the benefits in terms of cardiovascular risk reduction are less apparent. Interestingly, an inverse dose–response relationship in coffee consumption is associated with a 2% risk reduction of hypertension (relative risk = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.98–0.99) for each cup of coffee consumed daily. In contrast, a Japanese study indicated that consuming more than two cups of coffee daily increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk in individuals with grade 2–3 hypertension; this increased risk was not observed among green tea drinkers. Additionally, increased coffee consumption has been linked to a higher risk of aortic valve stenosis in a Swedish prospective population study.

Emerging data also suggest the benefits of nitrate compounds found in beetroot juice for lowering BP. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that beetroot juice significantly decreases systolic blood pressure (SBP) but not diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in patients with arterial hypertension. Interestingly, the BP-lowering effects on SBP and pulse pressure are enhanced when combined with other interventions.

### Does coffee reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation [^1161Kpck]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Pharmacological features of coffee and caffeine:

Physiological effects of coffee have shown a protective cardiovascular effect. Caffeine is reported to be a nonselective inhibitor of adenosine A1 and A2A receptors, reducing the ability of adenosine to shorten atrial action potentials and thereby decreasing the propensity for triggering atrial fibrillation. Additionally, constituents of coffee, including caffeine and polyphenols, possess antioxidant properties that may potentially help protect against adverse atrial remodeling. Broadly, antioxidants in coffee have been shown to improve cardiovascular health by enhancing lipid profiles and blood pressure. Collectively, these findings suggest that coffee and its constituents may be beneficial to cardiovascular and arrhythmogenic health.

### Does coffee reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation [^116UQZmY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

This article by Bodar et al. explores the potential influence of coffee consumption on the risk of developing atrial fibrillation, a common heart rhythm disorder. The study analyzes data from various observational studies to determine if there is a correlation between coffee intake and a reduced risk of atrial fibrillation. While the results suggest a possible protective effect, there are notable limitations, including variability in the studies analyzed and potential confounding factors that were not fully addressed. Further research is needed to establish a definitive connection between coffee consumption and atrial fibrillation risk.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^116hmb2m]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In adjusted analyses, there were no statistically significant associations between the frequencies of coffee, tea, or chocolate consumption and PACs/h, PVCs/h, or the number of SVT runs. The consumption of coffee 1 to 4 times per week (versus no coffee) and the consumption of tea 5 to 10 times per year (versus no tea) were each associated with a greater number of runs of VT. Tests for trends across levels of consumption failed to reveal any statistically significant linear or nonlinear trends for all four outcomes.

In examining dietary intake of coffee, tea, and chocolate as continuous measures and as a combined measure of total average consumption, we found no statistically significant relationships between weekly servings of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy, SVT, and VT. We observed a non–statistically significant estimated 0.48% decrease in PACs/h (95% CI −4.60 to 3.64), as well as a non–statistically significant estimated 2.87% decrease in PVCs/h (95% CI −8.18 to 2.43), for every one serving per week increase in regular consumption.

### Acute effects of ephedra on autonomic nervous modulation in healthy young adults [^111DNFBs]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the acute effects of ephedra on autonomic nervous modulation by means of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. On three separate days, 20 healthy subjects took capsules containing either 1 or 2 grams of ephedra dry extract or a placebo, and the sequential percentage changes in HRV measures were compared. After the subjects took ephedra, the normalized low-frequency component (LF) and the ratio of LF to high-frequency component (HF) increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the normalized HF (HF%) decreased significantly. We conclude that ingestion of ephedra tilts the sympathovagal balance dose-dependently toward increased sympathetic activity and impairs parasympathetic activity.

### Prevention and control of cardiac arrhythmic by using therapeutic foods: A review [^113r7tVZ]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2024). Low credibility.

Arrhythmia is a common cardiovascular disease. Functional food is a rich source of natural compounds with significant pharmacological properties. The aim of this paper is to explore its effect on arrhythmia.

- **Methods**: By reviewing the literature and summarizing the findings, we described the role of functional foods in the alleviation of cardiac arrhythmias from different perspectives.

- **Results**: Our study shows that functional foods have anti-arrhythmic effects through modulation of ion channels, oxidative stress, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.

- **Conclusions**: We summarize the mechanism of arrhythmia inhibition by the active ingredients of medicinal diets in this review article, intending to provide research ideas for dietary therapy to regulate arrhythmia.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^117Eo4FM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In an investigation of nearly 1,400 older adults, we found no evidence that the frequency of habitual coffee, tea, or chocolate consumption was associated with cardiac ectopy, before or after multivariable adjustment. This absence of association between caffeine and arrhythmias did not change whether caffeine was treated as a continuous or a categorical predictor.

Premature cardiac contractions are a common, often asymptomatic condition. However, given the growing evidence linking both PACs and PVCs to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, it is important we further our understanding of risk factors for ectopy. Increased PACs, even among healthy individuals, have been associated with incident AF, stroke, and death. Furthermore, the presence of PVCs in those free of heart disease has been associated with an increased risk of incident heart failure, CAD events, and CAD-related death. Our study is the first to examine chronic consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy in a community-based population using 24-hour Holter monitoring to directly assess PAC and PVC counts. Prior studies have focused on populations with previous diagnoses of symptomatic ventricular ectopy, arrhythmia, or MI, making it difficult to generalize their findings to other populations. Furthermore, our study used a validated approach to assessing food frequencies to approximate a person's typical consumption, as compared to other studies that have administered predetermined caffeine doses regardless of a person's average consumption.

### Krazati [^1172S5BF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Krazati can cause QTc interval prolongation, which may increase the risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes, or sudden death.

In the pooled safety population who received single-agent Krazati, 6% of 366 patients with at least one post-baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment had an average QTc ≥ 501 msec, and 11% of patients had an increase from baseline of QTc > 60 msec. Krazati causes concentration-dependent increases in the QTc interval.

In patients who received Krazati in combination with cetuximab, 5% of 93 patients with at least one post-baseline ECG assessment had an average QTc ≥ 501 msec, and 16% of patients had an increase from baseline of QTc > 60 msec.

Avoid concomitant use of Krazati with other products known to prolong the QTc interval. Also, avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in those with congenital QTc prolongation.

Monitor ECGs and electrolytes, particularly potassium and magnesium, prior to starting Krazati, during concomitant use, and as clinically indicated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, and in those who cannot avoid concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval. Correct any electrolyte abnormalities. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue Krazati depending on severity.

### Thoracic epidural anesthesia can be effective for the short-term management of ventricular tachycardia storm [^115Gr2zj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The discontinuation of thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) was continued for a median of 4 days (IQR, 2–9; range, 1–15). In three cases, the patient died, with the epidural catheter remaining in place. Concern for catheter infection in the setting of fevers was the reason for discontinuation in two patients, but other sources were found in both; tip culture results were negative. Concern for infection risk due to prolonged therapy was cited for two patients (at 9 and 15 days after insertion). Resolution of ventricular tachycardia was the reason for discontinuation in the other six patients.

- **Anticoagulation management**: All anticoagulation was withheld in six patients (55%), including all three with an intra‐aortic balloon pump; prophylactic dose heparin only was continued in four other patients (36%). Only patient 7 had his intra‐aortic balloon pump removed while the epidural catheter remained in place, done without a prolonged weaning period. No episodes of arterial emboli were noted in any patient. Patient 1 received therapeutic anticoagulation during his endocardial ventricular tachycardia ablation.

- **Complications and adverse effects of TEA**: No procedural complications associated with insertion or removal of the epidural catheter were identified. No epidural hematomas or infections occurred. Hypotension was noted in patient 7 when the infusion rate of bupivacaine was increased to 5 mL/h, leading to a reduction in dosage back to 4 mL/h, with resolution of hypotension.

### Multiple dosing of ephedra-free dietary supplements: Hemodynamic, electrocardiographic, and bacterial contamination effects [^117H9LzX]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Four popular ephedra-free dietary supplements were evaluated for their effects on heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters. Twelve healthy men participated in the study, which was randomized for product sequence with a 21-day washout period between supplement-administration phases. Throughout the study, Holter monitors were used to assess ECG and HR activity. BP was assessed automatically on multiple occasions. The supplements were ingested three times daily for 3 days. Caffeine content, microbial load, and serum caffeine concentrations were determined.

Mean systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) readings showed significant increases relative to baseline (10.8 ± 2.5 and 5.3 ± 3.1 mm Hg, respectively; P < 0.05). All supplements significantly increased HR and decreased bradycardia runs; abnormal atrial/ventricular events were frequently noted. Gastrointestinal and sympathomimetic symptoms were also common. Two supplements were heavily contaminated with Bacillus species. In light of these findings, the use of ephedra-free dietary supplements should be discouraged in individuals with hypertension, diabetes, or other cardiovascular diseases.

### The risky side of weight-loss dietary supplements: Disrupting arrhythmias causing sudden cardiac arrest [^1114v64a]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

The worldwide increasing prevalence of obesity has led to a corresponding increase in the consumption of weight-loss dietary supplements. The limited de novo regulatory oversight and under-reported toxicity profile of these products result in a constellation of newer adverse events. This paper chronicles the case of an otherwise healthy woman who developed ventricular fibrillation-related cardiac arrest secondary to the use of Hydroxycut and Metaboost preparations. Published medical literature contains a handful of case reports associating these products with potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The proposed hypothesis implicates ingredients of these diet aids as having proarrhythmogenic effects. Physicians should remain vigilant for possible cardiotoxicity associated with the use of dietary supplements. Individuals who are at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias should avoid herbal weight-loss formulas, given the serious clinical implications. Additionally, this paper highlights the need for a proper framework to delineate the magnitude and scope of this association.

### Genome assembly of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. provides insights into metabolisms of medicinal natural products [^117EqKNH]. G3 (2024). Low credibility.

Hibiscus sabdariffa L. is a widely cultivated herbaceous plant with diverse applications in food, tea, fiber, and medicine. In this study, we present a high-quality genome assembly of H. sabdariffa using more than 33 Gb of high-fidelity (HiFi) long-read sequencing data, corresponding to approximately 20× depth of the genome. We obtained three genome assemblies of H. sabdariffa: one primary and two partially haplotype-resolved genome assemblies. These genome assemblies exhibit N50 contig lengths of 26.25, 11.96, and 14.50 Mb, with genome coverage of 141.3%, 86.0%, and 88.6%, respectively.

We also utilized 26 Gb of total RNA sequencing data to predict 154,000, 79,000, and 87,000 genes in the respective assemblies. The completeness of the primary genome assembly and its predicted genes was confirmed by the benchmarking universal single-copy ortholog analysis, with a completeness rate of 99.3%. Based on our high-quality genomic resources, we constructed genetic networks for phenylpropanoid and flavonoid metabolism and identified candidate biosynthetic genes, which are responsible for producing key intermediates of roselle-specific medicinal natural products. Our comprehensive genomic and functional analysis opens avenues for further exploration and application of valuable natural products in H. sabdariffa.

### Association between tea consumption and depressive symptom among Chinese older adults [^116G1yDg]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Depression, as one of the most common mental disorders in old age, often causes great suffering in later life. Unipolar depression, or major depressive disorder, characterized by a persistent feeling of sadness or a lack of interest in external stimuli, now affects about 7% of older adults worldwide. In China, the rising prevalence of depression amongst seniors has become a major health concern. A recent nationwide survey in 2012, for example, reported that about one-third of Chinese elderly aged 75 and over suffered severe depressive symptoms. A growing body of research has been exploring risk factors for elderly depression, ranging from biomarkers, behavioral characteristics, socioeconomic status, family structure, living arrangements, to community environment. Amongst these factors, the consumption of tea, one of the most popular non-alcoholic beverages in the world, is currently drawing attention.

The positive impact of tea drinking on human health has long been acknowledged. According to a recent literature review, it has been well evidenced that tea consumption is inversely related to cancers of the skin, prostate, lung, and breast, as well as cardiovascular diseases (particularly atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease), diabetes, and arthritis. Another review paper reported that the benefits of tea drinking on cardiovascular diseases could partially stem from improved nitric oxide status and endothelial function, with other possible pathways working through body weight and fatness, oxidative damage, inflammation, platelet activation, and blood pressure.

### Innovative approaches to anti-arrhythmic drug therapy [^114g5KqQ]. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2006). Low credibility.

Normal cardiac function requires an appropriate and regular beating rate (cardiac rhythm). When the heart rhythm is too fast or too slow, cardiac function can be impaired, with derangements that range from mild symptoms to life-threatening complications. Irregularities, particularly those involving excessively fast or slow rates, are known as cardiac 'arrhythmias'. In the past, drug treatment of cardiac arrhythmias has proven difficult due to inadequate effectiveness and a risk of serious complications. However, a variety of recent advances have opened up exciting possibilities for the development of novel and superior approaches to arrhythmia therapy. This article reviews recent progress and future prospects for treating two particularly important cardiac arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation.

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^1132eRoj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

QTc prolongation is a recognized marker of increased risk for fatal arrhythmias. A QT/QTc interval prolongation by more than 60 ms from baseline, or a value greater than 500 ms, is a marker for life-threatening arrhythmias. Several published studies have assessed QT/QTc effects post-energy drink consumption for this reason. This is one of the first caffeine-controlled studies that shows significant QTc prolongation of approximately 10 ms two hours after high-volume energy drink consumption in young, healthy volunteers. It is possible that previously published studies showed a lack of effect due to studying a lower dose of energy drink (250–750 mL), monitoring for an insufficient amount of time (30–240 minutes), or not having a control arm. It also appears that the product and dose used in our study were different from the other studies, which might explain our significant findings.

Our findings are similar to another study (n = 27), which used the same dose as ours and found a significant 6-ms prolongation in QTc at two hours when compared with placebo. Further, in a noncontrolled study (n = 14) using the same dose (two cans) as in our study, 57% of participants had a QTc greater than 500 ms post-consumption. In contrast, a study by Brothers et al. (n = 15), comparing low- and moderate-dose energy drinks, coffee, and water, found no changes in the QTc interval.

### Coffee consumption is not associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation: results from two prospective cohorts and a meta-analysis [^114aymgL]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Participants were followed up from January 1, 1998, until the date of diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF), date of death (information obtained from the Swedish Death Register), or the end of follow-up on December 31, 2009, whichever came first. We categorized participants into five groups (approximate quintiles) according to their coffee consumption: 1 h/d), family history of myocardial infarction (yes or no), and consumption of alcohol (nondrinkers; and 1–4 drinks/week) and tea (cups/day, continuous). Analyses of men and women combined also adjusted for sex.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^112t7Scs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Premature cardiac contractions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Though experts associate premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) with caffeine, there are no data to support this relationship in the general population. As certain caffeinated products may have cardiovascular benefits, recommendations against them may be detrimental.

- **Methods and results**: We studied Cardiovascular Health Study participants with a baseline food frequency assessment, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography (Holter) monitoring, and without persistent atrial fibrillation. Frequencies of habitual coffee, tea, and chocolate consumption were assessed using a picture-sort food frequency survey. The main outcomes were PACs/hour and PVCs/hour. Among 1388 participants (46% male, mean age 72 years), 840 (61%) consumed ≥ 1 caffeinated product per day. The median numbers of PACs/hour and PVCs/hour and interquartile ranges were 3 (1–12) and 1 (0–7), respectively. There were no differences in the number of PACs or PVCs/hour across levels of coffee, tea, and chocolate consumption. After adjustment for potential confounders, more frequent consumption of these products was not associated with ectopy. In examining combined dietary intake of coffee, tea, and chocolate as a continuous measure, no relationships were observed after multivariable adjustment: 0.48% fewer PACs/hour (95% CI, −4.60 to 3.64) and 2.87% fewer PVCs/hour (95% CI, −8.18 to 2.43) per 1-serving/week increase in consumption.

In conclusion, this study, the largest to evaluate dietary patterns and quantify cardiac ectopy using 24-hour Holter monitoring, found no significant association between the consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy.

### Caffeine and cardiac arrhythmias: A review of the evidence [^115RgUFn]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Limited data exist on the safety and physiological effects of caffeine in patients with known arrhythmias. The studies presented suggest that, in most patients with known or suspected arrhythmia, caffeine in moderate doses is well tolerated, and there is therefore no reason to restrict the ingestion of caffeine. A review of the literature is presented.

### Arrhythmogenic effects of energy drinks [^113PTWKy]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Energy drinks (ED) are increasingly popular, especially among adolescents and young adults. They are marketed as enhancers of energy, alertness, and physical performance. ED contain high doses of caffeine and other active ingredients. Their safety has come under question due to reports temporally linking ED consumption with serious cardiovascular events, including arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. In this article, we report two cases of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in young patients after consuming ED. We also review the ingredients of ED, the physiologic effects on the cardiovascular system, and the available evidence suggesting arrhythmogenicity.

### Alcohol and cardiovascular diseases: Where do we stand today [^113RhCGn]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

For centuries, the multiple medical risks of heavy alcohol drinking have been evident, with simultaneous awareness of a less harmful or sensible drinking limit. The increased risks of heavy drinking, defined as three or more standard-sized drinks per day, are both cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV. The CV risks include the following: (i) alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ACM), (ii) systemic hypertension, (iii) atrial arrhythmias, (iv) haemorrhagic stroke, and probably, ischaemic stroke.

In contrast, modern epidemiological studies have shown lower morbidity and mortality among light to moderate drinkers, due mostly to a reduced risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), with contributions from ischaemic stroke and heart failure (HF). A low level of alcohol consumption has no clear relation to an increased risk of any CV condition, except for haemorrhagic stroke. There is good evidence supporting the existence of mechanisms by which alcohol might protect against CAD, but the mechanisms for other alcohol-CV associations remain unclear.

Interrelationships among the CV conditions affect the individual alcohol-disease relationships; for example, the lower CAD risk in light to moderate drinkers is largely responsible for the reduced HF risk. International comparison data, including the presence of proposed beneficial non-alcohol components in wine (particularly in red wine), suggest that this beverage type might afford extra CAD protection. However, the effect of beverage choice is confounded by a healthier drinking pattern and more favorable risk traits in wine drinkers. Debate persists about methodologic approaches and interpretations of these findings.

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: A randomized trial [^116ZdbKb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

While blood pressure changes can be attributed primarily to caffeine, other ingredients in energy drinks may pose some hemodynamic activity. Taurine has been shown to lower blood pressure in prehypertensive patients, indicating the need for investigating simultaneous caffeine and taurine intake.

Caffeine and ephedra-containing supplements were withdrawn from the market after the discovery of adverse QTc interval effects. Additionally, a sustained elevation in SBP of 2 mm Hg is associated with a 7% increased risk of mortality from ischemic heart disease and a 10% increased risk of stroke mortality. The cardiovascular effects seen in this study warrant concern as the observation of increased cardiovascular adverse effects and fatalities related to energy drinks remains an important public health issue.

Several factors may limit the generalizability of this study. We did not investigate the effects of different doses, and the volume of drink consumed (two 16-ounce cans over 60 minutes) in this study may not be representative of real-world consumption patterns. However, 24-ounce variants of certain energy drink brands are readily available, facilitating the consumption of larger volumes of energy drink in one sitting. In a survey of 2040 respondents, 16% reported having once consumed more than two energy drinks in a day. We assessed the effects of acute consumption of an energy drink in less than four hours, which does not lend insight into long-term effects nor the effects of chronic consumption. Additionally, we assessed energy drink consumption alone, and it is not uncommon for energy drinks to…

### Procainamide hydrochloride [^1142Tsco]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Procainamide hydrochloride injection is indicated for the treatment of documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia, that, in the judgment of the physician, are life-threatening. Due to the proarrhythmic effects of procainamide, its use for lesser arrhythmias is generally not recommended. The treatment of patients with asymptomatic ventricular premature contractions should be avoided.

Initiation of procainamide treatment, as with other antiarrhythmic agents used to treat life-threatening arrhythmias, should be carried out in the hospital. Antiarrhythmic drugs have not been shown to enhance survival in patients with ventricular arrhythmias.

Procainamide has the potential to produce serious hematological disorders (0.5 percent), particularly leukopenia or agranulocytosis, which can sometimes be fatal. Therefore, its use should be reserved for patients in whom, in the opinion of the physician, the benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the risks. (See warnings and boxed warning.)

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^1129jAMQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Our results support a long history of data from both experimental and observational trials indicating that moderate consumption of caffeine is not associated with cardiac ectopy and extend that evidence from predominantly arrhythmia patients to a community‐based cohort. Findings from this study suggest that the regular consumption of specific caffeinated products, in aggregate or alone, is not associated with cardiac ectopy in the general population. Although we observed an association between two isolated frequencies of coffee and tea intake and the number of VT runs, these results were not in line with the general observations. None of the unadjusted analyses were statistically significant, and the multivariable adjusted regression coefficients showed no trend towards increased or decreased VT across increasing categories of coffee and tea consumption.

While we cannot exclude a true effect between these very specific amounts of caffeinated product consumption and VT, we suspect these results are likely false positives due to multiple hypothesis testing. Additionally, analyzing coffee and tea consumption as continuous measures did not reveal any significant relationships with VT.

### Habitual tea consumption and 5-year incident metabolic syndrome among older adults: A community-based cohort study [^112rto6i]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

We defined Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) based on the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, which include the following five conditions: (a) a BMI of 25 kg/m² or more, (b) a BP of 130/85 mmHg or higher or on antihypertension medications, (c) blood TG ≥ 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L), (d) blood HDL-C lower than 40 mg/dL in men and 50 mg/dL in women, and (e) fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L or with a history of diabetes mellitus. An individual affected by three out of these five conditions was considered to have MetS.

Detailed information on tea consumption was collected at the recruitment stage by a trained research assistant through a survey. Participants responded to the question, "Do you usually drink tea?" Those who responded "no" were identified as non-habitual tea drinkers. Habitual tea drinkers were defined as those consuming 120 mL/d of tea or more for at least 1 year. The frequency of tea drinking over the past 12 months was classified into "1–5 times/week" and " > 5 times/week". Tea type was grouped into green tea and other teas since most habitual tea drinkers in Suzhou, China, consumed green tea. The duration of tea drinking was categorized into "1–15 years", "16–30 years", and " > 30 years". Detailed information regarding the cohort's tea drinking behaviors at baseline has been published elsewhere.

Participants' baseline information including socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, education level, marital status, working status, and monthly income) was collected.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^114Nbqvq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Premature cardiac contractions, otherwise known as atrial and ventricular ectopy, are common throughout the general population. Previously, these ectopic beats were believed to be harmless in the absence of known cardiovascular disease or symptoms. However, there is now evidence to indicate that premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. PACs are known to initiate paroxysms of atrial fibrillation (AF), and targeted ablation of ectopic foci in the atria can eliminate or significantly reduce AF recurrence. We previously showed that the PAC count is a particularly useful predictor of incident AF in older adults, and others have demonstrated that increased PACs in apparently healthy individuals are associated with incident AF, stroke, and death.

With regard to PVCs, the presence of even one PVC during a 2-minute ECG has been associated with an increased risk of incident congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) events, and CAD-related death. Additionally, our group has previously demonstrated that a higher frequency of PVCs is associated with an increase in incident CHF and with increased mortality. Recent evidence from the electrophysiology laboratory has shown that eradication of PVCs via radiofrequency ablation among patients with idiopathic systolic heart failure can normalize ventricular function, suggesting that PVCs alone are sufficient to result in heart failure.

### Thoracic epidural anesthesia can be effective for the short-term management of ventricular tachycardia storm [^1164s4mf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

**Response to TEA**: Pre- and post-TEA administration hemodynamics were available in five patients, with a median mean arterial pressure of 71 (IQR, 61–83) mm Hg pre-TEA and 71 (IQR, 58–83) mm Hg post-TEA (P = 1.0; Figure 3). Pre- and post-TEA telemetry strips for measuring electrocardiographic intervals in non-paced rhythms were available in three patients. In these patients, there was no significant difference in PR, QRS duration, or QTc, with a median change of 0 (IQR, −10 to 0; P = 1.0), 0 (IQR, 0–0; P = 1.0), and 0 (IQR, −20 to 5; P = 1.0) milliseconds, respectively. Five patients (45%) had a complete response to TEA; patients 6, 8, and 11 experienced no shocks. Patient 1 had a single VT episode requiring external shock 10 minutes after bupivacaine administration, and patient 5 had two VT episodes between 15 and 20 minutes after ropivacaine administration, treated with antitachycardia pacing; both had no further episodes. A sixth patient (patient 2) had a partial response with one episode of VT without implantable cardioverter defibrillator shock 17 hours after TEA initiation; in this patient, the bupivacaine infusion rate was increased to 3 mL/h, with no further episodes recorded (Table 3 and Figure 4). Inotropes (low-dose dopamine, infused at a rate of < 3 µg/kg per minute) were continuously required in three patients who responded to TEA (patients 1, 2, and 6) and one patient who did not respond to TEA (patient 7). Dopamine was weaned off in patients 1 and 6 as esmolol infusion was decreased after TEA initiation.

### Hypokalaemia and drinking green tea: A literature review and report of 2 cases [^111GwDt9]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

We report the association between excessive consumption of green tea and hypokalaemia in an Oriental couple. Both patients were asymptomatic, and the abnormal electrolyte level was only detected through routine blood tests. When they were advised to reduce the consumption of green tea, the abnormally low potassium level was reversed. We have not found such an association reported in the medical literature. The health benefits of green tea consumption are well publicized, but the potential side effects of overconsumption are less well known. We would like to report this association to alert clinicians about this potentially serious complication. This is especially relevant for those who are also taking prescribed medications that can lower potassium levels and/or sensitize patients to potential harm from hypokalaemia.

### Arrhythmogenic foods - A growing medical problem [^113fcgEA]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Arrhythmogenic ingredients in our diet, such as mushrooms, licorice, toxic honey, and liquid protein drinks, have long been recognized as rare but important considerations in the differential diagnosis of arrhythmias. Anecdotal reports of torsades de pointes (TdP), arrhythmias, and/or sudden death, along with small studies in normal subjects, have suggested that simple ingredients such as grapefruit juice or ingredients in energy drinks marketed as dietary supplements could have direct arrhythmogenic actions, especially in patients with congenital long QT syndrome (cLQTS).

Two recent studies that employed the industry-standard "thorough QT" trial design leave no doubt that grapefruit juice and some energy drinks can prolong the QTc interval and exceed 500 msec in some patients with cLQTS, a threshold known to signal imminent danger. These reports raise numerous clinically important questions, such as which other patients may be at risk of arrhythmias. For example, patients with multiple clinical risk factors for TdP (hypokalemia, bradycardia, female sex, etc) may be at risk from these and possibly other dietary ingredients ingested by millions of people each day.

It is essential that further research evaluate the safety of these and similar food products and that vulnerable patients, especially those with cLQTS, be warned of this serious and emerging threat.

### Thoracic epidural anesthesia can be effective for the short-term management of ventricular tachycardia storm [^116dN2BB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

The rationale for the use of thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) in ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm is grounded in its role in managing ventricular arrhythmias in humans. Cardiac sympathetic denervation (CSD) has been well established to exert effects by transiently decreasing cardiac tissue norepinephrine, increasing the threshold for ventricular arrhythmias, and reducing spatial heterogeneity in repolarization and depolarization. Bilateral thoracic sympathectomy, first described by Estes and Izlar in 1961, successfully treated a 35-year-old man with incessant runs of VT, refractory to medical therapy. Since then, CSD through surgical left or bilateral stellate ganglionectomy has effectively managed recurrent ventricular arrhythmias in patients with long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, idiopathic VT, and VT associated with structural heart disease.

However, in the short-term setting with an unstable patient, particularly one with incessant VT, surgical CSD may be neither feasible nor desirable. In these scenarios, rapidly acting and reversible methods of cardiac sympathetic blockade may be preferred, particularly to stop the vicious cycle of repetitive defibrillator shocks, which can cause psychological distress, potentiate heart failure, and perpetuate the heightened sympathetic state that sustains VT storm. For patients with recurrent VT after antiarrhythmic drug administration, deep sedation with intubation is the most commonly used method to reduce sympathoexcitation and avoid further arrhythmias and shocks while awaiting definitive treatment.

In comparison to TEA, deep sedation with intubation can…

### Propafenone HCl [^114Shgrd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Propafenone hydrochloride is indicated to prolong the time to recurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF) associated with disabling symptoms in patients without structural heart disease and to prolong the time to recurrence of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) associated with disabling symptoms in patients without structural heart disease. It is also used to treat documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia, that, in the judgment of the physician, are life-threatening. Initiate treatment in the hospital.

- **Usage considerations**:
	The use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) or in patients exclusively with atrial flutter or PSVT has not been evaluated. Do not use propafenone hydrochloride tablets to control ventricular rate during AF. Some patients with atrial flutter treated with propafenone have developed 1:1 conduction, producing an increase in ventricular rate. Concomitant treatment with drugs that increase the functional atrioventricular (AV) nodal refractory period is recommended. The use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation has not been evaluated. Due to the proarrhythmic effects of propafenone hydrochloride, its use with lesser ventricular arrhythmias is not recommended, even if patients are symptomatic. Any use of the drug should be reserved for patients in whom, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the risks. The effect of propafenone on mortality has not been determined.

### QTc prolongation by grapefruit juice and its potential pharmacological basis: HERG channel blockade by flavonoids [^115hg6pc]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

A high intake of dietary flavonoids, which are abundant in fruits, vegetables, tea, and wine, is known to reduce cardiovascular mortality. The effects of flavonoids on cardiac electrophysiology, which theoretically may have both antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic consequences, had not been studied systematically at the time of writing.

- **Methods and results**: We screened a broad spectrum of flavonoids for their inhibitory activity on HERG channels by using heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. At a concentration of 1 mmol/L, 10 compounds caused a significant inhibition of HERG currents, whereas 11 other flavonoids had no effect. The IC50 value for HERG block by naringenin, the most potent inhibitor, was 102.3 micromol/L in Xenopus oocytes and 36.5 micromol/L in HEK cells. To demonstrate the physiological relevance of these findings, we studied the effects of pink grapefruit juice, which contains large amounts of naringenin glycosides (> 1000 micromol/L), in human volunteers. In 10 persons, we observed a peak QTc prolongation of 12.5 ± 4.2 ms 5 hours after oral ingestion of 1 L of grapefruit juice; this effect was significant (P = 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: We found a significant QTc prolongation by grapefruit juice in healthy volunteers, probably caused by block of HERG channels by flavonoids. These findings reveal new perspectives on the potential for dietary modification of cardiac electrophysiology.

### 2022 ESC guidelines for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death [^1176ssdc]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

The 2022 ESC guidelines provide recommendations for the medical management of ventricular arrhythmias. Specifically, for PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, these guidelines suggest considering the initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs in patients whose cardiomyopathy is suspected to be caused by frequent and predominantly monomorphic premature ventricular complexes. This consideration applies particularly if catheter ablation is not desired, suspected to be high-risk, or has been unsuccessful.
