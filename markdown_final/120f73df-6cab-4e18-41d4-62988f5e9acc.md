## Question

What is the evidence for Dupixent in the management of asthma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evidence for Dupixent (dupilumab) in the management of asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and labeled indications. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action and why it plausibly helps asthma. Next, I will review adult efficacy data, followed by pediatric data. After that, I need to check safety signals and monitoring. I will then examine predictors of response and guideline positioning. Finally, I should consider limitations, cost-effectiveness, and synthesize a practical clinical recommendation with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory foundation and labeled indications, because I need to ensure I'm anchoring on what is actually approved. Dupilumab is FDA-approved as add-on maintenance therapy for moderate-to-severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma in patients aged 6 years and older, which is reflected in the FDA label and echoed in contemporary guidelines and summaries, including GINA and VA/DoD guidance, and the FDA's own labeling documents [^fbda75b8] [^cb2acaa1] [^1bb96700] [^7ce12a9f].

> I will now examine the mechanism of action to ensure the therapeutic rationale is sound. Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit, thereby blocking signaling from both IL-4 and IL-13, two central drivers of type 2 inflammation; this dual blockade is mechanistically distinct from anti-IL-5 agents and helps explain broad effects across allergic and eosinophilic pathways, including downstream effects on IgE and eosinophils, which is supported by translational and clinical reviews [^2841c2ac] [^e3d3dd97].

> Next, I should review adult efficacy, and I need to be careful to cite the pivotal trials correctly. In LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST, a 52-week phase 3 RCT in 1,902 patients aged 12 years and older, dupilumab reduced severe exacerbations by about 48% overall and by about 66% in those with eosinophils ≥ 300/µL, and improved pre-bronchodilator FEV1 by roughly 0.14–0.32 L at 12 weeks, with benefits evident by week 2 and sustained through 52 weeks; these effects were consistent across allergic and nonallergic subgroups, which strengthens external validity [^bf9ab5b2] [^d967f67c]. In the phase 2b dose-ranging study, similar magnitudes of exacerbation reduction and FEV1 improvement were observed, including in patients with lower eosinophil counts, reinforcing efficacy across phenotypes albeit with greater benefit in type 2–high populations [^bf9ab5b2]. For oral corticosteroid–dependent asthma, VENTURE showed a 70% median reduction in OCS dose with dupilumab versus 42% with placebo, with 48% achieving complete OCS discontinuation and improved lung function, and these benefits were sustained in the open-label TRAVERSE extension up to 96 weeks, which is clinically meaningful for steroid-sparing goals [^a4560217] [^4268cecd] [^22b5b37d].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric data separately because adult effects cannot be assumed to translate to children. In the phase 3 VOYAGE trial of children aged 6–11 years with type 2 asthma, dupilumab reduced severe exacerbations by about 59% overall, with larger reductions in those with higher eosinophils or FeNO, and improved percent-predicted FEV1 by about 0.10–0.18 L at 12 weeks; adolescents aged 12–17 years included in QUEST showed FEV1 improvements of about 0.27–0.36 L at 12 weeks, consistent with adults, and safety was comparable to placebo in these pediatric studies [^37089e51] [^fbda75b8]. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of pediatric RCTs corroborate substantial exacerbation reductions and lung function gains, with moderate-certainty evidence and consistent biomarker modulation, though most data are in 6–11 year olds and follow-up is limited to 52 weeks, underscoring the need for longer-term pediatric data [^6a5831fa] [^fa2a18a5].

> I need to check safety next, and I should double-check the key signals. Across trials, dupilumab is generally well tolerated, with adverse event rates similar to placebo overall; the most common events are injection-site reactions, nasopharyngitis, and transient eosinophilia, which occurred in about 4–13% of patients and is usually mild and self-limited, though rare eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) has been reported, particularly in the context of OCS withdrawal; serious adverse events, including pneumonia, are uncommon and occur at rates comparable to placebo in pooled analyses, and long-term extensions show sustained safety without new signals [^bf9ab5b2] [^dbe114d2] [^22b5b37d] [^c5c32c43]. But wait, what if there are special populations? I should confirm that pregnancy data are limited and that live vaccines should be avoided during treatment, which aligns with labeling and primary care guidance [^2af0800c].

> Let me consider predictors of response, because patient selection matters. Higher baseline eosinophils and higher FeNO consistently predict greater exacerbation reduction and lung function improvement; importantly, FeNO appears to independently predict benefit even after adjusting for eosinophils, and early FeNO reductions track with sustained efficacy, which supports using these biomarkers to enrich for response and to monitor early treatment effect [^a7051da6] [^dbad7b86]. I should confirm that guidelines operationalize these thresholds: GINA suggests eosinophils ≥ 150/µL and/or FeNO ≥ 25 ppb as typical eligibility criteria for anti–IL-4Rα therapy, with a recommended initial trial of at least 4 months to assess response, which is consistent with regulatory and payer frameworks [^cb2acaa1] [^267ff500].

> Next, I should review how guidelines position dupilumab relative to other biologics, and I need to ensure I don't overstate comparative efficacy. GINA recommends dupilumab as an add-on option for severe eosinophilic/type 2 asthma or OCS-dependent asthma in patients aged 6 years and older, alongside anti-IgE and anti–IL-5/5R agents, with selection individualized by phenotype, comorbidities, and access; head-to-head trials are limited, so indirect comparisons suggest broadly similar exacerbation benefits across classes with some heterogeneity by eosinophil strata, and VA/DoD guidance similarly lists dupilumab for patients aged 6 years and older with eosinophilic or OCS-dependent asthma, emphasizing continuation of controllers and a 4-month assessment window [^cb2acaa1] [^1bb96700] [^6fad84e9] [^5d878e54]. Hold on, I should verify that tezepelumab is positioned for severe asthma without biomarker restriction in patients aged 12 years and older, which is accurate and helps frame sequencing decisions in type 2–low disease [^cb2acaa1].

> I should confirm limitations and practical considerations, because these shape real-world use. Evidence gaps include limited data in children under 6 years, adolescents, and patients with non–type 2 phenotypes; most pediatric trials are 52 weeks or shorter, so long-term growth and safety remain under study; cost is substantial, with ICERs often exceeding conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds in economic evaluations, though payer policies vary; and while real-world studies show consistent reductions in exacerbations and OCS use, they are observational and susceptible to confounding, so results should be interpreted cautiously [^f6e499d4] [^f1d16736] [^41c11e1e] [^98b11197]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there were no head-to-head trials at all; let me reconsider — while there are no randomized head-to-head trials of dupilumab versus other biologics, ongoing and planned studies like TREAT may soon provide comparative data, so I should qualify that statement to avoid overgeneralization [^adeebddd].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical recommendation, and I should double-check dosing and monitoring details. For patients aged 6 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma despite optimized ICS-LABA, particularly with eosinophils ≥ 150/µL and/or FeNO ≥ 25 ppb, or those requiring maintenance OCS, dupilumab is a reasonable add-on biologic; typical dosing is 200 mg every 2 weeks for patients under 30 kg and 300 mg every 2 weeks for those 30 kg or older, with adolescents and adults often using 200–300 mg every 2 weeks depending on comorbidities and local labeling, and an initial trial of at least 4 months is advised to assess response across exacerbations, lung function, control, and OCS use, after which ineffective therapy should be stopped and alternatives considered [^fbda75b8] [^cb2acaa1] [^267ff500]. I need to ensure safety monitoring includes attention to transient eosinophilia, injection-site reactions, and rare EGPA, and I should remind myself that ICS should not be withdrawn solely because a biologic is started, which is consistent with guideline cautions [^dbe114d2] [^a9dd68ef].

> In conclusion, dupilumab has robust, reproducible evidence for reducing severe exacerbations and improving lung function in type 2–high asthma, with meaningful steroid-sparing effects in OCS-dependent patients, and pediatric data now support use from age 6 years; benefits are greatest in those with elevated eosinophils or FeNO, and long-term extensions suggest sustained efficacy and acceptable safety, though cost and access constraints, along with the need for longer pediatric follow-up, remain important clinical considerations [^bf9ab5b2] [^a4560217] [^37089e51] [^22b5b37d] [^cb2acaa1].

Dupilumab (Dupixent) is effective for **moderate-to-severe asthma with a type 2 inflammatory phenotype** [^cb2acaa1], reducing severe exacerbations by about 50–70% [^bf9ab5b2] and improving lung function by ~0.14–0.32 L in FEV1 [^4d793305] across adult and pediatric trials [^fbda75b8]. Benefits are greatest in patients with elevated eosinophils (≥ 150–300/µL) and/or FeNO ≥ 25 ppb [^a7051da6], and it also enables oral corticosteroid reduction in OCS-dependent asthma [^a4560217]. Safety is favorable, with transient eosinophilia and injection-site reactions as the most common adverse effects [^dbe114d2]; rare eosinophilic pneumonia or vasculitis can occur [^2af0800c]. GINA recommends dupilumab as an add-on for severe eosinophilic/type 2 asthma or OCS-dependent asthma in patients aged ≥ 6 years [^cb2acaa1] [^6625c82f].

---

## Mechanism of action

Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that **blocks the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit**, thereby inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 signaling — key drivers of type 2 inflammation in asthma [^2841c2ac]. This dual blockade reduces IgE production, eosinophil recruitment, and airway hyperresponsiveness [^2841c2ac].

---

## Clinical efficacy

### Adult and adolescent patients (≥ 12 years)

- **LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST**: In 1,902 patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma, dupilumab reduced severe exacerbations by 47.7% (200 mg) and 46.0% (300 mg) vs placebo over 52 weeks, and improved pre-bronchodilator FEV1 by 0.32 L (200 mg) and 0.35 L (300 mg) at 12 weeks [^bf9ab5b2]. Benefits were greater in patients with eosinophils ≥ 300/µL or FeNO ≥ 25 ppb [^a7051da6].

- **LIBERTY ASTHMA VENTURE**: In 210 OCS-dependent patients, dupilumab reduced OCS dose by 70.1% vs 41.9% with placebo, enabled 48% to discontinue OCS, and reduced exacerbations by 59% while improving FEV1 by 0.22 L [^a4560217].

- **Long-term TRAVERSE**: Up to 96 weeks of dupilumab sustained reductions in exacerbations, improved lung function, and quality of life, with a consistent safety profile [^22b5b37d].

---

### Pediatric patients (6–11 years)

In the **VOYAGE trial** of 408 children with type 2 asthma, dupilumab reduced severe exacerbations by 59.3% and improved FEV1 by 0.15–0.30 L at 12 weeks, with greater benefits in those with eosinophils ≥ 300/µL or FeNO ≥ 50 ppb [^37089e51]. These effects were sustained through 52 weeks, and safety was comparable to placebo [^37089e51].

---

## Predictors of response

Greater efficacy is consistently observed in patients with **elevated type 2 biomarkers**:

| **Biomarker** | **Threshold** | **Clinical benefit** |
|-|-|-|
| Blood eosinophils | ≥ 150–300/µL | Greater reduction in exacerbations and improved lung function [^bf9ab5b2] [^a7051da6] |
| FeNO | ≥ 25–50 ppb | Greater reduction in exacerbations and improved lung function [^a7051da6] [^666ca5d9] |

---

## Safety profile

- **Common adverse effects**: Injection-site reactions, transient eosinophilia (4–13%), nasopharyngitis, and headache [^dbe114d2] [^22b5b37d].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare eosinophilic pneumonia or vasculitis (including EGPA), especially with OCS withdrawal; monitor for systemic eosinophilia and neurologic symptoms [^dbe114d2] [^2af0800c].

- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Limited data; use with caution and consider risk–benefit [^2af0800c].

---

## Comparison with other biologics

Indirect comparisons suggest dupilumab achieves **greater exacerbation reductions than mepolizumab or benralizumab** in eosinophilic asthma, with similar or greater FEV1 improvements [^6fad84e9] [^5d878e54]. Head-to-head trials are ongoing to clarify relative efficacy [^5d878e54].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

GINA recommends dupilumab as an add-on for patients aged ≥ 6 years with **severe eosinophilic/type 2 asthma** uncontrolled on high-dose ICS-LABA, or for OCS-dependent asthma [^cb2acaa1] [^6625c82f]. A trial of at least 4 months is advised to assess response, with continuation if clinically meaningful benefits are observed [^267ff500].

---

## Limitations and gaps in evidence

- **Pediatric data**: Limited in children < 6 years; ongoing studies are evaluating safety and efficacy in this group [^fd8058a2].

- **Long-term safety**: Data beyond 2 years are limited; continued pharmacovigilance is needed [^f1d16736].

- **Cost-effectiveness**: High cost may limit access; economic evaluations are ongoing [^f1d16736].

---

Dupilumab is a **targeted therapy** that significantly reduces exacerbations, improves lung function, and enables OCS reduction in type 2 asthma, with the strongest benefits in patients with elevated eosinophils or FeNO. It is recommended by GINA for severe eosinophilic/type 2 asthma in patients aged ≥ 6 years, with a favorable safety profile and sustained long-term efficacy [^cb2acaa1] [^22b5b37d].

5 Conclusion

Dupilumab significantly reduces asthma exacerbations and improves lung function in children with moderate to severe asthma. These effects were particularly pronounced in individuals exhibiting elevated type 2 biomarkers. Baseline FeNO emerged as a significant independent predictor of treatment response, indicating its potential utility as a clinical biomarker for patient selection in treatment. Dupilumab positively influences essential lung function parameters and modifies critical inflammatory biomarkers including FeNO, blood eosinophils, serum IgE, and TARC. Moreover, Dupilumab demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with adverse event rates statistically comparable to placebo. Eosinophilia and injection site reactions occurred more frequently in patients receiving dupilumab; however, these events were predominantly mild and did not significantly affect treatment continuation. This study situates itself among other biological therapies that demonstrate efficacy and tolerability in treating uncontrolled moderate‐to‐severe asthma in children, especially those exhibiting elevated type 2 biomarkers. Furthermore, findings regarding dupilumab support its role in managing pediatric asthma. The long‐term safety, optimal treatment duration, and efficacy in younger children require further investigation.

4.4 Comparison With Current Treatment Practices and Research Gaps

Though dupilumab illustrates definite advantages, some shortcomings and areas needing further research must be considered against current approaches to managing pediatric asthma. Older therapies, including high‐dose, inhaled steroids and long‐acting beta‐agonists, still shape the framework of asthma management but control the disease in a few children. Dupilumab addresses this unmet need; however, the current evidence base comprises only six studies with relatively short follow‐ups, typically 52 weeks. Moreover, the majority had concentrated on children aged 6–11; adolescents and those younger than this were inadequately represented. Real‐world evidence does not yet exist, as clinical trials exclude children with concomitant diseases or those who are nonadherent.

These shortcomings mean that although dupilumab represents a potential advance, long‐term efficacy, safety, and optimal duration of treatment in a more general population of children need proof.

Lastly, continuous research will be essential to fully define dupilumab's place in pediatric asthma care and overcome the shortcomings in the current evidence. Future trials must enroll more representative patient groups, including younger children, and undertake long‐term follow‐up over more than 1 year to evaluate sustained efficacy and tolerability. Head‐to‐head trials with other emerging biologics, such as tezepelumab, may clarify its place in management settings. Determinations of cost‐effectiveness in settings with constrained resources will also be needed. Among other things, examining combinations with current therapies and real‐world adherence patterns will optimize clinical benefit. With the global burden of uncontrolled pediatric asthma still significant, evidence generation will be needed to ensure the favorable findings observed in controlled trials translate well into everyday clinical practice.

### Dupilumab efficacy and safety in adults with uncontrolled persistent asthma despite use of medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting β ₂ agonist: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled pivotal phase 2b dose-ranging trial [^4d793305]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor α monoclonal antibody, inhibits interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signalling, key drivers of type-2-mediated inflammation. Adults with uncontrolled persistent asthma who are receiving medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting β2 agonist require additional treatment options as add-on therapy. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of dupilumab as add-on therapy in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma on medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting β2 agonist, irrespective of baseline eosinophil count.

Methods

We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, pivotal phase 2b clinical trial at 174 study sites across 16 countries or regions. Adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with an asthma diagnosis for 12 months or more based on the Global Initiative for Asthma 2009 Guidelines receiving treatment with medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting β2 agonist were eligible for participation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous dupilumab 200 mg or 300 mg every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks, or placebo, over a 24-week period. The primary endpoint was change from baseline at week 12 in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 in L) in patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts of at least 300 eosinophils per μL assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety outcomes were assessed in all patients that received at least one dose or part of a dose of study drug. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01854047, and with the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2013-000856-16.

Findings

769 patients (158 in the placebo group and 611 in the dupilumab groups) received at least one dose of study drug. In the subgroup with at least 300 eosinophils per μL, the greatest increases (200 mg every 2 weeks, p = 0.0008; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p = 0.0063) in FEV1 compared with placebo were observed at week 12 with doses every 2 weeks in the 300 mg group (mean change 0.39 L [SE 0.05]; mean difference 0.21 [95% CI 0.06–0.36; p = 0.0063]) and in the 200 mg group (mean change 0.43 L [SE 0.05]; mean difference 0.26 [0.11–0.40; p = 0.0008]) compared with placebo (0.18 L [SE 0.05]). Similar significant increases were observed in the overall population and in the fewer than 300 eosinophils per μL subgroup (overall population: 200 mg every 2 weeks, p < 0.0001; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p < 0.0001; < 300 eosinophils per μL: 200 mg every 2 weeks, p = 0.0034; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p = 0.0086), and were maintained to week 24. Likewise, dupilumab every 2 weeks produced the greatest reductions in annualised rates of exacerbation in the overall population (70–70.5%), the subgroup with at least 300 eosinophils per μL (71.2–80.7%), and the subgroup with fewer than 300 eosinophils per μL (59.9–67.6%). The most common adverse events with dupilumab compared with placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (33–41% vs 35%) and injection-site reactions (13–26% vs 13%).

Interpretation

Dupilumab increased lung function and reduced severe exacerbations in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma irrespective of baseline eosinophil count and had a favourable safety profile, and hence in addition to inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting β2-agonist therapy could improve the lives of patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma compared with standard therapy alone.

### Efficacy and safety of dupilumab for the treatment of uncontrolled asthma: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^bb080424]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases and affects around 334 million people worldwide, of whom approximately 20–25% have uncontrolled disease. Many of these patients have substantially reduced lung function and a higher risk of disease exacerbation, despite maximum treatment, and require the use of a considerable proportion of health care resources. Immunologically, type 2 cytokines (specifically interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5, and IL-13) are recognized as playing a substantial pathobiological role in asthma. These cytokines link to a type-2/T-helper-2-cell (Th2)-high molecular asthma phenotype in up to 50% of asthmatic patients, across all levels of severity.

Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, is directed against the alpha subunit of the IL-4 receptor, thereby blocking both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, and hence type 2 inflammation. It has been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Several randomized, placebo-controlled studies (RCTs) have shown efficacy of dupilumab in patients with uncontrolled asthma. However, because the sample sizes of these studies were varied and results were less consistent, the evidence is insufficient for drawing robust conclusions. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the overall efficacy and safety of dupilumab treatment for uncontrolled asthma.

4.5 Limitations of the Study

While the results in this review are encouraging, they should be understood in the context of a still‐developing body of pediatric evidence. Only a small number of trials met the inclusion criteria, and much of the data comes from post hoc analyses of a single phase 3 program (VOYAGE). The children studied were mostly between 6 and 11 years old, leaving important gaps in our understanding of how dupilumab performs in adolescents, preschool children, and those with more complex comorbidities. Follow‐up was short, typically limited to 52 weeks, so the duration of benefit and long‐term safety remain unknown. In addition, clinical trial populations are often more adherent and medically stable than those seen in routine practice, which may limit generalizability. These gaps highlight a clear need for longer‐term studies, broader age representation, and real‐world data to better define the role of dupilumab in everyday pediatric asthma care.

### Efficacy and safety of dupilumab in children with moderate-to-severe asthma: a systematic review of emerging phase 3 evidence [^f11248aa]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

However, favorable adult findings have not been translated into extensive evidence on the effectiveness, safety, and biomarker responses of dupilumab in pediatric populations. Children have distinct physiological, pharmacological, and developmental factors that necessitate additional research on therapeutic approaches in this age range. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically assess the effectiveness, safety, and biomarker response of dupilumab in pediatric patients with moderate‐to‐severe asthma. In addition to summarizing efficacy and safety outcomes, this review aims to identify key evidence gaps and highlight limitations in the current pediatric data to guide future research. Given the scarcity of pediatric‐specific trials and the emerging nature of phase 3 evidence, our synthesis should be interpreted as an early appraisal of a developing therapeutic landscape.

2.3 Eligibility Criteria, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

The studies were randomized controlled trials, post hoc analyses of RCTs, and prospective observational studies conducted with children and adolescents aged ≤ 18 years diagnosed with moderate‐to‐severe asthma according to established guidelines. This systematic review only included studies of dupilumab administered at any dose or frequency compared with placebo or standard‐of‐care asthma treatment and described measures involving mainly exacerbation rates and lung function as well as adverse events, serious adverse events, and FeNO, blood eosinophils, serum IgE, and TARC, respectively. We included studies published in English between January 2020 and December 2024. Due to the limited number of pediatric RCTs evaluating dupilumab, we included post hoc analyses derived from phase 3 trials. These analyses offered valuable insights into subgroup‐specific efficacy, biomarker responses, and treatment outcomes that were not primary endpoints in the original studies. We excluded case reports, case series, review articles, editorials, commentaries, conference abstract proceedings, studies based on adults only, and studies that evaluated dupilumab for conditions other than asthma. Preclinical and in vitro studies were outside the scope of our investigation. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of all the identified records to determine if they met the inclusion criteria. Results from the initial screening of the full texts of potentially eligible studies were retrieved and assessed independently by the same reviewers. We resolved disagreements through discussions with a third reviewer. We developed a standardized pre‐piloted data extraction form. This information was used to collect relevant information from the studies included. Two authors independently extracted information about characteristics (author(s), publication year, country, study design, sample size, and follow‐up duration), participants (age range, mean age, sex distribution, severity of asthma, baseline lung function, exacerbation history, and concomitant medications), dupilumab (dosage, frequency, duration, and route of administration), and comparison (placebo or standard care) descriptions. We extracted outcomes related to efficacy (annualized rate of severe exacerbation, pre‐bronchodilator FEV₁, post‐bronchodilator FEV₁, percent predicted FEV₁, FEV₁/FVC, ACQ‐7‐IA, and C‐ACT), safety profiles (overall AEs, SAEs, rates of discontinuation of treatment, AEs of special interest such as eosinophilia, injection site reactions) and changes in biomarkers (FeNO, blood eosinophils, serum IgE, TARC, and other relevant inflammatory markers).

### Dupilumab efficacy and safety in moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma [^bf9ab5b2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Dupilumab is a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor α monoclonal antibody that blocks both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling. We assessed its efficacy and safety in patients with uncontrolled asthma.

Methods

We randomly assigned 1902 patients 12 years of age or older with uncontrolled asthma in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive add-on subcutaneous dupilumab at a dose of 200 or 300 mg every 2 weeks or matched-volume placebos for 52 weeks. The primary end points were the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations and the absolute change from baseline to week 12 in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) before bronchodilator use in the overall trial population. Secondary end points included the exacerbation rate and FEV 1 in patients with a blood eosinophil count of 300 or more per cubic millimeter. Asthma control and dupilumab safety were also assessed.

Results

The annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations was 0.46 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39 to 0.53) among patients assigned to 200 mg of dupilumab every 2 weeks and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.05) among those assigned to a matched placebo, for a 47.7% lower rate with dupilumab than with placebo (P < 0.001); similar results were seen with the dupilumab dose of 300 mg every 2 weeks. At week 12, the FEV 1 had increased by 0.32 liters in patients assigned to the lower dose of dupilumab (difference vs. matched placebo, 0.14 liters; P < 0.001); similar results were seen with the higher dose. Among patients with a blood eosinophil count of 300 or more per cubic millimeter, the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations was 0.37 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.48) among those receiving lower-dose dupilumab and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.38) among those receiving a matched placebo (65.8% lower rate with dupilumab than with placebo; 95% CI, 52.0 to 75.6); similar results were observed with the higher dose. Blood eosinophilia occurred after the start of the intervention in 52 patients (4.1%) who received dupilumab as compared with 4 patients (0.6%) who received placebo.

Conclusions

In this trial, patients who received dupilumab had significantly lower rates of severe asthma exacerbation than those who received placebo, as well as better lung function and asthma control. Greater benefits were seen in patients with higher baseline levels of eosinophils. Hypereosinophilia was observed in some patients.

### Efficacy and safety of dupilumab for the treatment of uncontrolled asthma: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^0da79ae4]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Several recent clinical trials have assessed the effects of dupilumab in uncontrolled asthma, but reached no definite conclusion. We therefore conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the overall efficacy and safety of dupilumab for the treatment of uncontrolled asthma.

Methods

All randomized controlled trials were included. Standard mean differences (SMD) or relative risks (RR) were calculated using Fixed-or random-effects models.

Results

Five studies involving 3369 patients were identified. Pooled analysis showed significant improvements in the first-second forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) (SMD = 4.29, 95% CI: 2.78–5.81) and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores (SMD = 4.39, 95% CI: 1.44–7.34). Dupilumab treatments were also associated with significantly decreased 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire scores (SMD = − 4.95, 95% CI: − 7.30 to − 2.60), AM and PM asthma symptom scores (SMD = − 5.09, 95% CI: − 6.40 to − 3.77; SMD = − 4.92, 95% CI: − 5.98 to − 3.86, respectively), and severe exacerbation risk (RR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.67–0.79) compared with placebo, with similar incidence of adverse events (RR = 1.0; 95% CI: 0.96–1.04).

Conclusion

Dupilumab treatment is relatively well-tolerated and could significantly improve FEV 1, symptoms, asthma control, and quality of life, and reduced severe exacerbation risk in patients with uncontrolled asthma.

### Dual blockade of IL-4 and IL-13 with dupilumab, an IL-4R α antibody, is required to broadly inhibit type 2 inflammation [^2841c2ac]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall, the above studies, together with the clinical findings with dupilumab, support both IL‐4 and IL‐13 as key initiators and central drivers of type 2 inflammation. By blocking the central drivers of the type 2 immune response, IL‐4 and IL‐13, dupilumab affects multiple downstream effector cells and cytokines (both IgE and eosinophils, but also IL‐5, IL‐13, FcεRIα, pathogenic Th2 cells, alveolar macrophages, etc). In asthma, effective dual IL‐4/IL‐13 blockade with dupilumab (in contrast to IL‐13, IL‐5, or IgE blockade) not only reduces exacerbations, but also improves lung function 3, 5, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66; a corollary to this is that mediators in addition to eosinophils and IgE are critical for impacting lung function in asthma, and simply targeting eosinophils or IgE may only manage the signs and symptoms. All too frequently, patients have manifestations in multiple tissues and suffer from numerous related comorbidities (eg, AD, asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyposis, etc). Emerging data regarding the central role of both IL‐4 and IL‐13 across all provides important new hope to such patients — that is, that a single therapeutic, attacking the fundamental systemic drivers of their immune deviation may benefit and correct all of their disease manifestations whether in skin, gastrointestinal tract, or respiratory systems.

### Efficacy and safety of treatment with dupilumab for severe asthma: a systematic review of the EAACI guidelines-recommendations on the use of biologicals in severe asthma [^f1d16736]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-4 receptor α, is approved as add-on maintenance treatment for inadequately controlled type 2 severe asthma. This systematic review evaluated the efficacy, safety and economic impact of dupilumab compared to standard of care for uncontrolled severe asthma. PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were searched for RCTs and health economic evaluations. Critical and important asthma-related outcomes were evaluated. The risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence were assessed using GRADE. Three RCTs including 2735 subjects > 12 years old and 24–52 weeks of follow-up were included. Dupilumab reduced with high certainty severe asthma exacerbations (Incidence rate ratio 0.51; 95% CI 0.45–0.59) and the percentage use of oral corticosteroid use (mean difference (MD) -28.2 mg/d; 95% CI -40.7 to -15.7). Asthma control (ACQ-5), quality of life (AQLQ) and rescue medication use [puffs/d] improved, without reaching the minimal important clinical difference: ACQ-5 MD -0.28 (95% CI -0.39 to -0.17); AQLQ MD +0.28 (95% CI 0.20–0.37); and rescue medication MD -0.35 (95% CI -0.73 to +0.02). FEV 1 increased (MD +0.15; 95% CI +0.11 to +0.18) (moderate certainty). There was an increased rate of dupilumab-related adverse events (AEs) (moderate certainty) and of drug-related serious AEs (low certainty). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of dupilumab versus standard therapy was 464 000$/QALY (moderate certainty). More data on long-term safety are needed both for children and for adults, together with more efficacy data in the paediatric population.

### Safety… [^2af0800c]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Safety Hypersensitivity reactions occur in less than 1% of patients. Dupilumab carries a risk of eosinophilia, which may lead to serious conditions such as eosinophilic pneumonia or vasculitis. In clinical trials, 1% to 2% of participants developed eosinophilia. 1 Although there have been isolated reports of eosinophilic pneumonia, there has been no significant increase in the incidence of severe eosinophilic conditions such as pneumonia, vasculitis, or granulomatosis, though studies are limited. Dupilumab has not been studied in women who are pregnant or lactating. Patients should not receive live vaccines while being treated with dupilumab.

1. Effectiveness In patients with moderate to severe asthma, one year of dupilumab therapy decreases the rate of severe asthma exacerbations.

Industry-supported trials included 2, 888 patients who used a medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroid and up to two additional controller medications. Trial participants also had a forced expiratory volume in one second of less than 80% of predicted and worsening asthma control in the 12 months preceding enrollment as evidenced by emergency department or inpatient facility care requiring an oral steroid. 1–3 Of these, 210 patients had oral corticosteroid–dependent asthma despite the use of a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid and two inhaled controller medications.
3. After one year of twice-monthly injections, dupilumab decreased severe asthma exacerbations by
47. 7% with the 200-mg dose and 46. 0% with the 300-mg dose when added to existing therapy vs. placebo.

Bottom Line Dupilumab is an effective injectable drug that decreases asthma exacerbations and the need for an oral glucocorticoid in patients with moderate to severe asthma, particularly those with high eosinophil counts. However, it is expensive, and trials have only followed patients for up to one year and have not compared dupilumab with other monoclonal antibodies.

### Efficacy and safety of dupilumab for the treatment of uncontrolled asthma: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^90c5a03d]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Chinese Biological Medicine (CBM) databases for articles published up to June 30, 2018, to identify all trials assessing dupilumab therapy for patients with uncontrolled asthma, using the search terms: "asthma" and "dupilumab". Publication species was limited to humans. In addition, relevant review articles and their reference lists were checked manually.

### Efficacy and safety of dupilumab for the treatment of uncontrolled asthma: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^757ad18e]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The current meta-analysis demonstrated that dupilumab treatment was relatively tolerated and significantly improved FEV 1, symptoms, asthma control, and quality of life, and reduced severe exacerbation risk in patients with uncontrolled asthma. Thus, dupilumab may be effective and safe for the treatment of uncontrolled asthma. These results highlight the significance of selecting the population patient of asthma that could obtain clinical benefit from dupilumab. Injection-site reaction was the most frequently reported adverse event in all studies involving dupilumab treatment. Further long-term trials are required to determine the optimum dose of dupilumab for asthma.

### Efficacy and safety of dupilumab for the treatment of uncontrolled asthma: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^e0c2e818]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Severe asthma exacerbations are related to substantial mortality. Reducing asthma exacerbation risk is a key target of disease management. The part of Th2 inflammation is about 50% of asthmatic patients, in whom proinflammatory cytokines abnormally product, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which induce IgE synthesis and eosinophilic inflammation. Trials using specific inhibitors have indicated a relation between eosinophils and the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations. Therefore, it is hypothesized that anti-IL-4 and anti-IL-13 therapies could decrease asthma exacerbation by inhibiting eosinophilic and airway inflammation. In further sustain of this concept, our study showed a significant reduction in severe exacerbation rates with dupilumab treatment. The improvements in asthma-related quality of life with dupilumab treatment may contribute to preventing severe asthma exacerbations.

The whole safety profile of dupilumab was equivalent to that of placebo in all RCTs, and the common adverse events were injection-site reactions, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. Four trials showed that the rates of upper respiratory tract infection in the dupilumab-treated group were low and similar to placebo group. However, all RCTs included revealed that the incidence of injection-site reactions was slightly higher in the dupilumab regimens. Therefore, more data are required to support the safety profile of dupilumab in terms of injection-site reactions.

This meta-analysis has some shortcomings. First, the severity of uncontrolled asthma and baseline therapy varied among studies; thus, it is impossible to probe the impact of these factors on results. Second, significant heterogeneity existed among trials evaluating FEV1, ACQ-5 score, FE NO, and AQLQ, possible sources of heterogeneity might include different geographic regions and races. Third, we combined 2 or 3 intervention groups into a single group according to the Cochrane handbook, regardless of differences in intervention dosage, which made it hard to determine the optimal dose. Last, as all the RCTs involved the pharmaceutical industry, the positive outcomes should be expounded cautiously. Our study also had some strengths; for instance, our patient selection was highly consistent, and all trials were of high quality, such that the internal validity of our meta-analysis was high.

### Younger severe asthma patients with interleukin 4 (CC variant) and dupilumab treatment are more likely to achieve clinical remission [^36df4f7d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study highlights the transformative potential of biologic therapies, specifically dupilumab, in achieving CR for severe asthma patients. By integrating genetic markers, such as IL-4 and TNF-α gene polymorphisms, as predictors of remission, this research paves the way for more tailored asthma management strategies. The results not only confirm the efficacy of biologics in improving asthma control but also emphasize the importance of personalized medicine in optimizing outcomes for severe asthma patients. However, future studies with larger cohorts are essential to validate these findings and further refine remission criteria, ultimately offering patients improved quality of life and long-term disease stability.

### Dupilumab plus medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) improves outcomes compared with placebo plus continued high-dose ICS in children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe type 2 asthma [^4a2b093f]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

ICS remains the mainstay of asthma treatment in pediatric populations, as these medications broadly suppress inflammation through multiple mechanisms. However, when high‐dose ICS is prescribed for > 6 months, some professional societies recommend screening for adrenal suppression as a potential side effect. Whereas recommendations for ICS dosing in children with asthma vary among different guidelines, they generally emphasize the importance of using the lowest effective dose to achieve and maintain control of asthma symptoms and utilizing a stepwise approach with increasing asthma severity.

Nonetheless, there remains ongoing discussion on whether increasing ICS dosage is more effective than using additional treatments in managing uncontrolled asthma. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of increasing ICS dose in improving respiratory outcomes; however, these improvements may not provide a clinically relevant therapeutic advantage in many children with persistent asthma or may be accompanied by an increased risk of AEs. Although a systematic review and meta‐analysis of 14 studies (n = 5768) showed a small but statistically significant improvement in FEV 1 with moderate‐ versus low‐dose ICS in children with mild‐to‐moderate asthma, there were no significant differences in other efficacy outcomes, and no evidence of a dose–response relationship at low‐to‐moderate doses compared with low doses. Another meta‐analysis (8 studies, n = 3866) found that increasing ICS dose significantly reduced treatment failure but increased the incidence of nonserious AEs.

### Effects of dupilumab in children and adolescents with moderate-severe asthma: a systematic review of clinical trials [^6a5831fa]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the benefits and harms of Dupilumab in children and adolescents with moderate to severe asthma.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, and Clinical Trials Registries up to August 18, 2024. Whenever possible, we performed meta-analyses of the studies. The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE methodology.

Results

Seven publications from two multicenter RCTs were included. These studies included 408 children (6–11 years old) and 134 adolescents (12–17 years old). Both studies were funded by the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Dupilumab. The evidence suggests that Dupilumab probably leads to a substantial reduction in the annual rate of severe exacerbations (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.31–0.67; moderate certainty), particularly in children with a Th2 phenotype. Dupilumab probably improves quality of life to a clinically meaningful extent (RR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.01–1.29; moderate certainty). However, it probably does not lead to a substantial improvement in asthma control (mean difference: -0.43, 95% CI: -0.56 to -0.30; two studies; moderate certainty; minimal-important-difference: 0.5). The frequency of serious adverse events may be similar between Dupilumab and placebo (4.8% vs. 4.5%; RR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.41–2.68; low certainty). Finally, at 52 weeks, Dupilumab lead to an important increase in the Z-score pre-BD FEV1/FVC (RR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.22–1.63; high certainty).

Conclusion

In children and adolescents with uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma, particularly those with a Th2 inflammatory phenotype, the use of Dupilumab probably reduced the annual rate of severe exacerbations, increases both the percentage of children with good quality of life and pulmonary function parameters, with probably minimal serious adverse events.

### Dupilumab for the treatment of asthma [^bf55f4a6]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dupilumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody directed against the α subunit of the interleukin (IL)-4 receptor (IL-4Rα). Since the activation of IL-4Rα is utilized by both IL-4 and IL-13 to mediate their pathophysiological effects, dupilumab behaves as a dual antagonist of these two sister cytokines, which blocks IL-4/IL-13-dependent signal transduction. Areas covered: Herein, the authors review the cellular and molecular pathways activated by IL-4 and IL-13, which are relevant to asthma pathobiology. They also review: the mechanism of action of dupilumab, the phase I, II and III studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics as well as the safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of dupilumab in asthma therapy. Expert opinion: Supported by a strategic mechanism of action, as well as by convincing preliminary clinical results, dupilumab currently appears to be a very promising biological drug for the treatment of severe uncontrolled asthma. It also may have benefits to comorbidities of asthma including atopic dermatitis, chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis.

### Anti-IL-4 / IL-13 for the treatment of asthma: the story so far [^63aa2c31]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Severe asthma is a global health concern with high morbidity and mortality. Understanding of its complex pathophysiology continues to increase, providing specific immune targets for therapeutic intervention. Areas covered: In this review, we focus on the role of IL-4 and IL-13 in severe asthma and on the biologic therapies developed to target them, particularly dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody against the IL-4 receptor α subunit and IL-4/IL-13 receptor complex. A literature search was undertaken for all studies of monoclonal antibodies against IL-4 and IL-13. Expert Opinion: Dupilumab decreases the rate of severe asthma exacerbations and improves symptoms, lung function, and quality of life. Importantly, these effects are also observed during reduction of maintenance oral corticosteroid doses. Those with the highest T2 biomarkers derive the greatest benefit and the presence of atopic dermatitis or chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyposis may recommend dupilumab as the preferred biologic treatment for a patient.

### Dupilumab is effective in type 2-high asthma patients receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids at baseline [^94939615]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Dupilumab blocks the shared receptor component for interleukin (IL)‐4/IL‐13, key drivers of type 2 inflammation. In phase 2b (NCT01854047) and phase 3 LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST (NCT02414854), add‐on dupilumab 200/300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) reduced severe exacerbations, improved prebronchodilator (pre‐BD) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and quality of life measures, and it was generally well tolerated in patients with uncontrolled, persistent (phase 2b), or moderate‐to‐severe (phase 3) asthma.

Methods

In patients on high‐dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with type 2‐high asthma (subgroups including baseline blood eosinophils ≥ 150/300 cells/µL and/or fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO] ≥ 25 ppb), annualized severe exacerbation rates over the treatment period, changes from baseline in pre‐BD FEV 1 and asthma control (5‐item asthma control questionnaire [ACQ‐5]) were analyzed.

Results

In high‐dose ICS type 2‐high subgroups, dupilumab 200/300 mg q2w vs placebo in the phase 2b (24 weeks) and phase 3 (52 weeks) studies significantly reduced severe exacerbations by 55%‐69%/57%‐60% (all P < .05) and 53%‐69%/48%‐66% (all P < .001), respectively, except in patients with ≥ 300 eosinophils/µL in phase 2b study (24%/50% (P = 0.52/0.15). Across subgroups, pre‐BD FEV 1 improved by 0.18‐0.22 L/0.19‐0.24 L (all P < .05) and 0.23‐0.36 L/0.15‐0.25 L (all P < .01) and ACQ‐5 scores were reduced by 0.46‐0.55/0.47‐0.85 (all P < .05) and 0.38‐0.50/0.24‐0.30 (all P < .05), respectively, except dupilumab 200 mg q2w in phase 2b in patients with FeNO ≥ 25 ppb (0.41; P = 0.09). Dupilumab was also effective in patients taking medium‐dose ICS.

Conclusion

Dupilumab significantly reduced severe exacerbations and improved lung function and asthma control in patients with type 2‐high asthma on high‐dose ICS at baseline.

### Dupilumab efficacy in patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe allergic asthma [^d967f67c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Dupilumab blocks the shared receptor component for IL-4 and IL-13, key drivers of type 2 inflammation, including IgE-mediated allergic inflammation in asthma. In the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST (NCT02414854) study, dupilumab reduced severe asthma exacerbations and improved forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) in patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma with greater efficacy observed in patients with elevated type 2 inflammatory biomarkers (blood eosinophils and fractional exhaled nitric oxide) at baseline.

Objective

We assessed dupilumab's effect on key asthma outcomes in QUEST patients with/without evidence of allergic asthma (total serum IgE ≥ 30 IU/mL and ≥ 1 perennial aeroallergen-specific IgE ≥ 0.35 kU/L at baseline).

Methods

Severe exacerbation rates and change from baseline in FEV 1, asthma control, and markers of type 2 inflammation during the 52-week treatment period were assessed.

Results

In the allergic asthma subgroup (n = 1083), dupilumab 200/300 mg every 2 weeks versus placebo reduced severe asthma exacerbation rates (-36.9%/-45.5%; both P < .01), improved FEV 1 at week 12 (0.13 L/0.16 L; both P < .001; improvements were evident by the first evaluation at week 2) with greater efficacy observed in patients with elevated type 2 inflammatory biomarkers at baseline, and improved asthma control. Dupilumab treatment also resulted in rapid and sustained reductions in type 2 inflammatory biomarkers. Comparable results were observed in patients without evidence of allergic asthma (n = 819).

Conclusion

Dupilumab reduced severe exacerbation rates, improved FEV 1 and asthma control, and suppressed type 2 inflammatory biomarkers in patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma with or without evidence of allergic asthma, highlighting the key role of IL-4 and IL-13 in airway inflammation.

Dupilumab (anti–IL4Rα) add-on for severe eosinophilic/Type 2 asthma or for patients requiring maintenance OCS — regulatory details, mechanism, eligibility, outcomes, predictors, and safety are summarized as follows: For ages ≥ 12 years, dupilumab 200 mg or 300 mg by SC injection every 2 weeks is listed for severe eosinophilic/Type 2 asthma, and 300 mg by SC injection every 2 weeks for OCS-dependent severe asthma or with concomitant moderate/severe atopic dermatitis; for children 6–11 years, dosing and frequency depend on weight, and self-administration may be an option. Mechanistically, dupilumab binds to interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor alpha, blocking both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling. Eligibility criteria often include more than a specified number of severe exacerbations in the last year and Type 2 biomarkers above specified levels, such as blood eosinophils ≥ 150/μL and ≤ 1500/μL or FeNO ≥ 25 ppb, or a requirement for maintenance OCS. In a meta-analysis of RCTs in uncontrolled severe asthma (ACQ-5 ≥ 1.5) and ≥ 1 exacerbation in the last year, anti-IL4Rα led to 56% reduction in severe exacerbations; in OCS-dependent severe asthma, the median reduction in OCS dose versus placebo was 50%, and changes were maintained through 2 years of follow-up. In children 6–11 years with eosinophilic/Type 2 asthma, dupilumab reduced severe exacerbation rate and increased lung function; in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, dupilumab reduced polyp size, improved nasal symptoms, and reduced the need for OCS or sinus surgery. Potential predictors of good asthma response to dupilumab include higher blood eosinophils (strongly predictive) and higher FeNO (strongly predictive). Adverse effects include injection-site reactions and transient blood eosinophilia (occurs in 4–13% of patients); rare cases of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) may be unmasked following reduction/cessation of OCS, and anti-IL4Rα is not suggested for patients with baseline or historic blood eosinophils > 1,500 cells/μL. Suggested initial trial is at least 4 months.

Dupilumab

Dupilumab is a humanised anti-IL4Rα monoclonal antibody, blocking IL4 and IL13 signalling. Dupilumab was recently licensed in the UK for use in children with severe asthma aged ≥ 12 years. Dupilumab is recommended by NICE for those with four severe asthma attacks in the previous year, and failed treatment or ineligibility with anti-IL5 treatment, and a blood eosinophil count of ≥ 0.15×10⁹/L, and FeNO ≥ 25 parts per billion. The Liberty Asthma QUEST phase 3 multicentre study of dupilumab in 1902 adults and adolescents with moderate to severe asthma recruited patients without any restriction on baseline type 2 inflammatory markers. Dupilumab significantly reduced asthma attacks and improved lung function. A greater clinical response was seen in those with high baseline eosinophil count and FeNO. Recently, the VOYAGER trial demonstrated efficacy of dupilumab in children. In a randomised controlled trial of 408 children (aged 6–11 years) with uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma, dupilumab significantly reduced severe attacks and improved lung function and asthma related quality of life. Dupilumab had the greatest clinical effect in children with biomarkers of type 2 (inflammation) high asthma (ie, elevated baseline blood eosinophil counts > 150 cells/µL or FeNO > 20 parts per billion).

### Dupilumab plus medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) improves outcomes compared with placebo plus continued high-dose ICS in children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe type 2 asthma [^03a77baa]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Current guidelines classify inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) by dose level as "low", "medium", and "high". For management of persistent asthma in children and adolescents, it is advised to begin with daily low‐dose ICS monotherapy and, depending on asthma severity and control, this may be escalated to medium and high‐dose ICS, often in combination with additional therapies. However, whereas numerous studies show that higher ICS doses may improve respiratory outcomes, these improvements might not offer significant clinical benefits beyond that achieved with medium doses for many children with persistent asthma. Additionally, high‐dose ICS use may result in systemic adverse effects, including adrenal suppression and growth retardation in pediatric asthma patients; as a result, clinical guideline committees like the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology recommend screening for adrenal insufficiency in children and adolescents receiving high‐dose ICS for > 6 months. In a minority of pediatric patients (2–5%), asthma may remain uncontrolled even with the highest tolerated/effective dose of ICS, increasing the risk of not only ICS‐related adverse effects but also asthma progression into adulthood and potential development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Type 2 inflammation, directed by the effects of inflammatory cytokines like interleukin (IL)−4, IL‐13, and IL‐5, is the most common phenotypic pattern of asthma in children, present in up to 85% of pediatric cases; however, non–type 2 phenotypes such as neutrophilic or type 1 or 3 inflammation‐driven asthma are also recognized. Dupilumab is a fully human VelocImmune®‐derived monoclonal antibody that blocks the shared receptor component for IL‐4 and IL‐13, inhibiting signaling of both IL‐4 and IL‐13, key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation in multiple diseases.

In the phase, 3 LIBERTY ASTHMA VOYAGE study (NCT02948959), add‐on dupilumab every 2 weeks (q2w), versus placebo, demonstrated significant reductions in severe asthma exacerbations and improvements in the percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV 1) as early as Week 12 in children with moderate‐to‐severe type 2 asthma, and was generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile.

This post hoc analysis of VOYAGE aimed to compare the treatment efficacy and safety of medium‐dose ICS plus add‐on dupilumab versus placebo plus continued high‐dose ICS in children with uncontrolled moderate‐to‐severe asthma with type 2 inflammation.

### Dupilumab reduced impact of severe exacerbations on lung function in patients with moderate-to-severe type 2 asthma [^2fbc9f77]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

In summary, this analysis shows that treatment with dupilumab results in significant increases in both pre‐ and post‐BD FEV 1 in patients with elevated type 2 biomarkers, regardless of whether severe exacerbations occurred. Although lung function in placebo‐treated patients declined following severe exacerbation events, dupilumab‐treated patients continued to experience improvements in lung function, suggesting sustained preservation of lung function after severe exacerbation can be achieved with dupilumab treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of dupilumab in children with moderate-to-severe asthma: a systematic review of emerging phase 3 evidence [^37089e51]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Dupilumab is a human monoclonal antibody targeting the IL‐4 receptor. There is a paucity of evidence regarding its efficacy and safety in pediatrics. Pediatric‐specific data are limited, and most evidence comes from recent phase 3 trials and post hoc analyses.

Objective

To summarize the current evidence of the efficacy, safety, and biomarker effects of dupilumab in children with moderate‐to‐severe asthma, while identifying key gaps in the pediatric evidence base.

Methods

This study is a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, and aims to assess the efficacy, safety, and biomarker response of dupilumab in pediatric patients with moderate to severe asthma. We evaluated the studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0.

Results

Six studies from 2021 to 2024 met the inclusion criteria: three of them are phase 3 randomized controlled trials and the other three post hoc analyses, mostly including children aged 6–11 years with type 2 inflammation, defined by elevated blood eosinophils and/or FeNO. Both allergic and nonallergic asthma phenotypes were represented across studies, with post hoc analyses indicating consistent benefit in each group. Dupilumab decreased the rate of severe exacerbations annually by 59.3% in children with type 2 inflammation. The study populations are mainly children between 6 and 11 years of age with moderate‐to‐severe asthma, characterized by eosinophilic or allergic phenotypes (type 2 asthma), including those with elevated blood eosinophils and/or FeNO levels. Dupilumab reduced the annual rate of severe exacerbation by ~59%, with greater reductions in children with FeNO ≥ 50 ppb (69%) or eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/µL (65%). The lung function showed improvement by 0.15–0.30 L in pre‐bronchodilator FEV₁, accompanied by gains in asthma control and quality of life. Biomarker reductions (FeNO, eosinophils, IgE, TARC) were consistent across phenotypes. Adverse event rates were like placebo; eosinophilia and injection site reactions were more common but usually mild.

Conclusion

This systematic review provides an early synthesis of emerging pediatric phase 3 evidence on dupilumab. While results suggest substantial benefits in reducing exacerbations, improving lung function, and modulating type 2 biomarkers, the evidence remains limited to short‐term studies in a narrow age range. Longer‐term follow‐up, broader age representation, and real‐world data are needed to define the long‐term role of dupilumab in pediatric asthma.

### Baseline FeNO independently predicts the dupilumab response in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma [^a7051da6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

FeNO may have a role as both a prognostic and predictive biomarker in combination with eosinophils for assessing responsiveness to some biological therapies.

Objective

We evaluated the value of baseline FeNO, adjusted for baseline blood eosinophil levels and other clinical characteristics, as an independent predictor of treatment response to dupilumab in patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma.

Methods

We performed a post hoc analysis of LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST (NCT02414854), a phase 3, double-blind study in patients aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma, who received dupilumab 200 or 300 mg, or placebo every 2 weeks up to 52 weeks. We assessed the annualized event rate of severe exacerbations and least-squares mean change from baseline in prebronchodilator FEV 1 at weeks 12 and 52 in relationship to baseline FeNO, adjusted for eosinophils and other clinical characteristics.

Results

The annualized event rate increased with increasing baseline FeNO in placebo and decreased in dupilumab groups. The relative risk of severe exacerbations was 22.7%, 58.3%, and 69.3% lower for dupilumab versus placebo for the FeNO less than 25, 25 to less than 50, and 50 and greater parts per billion subgroups. The magnitude of FEV 1 improvement increased with higher baseline FeNO for dupilumab and was consistent across the continuum of FeNO levels in placebo. Both findings were independent of blood eosinophil levels. Significant differences were observed between FeNO subgroups.

Conclusions

Increased baseline FeNO was associated with greater clinical effects in dupilumab versus placebo independently of eosinophil levels and other clinical characteristics.

### Efficacy and safety of dupilumab in glucocorticoid-dependent severe asthma [^a4560217]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Dupilumab is a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor α monoclonal antibody that blocks both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling. Its effectiveness in reducing oral glucocorticoid use in patients with severe asthma while maintaining asthma control is unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned 210 patients with oral glucocorticoid-treated asthma to receive add-on dupilumab (at a dose of 300 mg) or placebo every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. After a glucocorticoid dose-adjustment period before randomization, glucocorticoid doses were adjusted in a downward trend from week 4 to week 20 and then maintained at a stable dose for 4 weeks. The primary end point was the percentage reduction in the glucocorticoid dose at week 24. Key secondary end points were the proportion of patients at week 24 with a reduction of at least 50% in the glucocorticoid dose and the proportion of patients with a reduction to a glucocorticoid dose of less than 5 mg per day. Severe exacerbation rates and the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) before bronchodilator use were also assessed.

Results

The percentage change in the glucocorticoid dose was -70.1% in the dupilumab group, as compared with -41.9% in the placebo group (P < 0.001); 80% versus 50% of the patients had a dose reduction of at least 50%, 69% versus 33% had a dose reduction to less than 5 mg per day, and 48% versus 25% completely discontinued oral glucocorticoid use. Despite reductions in the glucocorticoid dose, in the overall population, dupilumab treatment resulted in a severe exacerbation rate that was 59% (95% confidence interval [CI] 37 to 74) lower than that in the placebo group and resulted in an FEV 1 that was 0.22 liters (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.34) higher. Injection-site reactions were more common with dupilumab than with placebo (9% vs. 4%). Transient blood eosinophilia was observed in more patients in the dupilumab group than in the placebo group (14% vs. 1%).

Conclusions

In patients with glucocorticoid-dependent severe asthma, dupilumab treatment reduced oral glucocorticoid use while decreasing the rate of severe exacerbations and increasing the FEV 1. Transient eosinophilia was observed in approximately 1 in 7 dupilumab-treated patients.

Analysis of patients who continued dupilumab for 36 months

Patients who continued therapy for 36 months (95 patients, 59%) showed a significant median (IQR) improvement in asthma control as depicted by an increase in ACT score (baseline vs 36 months: 15 points [10–19 points] vs 20 points [16–23 points]; P < .0001), decrease in annual exacerbations (baseline vs 36 months: 1 [0–3] vs 0 [0–0]; P < .0001), and decrease in OCS dose (baseline vs 36 months: 6 mg [5–13 mg] vs 0 mg [0–0 mg]; P < .001). In terms of lung function, there was a significant mean ± SD improvement in percent predicted of FEV 1 (FEV 1%) (baseline vs 36 months: 69% ± 22% vs 75% ± 23%; P < .001) and percent predicted of forced vital capacity (FVC%) (baseline vs 36 months: 83% ± 19% vs 87% ± 19%; P = 0.04) as well as a significant mean ± SD decrease in percent predicted of residual volume (baseline vs 36 months: 157% ± 49% vs 141% ± 41%; P < .001). At the 36-month visit, 35 patients (36%) achieved FEV 1 improvement of more than 200 mL. Median (IQR) BEC increased at the 3-month follow-up after dupilumab initiation (baseline vs 3 months: 150/μL [10–460/μL] vs 330/μL [165–785/μL]; P < .01), but was not significantly different from baseline at the 36-month follow-up (baseline vs 36 months: 150/μL [10–460/μL] vs 240/μL [115–420/μL]; P = 0.52). Median (IQR) Fsignificantly decreased (baseline vs 36 months: 41 ppb [23–78 ppb] vs 17 ppb [11–28 ppb]; P < .0001), as did total serum IgE (baseline vs 36 months: 143 IU/mL [62–334 IU/mL] vs 29 IU/mL [8–196 IU/mL], P < .05) (Fig 2). Further subgroup analysis was performed for patients who continued therapy for 36 months to evaluate efficacy in ex-smokers (Fig E1, A, in the Online Repository at), who had CRSwNP (Fig E1, B), and who had early-onset (Fig E1, C) or adult-onset asthma (Fig E1, D).

### Dupilumab safety and efficacy in uncontrolled asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^c5c32c43]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: We aimed to perform a meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with uncontrolled asthma. Data source: A search of electronic databases was performed using PubMed, Cochrane library and Embase. Study selection: The literature search was conducted independently by two reviewers. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared between placebo and dupilumab in patients with uncontrolled asthma were included in this analysis. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for dichotomous and continuous data, respectively. Results: A total of four RCTs representing 2,992 patients were included. Pooled analysis showed significant reductions of the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbation in the dupilumab group compared with placebo (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.35–0.055; P < 0.01; I2 = 42%). In addition, the absolute forced expiratory volume at 1s (FEV1) changes were significantly increased for the dupilumab group (MD 0.14; 95% CI: 0.12–0.17; P < 0.01; I2 = 0%). Finally, there were no significant differences between both groups in the development of any adverse event, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to death, discontinuation of medication due to adverse event or the occurrence of upper respiratory tract, influenza or bronchitis infections. However, dupilumab was associated with an increased risk of injection site reactions compared with placebo (RR 1.91; 95% CI 1.41, 2.59; P < 0.01; I2 = 24%). Conclusion: Among patients with uncontrolled asthma, the addition of dupilumab was associated with a reduced risk of severe asthma exacerbations and improvement in FEV1 without an increased risk of adverse events apart from injection site reactions with dupilumab.

### A comparison of the effectiveness of biologic therapies for asthma: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^6fad84e9]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Trials have not directly compared biologics for the treatment of asthma.

Objective

To compare the relative efficacy of biologics in asthma.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to May 31, 2022 for randomized trials addressing biologic therapies for asthma. Reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to screen references, extract data, and assess risk of bias. We performed a frequentist network meta-analysis and assessed the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. We present dichotomous outcomes as absolute risk differences per 1000 patients and relative risk with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) and 95% CI.

Results

We identified 64 trials, including 26,630 patients. For patients with eosinophilic asthma, tezepelumab (329 fewer exacerbations per 1000 [95% CI, 272.6–366.6 fewer]) and dupilumab (319.6 fewer exacerbations per 1000 [95% CI, 272.6–357.2 fewer]) reduce exacerbations compared with placebo (high certainty). Tezepelumab (MD, 0.24 L [95% CI, 0.16–0.32]) and dupilumab (0.25 L [95% CI, 0.21–0.29]) improve lung function compared with placebo (high certainty). Both tezepelumab (110.97 fewer hospital admissions per 1000 [95% CI, 94.53–120.56 fewer]) and dupilumab (97.27 fewer hospitalizations [4.11–124.67 fewer]) probably reduce hospital admissions compared with placebo (moderate certainty). For patients with low eosinophils, biologics probably do not improve asthma outcomes. For these patients, tezepelumab (MD, 0.1 L [95% CI, 0–0.19]) and dupilumab (MD, 0.1 L [95% CI, 0–0.20]) may improve lung function (low certainty).

Conclusion

Tezepelumab and dupilumab are effective at reducing exacerbations. For patients with low eosinophils, however, clinicians should probably be more judicious in using biologics, including tezepelumab, because they probably do not confer substantial benefit.

### Dupilumab is effective in type 2-high asthma patients receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids at baseline [^afb82286]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

In the phase 2 studies (NCT01312961 and NCT01854047), dupilumab‐ vs placebo‐treated patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma had a significantly reduced severe exacerbation rate and improved prebronchodilator (pre‐BD) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1). 18, 19 Of importance, these findings were consistent irrespective of baseline blood eosinophil count, a biomarker for type 2 inflammation. 19 In the subsequent phase 3 LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study (NCT02414854), add‐on dupilumab significantly reduced severe asthma exacerbations and improved pre‐BD FEV 1 in the overall intention‐to‐treat (ITT) population of patients with uncontrolled, moderate‐to‐severe asthma. 20 Treatment effects were of greater magnitude in subgroups of patients with elevated baseline levels of the type 2 biomarkers (blood eosinophils ≥ 150 cells/µL or fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO] ≥ 25 ppb). Dupilumab was generally well tolerated by patients in each of the studies.

This analysis across the dupilumab phase 2b and phase 3 QUEST studies further assessed the effect of dupilumab on severe exacerbations, pre‐BD FEV 1, and asthma control in subgroups of patients with different characteristics of type 2‐high disease who were taking high‐dose ICS at baseline. Given the evidence from previous studies and in other biologics, we expected dupilumab to also be effective in this patient population. For completeness and transparency, we also repeated the analysis in patients with elevated type 2 biomarkers taking medium‐dose ICS at baseline and have included the findings in Appendix S1.

### Dupilumab is effective in type 2-high asthma patients receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids at baseline [^860435cc]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have been the mainstay treatment of persistent asthma for more than 40 years. By targeting the glucocorticoid receptor, ICS inhibit the release of cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators, decrease eosinophil and mast cell recruitment, and inhibit nuclear transcription factors, thus suppressing adhesion molecule function and inducible nitric oxide synthase. 1, 2, 3, 4 However, the largest clinical benefits are seen at low‐dose ICS, with diminishing returns due to increased systemic adverse events at higher doses. 5

Uncontrolled, moderate‐to‐severe asthma accounts for approximately 20% of all asthma cases 6, 7 and includes patients who have persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite the use of high‐dose ICS and controller medicines. This population is at an increased risk of exacerbations, with many patients having substantially reduced lung function and impaired quality of life, all of which culminate in considerable healthcare resource use and associated costs. 8 Type 2‐high asthma, characterized by type 2 inflammation, occurs in approximately 50% of patients with asthma. 9 It includes the allergic phenotype, characterized by increased expression of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to aeroallergens; eosinophilic phenotype, characterized by eosinophilia evident in the blood, airways, and/or tissue 9, 10, 11; and nonallergic, adult‐onset, intrinsic phenotype. In recent years, add‐on biologic treatments for use in patients with uncontrolled moderate‐to‐severe or persistent asthma have been developed that specifically target elements of type 2 inflammation such as interleukin (IL)‐4, IL‐5, and IL‐13, which play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of asthma. 12, 13 One such agent, dupilumab, is a fully human VelocImmune ® ‐derived monoclonal antibody that blocks the shared receptor component for IL‐4 and IL‐13, key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation in multiple diseases. 14, 15, 16, 17

### Real-world effectiveness of dupilumab in patients with asthma: findings from the US ADVANTAGE study [^41c11e1e]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Dupilumab is approved as an add-on maintenance therapy for patients (≥ 6 years) with moderate-to-severe asthma. Better understanding of real-world effectiveness is needed.

Objective

To characterize the real-world effectiveness of dupilumab in asthma management.

Methods

This retrospective study included patients (≥ 12 years of age) diagnosed with asthma, initiating dupilumab between November 2018 and September 2020. The study used a US electronic medical record database (TriNetX Dataworks, Cambridge, Massachusetts). Asthma exacerbation rates before and after the initiation of dupilumab were analyzed using generalized estimating equations models with Poisson probabilistic link to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs). Sensitivity analyses were conducted based on previous exacerbation data, eosinophil levels, history of atopic dermatitis or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, previous use of biologics, and presence of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).

Results

A total of 2400 patients initiating dupilumab met all study criteria. After initiation of dupilumab, risk of asthma exacerbation was reduced by 44% (IRR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.47–0.57; P = < 0.0001) and systemic corticosteroid prescriptions by 48% (IRR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.48, 0.56; P = < 0.0001) compared with those before initiation of dupilumab. Adjustment for COVID-19 showed a greater reduction in asthma exacerbations (IRR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.45–0.55; P = < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Current real-world efficacy evidence indicates that dupilumab reduces asthma exacerbations and total systemic corticosteroid prescriptions in clinical practice. The effectiveness of dupilumab was observed independent of exacerbation history, eosinophil levels, or COVID-19 impact.

### The new biologic drugs: which children with asthma should get what? [^adeebddd]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

Novel biologics (targeted antibody therapies) have revolutionized the management of severe childhood asthma. However, it is important that the right biologic is selected for the right patient, and understanding the evidence base for each biologic is crucial. Currently, four biologics (all monoclonal antibodies) are licensed in the UK for the treatment of children with severe asthma - omalizumab (Xolair), mepolizumab (Nucala), and dupilumab (Dupixent) in children aged 6 years and over; and tezepelumab (Tezspire), only in children aged 12 years and over. Tezepelumab is the only licensed biological that may be beneficial in severe asthma without evidence of Type 2 inflammation. All have a good safety profile but varying degrees of clinical efficacy in children, with wide variation in treatment responsiveness between individual patients. When selecting biologics for severe asthma, it is essential to remember the limitations of the current pediatric evidence. At present, there are no results from randomized, head-to-head trials of biologics in severe asthma. TREAT is an ongoing trial comparing omalizumab to mepolizumab and will be one of the first to provide such evidence. We must be especially aware of the dangers of extrapolating data from adults to children, because the pathophysiology and role of biomarkers may differ significantly from adult asthma. Given the current level of knowledge, even after treatment has been initiated, children should be regularly reviewed to determine the efficacy of treatment, side-effect profile and consideration of when treatment with the biologic should be discontinued.

### Dupilumab is effective in type 2-high asthma patients receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids at baseline [^9429b394]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

The strength of this analysis is its randomized, double‐blind design, its large population sizes, and the inclusion of patients regardless of ICS dose at baseline. One of the limitations was that the findings are constrained by the low sample sizes in some of the subgroups, as these were not defined a priori. The studies were not powered specifically to investigate differences between patients with asthma with high/medium‐dose ICS and eosinophils ≥ 150 cells/µL or ≥ 300 cells/µL, FeNO ≥ 25 ppb, or eosinophils ≥ 150 cells/µL or FeNO ≥ 25 ppb. In addition, a large placebo effect on asthma control was observed in the QUEST study, possibly due to increased adherence in patients in the placebo group, which may have contributed to the differences in ACQ‐5 improvement from baseline for dupilumab vs placebo not being statistically significant. Finally, due to the timings of the trial, old versions of the GINA guidelines were used when designing the studies and this analysis.

### Dupilumab efficacy in steroid-dependent severe asthma by baseline oral corticosteroid dose [^ad49f0b2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, blocks the shared receptor component for interleukin-4/-13, key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation in multiple diseases. In the phase 3 LIBERTY ASTHMA VENTURE (VENTURE) study (NCT02528214), dupilumab versus placebo reduced oral corticosteroid (OCS) dose and improved clinical outcomes in patients with OCS-dependent severe asthma. Dupilumab efficacy in patients with varying disease burden (defined by baseline OCS dose) has not been assessed.

Objective

This post hoc analysis of VENTURE evaluated dupilumab efficacy across subgroups defined by baseline OCS dose.

Methods

The OCS dose, proportion no longer needing OCS at week 24, annualized severe exacerbation rate, and least squares mean change from baseline in pre- and post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second at week 24 were evaluated in VENTURE patients with OCS-dependent severe asthma receiving dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks versus placebo, categorized by a baseline OCS dose of less than 10 mg/d or 10 or more mg/d.

Results

Dupilumab reduced daily OCS dose from baseline at week 24 in both dose groups. In dupilumab-/placebo-treated patients with a baseline OCS dose of less than 10 mg/d and 10 or more mg/d, 72%/42% and 37%/23% stopped OCS by week 24 (P < .01/P < .05), respectively. Dupilumab significantly reduced the annualized severe exacerbation rate by 71% and 48% (P < .01/P < .05). At week 24, dupilumab improved pre- and post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second in patients in both dose groups.

Conclusions

In patients with OCS-dependent severe asthma receiving lower or higher baseline OCS doses, dupilumab significantly reduced the OCS dose and improved the likelihood of no longer requiring OCS while also reducing exacerbations and improving lung function.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design and patients

The phase 2b study (NCT01854047) was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group study conducted in adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with an asthma diagnosis for at least 12 months based on the Global Initiative for Asthma 2009 guidelines 21 and receiving treatment with high‐ (> 1000 µg/day) or medium‐ (500‐1000 µg/day) dose ICS plus long‐acting β 2 ‐agonists. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous dupilumab 200 or 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) or every 4 weeks or placebo, over a 24‐week period. Full details of the study design and conduct, including inclusion and exclusion criteria, have been published previously. 19 For this post hoc analysis, only the data from patients randomized to dupilumab q2w regimens (the approved dosing regimen) and placebo were included.

LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST was a phase 3 multinational, multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group study that assessed the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with uncontrolled asthma treated with high‐ (> 1000 µg/day) or medium‐ (500‐1000 µg/day) dose ICS (Table S1). Patients ≥ 12 years were randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive add‐on subcutaneous dupilumab 200 or 300 mg q2w or volume‐matched placebo for 52 weeks. The study was open to all patients irrespective of eosinophilic status or any other biomarker requirement. Full details of study design, methodology, and eligibility criteria have been reported previously. 20, 22

In both the phase 2b study and LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST, atopy was self‐reported by patients; no further clinical assessments were conducted to verify.

Both studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation and with applicable regulatory requirements. An independent data and safety monitoring committee conducted blinded monitoring of patient safety data. Study conduct and documentation were monitored by local institutional review boards or ethics committees, and all the patients provided written informed consent before participating in the trial. Adolescent patients provided assent according to the ethics committee and approved standard practice for pediatric patients at each participating center.

### Dupilumab reduces oral corticosteroid use in patients with corticosteroid-dependent severe asthma: an analysis of the phase 3, open-label extension TRAVERSE trial [^4268cecd]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Many patients with severe asthma require chronic corticosteroid treatment to maintain asthma control.

Research Question

Are the reduction in oral corticosteroid (OCS) use and the clinical efficacy observed with dupilumab treatment maintained long-term in patients with severe OCS-dependent asthma?

Study Design and Methods

The LIBERTY ASTHMA TRAVERSE study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02134028) was a multinational, multicenter, single-arm, open-label extension study in patients ≥ 12 years of age with asthma who participated in previous dupilumab studies. Treatment consisted of dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks for up to 96 weeks. In this analysis, we present the data from patients who initially enrolled in the LIBERTY ASTHMA VENTURE study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02528214), a 24-week placebo-controlled study of dupilumab in patients with OCS-dependent severe asthma, and continued in the TRAVERSE study. The subgroups analyzed were: those who received dupilumab in both (dupilumab/dupilumab group) and those who received placebo in the VENTURE study and dupilumab in the TRAVERSE study (placebo/dupilumab group). Outcomes included OCS use, exacerbation rates, and measures of lung function and asthma control.

Results

Ninety patients treated with dupilumab/dupilumab and 97 patients treated with placebo/dupilumab in the VENTURE study were enrolled and treated in the TRAVERSE study, with a mean OCS dosage of 11.0 mg/d (dupilumab) and 11.6 mg/d (placebo) at VENTURE study baseline. At TRAVERSE week 0, the mean daily OCS dosage was 3.1 mg/d and 6.4 mg/d (percentage decrease from the VENTURE study baseline, 68.8% and 41.3%) for the dupilumab/dupilumab group and placebo/dupilumab group, respectively, and decreased to 2.2 mg/d and 4.9 mg/d (78.3% and 53.4%) at week 48 and to 1.2 mg/d and 3.0 mg/d (89.3% and 74.4%) at week 96, respectively. Exacerbation rates were low during the TRAVERSE study. Further improvements from the VENTURE to TRAVERSE studies also were seen in FEV 1 and 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire scores. Safety findings were consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile.

Interpretation

In the open-label TRAVERSE study, dupilumab demonstrated the ability to sustain the OCS dosage reduction from the parent OCS-sparing study, while maintaining a low exacerbation rate and improved lung function.

### Real-world efficacy of treatment with benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab and reslizumab for severe asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^98b11197]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Biologicals have been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, it has been recognized that only a minority of patients with severe asthma would also be eligible for inclusion within an RCT. Moreover, in RCTs, many patients randomized to the placebo arm experience a significant improvement in asthma control and a reduction in the number of exacerbations suggesting that these apparent severe asthmatics simply require increased monitoring rather than increase drug therapy. Consequently, there are questions over the generalizability of results from RCTs. It has been suggested that, in general, the conclusions derived from RCTs could be more impactful if supported by evidence of therapeutic effectiveness from clinical practice. As such, real‐world studies are becoming more influential, informing decisions by healthcare regulatory bodies including the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) and Germany's Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care. However, when assessing real‐world studies, their small sample size and, in some cases, the lack of a control group can limit interpretation. These can both be addressed within the context of a systematic review and meta‐analysis through reference to effect measures derived from RCTs and by collating and pooling multiple studies to provide precise effect estimates. In this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of recently licenced biological agents in populations of participants with severe asthma reported in real‐world studies to assess the generalizability of the RCT data.

### Dual blockade of IL-4 and IL-13 with dupilumab, an IL-4R α antibody, is required to broadly inhibit type 2 inflammation [^e3d3dd97]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 inflammation has emerged as a unifying feature of both classically defined allergic diseases and a range of other inflammatory disorders, such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma. This specialized immune response promotes barrier immunity on mucosal surfaces and includes activity of the cytokines IL‐4, IL‐5, IL‐13, and IL‐9. 1 Given the pleiotropic roles of IL‐4 and IL‐13 in orchestrating type 2 responses, as well as their genetic association and increased expression in type 2 diseases, 2, 3 a number of therapeutic molecules targeting this pathway were evaluated in clinical trials for severe asthma over the last 20 years 4 and failed to robustly demonstrate clinical efficacy. 3, 5, 6 Renewed appreciation for the essential role of the two cytokines, IL‐4 and IL‐13, in driving type 2 disease has been resurrected based on clinical findings with dupilumab, a potent fully human IgG4‐based monoclonal antibody specific for IL‐4Rα. By targeting the shared receptor subunit IL‐4Rα, dupilumab blocks both IL‐4 and IL‐13 signaling and has shown robust clinical efficacy across multiple diseases with underlying type 2 signatures, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 perhaps supporting the idea that potent, dual cytokine blockade is required for efficacy and emphasizing important contributions of each in disease pathologies.

2.4 Quality Assessment

The methodological quality of the included control trials was assessed using Cochrane RoB 2.0, based on the following five parameters: randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selection of the reported result. The assessment included risk grading for each of these parameters as "low risk", "some concerns", or "high bias". Two independent reviewers (initials) performed the quality assessment, and any disagreements were resolved by consensus or through consultation with a third reviewer.

2.5 Data Synthesis

We used narrative synthesis methodology to include a summary and interpretation of results from the studies, as anticipated heterogeneity might occur in study populations, reported outcomes, and methodological approaches. We did not perform a meta‐analysis because there were few studies, and the effect estimates were heterogeneous. Instead, we narrated the effect estimates qualitatively, paying attention to the consistency and patterns of results across studies only where appropriate graphs were used to summarize the main findings.

2.6 Data Extraction

Figures 3 and 4 in this review were created using data extracted directly from the published results of the LIBERTY ASTHMA VOYAGE trial and related post hoc analyses. For Figure 3, the annualized severe exacerbation rates, subgroup definitions (e.g. FeNO categories, eosinophil thresholds), and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were taken exactly as reported in the original publications. For Figure 4, values for change in pre‐bronchodilator percent predicted FEV₁ (ppFEV₁) over 52 weeks were extracted from the same sources as reported means with standard errors. We did not perform any statistical recalculation or pooling of results; the figures are intended as a visual synthesis of published data rather than independent reanalysis.

2.3 Endpoints

Outcomes assessed in the current analysis include comparison of the baseline demographics and disease characteristics of exacerbators and non‐exacerbators, change from baseline over the 52‐week treatment period in pre‐ and post‐BD FEV 1, including assessment after the first severe exacerbation (and prior to a second severe exacerbation event), and the duration between first severe exacerbation and the first available measurement of pre‐ and post‐BD FEV 1 following the exacerbation event. Data were censored at onset of the potential second exacerbation event. A severe exacerbation during the study period was defined as a deterioration of asthma that required either the use of systemic corticosteroids for ≥ 3 days or a hospitalization or emergency room visit due to asthma and requiring systemic corticosteroids.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design

Full details of the QUEST study design have been published previously. In brief, QUEST was a phase 3, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study assessing the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with uncontrolled, moderate‐to‐severe asthma. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the principles of Good Clinical Practice, and all local applicable regulations. Patients or their parents/guardians provided informed consent/assent prior to enrollment in the study. Subgroup analysis of primary endpoints by number of asthma exacerbation events with 1 year prior to study was part of the pre‐specified analysis in the study protocol. However, other parts of the analysis were conducted post hoc (e.g. analysis by baseline FeNO subgroups).

2.2 Patients

Patients aged ≥ 12 years with physician‐diagnosed persistent asthma for ≥ 12 months based on the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommendations, who were receiving medium‐to‐high dose ICS plus up to 2 additional controllers (e.g. a long‐acting β2‐agonist or leukotriene receptor antagonist) were eligible for enrollment. Inclusion criteria included pre‐BD FEV 1 ≤ 80% of the predicted normal value for adults (≤ 90% for adolescents); FEV 1 reversibility ≥ 12% and 200 ml; a 5‐item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ‐5) score ≥ 1.5; and ≥ 1 asthma exacerbation in the past year, defined as a worsening of asthma in the preceding year that resulted in hospitalization, emergency medical care, or treatment with systemic glucocorticoids for ≥ 3 days. Full details of inclusion and exclusion criteria have been published previously.

Patients were randomized 2:2:1:1 to receive add‐on subcutaneous dupilumab 200 mg or 300 mg or matched placebo q2w for 52 weeks.

5 Conclusion

In this study, conducted in the often underrepresented populations of patients from China and India where it is crucial to have improved therapeutic options to treat severe asthma and reduce the asthma health care burdens, add‐on dupilumab demonstrated significantly improved lung function and asthma control and reduced the rate of severe exacerbations in patients with persistent asthma and elevated type 2 biomarkers at baseline who did not require maintenance OCS. Similar benefits were observed in patients with persistent asthma requiring maintenance OCS. Dupilumab was well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with the known safety profile of dupilumab. The outcomes presented in this study extend the knowledge of dupilumab and facilitate a better understanding of the patient populations who will most benefit from treatment with dupilumab.

3.2 Quality Assessment

We examined the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. Figure 2 illustrates comprehensive information on the quality assessment. The primary VOYAGE trials showed a low risk of bias. In contrast, the risk was high in three studies: Guilbert et al. Papadopoulos et al. and Jackson et al. Trials conducted by Fiocchi et al. and Pavord et al. demonstrated variable quality, presenting some concerns regarding selective reporting.

3.3 Characteristics of the Included Studies

The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 1. This systematic review included six studies conducted worldwide between 2021 and 2024. These studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in children with severe‐to‐moderate asthma. Most included studies enrolled participants aged 6 to 11 years, with a mean age of approximately 8.8–9.2, and one study recruited individuals aged ≥ 12 years. The sample size varied among these studies, ranging from 350 to 1878 participants. While three of these studies were phase 3 randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trials, the other three were post‐hoc analyses derived from phase 3 clinical trial data. The primary objective of the included studies was to assess the efficacy and safety profiles of dupilumab in asthmatic children, its impact on controlling asthma, its exacerbations, and improvement in patients' and caregivers' quality of life (QoL). One of these studies investigated pharmacokinetic properties and associated changes in type 2 inflammatory biomarkers. In contrast, another study explored the baseline fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level as an independent predictor of therapeutic response. Additionally, the impact of exacerbation history on dupilumab efficacy was investigated explicitly in a separate post‐hoc analysis. Collectively, these studies provide comprehensive demographic and clinical data supporting the use of dupilumab in various pediatric asthma populations.

### Younger severe asthma patients with interleukin 4 (CC variant) and dupilumab treatment are more likely to achieve clinical remission [^3f0428ee]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Strength and limitation

The study offers a comprehensive evaluation of biologics in severe asthma, leveraging real-world patient data to enhance clinical applicability. A notable strength is its exploration of genetic factors, specifically IL-4 and TNF-α gene polymorphisms, as potential predictors of remission, providing valuable insights for personalized asthma management. Moreover, the longitudinal design of the study allows for a more nuanced understanding of the causal relationship between genetic variations and treatment outcomes. However, this study is not without limitations. The relatively small sample size, particularly for certain biologics such as benralizumab and mepolizumab, limited the ability to perform more detailed statistical analyses. This constraint may reduce the generalizability of our findings, as remission outcomes could vary in a larger, more diverse patient population. Additionally, the lack of stratification of the study cohort based on factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities were a limitation. These variables, alongside inherent genetic heterogeneity, may have introduced confounding factors that could influence treatment outcomes and remission rates. Future prospective studies with larger, stratified cohorts are necessary to validate these findings and further explore the role of genetic and demographic factors in predicting responses to biologic therapies.

### Dupilumab reduced impact of severe exacerbations on lung function in patients with moderate-to-severe type 2 asthma [^9be0781a]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

Improvements from baseline in ACQ‐5 scores were greater in patients on dupilumab vs placebo. In both exacerbators and non‐exacerbators, improvements were observed as early as Week 2 and were sustained for the duration of the study, although significant differences were only consistent in the larger population of non‐exacerbators.

There are a number of limitations to this study. First, as a post hoc analysis, the study was not powered to investigate differences between treatments in the subgroups of exacerbators and non‐exacerbators. Small sample sizes in some subgroups may confound interpretation of the data. Second, our post‐exacerbation spirometry testing was not conducted at pre‐specified intervals relative to exacerbation events, but at times specified by the overall 52‐week protocol. The higher incidence of exacerbation rates seen in placebo‐treated patients might have increased the likelihood of spirometry occurring sooner after exacerbation events in these patients vs those treated with dupilumab, leading to higher probability of detecting lower FEV 1 values. However, we found no statistically or clinically important difference between placebo‐ and dupilumab‐treated patients in terms of time from exacerbation to FEV 1 measurement. Therefore, our data point to dupilumab favoring a more rapid improvement in lung function after exacerbation events (as early as 0–42 days) compared with placebo (from 43 days onwards). A faster recovery after exacerbations is a priority for many patients. Nevertheless, the FEV 1 increase after exacerbations appears not to be the only determinant of the overall lung function improvement seen with dupilumab treatment, as non‐exacerbators also benefitted from dupilumab therapy. Third, our study was not designed to examine the nature of the exacerbations that occurred. For example, it has been reported that patients receiving mepolizumab for severe eosinophilic asthma are heterogenous, with approximately half of exacerbations being non‐eosinophilic events driven by infection. Fourth, as this was a randomized controlled study, it may be that exacerbations were assessed and managed more rapidly than would have occurred in a real‐world situation. Finally, the study design reflects previous rather than current GINA recommendations.

### Adverse events of anti-IL-5 drugs in patients with eosinophilic asthma: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and real-world evidence-based assessments [^97054297]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Eosinophilic asthma represents a prevalent, chronic respiratory condition characterized by airflow obstruction, bronchial inflammation, and heightened airway responsiveness. Its pathogenesis often involves airway inflammation, predominantly seen as eosinophilic infiltration, as evidenced by consistent blood eosinophils presence. Eosinophilic granular release-induced tissue damage drives inflammation progression and airway remodeling. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 estimated that approximately 262 million individuals worldwide suffer from eosinophilic asthma, leading to around 461,000 fatalities annually. Presently, the primary treatments include inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), oral corticosteroids (OCS), short-acting β2 agonists, long-acting β2 agonists (LABA) and long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA). While conventional treatments effectively manage asthma in many instances, they often exacerbate the overall disease burden due to potential adverse effects. In contrast, additional treatments such as antileukotrienes and cromones offer limited clinical benefits or are prohibitively expensive. To this end, the 2022 GINA guidelines endorse the usage of biologic therapies as adjunctive therapies for managing severe eosinophilic asthma effectively.

Biologic therapies, including anti-immunoglobulin E (anti-IgE) (omalizumab), anti-IL-4Rα (dupilumab), anti-thymic stomal lymphopoietin (anti-TSLP) (tezepelumab), play a pivotal role in the management of eosinophilic asthma. Studies on omalizumab indicated for asthma showed overall incidence of adverse events is similar to that of the placebo-controlled groups. The phase III clinical trial "Efficacy and Safety of Dupilumab in Glucocorticoid-Dependent Severe Asthma" reported similar adverse event rates in both the dupilumab (62%) and placebo (64%) groups. Additionally, in the phase IIa clinical study "Dupilumab in Persistent Asthma with Elevated Eosinophil Levels", adverse events were reported by comparable proportions of patients in both groups (77% in the placebo group versus 81% in the dupilumab group). The phase 2b Pathway study and phase 3 Navigator trial, evaluating tezepelumab for severe asthma treatment, also showed similar adverse event incidences between treatment groups, with 75% (n = 496 of 665) in the tezepelumab group and 77% (n = 512 of 669) in the placebo group. These findings underscore the clinical value of biologic drugs in managing eosinophilic asthma.

Management of Severe Asthma

Refer patients to support services, where available, to help them deal with the heavy physical, emotional, social and financial burden of severe asthma and its treatment.

In Step 5, recommended add-on options include long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) (tiotropium ⩾6 yr, triple therapy with ICS–LABA–LAMA ⩾18 yr). Adding LAMA provided modest improvement in lung function but not symptom control, and exacerbations were reduced in some studies. Step 4 MART with ICS–formoterol should be tried before considering add-on LAMA; as-needed ICS–formoterol can be continued as the reliever for patients prescribed ICS–formoterol–LAMA, but for patients prescribed an ICS–LABA–LAMA with nonformoterol LABA, the appropriate reliever is SABA. After specialist referral, add-on, low-dose azithromycin is another option for reducing exacerbations, but risks of antibiotic resistance and prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) on electrocardiography must be considered. Sputum-guided adjustment of the ICS dose improves outcomes in moderate-to-severe asthma but is not widely available, and the optimal frequency of sputum assessment is not known.

With add-on biologic therapies for severe eosinophilic asthma (benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab) and severe allergic asthma (dupilumab, omalizumab) the main benefits are substantial reduction in severe exacerbations and reduced OCS exposure. No head-to-head studies are available, but typical eligibility criteria for each class, and predictors of good response, are found in the GINA pocket guide decision tree.

Maintenance OCS treatment should be avoided, wherever possible, because of its serious long-term side effects.

At follow-up, assess the response to any add-on treatment, stop ineffective treatments, and consider other options. For patients who respond to add-on therapy, reevaluate the need for other therapies every 3–4 months, but do not completely stop ICS.

Continue to optimize patient care in collaboration with primary care and consider the patient's social and emotional needs. Arrange multidisciplinary team care for severe asthma, if available. Invite patients with severe asthma to enroll in a registry or clinical trial, if available and relevant, to help fill evidence gaps, including comparison of biologic therapy options and positioning of bronchial thermoplasty.

2 METHODS

2.1 Protocol and registration

The study protocol was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42020207080). Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines were followed. The review aimed to assess adults and children with a diagnosis of asthma from 6 years of age treated with any nearly licenced or licenced biological therapies. Clinical outcomes examined included exacerbation rate, asthma control and reduction in the mean daily dose of OCS. Additional outcomes examined included forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and eosinophil count. Benralizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab and dupilumab were examined. Omalizumab was excluded from this analysis as it has been in routine use for over a decade, and the authors chose to focus on newer agents where healthcare professionals have less clinical experience.

2.2 Search strategy and study selection

Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) database (EBSCOhost) and ISI Web of Science (WOS) were systematically searched to identify eligible real‐world trials examining biologicals in asthma. The search strategy combined relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and plain text. The search strategies (Supporting Information S1) were adapted for each of the databases. Databases were searched from inception to 31 August 2020. Searches were restricted to articles published in English. Two independent researchers (D. C. and J. S.) then selected relevant records by a two‐step process. Initially, titles and abstracts of records were screened for eligibility. The full text of any eligible record was then acquired, and a detailed evaluation was performed. Any disagreements about inclusion were resolved by discussion and consensus, or by consultation with a third reviewer (G. R.). Studies were excluded if they were very small (included < 20 participants in total) to minimize bias, were animal studies, qualitative research, systematic reviews, narrative reviews, RCTs, editorials, conference abstracts, studies not relating to asthma, studies not relating to specified biologics, studies not in English or studies not focused on real‐life research. References were managed with Endnote Version X9 (Thomson Reuters) and Rayyan.

### Can early intervention in pediatric asthma improve long-term outcomes? A question that needs an answer [^7841eadd]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

The cytokine IL‐4 contributes to the type 2 inflammation associated with allergic response by inducing differentiation of T cells into Th2 lymphocytes and stimulating B cells to produce IgE. 70 IL‐4 and IL‐13 both activate the same receptor subunit IL‐4 receptor α, so there is a significant overlap in the function of these two cytokines. Dupilumab is an anti–IL‐4 receptor α monoclonal antibody under investigation in asthma that inhibits both IL‐4 and IL‐13 signaling by binding the receptor. Studies have shown that dupilumab reduces exacerbations in adult patients with moderate to severe asthma and elevated eosinophil counts (≥ 300 cells/µL). 71 In a larger subsequent study, dupilumab improved lung function in addition to reducing severe exacerbations in adult patients with persistent uncontrolled asthma regardless of eosinophil count. 72 The LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study investigated the efficacy of dupilumab in patients aged ≥ 12 years with uncontrolled asthma for 1 year of treatment. 73 These results were similar to the adult studies; dupilumab significantly reduced asthma exacerbation rates, improved lung function, and improved asthma control compared with placebo. Greater benefits were observed for patients with elevated baseline blood eosinophil counts (≥ 300 cells/µL) and FeNO (≥ 25 ppb). Dupilumab is also currently being evaluated in younger children aged 6‐ < 12 years with uncontrolled asthma in the VOYAGE study (Identifier: NCT02948959).

3.11 Lung Function Outcomes

Significant improvements in lung function were demonstrated with dupilumab treatment. It demonstrated improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) compared to the placebo. Its efficacy was strongly correlated with baseline FeNO levels. In patients with FeNO ≥ 50 ppb, a statistically significant increase in FEV1 (0.3 L) was observed, whereas those with FeNO 25 to < 50 ppb showed moderate improvements in FEV1 (0.15 L increase, statistically significant). Furthermore, alterations in pre‐ and post‐bronchodilator levels predicted FEV1(ppFEV1) and absolute FEV1 was an important outcome. (Figure 4).

Figure 4
Change from Baseline in ppFEV₁ over 52 Weeks in Patients with Type 2 Inflammatory Phenotype. [Color figure can be viewed at]

The LIBERTY ASTHMA VOYAGE Study specifically evaluated ppFEV1 and the pre‐bronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio. At week 52, dupilumab significantly improved the pre‐bronchodilator ppEFV1 in patients with 1, 2, or ≥ three prior exacerbation episodes across most groups by baseline type 2 biomarker levels compared with placebo.

An improvement in QoL was observed among dupilumab‐treated patients and caregivers. This was measured using the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ‐IA), which measures the impact of asthma on daily life and well‐being in children. Another study utilized the Asthma Control Questionnaire 7‐item version Interviewer‐Administered (ACQ‐7 IA) and revealed that dupilumab was superior to placebo in managing asthma, resulting in better QoL.

Exacerbation of asthma and the need for emergency visits or hospitalization were evaluated in patients treated with dupilumab. The study revealed that dupilumab, compared with placebo, significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and emergency needs, reflecting an improvement in QoL. Safety Outcomes.

VENTURE

VENTURE was a 24-week oral corticosteroid-reduction study in 210 adult and pediatric subjects 15 years of age and older with asthma who required daily oral corticosteroids in addition to regular use of high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller. After optimizing the OCS dose during the screening period, subjects received 300 mg DUPIXENT (N = 103) or placebo (N = 107) once Q2W for 24 weeks following an initial dose of 600 mg or placebo. Subjects continued to receive their existing asthma medicine during the study; however, their OCS dose was reduced every 4 weeks during the OCS reduction phase (Week 4–20), as long as asthma control was maintained. The primary endpoint was the percent reduction of oral corticosteroid dose at Weeks 20 to 24 compared with the baseline dose, while maintaining asthma control in the overall population (unrestricted by minimum baseline blood eosinophils count). Additional secondary endpoints included the annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during treatment period and responder rate in the ACQ-5 and AQLQ(S) scores.

The demographics and baseline characteristics of these 3 trials are provided in Table 22 below.

### Dupilumab sustains efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe type 2 asthma regardless of inhaled corticosteroids dose [^27403cd8]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody, blocks the shared receptor component for interleukins-4/13, key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation. The TRAVERSE (NCT02134028) open-label extension study demonstrated the long-term safety and efficacy of dupilumab in patients ≥ 12years who completed a previous dupilumab asthma study. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in the parent studies. Here, we assess whether dupilumab sustains long-term efficacy in patients regardless of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose at parent study baseline (PSBL).

Methods

Patients from phase 2b (NCT01854047) or phase 3 (QUEST; NCT02414854) studies receiving high- or medium-dose ICS at PSBL and enrolled in TRAVERSE were included. We analyzed unadjusted annualized severe exacerbation rates, change from PSBL in pre-bronchodilator (BD) forced expiratory volume in 1second (FEV 1), 5-item asthma control questionnaire, and type 2 biomarkers in patients with type 2 asthma at baseline (blood eosinophils ≥ 150 cells/μL or fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO] ≥ 25ppb), and subgroups defined by baseline blood eosinophils or FeNO.

Results

Of patients with type 2 asthma (n = 1666), 891 (53.5%) were receiving high-dose ICS at PSBL. In this subgroup, unadjusted exacerbation rates for dupilumab versus placebo were 0.517 versus 1.883 (phase 2b) and 0.571 versus 1.300 (QUEST) over the parent study (52weeks) and remained low throughout TRAVERSE (0.313–0.494). Improvements in pre-BD FEV 1 were sustained throughout TRAVERSE. Similar clinical efficacy was observed among patients receiving medium-dose ICS at PSBL and biomarker subgroups.

Conclusions

Dupilumab showed sustained efficacy for up to 3years in patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe type 2 asthma on high- or medium-dose ICS.

### Severe asthma clinical remission after biologic treatment with anti-IL4 / IL13: a real-life experience [^22c5a687]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-4/interleukin-13 monoclonal antibody, has shown efficacy in many aspects of Type-2 severe asthma management. Currently, we lack real-life studies addressing the achievment of clinical remission in patients treated with this biologic.

Materials and Methods

We performed a prospective study enrolling 18 patients with severe asthma treated with Dupilumab. We assessed main clinical, functional and biological severe asthma features at baseline (T0) and after a 1-year course of treatment (T12). Clinical remission was defined at T12 in patients without asthma exacerbations, no oral corticosteroid (OCS) use, ACT ≥ 20 and FEV1 improvement ≥ 100 mL from baseline.

Results

Among total population, 38.9% of patients achieved clinical remission at T12. Anti IL-4/IL-13 treatment significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and OCS use in the overall cohort, with a more pronounced ACT improvement in the remission group. Patients achieving clinical remission went through a step down of the inhalation therapy, suspending long-acting anti-muscarinics administration at T12.

Conclusions

Treatment with anti-IL4/IL13 can induce clinical remission in patients with T2 severe asthma.

### Dupilumab (Dupixent) [^fbda75b8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma

The safety and effectiveness of DUPIXENT for an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of DUPIXENT for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adult and pediatric patients 6 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Pediatric Subjects 12 to 17 Years of Age:

A total of 107 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe asthma were enrolled in QUEST and received either 200 mg (N = 21) or 300 mg (N = 18) DUPIXENT (or matching placebo either 200 mg [N = 34] or 300 mg [N = 34]) Q2W. Asthma exacerbations and lung function were assessed in both pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age and adults. For both the 200 mg and 300 mg Q2W doses, improvements in FEV1(LS mean change from baseline at Week 12) were observed (0.36 L and 0.27 L, respectively). For the 200 mg Q2W dose, subjects had a reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations that was consistent with adults. Dupilumab exposure was higher in pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age than that in adults at the respective dose level which was mainly accounted for by difference in body weight [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The adverse event profile in pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age was generally similar to the adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Controversies and opportunities in severe asthma [^a6fd2480]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite currently available treatments, many asthma patients remain inadequately controlled, but identifying distinct patient populations (phenotypes/endotypes) may optimize their management. This review discusses some of the controversies and opportunities for improved disease control in severe asthma.

Recent Findings

Currently approved anti-immunoglobulin E and anti-interleukin 5 biologics, which target specific pathways instead of using a 'one size fits all' strategy, are efficacious and well tolerated therapies for severe asthma. The appropriate use of these biologics, and of those in development (e.g., benralizumab and dupilumab), should be aided by further understanding of asthma phenotypes and endotypes, utilizing appropriate biomarkers. Oral corticosteroids are often added as maintenance therapy for patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, but their use is associated with significant adverse effects and should be considered a last option. The true cost of this therapy, including the cost of morbidities associated with its use, remains to be determined. Severe asthma in pediatrics poses a unique opportunity for possible prevention strategies and the potential for primary prevention. Although several avenues for primary prevention are being explored and are out of the scope of this review, we focus our discussion on the use of omalizumab, which has been recently explored in clinical trials.

Summary

Appropriate use of biologics in severe asthma should be supported by further understanding of biomarkers predicting response to targeted therapy. Because of their association with significant adverse effects, add-on oral corticosteroids should be considered a last treatment option for patients with uncontrolled severe asthma. Finally, severe asthma in pediatrics poses a unique opportunity for potential prevention strategies.

2 Methods

2.1 Study Design and Participants

Details of the VOYAGE study design have been described previoulsy. VOYAGE was a phase 3, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multinational study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate‐to‐severe type 2 asthma (baseline blood eosinophil counts ≥ 150 cells/μL or fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO] ≥ 20 parts per billion [ppb]). Patients were required to have a ≥ 3‐month history of receiving either medium‐dose ICS in combination with a second controller (long‐acting β2‐agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, long‐acting muscarinic antagonists, or methylxanthines), or high‐dose ICS alone or in combination with a second controller at a dose that had been stable for ≥ 1 month before screening. ICS categorization into medium and high doses was based on GINA 2015 guidelines. Eligible children were randomized 2:1 to receive add‐on dupilumab 100/200 mg (by body weight ≤ 30 kg/ > 30 kg) q2w for 52 weeks or volume‐matched placebo q2w. The 2:1 ratio ensured adequate representation in the dupilumab group for key secondary efficacy analyses. This design, informed by the QUEST study, also helped incentivize enrollment by increasing the chance of receiving active treatment. Sample size calculations supported this approach: in patients with type 2 asthma, the VOYAGE study had 94% power to detect a 54% reduction in the annualized rate of severe exacerbations with a two‐sided α = 0.05. The design met rigorous regulatory evaluation globally. Background ICS‐containing medication was continued at the same dosing level. The primary outcome was the adjusted annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations during the 52‐week treatment period, and the key secondary endpoint was change from baseline at Week 12 in pre‐bronchodilator ppFEV 1.

3.4 Change from baseline in‐5 scores

In both the type 2–150/25 and type 2–300/25 groups, treatment with dupilumab in non‐exacerbators resulted in significantly greater improvements in ACQ‐5 scores vs placebo from Week 2, and these improvements were sustained through Week 52 (LSMD vs placebo p < .0001 at all time points) (Figure 5). In exacerbators in the type 2–150/25 and type 2–300/25 groups, treatment with dupilumab resulted in greater improvements in ACQ‐5 scores vs placebo from Week 2; however, the LSMD vs placebo was only significant at some time points (Figure 5).

Similarly, in the overall ITT population of QUEST, consistent improvements in asthma control were observed for patients with high‐dose ICS at baseline (LS mean difference from baseline [95% CI] vs placebo at Week 24: −0.31 [−0.51 to −0.11; P = 0.002] and −0.13 [−0.33 to 0.07; P = 0.21], respectively; Week 52: −0.34 [−0.54 to −0.14; P = 0.0009] and −0.15 [−0.35 to 0.05; P = 0.14], respectively; Figure S5) and in subgroups stratified by baseline eosinophils or FeNO (Figure 3). This was also the case in patients requiring medium‐dose ICS at baseline (LS mean difference from baseline [95% CI] vs placebo at Week 24: −0.40 [−0.59 to −0.22; P = 0.0001] and −0.27 [−0.45 to −0.09; P = 0.003], respectively; Week 52: −0.44 [−0.63 to −0.24; P < .0001] and −0.29 [−0.48 to −0.10; P = 0.002], respectively; Figure S5) and in the subgroups stratified by baseline eosinophils or FeNO (Figure S6).

### Long-term safety and efficacy of dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma (TRAVERSE): an open-label extension study [^22b5b37d]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Background

Clinical trials have shown treatment benefits of dupilumab in patients with uncontrolled asthma for up to 1 year. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma, as data for extended treatment with dupilumab beyond 1 year are not available.

Methods

TRAVERSE was an open-label extension study in 362 hospitals and clinical centres across 27 countries that assessed the safety and efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks up to 96 weeks in adults and adolescents (aged 12–84 years) with moderate-to-severe or oral-corticosteroid-dependent severe asthma who had completed a previous dupilumab asthma study (phase 2A EXPEDITION, phase 2B DRI [P2b], phase 3 QUEST, or VENTURE). The primary endpoint was the number and percentage of patients with any treatment-emergent adverse events. Secondary endpoints included annualised exacerbation rate (AER) over the treatment period and change from parent study baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV 1, the five-item asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-5), the asthma quality of life questionnaire (AQLQ), type 2 biomarkers (blood eosinophils and serum total IgE), and anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Statistical analyses were descriptive. We report safety in all enrolled patients, and efficacy in patients with non-oral-corticosteroid-dependent asthma and in subgroups, including patients with a type 2 inflammatory phenotype who received 148 weeks of treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02134028.

Findings

Between Aug 5, 2014, and Oct 11, 2019, of 2302 patients assessed for eligibility, 2282 adults and adolescents were enrolled (median age 50 years, 62.1% female and 37.9% male). Safety during TRAVERSE was consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile. The proportion of patients reporting treatment-emergent adverse events throughout the study duration was similar to that observed in the parent studies and ranged from 76.3% to 94.7%. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were nasopharyngitis (17.5–25.9%), injection-site erythema (2.2–23.4%), and bronchitis (9.3–19.0%). Serious asthma exacerbations (0.5–3.6%) and pneumonia (0.7–2.7%) were the most frequently reported serious adverse events. There were four treatment-emergent adverse events leading to death. Efficacy during TRAVERSE was also consistent with the results of parent studies. In patients who were non-oral-corticosteroid-dependent, AER remained low (0.277–0.327) across parent study and treatment groups, pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 improvements were sustained to the end of treatment at week 96 (mean changes from parent study baseline ranged from 0.22 L [SD 0.44] to 0.33 L [0.44] across parent study and treatment groups), and improvements in ACQ-5 and AQLQ scores were sustained to the last timepoint assessed at week 48. Rapid improvements were observed in pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 and sustained improvements were seen in all outcome measures for patients given dupilumab who previously received placebo in parent studies; further improvements in AER, asthma control, and health-related quality of life were observed in patients who continued receiving dupilumab. Blood eosinophils and serum total IgE decreased progressively. ADA status had no effect on safety or efficacy. In the subgroup of patients with a type 2 inflammatory phenotype followed-up for 148 weeks, AER decreased progressively, and initial lung function improvements were sustained over 148 weeks.

Interpretation

Data show that safety and efficacy of dupilumab in adult and adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe asthma are sustained when treatment is extended up to 148 weeks. These findings therefore support the long-term use of dupilumab in this patient population.

4 DISCUSSION

In this analysis of data from the pivotal phase 2b and phase 3 LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST studies, dupilumab 200 and 300 mg q2w vs placebo reduced severe exacerbation rates and improved FEV 1 (L), asthma control (ACQ‐5), and rate of responders (ACQ improvement of MCID ≥ 0.5) in patients with uncontrolled, type 2‐high persistent or moderate‐to‐severe asthma taking high‐dose ICS at baseline. Improvements were observed across each of the subgroups as early as the first time point assessed and were sustained until treatment end in both studies.

There are currently 5 biologic add‐on treatments for patients with uncontrolled severe asthma that target underlying type 2 inflammatory processes: dupilumab, benralizumab, reslizumab, mepolizumab, and omalizumab. As previously outlined, dupilumab blocks the shared receptor component for IL‐4/IL‐13, key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation. 14, 15, 16, 17 It is approved in the EU 26 as add‐on maintenance treatment in patients aged ≥ 12 years with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised FeNO levels who are inadequately controlled with a high‐dose ICS plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. It is also approved in the USA 27 and other countries 28 as an add‐on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate‐to‐severe asthma aged ≥ 12 years with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid‐dependent asthma. 19, 20, 29 Benralizumab, reslizumab, and mepolizumab are monoclonal antibodies targeting IL‐5, a key component in eosinophil activation, proliferation, and degranulation. Benralizumab binds the alpha chain of the IL‐5 (IL‐5α) eosinophil cell surface receptor, blocking IL‐5 binding and has been evaluated in phase 3 studies in patients ≥ 12 years. 30 Mepolizumab and reslizumab bind directly to IL‐5, which in turn blocks binding with IL‐5α. 31, 32 Mepolizumab has been evaluated in patients aged ≥ 6 years and reslizumab in patients ≥ 18 years. Omalizumab, an anti‐IgE monoclonal antibody that has been evaluated in patients ≥ 6 years, binds IgE and inhibits basophil and mast cell release of proinflammatory mediators. 33

### Efficacy of dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma and persistent airflow obstruction [^86503e8d]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The 52-week, phase 3 LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study (NCT02414854) in patients aged above or equal to 12 years with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma demonstrated the efficacy and safety of dupilumab 200 mg and 300 mg every 2 weeks vs matched placebo.

Objective

To assess whether dupilumab improves clinical outcomes in QUEST patients with persistent airflow obstruction (PAO) defined as post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio less than 0.7 at baseline.

Methods

End points were annualized rate of severe exacerbations, pre and post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second over time, proportion achieving reversal of PAO, and quality of life. Efficacy was evaluated in patients with or without PAO at baseline in subpopulations with eosinophils ≥ 150 cells/µL or fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) ≥ 25 ppb or eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/µL and FeNO ≥ 25 ppb.

Results

Of 1902 patients enrolled in QUEST, 1039 (55%) had PAO at baseline. Dupilumab vs placebo rapidly and significantly improved lung function in patients with PAO and elevated type 2 inflammatory biomarkers at baseline. Dupilumab improved probability of reversing airflow obstruction (hazard ratio vs placebo 1.616 [95% confidence interval, 1.272–2.052] and 1.813 [1.291–2.546]; both P < .001) and significantly reduced severe exacerbations by 69% (relative risk, 0.411; 95% confidence interval [0.327–0.516]; P < .0001) and by 75% (0.252 [0.178–0.356]; P < .0001) in patients with PAO with eosinophils ≥ 150 cells/µL or FeNO ≥ 25 ppb and eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/µL and FeNO ≥ 25 ppb, respectively. Similar results were observed in patient subgroups without PAO.

Conclusion

In patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma, treatment with dupilumab facilitates reversal of PAO status and improves clinical outcomes.

### Dupilumab reduced impact of severe exacerbations on lung function in patients with moderate-to-severe type 2 asthma [^9aa2a475]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Severe asthma exacerbations increase the risk of accelerated lung function decline. This analysis examined the effect of dupilumab on forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) in patients with moderate‐to‐severe asthma and elevated type 2 biomarkers from phase 3 LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST (NCT02414854).

Methods

Changes from baseline in pre‐ and post‐bronchodilator (BD) FEV 1 and 5‐item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ‐5) scores were assessed in patients with elevated type 2 biomarkers at baseline (type 2–150/25: eosinophils ≥ 150 cells/μl and/or fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO] ≥ 25 ppb; type 2–300/25: eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/μl and/or FeNO ≥ 25 ppb), stratified as exacerbators (≥ 1 severe exacerbation during the study) or non‐exacerbators.

Results

In exacerbators and non‐exacerbators, dupilumab increased pre‐BD FEV 1 by Week 2 vs placebo; differences were maintained to Week 52 (type 2–150/25: LS mean difference (LSMD) vs placebo: 0.17 L (95% CI: 0.10–0.24) and 0.17 L (0.12–0.23); type 2–300/25: 0.22 L (0.13–0.30) and 0.21 L (0.15–0.28)), in exacerbators and non‐exacerbators, respectively (p < .0001). Similar trends were seen for post‐BD FEV 1. Dupilumab vs placebo also showed significantly greater improvements in post‐BD FEV 1 0–42 days after first severe exacerbation in type 2–150/25 (LSMD vs placebo: 0.13 L [0.06–0.20]; p = .006) and type 2–300/25 (0.14 L [0.06–0.22]; p = .001) patients. ACQ‐5 improvements were greater with dupilumab vs placebo in both groups.

Conclusion

Dupilumab treatment led to improvements in lung function independent of exacerbations and appeared to reduce the impact of exacerbations on lung function in patients who experienced a severe exacerbation during the study.

### Head-to-head comparison of biologic efficacy in asthma: what have we learned? [^5d878e54]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

We performed an in-depth appraisal of indirect head-to-head comparisons of biologics approved for asthma, including anti-IL5/5Rα (mepolizumab, benralizumab), anti-IL4Rα (dupilumab), anti-TSLP (tezepelumab) and anti-IgE (omalizumab), which was neither a systematic review nor a meta-analysis. A crude evaluation of 95% CI's for rate ratios which excluded unity revealed greater overall reductions in annualised exacerbations with dupilumab versus either mepolizumab or benralizumab and also with tezepelumab versus benralizumab. Furthermore in patients with eosinophils ≥ 300/μL exacerbation rates were lower for tezepelumab, dupilumab and mepolizumab versus benralizumab; and with eosinophils < 150/μL for tezepelumab versus dupilumab. For lung function, no overall differences in FEV1 response were observed between drugs where there was considerable heterogeneity of overlapping 95% CI's. Dupilumab was superior to benralizumab for oscillometry-derived peripheral lung resistance and compliance, as well as for attenuation of mannitol airway hyperresponsiveness. There were no differences in asthma control or quality of life scores where the effect sizes were small, along with wide overlaps in 95% CI's. There is an unmet need for prospective pragmatic randomised controlled trials to directly compare biologics, especially to assess clinical remission in both type 2 high and low asthma patients. Real-life studies might also evaluate complete remission with different biologics to include outcomes such as inhaled corticosteroid sparing, small airways dysfunction using oscillometry, abolition of airway hyperresponsiveness and to assess mucus plugging and remodelling as wall thickening with imaging.

### Dupilumab induces long-term on-treatment clinical remission in patients with type 2 asthma [^21595670]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Remission is proposed as a multicomponent outcome for patients with severe asthma.

Objective

This post hoc analysis of QUEST (NCT02414854) and TRAVERSE (NCT02134028) evaluated whether dupilumab treatment leads to clinical asthma remission (≥ 12 months with no severe exacerbations, zero oral corticosteroid use, stabilized or improved lung function, patient-reported asthma control < 1.5) and assessed its durability in patients with uncontrolled, moderate to severe type 2 asthma (blood eosinophils ≥ 150 cells/μL or fractional exhaled nitric oxide ≥ 20 ppb at parent-study baseline) who are not receiving maintenance oral corticosteroids.

Methods

In QUEST, patients (aged ≥ 12 years) were randomized to dupilumab 200/300 mg or placebo every 2 weeks for 52 weeks. In TRAVERSE, all patients received dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks for up to 96 weeks. We assessed the proportion of patients meeting criteria for on-treatment clinical remission up to 48 weeks of TRAVERSE.

Results

At QUEST baseline, 1,040 patients receiving dupilumab and 544 taking placebo had type 2 asthma; of those, 842 (dupilumab/dupilumab) and 437 (placebo/dupilumab) enrolled in TRAVERSE. At QUEST week 52 (year 1), 37.2% of patients receiving dupilumab met clinical remission criteria, compared with 22.2% taking placebo (all P < .001). At week 48 of TRAVERSE (year 2 overall), 42.8% (dupilumab/dupilumab) and 33.4% (placebo/dupilumab) of patients met clinical remission criteria. Overall, 29.5% of patients in the dupilumab/dupilumab group met the criteria at both years 1 and 2.

Conclusions

Dupilumab treatment enabled approximately one third of patients with type 2 asthma to meet the multicomponent end point for on-treatment clinical asthma remission for up to 2 years.

Background

Several biologic agents have been approved for asthma treatment. However, previous comparative effectiveness studies have been indirect treatment comparisons or restricted in geographical scope.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of dupilumab versus mepolizumab and benralizumab in reducing asthma exacerbations among patients with asthma.

Methods

Data from the Global Collaborative Network of TriNetX were used. Patients aged ≥ 18 years who received dupilumab, mepolizumab, or benralizumab for asthma between November 1, 2018, and January 1, 2024, were included. The primary outcome was time to the first asthma exacerbation within the 1-year follow-up period. Two comparisons were performed: (1) dupilumab versus mepolizumab and (2) dupilumab versus benralizumab. Propensity score matching was used to balance covariates between the groups. The risk of asthma exacerbations was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on eosinophil counts (≥ 300, ≥ 150 to < 300, and < 150 cells/μL), the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and exacerbation history (0 and ≥ 1 events).

Results

Dupilumab was associated with a lower risk of asthma exacerbations compared with mepolizumab (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–0.76) and benralizumab (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67–0.82). Benefits of dupilumab were pronounced in patients with eosinophil counts ≥ 300 cells/μL, those with COPD, and those without an exacerbation history.

Conclusion

Dupilumab was associated with a decreased risk of asthma exacerbations compared with both mepolizumab and benralizumab among patients with asthma. Further research incorporating comprehensive biomarker data is needed to optimize biologic selection.

The development of multiple targeted biologic therapies over the past two decades has revolutionized the management of asthma. Currently, there are 6 monoclonal antibodies that target specific inflammatory mediators involved in the pathophysiology of asthma, and together, they provide the opportunity for personalized treatment options beyond bronchodilators and inhaled or systemic glucocorticoids in severe and difficult-to-control cases of asthma. These agents are the anti-IgE antibody omalizumab, the anti-IL-5 antibodies mepolizumab and reslizumab, the IL-5 receptor alpha antagonist benralizumab, the IL-4 receptor alpha antagonist dupilumab, and the anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin antibody tezepelumab.

3 RESULTS

In total, 1902 patients were included in the QUEST study, of whom 1519 patients were included in the analysis reported in this manuscript. All 1519 patients were included in the type 2–150/25 group, and 1219 were also included in the type 2–300/25 group. Baseline pre‐ and post‐BD FEV 1 and reversibility were higher in non‐exacerbators vs exacerbators in both type 2 subgroups (both subgroups — p < .0001 for pre‐BD and post‐BD FEV1; p < .05 for reversibility) (Table 1). Across treatment groups, a higher percentage of exacerbators were on high‐dose ICS at baseline (both subgroups — p < .0001). Similarly, the mean number of severe asthma exacerbations in the previous year was higher in patients in the exacerbator group (both subgroups — p ≤ .0001) and a higher percentage of exacerbator patients had ≥ 2 exacerbations in the year prior to the study (both subgroups — p ≤ .0001). No clear differences in baseline biomarkers were seen between exacerbators and non‐exacerbators. As reported previously, exacerbations in the previous year were less common in dupilumab‐treated patients than placebo‐treated patients.

3.3 Change from baseline inafter onset of the first exacerbation

Within the exacerbator population, significantly greater improvements from baseline in post‐BD FEV 1 were observed 0–42 days after the first severe exacerbation event in dupilumab‐ vs placebo‐treated patients with either type 2–150/25 (LSMD [95% CI] vs placebo: 0.13 L [0.06–0.20], p = .0006) or type 2–300/25 (0.14 L [0.06–0.22], p = .001) asthma (Figure 3). There was also a trend toward greater improvements from baseline in post‐BD FEV 1 measured at either 43–125 or 126–210 days after the first severe exacerbation event in dupilumab‐ vs placebo‐treated patients, although these were not statistically significant (Figure 3). Overall, the median durations between first severe exacerbation event and the latest available pre‐ and post‐BD FEV 1 data were similar in the placebo and dupilumab groups and for patients with type 2–150/25 and type 2–300/25 asthma (Figure 4A and B). Median duration between first severe exacerbation and pre‐BD FEV 1 data was 8 days (IQR: 1–15 days) for placebo and 9 days (3–15) for dupilumab, for both subgroups of patients. For type 2–150/25 patients, median duration between first severe exacerbation and post‐BD FEV 1 was 19 days (IQR: 7–54) in the placebo group and 23 days (IQR: 9–54) in the dupilumab group. Similar durations were observed in type 2–300/25 patients (18 days [IQR: 7–49] and 26 days [IQR: 9–54] for placebo‐ and dupilumab‐treated patients, respectively).

2.2 Study endpoints

Annualized severe exacerbation rates (defined as number of severe exacerbations per patient‐year), change from baseline in pre‐BD FEV 1 (L), and asthma control (using the patient‐reported 5‐item Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ‐5] 23) were assessed over the 24‐week (phase 2b study) and 52‐week (QUEST) treatment periods. A responder analysis of ACQ‐5 scores was conducted in which the proportion of patients with a response to treatment (responders) was defined as those with an improvement from baseline in ACQ‐5 score that reached or exceeded the threshold of the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.5. 24 In line with the primary analyses for these studies, patients with improvement from baseline of < 0.5 or with a missing value were considered as nonresponders for that time point.

2.3 Statistical analysis

Prespecified efficacy analyses were performed on subgroups of patients in the overall ITT population categorized by ICS controller requirement at baseline (adapted from GINA 2014 25; Table S1), and post hoc analyses, which further stratified the groups by baseline levels of blood eosinophils or FeNO. The subgroups examined were high‐dose ICS and eosinophils ≥ 150 cells/µL, high‐dose ICS and eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/µL, high‐dose ICS and FeNO ≥ 25 ppb, high‐dose ICS and eosinophils ≥ 150 cells/µL or FeNO ≥ 25 ppb, and high‐dose ICS ITT subgroups. The same analyses were also performed on equivalent subgroups for completeness and transparency in patients taking medium‐dose ICS. The ITT population was defined as all patients who were randomized, and data were analyzed according to the assigned intervention and whether an intervention was received. Results are presented separately for each study.

In both studies, the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations was analyzed using a negative binomial regression model. 19, 20, 22 Change from baseline in FEV 1 (L) and ACQ‐5 was analyzed using mixed‐effects models with repeated measures. Additional model details are provided in Appendix S1.

Descriptive statistics have been employed to present the data; a P value of < .05 for the comparison between each dupilumab dose and placebo (within each subgroup) was considered statistically significant.

### Efficacy of dupilumab on clinical outcomes in patients with asthma and perennial allergic rhinitis [^e6cc00fe]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Comorbid perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) or year-round aeroallergen sensitivity substantially contributes to disease burden in patients with asthma. Dupilumab blocks the shared receptor for interleukin (IL) 4 and IL-13, key drivers of type 2 inflammation that play important roles in asthma and PAR. In the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST trial (NCT02414854), dupilumab reduced severe asthma exacerbations and improved forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) in patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma, with greater efficacy observed in patients with elevated type 2 inflammatory biomarkers at baseline (blood eosinophils and fractional exhaled nitric oxide).

Objective

To assess dupilumab efficacy in LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST patients with comorbid PAR.

Methods

Severe asthma exacerbation rates, FEV 1, asthma control (5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire), rhinoconjunctivitis-specific health-related quality of life (Standardized Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire +12 scores), and type 2 inflammatory biomarkers during the 52-week treatment period were assessed.

Results

A total of 814 of the 1902 patients (42.8%) had comorbid PAR (defined as an allergic rhinitis history and ≥ 1 perennial aeroallergen specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) level ≥ 0.35 kU/L at baseline). Dupilumab, 200 and 300 mg every 2 weeks, vs placebo reduced severe exacerbations rates by 32.2% and 34.6% (P < .05 for both) and improved FEV 1 at week 12 by 0.14 L and 0.18 L (P < .01 for both); greater efficacy was observed in patients with elevated baseline blood eosinophil counts (≥ 300 cells/μL) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide. Dupilumab treatment also numerically improved the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire and Standardized Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire +12 scores and suppressed type 2 inflammatory biomarkers.

Conclusion

Dupilumab improved key asthma-related outcomes, asthma control, and rhinoconjunctivitis-specific health-related quality of life while suppressing type 2 inflammatory biomarkers and perennial allergen-specific IgE in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma and comorbid PAR, highlighting its dual inhibitory effects on IL-4 and IL-13 and its role in managing asthma and PAR.

### Dupilumab reduced impact of severe exacerbations on lung function in patients with moderate-to-severe type 2 asthma [^dbef53c5]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

3.1 Change in pre‐ and

Non‐exacerbators compared with exacerbators had significantly higher pre‐ and post‐BD FEV 1 at baseline (p < .0001), regardless of biomarker levels at baseline. Significantly greater increases in pre‐BD FEV 1 were seen in both exacerbators and non‐exacerbators for dupilumab vs placebo from Week 2 onwards. These differences were maintained through to Week 52 and were similar in patients included in the type 2–150/25 and type 2–300/25 groups. In patients with type 2–150/25 asthma, by Week 52, least squares mean differences (LSMD) (95% CI) for dupilumab vs placebo were 0.17 L (0.10–0.24) and 0.17 L (0.12–0.23) in exacerbators and non‐exacerbators, respectively (both p < .0001; Figure 1A). In patients with type 2–300/25 asthma, these differences were 0.22 L (0.13–0.30) and 0.21 L (0.15–0.28), respectively (both p < .0001; Figure 1B). It should be noted that whereas the LSMDs vs placebo were similar in exacerbators and non‐exacerbators, the absolute pre‐BD FEV 1 remained lower throughout the study in exacerbators compared with non‐exacerbators in both treatment groups. Similar trends were observed in post‐BD FEV 1, with significantly greater improvements in the dupilumab vs placebo groups by Week 2, sustained through to Week 52, irrespective of exacerbator status. In patients with type 2–150/25 asthma, by Week 52, LSMD (95% CI) vs placebo was 0.15 L (0.08–0.22) in exacerbators and 0.19 L (0.14–0.25) in non‐exacerbators (both p < .0001; Figure 2A). In patients with type 2–300/25 asthma, by Week 52, LSMD vs placebo was 0.17 L (0.09–0.24) in exacerbators and 0.24 L (0.18–0.30) in non‐exacerbators (both p < .0001; Figure 2B). As observed with pre‐BD FEV 1, absolute post‐BD FEV 1 remained lower throughout the study in exacerbators compared with non‐exacerbators, irrespective of baseline biomarkers or treatment group.

### Head-to-head comparison of biologic efficacy in asthma: what have we learned? [^1a5870e0]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

We performed an in‐depth appraisal of indirect head‐to‐head comparisons of biologics approved for asthma, including anti‐IL5/5Rα (mepolizumab, benralizumab), anti‐IL4Rα (dupilumab), anti‐TSLP (tezepelumab) and anti‐IgE (omalizumab), which was neither a systematic review nor a meta‐analysis. A crude evaluation of 95% CI's for rate ratios which excluded unity revealed greater overall reductions in annualised exacerbations with dupilumab versus either mepolizumab or benralizumab and also with tezepelumab versus benralizumab. Furthermore in patients with eosinophils ≥ 300/μL exacerbation rates were lower for tezepelumab, dupilumab and mepolizumab versus benralizumab; and with eosinophils < 150/μL for tezepelumab versus dupilumab. For lung function, no overall differences in FEV1 response were observed between drugs where there was considerable heterogeneity of overlapping 95% CI's. Dupilumab was superior to benralizumab for oscillometry‐derived peripheral lung resistance and compliance, as well as for attenuation of mannitol airway hyperresponsiveness. There were no differences in asthma control or quality of life scores where the effect sizes were small, along with wide overlaps in 95% CI's. There is an unmet need for prospective pragmatic randomised controlled trials to directly compare biologics, especially to assess clinical remission in both type 2 high and low asthma patients. Real‐life studies might also evaluate complete remission with different biologics to include outcomes such as inhaled corticosteroid sparing, small airways dysfunction using oscillometry, abolition of airway hyperresponsiveness and to assess mucus plugging and remodelling as wall thickening with imaging.

### Dupilumab efficacy and safety in latin American patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma: phase 3 LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study [^f386c0b4]. The Journal of Asthma (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

While advances in asthma care have been made in Latin America, there is still a large unmet need in patients with uncontrolled asthma. This post hoc analysis of the QUEST study assessed safety and efficacy of dupilumab in the subgroup of patients enrolled in Latin American countries with a type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype (blood eosinophils ≥ 150cells/µL or FeNO ≥ 25ppb).

Methods

LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST (NCT02414854) was a phase 3, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma. Eligible patients ≥ 12years of age were randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive 52weeks of add-on subcutaneous dupilumab 200 or 300mg every 2weeks or matched-volume placebos. Pre-specified co-primary efficacy endpoints were the annualized rate of severe exacerbations during the treatment period and the change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 at treatment week 12. Asthma control, changes in asthma biomarker levels, and dupilumab safety were also evaluated.

Results

530 (27.9% of the overall QUEST population; dupilumab: 353, placebo: 177) Latin-American patients were recruited; 420 (79.2%) had a type 2 inflammatory asthma phenotype. Dupilumab vs placebo reduced the annualized rate of severe exacerbations by 52.7% (P < 0.001) and increased pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 at week 12 by 0.15L (P < 0.001), in the type 2 population. Safety was consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile.

Conclusions

Consistent with the results in the overall population, dupilumab reduced the risk of severe asthma exacerbations and improved lung function in Latin American patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma and a type 2 phenotype.

### Efficacy and safety of treatment with biologicals (benralizumab, dupilumab and omalizumab) for severe allergic asthma: a systematic review for the EAACI guidelines-recommendations on the use of biologicals in severe asthma [^efa068d6]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

Allergic asthma is a frequent asthma phenotype. Both IgE and type 2 cytokines are increased, with some degree of overlap with other phenotypes. Systematic reviews assessed the efficacy and safety of benralizumab, dupilumab and omalizumab (alphabetical order) vs standard of care for patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched to identify RCTs and health economic evaluations, published in English. Critical and important asthma-related outcomes were evaluated. The risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence were assessed using GRADE. All three biologicals reduced with high certainty the annualized asthma exacerbation rate: benralizumab incidence rate ratios (IRR) 0.63 (95% CI 0.50–0.81); dupilumab IRR 0.58 (95%CI 0.47–0.73); and omalizumab IRR 0.56 (95%CI 0.42–0.73). Benralizumab and dupilumab improved asthma control with high certainty and omalizumab with moderate certainty; however, none reached the minimal important difference (MID). Both benralizumab and omalizumab improved QoL with high certainty, but only omalizumab reached the MID. Omalizumab enabled ICS dose reduction with high certainty. Benralizumab and omalizumab showed an increase in drug-related adverse events (AEs) with low to moderate certainty. All three biologicals had moderate certainty for an ICER/QALY value above the willingness to pay threshold. There was high certainty that in children 6–12 years old omalizumab decreased the annualized exacerbation rate [IRR 0.57 (95%CI 0.45–0.72)], improved QoL [relative risk 1.43 (95%CI 1.12–1.83)], reduced ICS [mean difference (MD) -0.45 (95% CI -0.58 to -0.32)] and rescue medication use [MD -0.41 (95%CI -0.66 to -0.15)].

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^1bb96700]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Appendix G biologic indications and monitoring detail steroid-sparing evidence, age-based approvals, and continuation of controllers. An oral steroid-sparing effect with benralizumab, mepolizumab, dupilumab, and reslizumab has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials in oral steroid–dependent patients; tezepelumab was not shown to reduce ICS dose while maintaining asthma control compared to placebo, and real-world studies with omalizumab have shown reduction in oral steroid maintenance doses. Omalizumab is indicated for moderate-to-severe persistent asthma in patients six years of age and older with a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen; mepolizumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab are indicated for severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype, with mepolizumab and benralizumab approved for those who are six years of age and older and reslizumab for those who are 18 years of age and older; dupilumab is indicated for moderate-to-severe asthma in those who are six years of age and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma; tezepelumab is indicated for severe asthma in those who are 12 years of age or older without regards to phenotype or biomarkers; and higher blood eosinophils at baseline is a predictor of a good asthma outcome to biologic therapy. When biologics are started, other controller treatments are continued. Do not discontinue ICS. A trial of at least 4 months is needed to assess initial response, with assessments including asthma symptom control, exacerbations, lung function, side effects to therapy, and patient satisfaction, and where applicable, effects on type 2 co-morbidities such as nasal polyps and atopic dermatitis should be assessed.

### Dupilumab and COVID-19: what should we expect? [^42dd9557]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with high morbidity and mortality. There are very limited data on the interference of immunomodulating drugs on the risk of infection and on the course of the disease. In particular, there are no current clinical data about the interference exerted by dupilumab, a biologic drugs blocking IL-4 and IL-13, used for adult atopic dermatitis. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is complex, characterized by an immune response mainly Th1/Th17. The hyper-activation of these cells may cause the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that may result in lung impairment. IL-4 and IL-13 are Th2 cytokines, thus being part of a pathway not considered implicated in host defense mechanism against viral infections. Indeed, viral infections, including respiratory infections, have not been reported as a significant adverse event in clinical trials. Furthermore, dupilumab has been proved to be efficacious also in exacerbations of asthma, and it is known that viral infections can worsen asthma. Therefore, the current data seem to suggest that treatment with dupilumab should not be stopped during COVID-19 pandemic. Obviously, a careful assessment is mandatory for each individual patient and further studies are necessary to characterize the immunologic responses in COVID-19.
