## Question

Buldging disc

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about bulging discs, including definitions, prevalence, natural history, diagnostic approach, and treatment options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise terminology and classification to avoid conflating bulging with herniation. Then, I should verify prevalence in asymptomatic individuals to contextualize imaging. Next, I will examine natural history and spontaneous regression. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, especially when to image and how to correlate findings. Finally, I will review treatment pathways, including conservative care, injections, minimally invasive options, and surgery, and close with special scenarios and a practical decision framework.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislabel the pathology. A disc bulge is a diffuse, circumferential extension of the annulus beyond the vertebral endplates, typically with the annulus intact, whereas a herniation is a focal displacement of nucleus pulposus through the annulus; importantly, bulges are very common in asymptomatic people and are not synonymous with herniation or nerve root compression, so I need to be careful not to overcall them as pathologic drivers of pain [^9465067b] [^1b139daf].

> Wait, let me verify prevalence in asymptomatic individuals before attributing symptoms to a bulge. Multiple high-quality sources show that disc bulges and other "degenerative" MRI findings are extremely common in people without symptoms, with bulges seen in roughly half to two-thirds of asymptomatic adults and herniations in about a quarter, and these frequencies rise with age; this means imaging must be interpreted in strict clinical context to avoid the harm of overtreatment [^6678cd84] [^a0fe4b08] [^2a837fdc].

> I will now examine natural history and spontaneous regression, because this shapes counseling. Hold on, I should verify the hierarchy of regression by herniation type: sequestrated discs regress most often, extrusions moderately, protrusions less, and bulges least; specifically, bulges show only about a 13% regression rate, which is substantially lower than extrusions or sequestrations, reinforcing that bulges are more likely to persist and may be less likely to explain rapid clinical improvement compared with frank herniations [^3d9c0c80].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and when to image. I need to ensure I anchor on red flags and progressive deficits first; in the absence of these, routine imaging for uncomplicated low back pain is discouraged because it does not improve outcomes and can drive unnecessary procedures, whereas MRI is appropriate when symptoms persist beyond 6–8 weeks despite conservative care or when radiculopathy is suspected and will change management; when I do image, I must correlate MRI with the clinical syndrome to avoid misattribution of pain to incidental bulges [^6678cd84] [^5a850882] [^1fb03339].

> Let me consider conservative management, since most patients improve without surgery. I should confirm that first-line care includes NSAIDs, activity as tolerated, and structured physical therapy; evidence-based guidelines support nonoperative care as the initial approach for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy, and although high-quality evidence for exercise alone is mixed, it remains a reasonable component within a multimodal plan, with the caveat that structured exercise may be more impactful when symptoms are mild to moderate rather than severe [^cdb0e00b] [^9bcb2d47] [^e9d47630].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of epidural steroid injections. ESIs can provide short-term relief of radicular pain and may delay surgery, but benefits are transient and do not reliably reduce long-term surgery rates; thus, they are best viewed as a bridge or diagnostic adjunct in select cases rather than disease-modifying therapy, and I need to counsel patients accordingly [^332c249d] [^09dd536a].

> I need to check minimally invasive options for contained herniations that fail conservative care. Percutaneous decompression techniques such as nucleoplasty can reduce intradiscal pressure and have reported success rates around 75–94% in carefully selected patients with contained herniations and preserved disc height; however, evidence quality varies and patient selection is critical, so I should confirm concordant symptoms and appropriate imaging before proceeding [^adbb4c1a] [^47b73af1].

> But wait, what if the clinical picture is dominated by neurogenic claudication from central canal stenosis rather than a discrete herniation. In that scenario, I should consider whether percutaneous lumbar decompression (MILD) is indicated; randomized data suggest MILD can outperform epidural injections for neurogenic claudication due to ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and interestingly, comorbid disc bulging has been associated with better response, which cautions against reflexively excluding patients with bulges on imaging [^ab72d87d] [^4ad627a4].

> Next, I should review surgical indications and expected outcomes. Surgery is generally reserved for persistent, function-limiting radiculopathy beyond about 6 weeks despite appropriate conservative care, or for progressive neurologic deficits; discectomy provides faster relief than nonoperative care but long-term outcomes converge, and cost-effectiveness is favorable in appropriately selected patients; I should double-check that fusion is not routinely indicated for isolated herniation with radiculopathy, as evidence does not show superiority over decompression alone in this context [^f3ee1c55] [^6f3d016a] [^92d2cfe2].

> Let me reconsider the special case of a bulge contributing to spinal stenosis, because I initially thought bulges alone rarely warrant surgery; however, a recent retrospective analysis suggests that greater disc bulge dimensions independently predict revision surgery after decompression for lumbar spinal stenosis, implying that unrecognized or undertreated bulge-related compression may predispose to persistent symptoms and reoperation; this means I should scrutinize preoperative imaging for bulge extent and integrate that into surgical planning rather than dismiss it as benign [^ffe8fafe].

> I should confirm a practical decision framework to tie this together. First, screen for red flags and progressive neurologic deficits; if present, expedite imaging and surgical consultation. Second, in the absence of red flags, manage conservatively for 6–8 weeks with education, activity, NSAIDs, and structured therapy. Third, if symptoms persist or worsen, obtain MRI and correlate with the clinical syndrome. Fourth, consider ESIs as a short-term bridge in radiculopathy. Fifth, for refractory cases with concordant imaging, discuss discectomy with transparent counseling about benefits, risks, and recovery. Sixth, reserve minimally invasive decompression for carefully selected contained herniations or consider MILD when stenosis predominates, recognizing evolving evidence and patient-specific factors [^5a850882] [^1fb03339] [^332c249d] [^adbb4c1a] [^ab72d87d].

> In summary, I need to ensure I do not overinterpret a bulging disc on MRI as the cause of pain; bulges are common in asymptomatic people, regress infrequently, and often coexist with other pain generators, so management should be driven by clinical correlation, symptom severity, and functional impairment, with conservative care first and escalation only when indicated and aligned with patient goals [^6678cd84] [^3d9c0c80] [^cdb0e00b].

A bulging disc is a **diffuse extension of the disc beyond the vertebral margins** [^9465067b], often due to age-related degeneration or mechanical stress, and is distinct from a herniation [^1b139daf]. Most bulging discs are **asymptomatic** [^a0fe4b08] and found incidentally on MRI [^6678cd84]; when symptoms occur, they are typically axial back pain or mild radiculopathy from nerve irritation or stenosis [^1cf6a973]. Conservative care — NSAIDs, physical therapy, and activity modification — is first-line [^eb5a680a]; surgery is reserved for persistent, severe, or progressive neurologic deficits [^933e13e0]. Prognosis is **generally favorable** [^d50b179e], with most patients improving over weeks to months [^5a850882]; however, bulges rarely regress spontaneously [^3d9c0c80], and recurrence is possible without lifestyle changes.

---

## Pathophysiology and causes

Bulging discs reflect **age-related degeneration** [^23b07658] with loss of hydration and elasticity, reducing disc height and causing the annulus to bulge circumferentially [^9465067b]. Mechanical stress from repetitive loading, poor posture, or obesity accelerates this process [^5f36d9a6]. Unlike herniation, the annulus remains intact, so there is no free fragment to compress nerves [^9465067b].

---

## Clinical symptoms

Many bulging discs are **asymptomatic** [^a0fe4b08]; when symptomatic, features include:

- **Axial back pain**: Midline, mechanical, worsened by flexion or prolonged sitting [^70851a6d].
- **Radiculopathy**: Mild leg pain, numbness, or weakness from nerve root irritation or foraminal stenosis [^1cf6a973].
- **Neurogenic claudication**: From central canal or lateral recess stenosis, worsened by walking and relieved by flexion [^07780db0].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **History and examination**: Localize pain, identify neurologic deficits, and exclude red flags [^cb3459f5].
- **MRI**: Gold standard to define bulge extent, canal/foraminal compromise, and exclude herniation or other pathology [^1b139daf].
- **CT myelography**: Alternative when MRI is contraindicated or inconclusive [^1fb03339].
- **Plain radiographs**: Limited value; may show disc space narrowing or osteophytes [^f17c4ada].

---

## Treatment options

### Conservative management

Conservative care is **first-line** [^1c6ea42e] and effective for most patients:

- **NSAIDs**: Reduce pain and inflammation [^eb5a680a].
- **Physical therapy**: Core strengthening, flexibility, and posture training [^e9d47630].
- **Activity modification**: Avoid heavy lifting, prolonged sitting, and poor ergonomics [^notfound].
- **Epidural steroid injections**: Short-term relief for radicular symptoms [^332c249d].

---

### Surgical intervention

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases** with persistent, severe, or progressive neurologic deficits despite 6–12 weeks of conservative care [^933e13e0]. Options include microdiscectomy, laminectomy, or minimally invasive decompression, selected based on anatomy and symptoms [^933e13e0].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **generally favorable** [^d50b179e]; most patients improve over weeks to months with conservative care [^5a850882]. Bulges rarely regress spontaneously [^3d9c0c80], and recurrence is possible without ongoing rehabilitation and lifestyle changes.

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **core strengthening**, weight control, ergonomic workstations, and avoiding tobacco [^notfound]. Patient education on posture, lifting mechanics, and activity pacing reduces recurrence risk.

---

A bulging disc is a **common, often incidental** finding [^a0fe4b08] that can cause axial pain or mild radiculopathy; most patients improve with conservative care, and surgery is reserved for persistent or progressive neurologic deficits.

### Contemporary management of symptomatic lumbar disc herniations [^e225b8bf]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Lumbar disc herniations are common clinical entities that may cause lumbar-related symptoms. The spectrum of treatment options is geared toward a patient's clinical presentation and ranges from nothing to surgical intervention. Many lumbar disc herniations cause no significant symptoms. In studies of asymptomatic individuals who have never experienced lumbar-related symptoms, 30% have been reported to have major abnormality on magnetic resonance imaging. The mainstay of treatment of patients with symptomatic disc herniations is accepted to be nonoperative (as long as there are no acute or progressive neurologic deficits); this includes medications, physical therapy, and potentially lumbar injection. For patients with symptomatic disc herniations who fail to respond appropriately to conservative measures, surgical intervention may be considered. For this population, lumbar discectomy is considered to be a good option.

Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation (NASS) define how study quality informs recommendation wording and strength. Levels of evidence range from Level I (high quality randomized controlled trial) to Level V (expert consensus), and levels are assigned to studies prior to developing recommendations; recommendations are then graded based on the level of evidence. Grades of Recommendation pair evidence tiers with language: A uses Level I studies with consistent findings and the recommendation wording "is recommended"; B uses Level II or III studies with consistent findings and the wording "suggest"; C uses Level IV or V studies and indicates a test or intervention "may be considered" or "is an option"; I denotes insufficient or conflicting evidence and states that "there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against". The guideline notes that significant shortcomings in study execution can downgrade a study's potential level of evidence.

### Management of symptomatic lumbar degenerative disk disease [^eb5a680a]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

Symptomatic lumbar degenerative disk disease, or discogenic back pain, is difficult to treat. Patients often report transverse low back pain that radiates into the sacroiliac joints. Radicular or claudicatory symptoms are generally absent unless there is concomitant nerve compression. Physical examination findings are often unremarkable. Radiographic examination may reveal disk space narrowing, end-plate sclerosis, or vacuum phenomenon in the disk; magnetic resonance imaging is useful for revealing hydration of the disk, annular bulging, or lumbar spine end-plate (Modic) changes in the adjacent vertebral bodies. The use of diskography as a confirmatory study remains controversial. Recent prospective, randomized trials and meta-analyses of the literature have helped expand what is known about degenerative disk disease. In most patients with low back pain, symptoms resolve without surgical intervention; physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the cornerstones of nonsurgical treatment. Intradiskal electrothermal treatment has not been shown to be effective, and arthrodesis remains controversial for the treatment of discogenic back pain. Nucleus replacement and motion-sparing technology are too new to have demonstrated long-term data regarding their efficacy.

Indications and Contraindications

Lumbar discectomy, in both its minimally invasive and more traditional open forms, is a procedure which targets the removal of a portion of an intervertebral lumbar disc which is herniated through the disc annulus or causing the annulus to bulge, ultimately leading to pressure on the traversing and/or exiting nerve root at this level. In the traditional open procedure, a laminotomy is usually created at the more cranial level of the disc herniation. The thecal sac and traversing nerve root are then retracted medially, and the herniated or bulging disc fragment is removed under microscopic magnification. In the more minimally invasive techniques, bony removal is often limited, if necessary at all. Visualization is often provided by an endoscope in an effort to limit the opening needed to perform such a procedure.

Lumbar discectomy is indicated in the following situations:
Diagnostic testing (MRI, CT myelogram) which shows a herniated/bulging lumbar disc causing compression of the traversing nerve root, exiting nerve root or cauda equina
Significant pain, weakness, numbness or paresthesias in an expected distribution based on the compressed nerve root
Radiculopathy symptoms that are more significant than LBP symptoms
Symptoms have not improved with upwards of 6 weeks of conservative management (NSAIDs, oral steroids, epidural steroid injections, physical therapy, etc.)
Symptoms consistent with cauda equina syndrome (bilateral leg weakness, sensory disturbances in the genital and saddle region, loss of bowel/bladder control)

While multiple different interventions are possible with regard to lumbar discectomy, all of these procedures and devices have received approval from the FDA. Regarding contraindications to lumbar discectomy, the most significant is related to spinal instability. In patients with evidence of underlying instability, decompression alone can lead to worsening of this instability and further morbidity. Other contraindications which have been noted in the literature include calcified discs, painless weakness and pyogenic spondylodiscitis or other severe disc space infections. Specifically, endoscopic discectomy can be contraindicated in the setting of cauda equina syndrome and severe fibrotic adhesions. Also, regarding endoscopic discectomy, tubular discectomy and other percutaneous techniques, surgeon experience and level of training must be considered prior to proceeding.

Treatment

Conservative treatment is considered a first-line treatment for the majority of patients with degenerative spine disease, unless the disease presents with acute neurological symptoms such as myelopathy or cauda equine syndrome. When medical therapy fails, imaging and spinal surgery are considered as the next step of management. Depending on the prevalent degenerative pattern, different surgical approaches can be utilised. Patients with symptomatic disc herniations can benefit from microdiscectomy. If a degenerative process results in destabilisation and abnormal spinal motion, different types of surgical fusion can be used to stabilise the spine. Interbody fusion implants are widely used to restore disc height and support the anterior column. Spondylotic changes usually do not require surgery (Fig. 24).

Fig. 24
Surgical treatment options for degenerative changes. (a) Herniations. Herniations are often associated with pain and neurological symptoms and most commonly occur on the lumbar spine. Treatment options include conservative treatment if the herniation does not compress the nerves and surgical removal of the herniation if neural compression exists. (b) Spondylosis. Chronic longstanding disc degeneration results in slowly progressive mild-to-moderate disc space narrowing and gradual osteophyte formation without apparent disc displacement. Spondylosis is considered an adaptive reaction to stabilise motion in the presence of instability or a compensatory mechanism to limit the range of motion and prevent further degeneration. Altered disc biomechanics and narrowed intervertebral disc space subsequently lead to facet joint degeneration. This is probably the most favourable type of degeneration as it is essentially asymptomatic, may be seen at all levels of the spine and typically does not require treatment. (c) Disc collapse. Disc collapse leads to annular folding, anterior bulging of the flaval ligaments and posterior bulging of the posterior longitudinal ligament, with consequential narrowing of the central spinal canal. The decreasing disc height of the involved spinal segment leads to increased stiffness and may cause vertical degeneration of the adjacent vertebral segments. (d) Progressive structural failure of the disc to maintain the integrity of the functional spinal unit leads to segmental instability. This may progress to degenerative spondylolysthesis and require spinal instrumentation

Introduction

Low back pain is a multifactorial disease, and different treatment options are continuously discussed in the medical community. The choice of the best therapeutic approach for a patient heavily relies on the accurate identification of etiologic factors and symptoms. This applies in particular to the distinction between localized low back pain (lumbago) versus radicular pain. The latter typically follows the supply territory of a distinct nerve into the groin, the buttocks, or a lower limb. In the case of L4 to S3 nerve roots, the term sciatica is used for related symptoms of pain or paresthesia (numbness, burning, tingling sensation). Radicular pain is believed to be caused by nerve inflammation, sometimes induced by direct mechanical nerve compression, the most common cause being a bulging lumbar disc and/or spondylolisthesis. Lower limb radiculopathy is a considerable worldwide health problem, without gender predominance. It has a lifetime incidence of 10 to 40% that affects patients' quality of life, causes economic losses, and increases healthcare costs.

Lower back pain treatment follows a stepwise approach. The first step is to determine whether a motor deficit is present. Should this be the case, prompt surgical evaluation is indicated to precisely define its extent. In the absence of significant motor deficit, the second step usually involves patient education and adapted oral medication, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants. Other complementary second-line treatments include massages, physiotherapy, and acupuncture. Unlike lumbago care, the third step for radicular pain, if it lasts longer than 6–8 weeks, consists of lumbar or sacral nerve root infiltrations. These infiltrations provide pain relief and may also have a diagnostic purpose — the confirmation of a single affected nerve root — if surgery is required for the patient during the course of the disease. For inoperable patients, repeated infiltrations might even represent a final treatment option.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^b3dbec01]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Our primary objective was to develop a simple, understandable clinical algorithm that can serve as a foundation for physicians to confidently make objective decisions regarding the diagnosis, management and treatment of lumbar discogenic pain throughout the entire clinical course of the condition. In realizing and refining this algorithm, we utilized a modified Delphi methodology whereby a panel of 11 experts in this area were engaged to form a consensus around diagnostic components and characteristics, the full spectrum of treatment options as well as the temporal sequence of interventions with the objective of maximizing clinical benefit and efficiency of care. The algorithm development process was administrated and coordinated by one panel member who aggregated panel member responses. The progression was iterative, commencing with the establishment of the clinical definition of lumbar discogenic pain in June, 2023, followed by an in-person gathering of the expert panel in December, 2023 to further refine key clinical examination features and prioritize the range of interventions. Final input was solicited and collated from the panel members at pain society conferences in July and October, 2024.

Our proposed algorithm recommends a systematic rule set of diagnostic and treatment decisions for lumbar discogenic pain based on unambiguous alternatives and clear stopping rules. A decision tree approach was utilized with "either/or" choices at each branch or node in the algorithm which progresses logically in a temporal fashion (Figure 1). Actions and events are segregated into physical examination assessments, diagnostic procedures and corresponding treatment interventions. Diagnostic and clinical evaluation queries are represented in the algorithm as diamonds, with corresponding symptom severity grading and treatment options shown as rectangles.

Diagnostic and Treatment Algorithm for Lumbar Discogenic Pain.

Published validated standards were employed to grade symptom and radiographic severity as well as assessments of clinical change. Commensurate treatment choices were selected based on published discogenic pain-specific clinical practice guidelines and/or meta-analyses to support each option.

### Discogenic low back pain [^f492648f]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Most lumbar disk herniations improve over time with or without medical treatment. Disk herniations and annular tears may not be symptomatic and are shown to exist in patients without any symptoms. In some patients, chronic low back pain may result from the syndrome of internal disk disruption. Treatment of chronic pain of diskal cause can be challenging and have varying results in terms of success. The diagnosis, cause, and treatment options are reviewed in this article.

### Acute lumbar disk pain: navigating evaluation and treatment choices [^82398ddf]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute lumbar disk herniations are the most common cause of sciatica. After excluding emergent causes, such as cauda equina syndrome, epidural abscess, fracture, or malignancy, a six-week trial of conservative management is indicated. Patients should be advised to stay active. If symptoms persist after six weeks, or if there is worsening neurologic function, imaging and invasive procedures may be considered. Most patients with lumbar disk herniations improve over six weeks. Because there is no difference in outcomes between surgical and conservative treatment after two years, patient preference and the severity of the disability from the pain should be considered when choosing treatment modalities. If a disk herniation is identified that correlates with physical findings, surgical diskectomy may improve symptoms more quickly than continued conservative management. Epidural steroid injections can also provide short-term relief.

### Best practices for minimally invasive lumbar spinal stenosis treatment 2.0 (MIST): consensus guidance from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) [^1cf6a973]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Lateral Recess

The lateral recess (aka the subarticular zone) is the outermost region of the spinal canal that is bordered laterally by the pedicle, posteriorly by the superior articular facet and LF, and anteriorly by the vertebral body, endplate and disc margin. This region is considered stenotic when AP measurement is < 4 mm. Nerve root compression in the lateral recess is also another important qualitative parameter in the radiological assessment for lateral recess stenosis. Due to the close proximity within the canal, stenosis in this region can lead to symptoms of radiculopathy due to nerve root compression with or without NC and can have a bilateral or unilateral presentation.

Foraminal

The neuroforamen is formed by the interpedicular osseous opening in which each spinal nerve root exits the dural sac passing through the lateral recess. The anterior anatomic boundaries of the intervertebral foramen include the adjacent superior-inferior vertebral pedicles, posteroinferior margin of the superior vertebral body, the intervertebral disc, and the posterosuperior margin of the inferior vertebral body, and the posterior anatomic boundaries include the LF and the superior and inferior articular facets. This region has three anatomical zones: internal, intraforaminal and extraforaminal. Degenerative changes such as hypertrophy and bone spurs from facet joints and bulging or herniated discs often contribute to foraminal stenosis. The neuroforamen are considered stenotic based on reduced perineural fat and/or reduced foraminal dimensions on MRI. A height less than 15 mm and a posterior disc height of 4 mm or less are associated with significant nerve root compression. Lumbar foraminal stenosis has a reported prevalence of 8% to 11%. Symptoms of pure foraminal stenosis typically are due to neural compression or neural irritation from an inflammatory cascade with a dermatomal distribution. Although no clinical finding is specific enough to suggest foraminal stenosis, patients often present with radicular leg pain and limited lumbar range of motion, particularly with extension. Low back pain, particularly in the buttock region, is often associated with foraminal stenosis.

Multistructural

Multistructural narrowing involving the central, lateral recess, and neuroforamen is the most frequently encountered LSS in those > 60 years old. The narrowing typically has a trefoil or cloverleaf appearance on axial cross-sections, in which all three regions of the spinal canal are narrowed. Symptoms are a combination of the above with nonspecific physical examination findings.

The evidence for change

Evidence from randomised controlled trials has established that imaging does not improve clinical outcomes, and several observational studies have linked liberal imaging with greater work absence and unnecessary use of health services. Unnecessary LBP imaging has the potential for harm. Perhaps the most obvious of these harms is exposure to radiation from x rays and computed tomography. Harm is also possible if a clinician acts on incidental findings from any imaging method, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or if these findings are not appropriately explained to patients. For example, disc abnormalities such as bulging disc or degenerative disc disease are commonly seen on images but may not be the source of pain, as they are also seen on images in up to 97% of asymptomatic patients (table 1). Incidental findings may lead to further investigations, specialist referral, and more intensive treatment such as surgery, which limits access to those services for the patients who are in genuine need of such care. Incidental findings may also provoke worry or concern in patients from a labelling effect (possibly delaying recovery) if they fail to understand that these anomalies are common and benign.

Imaging and follow-up based on incidental findings affects the health system in terms of direct costs (such as cost of equipment, staff time to conduct the imaging, and time to interpret the image findings) and downstream costs (subsequent tests, referrals, and interventions, many of which are expensive and are of limited benefit for most patients with back pain). The downstream costs of imaging also affect patients and society due to indirect costs relating to out of pocket expenses for unnecessary interventions, as well as expenses related to lost work or household productivity. Two systematic reviews of six randomised controlled trials (1804 participants) both concluded that patients who received imaging without a clear clinical indication did not have improvements to pain, function, or quality of life compared with those who did not have imaging. Additionally, observational studies have found that those who received imaging when not indicated had greater use of health services such as injections and surgery and greater work absence than their counterparts who did not receive imaging. For example, a 2020 study of 405 965 US primary care patients found that those who had early MRI were more likely to undergo back surgery (1.48% v 0.12%) and take prescription opioids (35.1% v 28.6%), yet had higher pain score at 1-year follow-up (3.99 v 3.87) than those who did not get early MRI.

### Are "structural abnormalities" on magnetic resonance imaging a contraindication to the successful conservative treatment of chronic nonspecific low back pain? [^d2a61631]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective study.

Objective

To examine the association between structural abnormalities recorded on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and outcome after evidence-based conservative treatment in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain (LBP).

Summary Of Background Data

In most guidelines for the management of LBP, MRI is not recommended unless the diagnostic triage suggests serious spinal pathology or nerve root involvement for which surgical treatment is foreseen. This is because many structural changes seen on MRI appear to be as common in asymptomatic individuals as in people with LBP and are, therefore, considered of little value in either explaining the cause of pain or deciding the subsequent course of management. However, to our knowledge, no studies have assessed whether the presence of such MRI abnormalities influences the outcome of the conservative treatment that patients with chronic nonspecific LBP typically receive.

Methods

T2-weighted, 4-mm spin-echo MRI sequences of the lumbar spine were obtained from 53 patients with chronic nonspecific LBP before a 3-month program of exercise therapy. Disc degeneration, disc bulging, high intensity zones, and endplate/bone marrow changes were assessed for each lumbar segment. Back pain (average and worst) and disability (Roland Morris score) were assessed before and after therapy, and 12 months later, and the improvements were examined in relation to the presence or absence of baseline MRI "abnormalities".

Results

Eighty-nine percent of patients had severe disc degeneration (grade 4 or 5), 74% had disc bulging, 60% had high intensity zones, and 62% had endplate/bone marrow changes in at least 1 lumbar segment. Only 11% patients had none of these changes at any level. The MRI abnormalities showed only minimal association with baseline symptoms. In multivariate regression analyses, in which age, gender, and baseline symptoms were controlled for, only 1 significant association between the MRI variables and outcome was observed: the presence of a high intensity zone in any vertebral segment was associated with lower average pain at the 12-month follow-up (standardized beta -0.376, P = 0.006, 16.5% variance accounted for).

Conclusion

In the patient group examined, the presence of common "structural abnormalities" on MRI had no significant negative influence on the outcome after therapy.

### A pilot study for effectiveness of non-pharmacological versus pharmacological treatment strategies for lumbar disc herniation: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^6b3ccea9]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary and Secondary outcomes

The primary outcome of this study was the NRS of radiating leg pain. The NRS is a numeric pain scale for the objective representation of subjective pain felt by individual patients, and the intensity of pain over the past week was evaluated. The patient selects a number from 0 to 10 that best represents the current level of pain and discomfort (0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst pain and discomfort imaginable).

For secondary outcomes, the NRS score for LBP, Oswestry disability index (ODI), visual analog scale (VAS) for LBP and radiating pain, Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), patient global impression of change (PGIC), Short Form-12 Health Survey, version 2 (SF-12 v2),5-level European Quality of Life-5 dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) [9, 10, and credibility and expectancy were measured. All questionnaires used in this study were verified validity and reliability. Detailed descriptions for each outcome and timelines are presented in.

In addition, changes in the severity of disc herniation on MRI was investigated, and the pathological state of disc herniation was classified into a total of four types (desiccated or bulging; protrusion; extrusion; and sequestration or migration) for each of the baseline and Week 27 follow-up time points. Regardless of the level of the spine, if any of the levels had a corresponding finding, it was considered present; otherwise, it was absent.

Resource Utilization Measurements

In addition to the intervention conducted within the trial, the utilization of healthcare services related to LBP and radiating leg pain was surveyed at each visit of the participants. For the survey, a questionnaire that was separately developed for this purpose with structured questions to assess formal or informal medical costs, non-medical costs, time costs, and costs of productivity loss was used. Formal medical costs refer to costs incurred in using the services of healthcare providers, while informal medical costs include costs of purchasing healthy functional food and medical devices. Non-medical costs include costs incurred while using healthcare services, such as transportation costs, the time the patient spent, and fee of the paid caregiver. The cost of productivity loss refers to the cost of economic loss caused by (i) not being able to participate in labor or (ii) reduced work productivity owing to illness.

### How should we grade lumbar disc herniation and nerve root compression? A systematic review [^1b139daf]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

MRI is the gold standard for evaluating the relationship of disc material to soft tissue and neural structures. However, terminologies used to describe lumbar disc herniation and nerve root compression have always been a source of confusion. A clear understanding of lumbar disc terminology among clinicians, radiologists, and researchers is vital for patient care and future research.

Questions/Purposes

Through a systematic review of the literature, the purpose of this article is to describe lumbar disc terminology and comment on the reliability of various nomenclature systems and their application to clinical practice.

Methods

PubMed was used for our literature search using the following MeSH headings: "Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Intervertebral Disc Displacement" and "Lumbar Vertebrae" and terms "nomenclature" or "grading" or "classification". Ten papers evaluating lumbar disc herniation/nerve root compression using different grading criteria and providing information regarding intraobserver and interobserver agreement were identified.

Results

To date, the Combined Task Force (CTF) and van Rijn classification systems are the most reliable methods for describing lumbar disc herniation and nerve root compression, respectively. van Rijn dichotomized nerve roots from "definitely no root compression, possibly no root compression, indeterminate root compression, possible root compression, and definite root compression" into no root compression (first three categories) and root compression (last two categories). The CTF classification defines lumbar discs as normal, focal protrusion, broad-based protrusion, or extrusion. The CTF classification system excludes "disc bulges", which is a source of confusion and disagreement among many practitioners. This potentially accounts for its improved reliability compared with other proposed nomenclature systems.

Conclusions

The main issue in the management of patients with lumbar disc disease and nerve root compression is correlation of imaging findings with clinical presentation and symptomatology to guide treatment and intervention. Although it appears that the most commonly supported nomenclatures have strong interobserver reliability, the classification term "disc bulges" is a source of confusion and disagreement among many practitioners. Additional research should focus on the clinical application of the various nomenclatures.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^70851a6d]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There is renewed interest in the intervertebral disc as a target for treatments aimed at ameliorating lumbar discogenic pain by restoring and preserving the natural structure and function of this component of the vertebral motion segment.

Methods

Using a modified Delphi methodology involving a panel of 11 experts, we developed a simple, understandable clinical algorithm to serve as a foundation for objective decision making regarding the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar discogenic pain throughout the entire continuum of care. A decision tree approach was utilized with "either/or" choices at each branch or node in the algorithm. Clinical activities in this algorithm were divided into examination procedures and corresponding treatment interventions. Corresponding treatment options were designated based on published degenerative disc disease (DDD)-specific clinical practice guidelines and/or meta-analyses.

Results

This algorithm recommends a systematic rule set for discogenic pain diagnostic and treatment options. Initially, the presence of lumbar discogenic pain is confirmed via assessment of a series of clinical signs including axial midline back pain (≥ 4 of 10), pain with flexion, sitting intolerance, positive pain provocation with sustained hip flexion, and absence of motor/sensory/reflex changes. Radiographic severity of DDD is graded by modified Pfirrmann grade (1 to 8). Treatment options are stratified by DDD severity to include conservative management (grades 1 and 2), minimally-invasive intradiscal therapies (grades 3 to 7), and more invasive surgical procedures (grade 8). Recognizing that the management program for patients with lumbar discogenic pain can be highly personalized, the treatment options recommended by this algorithm should be considered general guidance.

Conclusion

The proposed algorithm offers an easy-to-use clinical tool for identifying, evaluating and treating patients with lumbar discogenic pain. The successful implementation of this algorithm involves an important interplay between advanced practice providers, interventional pain physicians and spine surgeons.

Disc displacement

Displacement of disc material beyond the limits of the intervertebral disc space may be diffuse (bulging) or focal herniation (protrusion, extrusion and extrusion with sequestration) (Fig. 9). On the axial plane, it may be anterior or posterior. Herniation can be classified as: central, paracentral, foraminal or extraforaminal. The herniation may migrate superiorly or inferiorly (Fig. 10).

Diffuse disc migration is the circumferential displacement of the annulus fibrosus.
Disc bulging. This occurs when intradiscal pressure remains high and the annulus fibrosus is intact and the height of the disc preserved. A rapid increase in intradiscal pressure in the setting of bulging may lead to the development of annular fissures and eventually result in herniation. Bulging is very often seen in asymptomatic individuals (Fig. 11 a, b).
Annular bulging (folding). Degeneration of the nucleous pulposus eventually leads to a marked drop in intradiscal pressure resulting in disc space narrowing or collapse with the vertebral bodies moving closer to one another. Increased vertical loading on the annulus fibrosus causes it to bulge or fold radially outward. Annular bulging (folding) may be symptomatic as severe disc space narrowing also results in decreased size of the intervertebral foraminae, which is further exacerbated by bulging annulus fibrosus (Fig. 11 c). Annular bulging (folding) has never been identified as a separate entity; however, it is an important finding from the clinical point of view, since the surgical treatment aims to restore the intervertebral disc space rather than microdiscectomy.

### Discectomy versus disc preservation for internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint [^e44aebd9]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anterior disc displacement with or without reduction is a common finding in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. When symptomatic and associated with dysfunction it requires an intervention. Once nonsurgical management fails and the patient does not respond to minimally invasive procedures, open surgical treatment is indicated. However, controversy exists about whether disc-preservation procedures, such as repositioning/repairing or disc removal, is the preferred treatment. This article evaluates the current evidence supporting both treatment options and highlights the indications, contraindications, and consequences of each.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of minimally invasive lumbar decompression procedure for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication: 2-year results of MiDAS ENCORE [^4ad627a4]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The addition of MILD to the array of treatment options for spinal stenosis is valuable to treating physicians as well as patients. MILD is safe and has been shown to provide durable results through 2-year follow-up. MILD does not involve the use of implants, is performed as an outpatient procedure without general anesthesia, requires only a small 5.1-mm port for access, and does not require sutures (although some surgeons elect to place a single suture at the portal site). In the comparative trial of MILD against ESIs, the success rate including durability was greater than ESIs, with a comparable safety profile. Given the minimally invasive nature of this procedure, its robust success rate, and durability of outcomes, MILD is an excellent choice for patients suffering from neurogenic claudication symptoms with LFH, who are refractory to conservative care.

While open surgery is often an excellent choice and may be required for certain patients, MILD can be offered for patients who may not tolerate a more invasive procedure, and it has a unique role as a solution when conservative therapies have failed, and the risks of more invasive approaches may not be warranted. It is important to note that MILD does not affect surgical options for the few patients who do not respond to this treatment. Because of the very minimally invasive approach and targeted subtle decompression, there is minimal or no scar tissue that would increase the risk of possible future open spine surgery. Another important consideration related to treatment planning is that patients undergoing open surgical decompression are no longer candidates for less invasive approaches.

The average age of patients in this study was 75.6 years, with patients as old as 93 years. This can be compared with an average age of 63.6 years for the surgical patients in SPORTand 66.9 and 66.2 years for the treatment and control arms, respectively, of the recent US Food and Drug Administration randomized controlled trial comparing safety and clinical outcomes of spacers. In addition, there was a high rate of presenting spinal comorbidities for MILD patients enrolled in this study (Table 1). MILD is intended for patients with central stenosis due to LFH; however, bulging discs, foraminal narrowing, and facet hypertrophy or arthrosis were common and actually were associated with higher rates of response than the ENCORE population as a whole (Table 4). Further, responder rates for patients with bulging disc and facet hypertrophy were statistically significantly higher than those without these comorbidities. Thus, our data suggest that the mere presence of these comorbidities should not be used as an exclusion.

### Hybrid cervical disc arthroplasty [^41beb294]. Neurosurgical Focus (2017). Low credibility.

For patients with multilevel cervical stenosis at nonadjacent segments, one of the traditional approaches has included a multilevel fusion of the abnormal segments as well as the intervening normal segment. In this video we demonstrate an alternative treatment plan with tailored use of a combination of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) with an intervening skipped level. The authors present the case of a 72-year-old woman with myeloradiculopathy and a large disc herniation with facet joint degeneration at C3-4 and bulging disc at C5-6. After nonoperative treatment failed, she underwent a single-level ACDF at C3-4 and single-level arthroplasty at C5-6, which successfully relieved her symptoms. No intervention was performed at the normal intervening C4-5 segment. By using ACDF combined with arthroplasty, the authors have avoided a 3-level fusion for this patient and maintained the range of motion of 2 disc levels.

### Lumbar disc herniation: diagnosis and management [^931127ce]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniations are common causes of lower back pain, neurological dysfunction, and buttock/leg pain. Herniation refers to the displacement of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc through the annulus fibrosus, thereby causing pressure on the neural elements. The sequalae of lumbar disc herniations range in severity from mild low back and buttock pain to severe cases of inability to ambulate and cauda equina syndrome. Diagnosis is achieved with a thorough history and physical examination along with advanced imaging. Treatment plans are dictated by corresponding patient symptoms and examination findings with their imaging. Most patients can experience relief with nonsurgical measures. However, if symptoms persist or worsen, surgery may be appropriate.

### Responsible, safe, and effective use of biologics in the management of low back pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) guidelines [^23b07658]. Pain Physician (2019). High credibility.

Intervertebral disc — degenerative disc disease pathophysiology and discogenic pain mechanisms — emphasizes disc composition, microenvironment, and clinical features. The disc is composed of the nucleus pulposus, the annulus fibrosus, and the fibrous attachments to the vertebral endplates, with anabolic growth factors such as transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), bone morphologic protein (BMP), growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF5), and insulin-like growth factor (IL-GF) contrasted with catabolic enzymes and inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs); the disc is relatively avascular with limited vascular support contributing to poor natural regenerative capacity when metabolic homeostasis is disrupted. Degenerative disc disease is defined as a diffuse, progressive, and age-related phenomenon characterized by nuclear dehydration and fibrosis with resultant disc space narrowing of approximately 3–4% height loss per year; hallmarks include increased MMP activation, decreased intervertebral disc cell viability, and decreased proteoglycan production, with fissures that may be radial or circumferential, loss of shock-absorbing function, bulging, and osteophyte development, and it may or may not result in discogenic low back pain. Annular fissures can provide a conduit for inflammatory mediators to trigger nociceptive nerve endings in the outer annulus fibrosus, with nerve ingrowth along fissures and discogenic pain developing with internal disc disruption; internal disc disruption has been shown to be present in approximately 36% to 39% of the patients.

### Which kind of prognosis is better in the treatment of cervical and lumbar disc herniation with coblation nucleoplasty? [^64ce9007]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cervical or lumbar discogenic pain affects more than 50% of patients, which severely impair quality of life and impose a huge socioeconomic burden. Various treatments are available for discogenic pain, such as medication, physical therapy, nerve block, behavior management, psychotherapy, minimally invasive interventions, and fusion or non-fusion surgery. However, these treatments have obvious limitations and complications, and do not always yield satisfactory results.

In CDH and LDH, the discs in the spine bulge or protrude from their normal positions, which can cause pain or numbness in the corresponding region. Disc herniation is primarily occurring at levels of C6/7, L4/5 and L5/S1. In consistent with this finding, our results showed that CDH was mostly observed at the levels of C5/6 (52.73%) and C6/7 (41.82%), whereas LDH was mainly detected at the levels of L4/5 (50.79%) and L5/S1 (42.86%). Conservative treatment is the first choice for most patients with disc herniation, including physical therapy, anti-inflammatory and epidural steroid injection. Decompression surgery may be considered when the conservative treatment fails to improve the condition, including discectomy for radiculopathy from herniated intervertebral disc, decompressive laminectomy for symptomatic spinal stenosis with or without degenerative spondylolisthesis, and fusion for nonradicular pain with degenerative changes.

### Sciatica: what the rheumatologist needs to know [^5a850882]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Sciatica is a set of symptoms rather than a specific diagnosis, and is caused by a herniated lumbar disc in the vast majority of cases. The most important symptom is lower limb pain radiating below the knee and into the foot and toes. The clinical course of acute sciatica is generally favorable, with most pain and related disability improving within 2–4 weeks with or without treatment. Diagnosis mainly involves history taking and physical examination. Imaging is warranted if there is evidence of an underlying pathology other than disc herniation, such as infection or malignancy, and in patients with severe symptoms that do not improve after 6–8 weeks of conservative treatment. MRI is the preferred imaging modality, as it can visualize soft tissues better than CT and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation. Conservative treatment is generally the first-line option in patients with sciatica; however, the currently available evidence does not show any intervention — including a broad range of conservative and surgical approaches — to have clearly superior outcomes. Thus, patient preference seems to be an important factor in the clinical management of sciatica.

### Treatment of chronic low back pain-new approaches on the horizon [^09dd536a]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment

Given that many people with intervertebral lumbar disc herniation have a high likelihood of recovery spontaneously without surgical interventions, and the fact that some people are not good surgical candidates, there are many other methods that are used to manage pain from this condition. The areas of treatment can be divided into conservative management and invasive treatments. When starting conservative management, most people begin with a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies. Pharmacological interventions include acetaminophen, NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, tramadol, corticosteroids, and even short courses of opioids for moderate-to-severe pain, in accordance with the World Health Organization's stepladder approach to managing chronic pain. Pharmacological strategies are mainly aimed at symptom control until pain abates. Non-pharmacological strategies include physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic manipulation, or therapies such as yoga, tai chi, or meditation. The majority of people improve with conservative treatments exclusively or in conjunction with a multimodal analgesic regimen as mentioned previously.,

If conservative treatment does not provide symptom relief, more invasive treatments are generally considered. Epidural glucocorticoid injections have long been touted as the first step in invasive interventional management of symptomatic intervertebral herniated discs. Whether by a lumbar interlaminar, caudal, or transforaminal approach, epidural injections have been shown to reduce pain scores and disability mainly in the short term (usually at 2 weeks) as well as delay the need for surgical intervention for as long as 13–28 months. Patients may experience relief for a period of time but may require additional repeat injections following pain recurrence. Whereas the efficacy of steroids in epidural injections is controversial, a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials of epidural injections for the treatment of radicular low back pain confirmed that epidural injections of local anesthetic with or without steroids resulted in significant improvement in pain and functionality, as well as decreased opioid consumption. However, epidural injections have not been shown to decrease the need for eventual subsequent surgery in patients with chronic pain secondary to herniated intervertebral disc. Are there any other treatment options for patients who fail both conservative and interventional procedures before undergoing surgical procedures (discectomy, disc arthroplasty, spinal fusion, etc.) in the management of symptomatic lumbar radicular low back pain (Figure 3)?

### Disc bulging predicts poor outcomes of decompression surgery for lumbar spinal canal stenosis [^ffe8fafe]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSCS) is a prevalent degenerative musculoskeletal disorder in aging populations. While decompression surgery is a standard treatment, some patients require revision surgery. Disc bulging, a distinct component of the degenerative process separate from disc herniation, contributes to spinal stenosis. However, its impact on surgical outcomes for LSCS has never been examined. This study aimed to elucidate the influence of disc bulging on outcomes of decompressive surgery for LSCS, addressing a critical knowledge gap.

Methods

This retrospective study analyzed the clinical data of 517 consecutive patients involving 912 intervertebral levels who underwent decompression surgery for LSCS. We statistically evaluated the association between disc bulging and revision surgery. Two measures were utilized to assess disc bulging: the extended area of the disc (EAD), referring to the horizontal expansion of the disc, and the disc bulging length (DBL), which indicated the degree of disc intrusion into the spinal canal. Other conventional radiographical assessments and patient background characteristics were also evaluated.

Results

Revision surgery was required in 28 patients (5.4%) involving 31 intervertebral levels (3.4%). Patients requiring revision surgery were significantly younger and more likely to smoke. Both the EAD and DBL were significantly higher in the revision group compared to the no-revision group (P < .001 for both). We did not observe an association between other conventional radiographical assessments and revision surgery. Multivariable analysis revealed that the EAD and DBL were independently correlated with revision surgery.

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that disc bulging, particularly as measured by EAD, is a significant predictor of revision surgery following decompression for LSCS. These findings highlight the importance of pre-operative assessment of disc bulging in predicting surgical outcomes and optimizing patient selection for decompressive procedures.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — guideline development process describes a structured methodology in which participants submitted and independently ranked clinical questions, multidisciplinary work groups defined search terms and followed a NASS Literature Search Protocol (Appendix D), a medical/research librarian implemented the search, and NASS maintains an Endnote search history; when identifying literature, if Level I, II or III evidence existed, Level IV or V studies were not required for review. Evidence analysis used independent dual review, with at least two work group members assigning levels of evidence, discrepancies addressed, and the consensus level assigned when two-thirds of reviewers were in agreement. Evidence-based recommendations were then formulated, incorporating expert consensus only where Level I-IV evidence was insufficient. For consensus development, work group members ranked recommendations on a scale ranging from 1 to 9; consensus was obtained when at least 80% of members ranked a recommendation as 7, 8 or 9, with up to three rounds of discussion and voting if the 80% threshold was not attained.

Lumbar intervertebral disc herniation — prospective comparative study found 743 patients were included, with 528 patients in the surgically treated group and 191 patients in the medical/interventional group; outcomes were assessed for up to two years and at three months the surgical group had statistically significant improvement in bodily pain, physical function and Oswestry Disability Index that narrowed at two years but remained statistically significant. Those who chose operative intervention reported greater improvements and the effects of surgery persisted at two-year follow-up; this study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that surgical treatment may result in earlier and greater improvement of symptoms compared to medical/interventional treatment.

### The probability of spontaneous regression of lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^3d9c0c80]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the probability of spontaneous disc regression among each type of lumbar herniated disc, using a systematic review.

Data Sources

Medline, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched using key words for relevant original articles published before March 2014. Articles were limited to those published in English and human studies.

Review Methods

Articles had to: (1) include patients with lumbar disc herniation treated conservatively; (2) have at least two imaging evaluations of the lumbar spine; and (3) exclude patients with prior lumbar surgery, spinal infections, tumors, spondylolisthesis, or spinal stenosis. Two reviewers independently extracted study details and findings. Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Furthermore, if the classification of herniation matched the recommended classification of the combined Task Forces, the data were used for combined analysis of the probability of disc regression of each type. Nine studies were applicable for probability calculation.

Results

The rate of spontaneous regression was found to be 96% for disc sequestration, 70% for disc extrusion, 41% for disc protrusion, and 13% for disc bulging. The rate of complete resolution of disc herniation was 43% for sequestrated discs and 15% for extruded discs.

Conclusions

Spontaneous regression of herniated disc tissue can occur, and can completely resolve after conservative treatment. Patients with disc extrusion and sequestration had a significantly higher possibility of having spontaneous regression than did those with bulging or protruding discs. Disc sequestration had a significantly higher rate of complete regression than did disc extrusion.

### Percutaneous treatment of cervical and lumbar herniated disc [^adbb4c1a]. European Journal of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Therapeutic armamentarium for symptomatic intervertebral disc herniation includes conservative therapy, epidural infiltrations (interlaminar or trans-foraminal), percutaneous therapeutic techniques and surgical options. Percutaneous, therapeutic techniques are imaging-guided, minimally invasive treatments for intervertebral disc herniation which can be performed as outpatient procedures. They can be classified in 4 main categories: mechanical, thermal, chemical decompression and biomaterials implantation. Strict sterility measures are a prerequisite and should include extensive local sterility and antibiotic prophylaxis. Indications include the presence of a symptomatic, small to medium sized contained intervertebral disc herniation non-responding to a 4–6 weeks course of conservative therapy. Contraindications include sequestration, infection, segmental instability (spondylolisthesis), uncorrected coagulopathy or a patient unwilling to provide informed consent. Decompression techniques are feasible and reproducible, efficient (75–94% success rate) and safe (> 0.5% mean complications rate) therapies for the treatment of symptomatic intervertebral disc herniation. Percutaneous, imaging guided, intervertebral disc therapeutic techniques can be proposed either as an initial treatment or as an attractive alternative prior to surgery for the therapy of symptomatic herniation in both cervical and lumbar spine. This article will describe the mechanism of action for different therapeutic techniques applied to intervertebral discs of cervical and lumbar spine, summarize the data concerning safety and effectiveness of these treatments, and provide a rational approach for the therapy of symptomatic intervertebral disc herniation in cervical and lumbar spine.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^341d5411]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using a modified Delphi methodology, we engaged a panel of experts in musculoskeletal imaging, interventional pain management, and spine surgery to develop a pragmatic discogenic pain clinical algorithm that provides a foundation for making procedural decisions related to the management of patients with lumbar discogenic pain. The advantage of this Delphi-based approach is the ability to develop consensus around this topic by involving experts with substantial experience in treating such patients and with significant contributions to the existing literature on this issue.

We recognize that many decisions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with disc degeneration require personalized treatment plans that cannot be addressed via binary choices in an algorithm. Indeed, many patients with chronic low back pain have multiple contributory spinal conditions that can act as pain generators. That said, the current algorithm specifically focuses on identifying those patients where the primary complaint is axial midline back pain without radicular symptoms, a symptom set highly specific to disc associated pain.

### Sex-dependent differences in symptom-related disability due to lumbar spinal stenosis [^07780db0]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a complex disease with a wide variety of symptoms and anatomic pathologies. Besides pain in the lower back and buttocks, the main symptom is neurogenic intermittent claudication. The combination of degenerative changes such as bulging of the discs, facet joints with osteophytes, and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum (LF) leads to the various known clinical appearances of LSS. The subjective perception of symptoms often does not correlate with the objective expression. Therefore, therapeutic decision-making is based on multiple factors including symptom severity, disability in daily life, and radiological criteria.

Male and female patients are known to differ in symptom-related disability as women have shown higher pain perception and elevated depression scores. Because pain may lead to depression, particularly in chronic conditions, it is important to identify symptom-related disability to initiate individualized therapies. Symptom-related disability poses a major challenge to health systems, not only from a medical but also from a socio-economic point of view. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine sex-dependent differences in symptom-related disability of patients with LSS and to identify the factors influencing disability.

### Treatment gaps and emerging therapies in lumbar disc herniation [^332c249d]. Pain Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) occurs when the central disc material, primarily the nucleus pulposus, is displaced beyond the outer annulus, compressing the spinal nerve roots. LDH symptoms, including radicular leg pain, radiculopathy, and low back pain, are associated with considerable disease burden and the significant utilization of health care resources.

Objectives

Provide overview of the current treatment landscape for LDH, identify unmet needs, and describe emerging treatments.

Study Design

Narrative literature review.

Methods

A review of literature concerning available LDH treatments and associated outcomes was conducted in PubMed to identify areas of unmet need. Some key words included "lumbar disc herniation", "radicular leg pain", "sciatica", "treatment", "therapy", and "burden".

Results

For patients who do not respond to conservative therapy, epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are widely used for persistent LDH symptoms. While ESIs provide short-term improvements in radicular pain, evidence that ESIs bestow sustained benefits is limited. ESIs are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, in rare cases, carry risks of infection and neurological injury, as well as the potential for long-term systemic effects of glucocorticoids. In cases when nonsurgical treatment fails to relieve symptoms, lumbar discectomy can provide rapid pain relief; however, in addition to the risk of intraoperative complications, the long-term consequences of lumbar discectomy may include recurrent pain or herniation, revision discectomy, loss of disc height, and Modic changes. Treatments for LDH in late-stage clinical development include sustained-release ESI formulations and a novel agent for chemonucleolysis, a nonsurgical method of minimizing the volume of the displaced nucleus pulposus. Emerging minimally invasive therapies that address the underlying pathophysiology of the disease have the potential to bridge the gap between symptomatic treatments and surgery.

Limitations

Because this paper was a narrative review, literature search and selection processes were not systematic in nature. The evidence regarding the long-term efficacy of some treatments, such as discectomy, was limited by the high rates of crossover between the treatment groups.

Conclusions

The lack of sustained benefits associated with ESIs and the risks associated with surgery underscore the unmet need for novel, minimally invasive interventional therapies able to address the underlying nerve root compression in LDH.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — comparative outcomes of surgery versus manipulation and research needs are noted: Manipulation "responded as well to treatment as surgically treated patients at 12 weeks", yet "because of the small sample size, along with the significant crossover and lack of a metaanalysis, this potential Level I study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that short-term outcomes in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy may be superior in surgically treated patients compared to patients treated with manipulation". For future research, "in the absence of clinical equipoise, it is impractical to demand additional randomized controlled trials comparing surgical intervention to 'usual nonoperative care'. Randomized controlled trials focusing on specific alternative treatments may be useful to identify effective alternatives to surgical intervention".

### Active discopathy: a clinical reality [^057cd1eb]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

What is active discopathy?

Degenerative disc disease

To understand active discopathy, we first describe 'non-active' disc disease, or DDD. At the macroscopic level, DDD affects the intervertebral disc and also the whole discovertebral complex. It is characterised by a fibrillar structure of the annulus fibrosus, cracks of the nucleus pulposus, thinning and erosions of the cartilaginous vertebral endplates, marginal osteophytosis and loss of disc height.DDD results from an imbalance in intervertebral disc homeostasis with quantitative and qualitative changes affecting intervertebral disc cells and extracellular matrix as well as decreased water content that impair the biomechanics of the intervertebral disc. At the molecular level, DDD is associated with local inflammatory processes characterised by immunological stimulation, neovascularisation and neoinnervation, accelerated cartilaginous and bone remodelling, and changes in lipid and oxidative metabolism. At the MRI level, the most consistently reported signs of DDD are nucleus pulposus dehydration, decreased disc height, disc bulging or hernia. Pfirrmann and colleagues described five MRI grades of DDD. The first grade corresponds to a normal intervertebral disc, and higher grades correspond to DDD and have in common a hypointense signal in T2-weighted sequences of a homogenous nucleus pulposus, with no distinction between the annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus, and loss of intervertebral disc height. However, no consistent anatomoclinical correlation between DDD and LBP has been described.

### Which variables are associated with patient-reported outcomes after discectomy? Review of SPORT disc herniation studies [^51433b3e]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) evaluated the effects of surgery versus nonoperative treatment for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (IDH), among other pathologies. Multiple subgroup analyses have been completed since the initial publications, which have further defined which patient factors lead to better or worse patient-reported outcomes; however, the degree to which these factors influence patient-reported outcomes has not been explored.

Questions/Purposes

We reviewed the subgroup analyses of the SPORT IDH studies to answer the following questions: (1) What factors predicted improvement in patient-reported outcomes after operative or nonoperative treatment of lumbar IDH? (2) What factors predicted worse patient-reported outcomes compared to baseline after operative or nonoperative treatment of lumbar IDH? And (3) what factors influenced patient-reported outcomes of surgery in patients with lumbar IDH?

Methods

We conducted a MEDLINE(®) search to identify the subgroup analyses of the SPORT IDH data that were responsive to our study questions. Eleven articles were identified that met our search criteria.

Results

The patient factors associated with larger improvements in Oswestry Disability Index at 4 years with either surgical or nonoperative treatment included a higher baseline Oswestry Disability Index, BMI of less than 30, not being depressed, being insured, having no litigation pending, not having workers compensation, and having symptoms for less than 6 weeks, though there were others. Factors leading to improvement with surgical treatment were mostly related to anatomic characteristics of the disc herniation such as posterolateral and sequestered herniations. There were no patient or clinical factors identified that were associated with worse patient-reported outcomes compared to baseline after either operative or nonoperative treatment. At 2-year followup, the treatment effects were greater for those patients with upper-level herniations, patients not receiving workers compensation, and nondiabetic patients. In a 4-year multivariate analysis, being married, without joint problems, and having worse symptoms at baseline resulted in greater treatment effect with surgery.

Conclusions

While most patients with IDH will likely see improvement with either surgical or nonoperative treatment, there are patient-related factors that can help predict which subgroups will demonstrate a greater improvement with surgery, such as not having joint problems, being married, having worsening symptoms at baseline, and not having diabetes. These results can help providers and patients when discussing treatment options.

Lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy — about 95% of herniated discs occur at the lower lumbar spine (L4/5 and L5/S1 level); disc herniation above this level is more common in people aged over 55 years. The estimated prevalence of lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica has been described as 9.8 per 1,000 cases, 5.1 in men and 3.7 in women. Lumbar radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation resolves spontaneously in 23% to 48% of patients, but up to 30% to 70% will still have significant symptoms after one year, with 5% to 15% of patients undergoing surgery. Based on controlled evaluations, lumbar intervertebral discography has been shown to diagnose internal disc disruption in 39% of a younger cohort of patients with low back pain, and in a study without assessing internal disc disruption the reported prevalence rate of discogenic pain was 26%.

Discogenic pain and internal disc disruption (ASIPP guidelines) are described with prevalence reported as 39% in a cohort of young patients following injury and 42% in a heterogeneous population of all age groups and types of low back pain; disc pathology begins with nuclear and/or inner annular degeneration followed by annular disruption permitting herniation, and ongoing degeneration can contribute to central canal and foraminal stenoses, segmental instability, and degenerative scoliosis; initial pathology includes decreased water content of the nucleus and fissuring of the inner annulus allowing the disc to bulge; the resulting disc morphology changes lead to altered spinal biomechanics and irritation of nerve roots by chemical irritation via an outer annular fissure near a nerve root, displacement or direct compression by disc material, or vascular compromise within canal or vascular stenoses; discogenic pain may occur without internal disc disruption, such as by chemical leakage through an outer annular fissure irritating the annulus, epidural soft tissues, and dura, and disc degeneration and herniation predispose the disc to additional pathology over time.

### Five reasons why some herniated intervertebral discs are painless [^2a837fdc]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A herniated intervertebral disc (HIVD) refers to the rupture of the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc, leading to the herniation of the nucleus pulposus beyond the intervertebral disc space. It is caused by a sudden back injury or by gradual wear and tear of the disc (ie disc degeneration).HIVDs induce lower back and lumbosacral radicular pain in the lower extremities and are a common cause of musculoskeletal pain. The prevalence of symptomatic HIVDs in the general population is known to be 1–3%. A diagnosis of an HIVD is confirmed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). However, despite clear findings of an HIVD on MRI or CT, many HIVDs do not cause pain. Jensen et al reported that only 36% of 98 asymptomatic patients had normal discs at all levels on MRI, with 52% showing a bulging disc at least at one level and 27% with a disc herniation. Here, we propose five reasons why some HIVDs do not induce pain.

Differential diagnosis

Disc herniation

LBP is very common and the number of cases with additional sciatic pain is low in comparison. The compression of a nerve root is one of the most common causes of sciatica; a herniated disc compresses the root in 90% of cases. Other possible causes of sciatica include lumbar spinal stenosis and, more rarely, tumours or cysts. Typical dermatomal distribution of pain which worsens on coughing, sneezing or straining, increased finger–floor distance and sensory symptoms, such as numbness or paraesthesia, are significant predictors of nerve root compression in patients with low back pain radiating distally into the leg.

Medical history and physical examination are the mainstays of sciatica diagnosis. The straight leg raising test or Lasegue's test is commonly used in patients with suspected sciatica. In addition, changes in the Achilles and patellar tendon reflexes and reduced strength in the big toe, ankle and knee are typical signs in patients with nerve root compression. The distribution of pain radiating in the lower limb, a characteristic and definitive feature of the condition, can sometimes be evaluated using pain drawings. Disc herniation is reported in 20–36% of individuals without symptoms of sciatica or low back pain and, furthermore, many patients with clinical symptoms of sciatica do not display lumbar disc herniation on imaging. Conservative treatment strategies for disc herniation are primarily aimed at pain reduction, either by using analgesics or by the non-surgical reduction of pressure on the nerve root using traction, spinal manipulation or physiotherapy, for example. Conservative treatment regimens are currently the first-line option for patients with sciatica. The adequate management of pain and an active approach, with patients being reassured and advised to continue their daily activities as much as possible, is the preferred treatment strategy.

### A pilot study for effectiveness of non-pharmacological versus pharmacological treatment strategies for lumbar disc herniation: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^792d72a7]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Based on the baseline characteristics of the 30 participants in this study, 40% were recommended for spinal surgery, 30% showed extrusion or sequestrated discs on MRI findings, and the NRS score for radiating leg pain was approximately 7 points, indicating that patients with severe LDH participated in this clinical trial. Additionally, the onset median value of the patients was 53 months in both groups, indicating many patients with chronic conditions of LDH.

The changes in the NRS score of radiating leg pain during the 8-week intervention period showed gradual improvement in both groups, but the improvement in the Phm group tended to be slightly greater. However, in the Phm group, the pain worsened at Week 14 and then improved again. Accordingly, at Week 14 in the follow-up period, the improvement in the Non-Phm group was significantly greater. Looking at the minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for major outcomes, there were previous studies where the MCID for NRS of back pain ranged from 1 to 2.3, and for NRS of leg pain ranged from 1 to 1.6 and ODI ranged from 10 to 12.8. In this study, at Week 14, the difference in NRS of leg pain between the two groups was 1.65 (95% CI 0.59 to 2.71), and the difference in ODI was 8.67 (95% CI 1.37 to 15.98). Therefore, the difference in NRS is judged to be a significant difference beyond the MCID between the two groups, and the ODI difference is also judged to be large, ranging from 67% to 87% of the MCID.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^cbcb5701]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — diagnosis and imaging emphasizes core test accuracy concepts and appropriate use of imaging relative to clinical assessment. With tests that have a high sensitivity, a negative test effectively rules out the disease, and with tests that have a high specificity, a positive test effectively rules in the disease; additionally, the performance of a test depends on positive and negative predictive value, which depends directly on the prevalence of disease in the tested population. One of the purposes of a history and physical examination is to increase the prevalence of disease in patients seen for advanced diagnostic imaging/testing or offered surgery, and the review attempted to identify those symptoms or findings which have a high likelihood ratio for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. Cross-sectional imaging exams have a low intrinsic specificity with significant pathologic findings in asymptomatic populations, so results of any cross-sectional examination need to be closely correlated with the clinical examination. Direct visualization of intrinsic neurologic processes and neural impingement is noted as important in determining the etiology of radicular symptoms. Although the gold standard in the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation is surgery, when assessing the validity of subjective complaints or physical examination findings, use of cross-sectional imaging as a gold standard may be considered an acceptable substitute, though the validity of surgery as a gold standard can be questioned as findings at surgery can be subjective. Additional sufficiently-powered observational studies of history/physical examination findings and diagnostic tests are needed to determine their value in influencing treatment assignment and outcome in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.

### Orofacial pain management: current perspectives [^f7d5ae80]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the muscles of mastication

The muscles of mastication should be palpated bilaterally for firmness and tenderness, utilizing approximately 2–3 lbs of pressure, or the amount of pressure needed to cause blanching of the fingernail. Upon muscular palpation, the patient should be asked to report the severity of the tenderness, pain referral to multiple sites or single-site pain localization, and replication of the chief complaint upon palpation. It may be pertinent to ask the patient about their use of analgesics prior to palpation in order to account for reduced symptoms upon examination.

Management of TMD

Most of the time, patients will visit the clinician when pain and dysfunction, such as limitation of opening, episodes of joint locking (open lock/TMJ subluxation), pain with mandibular function (chewing), facial pain, or headache are present.

The treatment goals for TMD are decreasing pain, restoring normal ROM, and restoring normal masticatory and jaw function. Many TMDs can be cyclical and self-limiting, with periods of complete remission of symptoms.

In the case of disc-condyle incoordinations, studies suggest that for some patients even though they may be progressive (for example, a disc displacement with reduction may progress to a disc displacement without reduction), they are self limiting, suggesting an adaptation of the condition and with no significant disability. It is very important to emphasize that patients have no recurrence of symptoms with the use of conservative, reversible treatments, thus conservative treatment is the modality that needs to be used at all times. Initial treatment should therefore stress a conservative and reversible approach. Primary treatment options include home care (self-care program), medical care (non-surgical care), and surgical care.

Data extraction

Two review authors independently extracted relevant data from the included studies regarding design, population (e.g. age, gender, duration of complaints before surgery, etc), type of surgery, type of control intervention, follow-up period and outcomes. Primary outcomes that were considered relevant are pain intensity (e.g. visual analogue scale or numerical rating scale), functional status (e.g. Roland Morris Disability Scale, Oswestry Scale), global perceived effect (e.g. McNab score, percentage patients improved), vocational outcomes (e.g. percentage return to work, number of days of sick leave), and other outcomes (recurrences, complication, re-operation and patient satisfaction). We contacted primary authors where necessary for clarification of overlap of data in different articles.

Methodological quality assessment

Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies.

### Clinical evaluation and treatment options for herniated lumbar disc… [^f17c4ada]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The intervertebral disc is responsible for the attachment of vertebral bodies to each other, providing flexibility and absorbing and distributing the loads applied to the spinal column. With aging, the disc undergoes significant changes in volume and shape as well as in biochemical composition and biomechanical properties. Lumbar disc herniations are believed to result from anular degeneration that leads to a weakening of the anulus fibrosus, leaving the disc susceptible to anular fissuring and tearing. Etiology of Disc Degeneration The intervertebral disc is arranged in four concentric layers: an outer anulus fibrosus composed of dense collagen fibril lamellae; a fibrocartilaginous inner anulus fibrosus; a transition zone; and the central nucleus pulposus.
2. The frame work of the disc is composed of collagen fibers in the anulus, which provide tensile strength, and proteoglycans in the nucleus, which provide stiffness and resistance to compression.

Several factors, including genetic factors and changes in hydration and collagen, are believed to play a role in the development of degenerative disc disease. It is widely accepted that the water-binding capability of the nucleus plays an integral role in the physical properties of the disc. In the healthy disc, the nucleus distributes the applied forces equally throughout the anulus. Decreased hydration of the disc can reduce the cushioning effect, thus transmitting a greater portion of the applied loads to the anulus in an asymmetric distribution.
7. This explains the exacerbation of herniated disc symptoms when the patient is in the sitting position. Imaging of the Herniated Disc The major finding on plain radiographs of patients with a herniated disc is decreased disc height. Radiographs have limited diagnostic value for herniated disc because degenerative changes are age-related and are equally present in asymptomatic and symptomatic persons.

10 Neurodiagnostic imaging modalities reveal abnormalities in at least one third of asymptomatic patients. 11 For this reason, computed tomography also has limited diagnostic value for herniated disc. MRI also has the ability to demonstrate damage to the intervertebral disc, including anular tears and edema in the adjacent end plates. As with CT scans, MRI can reveal bulging and degenerative discs in asymptomatic persons; therefore, any management decisions should be based on the clinical findings corroborated by diagnostic test results. 11.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^30499bda]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Discectomy, microdiscectomy, sequestrectomy, endoscopic decompression — evidence review reports "There are three high-quality and 31 moderate-quality studies incorporated into this analysis". Methodologically, "There are no sham-controlled discectomy trials", and results show "All moderate-quality comparative trials demonstrate short- to intermediate-benefits, but not long-term benefits from nerve root decompression surgery compared with nonoperative treatment for patients with radicular symptoms from disc herniation unresponsive to preoperative treatment". Natural history remains favorable because "up to 75% of patients with radicular symptoms from herniated discs may become minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic without surgery". For timing and strength, "patients with radiculopathy… who have not improved significantly after 4 to 6 weeks of time and appropriate conservative therapy, it is thus Moderately Recommended (B), High Confidence".

### Best practices for minimally invasive lumbar spinal stenosis treatment 2.0 (MIST): consensus guidance from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) [^ab72d87d]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

More recently, the level 1 ENCORE RCT involving over 300 patients randomized to PILD or ESI showed PILD to be statistically and significantly superior to ESI in the treatment of patients with NC central stenosis due to LFH at 1- and 2-year follow-up. Most patients enrolled in this study did have comorbid foraminal stenosis, facet hypertrophy, and/or disc bulging, which were found to be positive predictors of success with percutaneous decompression. There were no serious device- or procedure-related adverse events and there was no difference in safety between PILD and ESI, thereby providing level I evidence that PILD is as safe as ESI.

Prior to these RCTs, an earlier prospective study by Deer and Kapural first described the technique of PILD and evaluated the safety of the procedure. This prospective study from 2010 involved 90 subjects and found the procedure to be a safe treatment option for patients with complication rates lower than those reported for minimally invasive LSS surgery. This was quickly followed by a second prospective study by Chopko and Caraway demonstrating clinical improvement in LSS patients as measured by the VAS, ODI, ZCQ and 12-item short form health survey (SF-12). The study included 78 subjects who were enrolled to undergo PILD, with statistically significant improvement across all outcome measures at 6 weeks. Also, in 2010, a two-site retrospective evaluation by Lingreen and Grider looked at 42 consecutive patients with significant improvement in VAS scores at 6 weeks and reduction by 40% to 86%. There was significant patient satisfaction with this procedure and patients felt that PILD was a viable option for the treatment of LSS prior to considering open surgical decompression.

### The type of cervical disc herniation on MRI does not correlate to clinical outcomes [^9c84a543]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the type of cervical disc herniation influences the severity of symptoms at the time of presentation, and the outcome after surgical treatment.

Methods

The type and extent of disc herniation at the time of presentation in 108 patients who underwent anterior discectomy for cervical radiculopathy were analyzed on MRI, using a four-point scale. These were dichotomized into disc bulge and disc herniation groups. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Neck Disability Index (NDI), 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36), and a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain in the neck and arm at baseline and two years postoperatively. The perceived recovery was also assessed at this time.

Results

At baseline, 46 patients had a disc bulge and 62 had a herniation. There was no significant difference in the mean NDI and SF-36 between the two groups at baseline. Those in the disc bulge group had a mean NDI of 44.6 (SD 15.2) compared with 43.8 (SD 16.0) in the herniation group (p = 0.799), and a mean SF-36 of 59.2 (SD 6.9) compared with 59.4 (SD 7.7) (p = 0.895). Likewise, there was no significant difference in the incidence of disabling arm pain in the disc bulge and herniation groups (84% vs 73%; p = 0.163), and no significant difference in the incidence of disabling neck pain in the two groups (70.5% (n = 31) vs 63% (n = 39); p = 0.491). At two years after surgery, no significant difference was found in any of the clinical parameters between the two groups.

Conclusion

In patients with cervical radiculopathy, the type and extent of disc herniation measured on MRI prior to surgery correlated neither to the severity of the symptoms at presentation, nor to clinical outcomes at two years postoperatively. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2022;104-B(11):1242–1248.

### Clinical efficacy and safety of a modified moxibustion therapy for low back pain in lumbar disc herniation: a two-center, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^5f36d9a6]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

LDH refers to a clinical syndrome in which the nucleus pulposus migrates through the damaged annulus fibrosus and protrudes around due to external force or intervertebral disc degeneration to compress and stimulate the nerve root or spinal cord, inducing symptoms such as low back pain, sciatica, lower limb sensory disturbance, etc.LDH has a prevalence of about 1% and involves L4/5 and L5/S1 segments commonly. Low back pain is the initial and main symptom of LDH, as well as the leading cause of disability and decreased productivity worldwide, and LDH has been recognized to be the most common disease causing low back pain. Therefore, the occurrence of LDH may induce huge individual, family, and socioeconomic burden. At present, it is believed that the pathogenesis of LDH may be explained by mechanical compression, inflammatory stimulation, and autoimmune reaction. It can be induced and aggravated by genetic factors, trauma, smoking, obesity, pregnancy, long-term unreasonable exercise, etc.

Surgery for LDH is necessary when the symptoms are not significantly improved after continuous conservative treatment. However, there may be postoperative intractable complications such as unstable spinal force line, recurrent protrusion, and pain. Currently, it is believed that only 1–5% of patients need surgical treatment, about 15–25% of which still have symptoms of low back pain after surgery. Therefore, conservative treatment such as exercise, manual therapy, spinal traction, physical therapy, oral medicine (anti-inflammatory and analgesic, neurotrophic treatment), and epidural steroid injection are widely considered as the first therapeutic option for LDH.

To some extent, measures that can alleviate low back pain have the potential to treat LDH. Acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping, and other complementary therapies of traditional Chinese medicine have been confirmed to alleviate the low back pain. In recent decades, spontaneous resorption of nucleus pulposus induced by conservative treatment has been widely reported, which provides more possibilities for the treatment of LDH with the complementary therapies of traditional Chinese medicine. However, it remains a challenge for doctors and LDH patients to choose a suitable complementary therapy with better efficacy, higher safety, and lower cost.

### Black disc disease: a commentary [^c04cc965]. Neurosurgical Focus (2002). Low credibility.

Internal disc disruption associated with axial back pain but not radicular pain is a disease entity that was recognized about two decades ago as a disorder that could potentially be treated by spinal fusion. In this article the authors describe the clinical syndrome, magnetic resonance imaging and discography findings of pathophysiological pain generation, and the available surgical options. Based on the current understanding of this disease entity, the optimum surgical procedure entails radical discectomy, anterior column support, adequate amounts of auto- or allograft bone, bone extenders and enhancers, and rigid stabilization of the motion segment.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — cost-effectiveness of surgical options is supported, with microdiscectomy showing favorable value across multiple analyses; the committee "felt that there was strong and consistent evidence supporting the cost effectiveness of microdiscectomy for patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation who desired surgical treatment". In the SPORT cohort, Tosteson et al evaluated outcomes "at two and four years", finding that "at two years, lumbar discectomy compared to nonsurgical management was felt to be cost effective with a cost per QALY of between $35,000 and $70,000 depending upon the payer", and with continued follow-up "the cost per QALY of surgical intervention dropped to approximately $20,000 per QALY". In a prospective registry of "1822 workers", Hansson et al "estimated the cost per QALY of surgical intervention to be $4,648.00 and reported that surgical treatment had better cost utility than nonsurgical treatment". Malter et al reported that microdiscectomy was cost effective "with an estimated cost per QALY of $12,000–$30,000 depending upon the payer".

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^b6321095]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The modified Delphi methodology we employed has several limitations including bias associated with participants altering their response to align with the majority view, limited open discussion, the dependence on the expertise of the responder to interpret the results, as well as the lack of guidelines and standards for selecting the expert panel members. We also note the distinction between clinical and mathematical algorithms in this context with the former utilized to guide clinical decision-making by providing a structured approach to diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and the latter used to perform calculations, analyze data, make predictions, and suggest treatments.

The operative treatment of spinal pathology in degenerative disc disease has traditionally been under the management purview of orthopedic spine surgeons and neurosurgeons. However, the recent commercial adoption of several minimally invasive treatment options has extended these intradiscal interventions to an expanded group of physician subspecialties. Interventional pain physicians play an integral role not only in the accurate diagnosis of lumbar discogenic pain but also in utilizing the burgeoning armamentarium of first line interventions to avert surgical intervention and restore and preserve the natural physiology, mechanics and structure of the intervertebral disc. Thus, we believe a team approach that integrates the knowledge base of imaging, pain management and orthopedic/neurosurgical specialists provides the most comprehensive method for managing patients with the full array of available intradiscal treatments and surgical options. This algorithm provides a straightforward clinical decision process for identifying, evaluating and treating patients with chronic lumbar discogenic pain.

Secondary Interventions

We recommend additional multidisciplinary team consultation for patients who fail to realize a clinically significant improvement and/or exhibit worsening or new onset symptoms following first line intradiscal therapy. For patients with Modic type 1 and/or 2 changes evident on MRI, basivertebral nerve ablation (BVNA) should be considered for L3 to S1 involvement (Figure 1, Box 9). For patients without Modic changes, surgical consultation should be considered (Figure 1, Box 7). Surgical options for chronic lumbar discogenic pain consist of discectomy with instrumented interbody fusion or disc arthroplasty. Both approaches remove the painful disc and either stabilize the motion segment, as in the case of fusion, or preserve motion, as in the case of disc arthroplasty. While there is ongoing debate regarding choice of surgical treatment for symptomatic disc degeneration, several meta-analyses have concluded that lumbar fusion provides improvement in back function that is no better than that achieved with nonoperative care alone. The reimbursement barriers to lumbar disc arthroplasty notwithstanding, our panel concluded that it remains preferable to preserve natural motion across the joint if at all possible.

Similar clinical success criteria as noted previously should be employed to evaluate the effectiveness of secondary interventions for disc degeneration and discogenic back pain with the caveat that assessment of clinical success should be undertaken within 6 months of BVNA (Figure 1, Box 10) and within 12 months for surgical interventions (Figure 1, Box 11). For all interventions deemed a treatment success, periodic symptom assessment should be undertaken at least annually (Figure 1, Box 12). For patients who fail to experience clinical success post surgery (ie, failed back surgery syndrome), additional interventions may be considered such as revision surgery, spinal cord stimulation and/or facet denervation (Figure 1, Box 13).

### Transforaminal epidural steroid injection for patients with lumbosacral disc herniation in the absence of spine magnetic resonance imaging-is better really the enemy of the best? [^a6e00966]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Paradoxically, the incorrect injection level, as later determined on MRI, could actually be correct. For instance, the most prominent disc protrusion at the L4-5 level on MRI might not be prioritized, or it could rule out the advanced degeneration or mild bulging phenomenon at the L3-4 level as the actual pain source. Thus, the L3-4 injection level designated superficially using plain radiography could incidentally be the actual affected level, although the L4-5 level was shown to be the main structural lesion later on MRI.

Another interpretation for these coincidental clinical improvements, regardless of the treatment level discrepancies, would be that the retrodiscal (infraneural) approach routinely performed might imitate the supraneural approach performed one level below, thus yielding similar relief. Retrodiscal transforaminal injection causes the medication to spill into the epidural space as well as the traversing root connected to the lower disc level. For example, a retrodiscal injection at the L4-5 level may not be topically restricted to the L4-5 ventral epidural segment and could involve the traversing L5 nerve root, mimicking the drug-spreading pattern observed in the L5-S1 supraneural approach. Therefore, a one-level discrepancy between the radiograph and MRI scan could readily be compensated by equivocal efficacy through the dual access of injections across adjacent levels.

This study has some limitations. The retrospective design in this study is predisposed to a selection bias since the patients undergoing post-procedural MRI were compared with those undergoing pre-procedural MRI. Second, the results and conclusions were established based on a relatively short-term follow-up period (10 weeks). However, this may be excused because the clinical course after each epidural injection usually declines over 2–3 months, along with diminishing steroid effects, and dexamethasone used in this study tended to last for a shorter duration than methylprednisolone or triamcinolone.

Discogenic low back pain is a common musculoskeletal complaint in patients presenting to orthopaedic surgeons. In addition to surgical options, there are several nonsurgical intradiscal treatments that have gained interest, ranging from biologic, nonbiologic, cell-based, and molecular therapies. However, there is limited evidence for many of these techniques, and some are still in the clinical trial stage. We describe a broad overview of these intradiscal therapies, the mechanism of action, and the evidence behind them.

### SPORT lumbar intervertebral disk herniation and back pain: does treatment, location, or morphology matter? [^c302b255]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Diskectomy candidates with at least 6 weeks of sciatica and confirmatory imaging were enrolled in a randomized or observational cohort.

Objective

This study sought to determine: (1) whether diskectomy resulted in greater improvement in back pain than nonoperative treatment, and (2) whether herniation location and morphology affected back pain outcomes.

Summary Of Background Data

Previous studies have reported that lumbar diskectomy is less successful for relief of back pain than leg pain and patients with central disc herniations or protrusions have worse outcomes.

Methods

Patients underwent diskectomy or received "usual" nonoperative care. Data from the randomized cohort and observational cohort were combined in an as-treated analysis. Low back pain was recorded on a 0 to 6 point scale, and changes in low back pain were compared between the surgical and nonoperative treatment groups. The effects of herniation location and morphology on back pain outcomes were determined.

Results

The combined analysis included 1191 patients with 775 undergoing surgery within 2 years, whereas 416 remained nonoperative. Overall, leg pain improved more than back pain in both treatment groups. Back pain improved in both surgical and nonoperative patients, but surgical patients improved significantly more (treatment effect favoring surgery -0.9 at 3 months, -0.5 at 2 years, P < 0.001). Patients who underwent surgery were more likely to report no back pain than nonoperative patients at each follow-up period (28.0% vs. 12.0% at 3 months, P < 0.001, 25.5% vs. 17.6% at 2 years, P = 0.009). At baseline, central herniations were associated with more severe back pain than more lateral herniations (4.3 vs. 3.9, P = 0.012). Patients with central herniations and protrusionshad a beneficial treatment effect from surgery similar to the overall surgical group.

Conclusion

Diskectomy resulted in greater improvement in back pain than nonoperative treatment, and this difference was maintained at 2 years for all herniation locations and morphologies.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^a0694f2c]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The usefulness and clinical adoption of this algorithm is predicated on a grasp of several key takeaway points and the flexibility to incorporate rapidly emerging new technologies into the continuum of care. Many patients with chronic lumbar discogenic pain are in their 30–50s underscoring the reality that their spine care will span many forthcoming decades. In summary, the starting point for the physical examination assessment is in the identification of patients with midline low back pain with no neurologic deficits that is increased with forward flexion and sitting who have a positive sustained hip flexion test that narrows the diagnostic aperture to anterior column involvement as the primary pain source. The identification of painful intervertebral discs is done via MRI and MRS which represents a potentially novel breakthrough in the precise and personalized diagnosis of lumbar discogenic pain. When these advancements in quantitative imaging are combined with effective first line intradiscal interventions, the potential exists to optimize spine care by restoring and preserving native disc structure and mechanics. There has been a renewed appreciation of the importance of the intervertebral disc as a catalyst in spine degeneration and this has hastened the development of new diagnostic and treatment technologies aimed at averting spinal surgery. A concerted and collaborative effort will be necessary from all stakeholders to amass the supporting compendium of data to fulfill regulatory and reimbursement requirements so that effective treatments can be made available to patients.
