## Question

Dexamthesaone for throat pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether dexamethasone helps with throat pain and how to apply the evidence clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we mean acute pharyngitis versus postoperative sore throat. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence base, including the 2017 BMJ systematic review and meta-analysis and the TOAST randomized trial. Next, I will quantify benefits and harms, check dosing and route, and consider special populations. Finally, I will align this with guidelines and outline a practical, shared decision-making approach with appropriate caveats and monitoring.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because the answer differs for acute community-acquired sore throat versus postoperative sore throat after intubation. For acute sore throat, the most authoritative evidence comes from the 2017 BMJ systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials and the TOAST randomized trial in primary care, whereas for postoperative sore throat, multiple meta-analyses support prophylactic dexamethasone to reduce incidence and severity, so I need to keep these distinct as I proceed [^115Jhqxu] [^115rpVFB] [^111JEKxX].

> Now, I will examine the magnitude of benefit for acute sore throat. Wait, let me verify the key outcomes: at 24 hours, patients receiving a single low dose of corticosteroid were about twice as likely to have complete pain resolution, and at 48 hours, about 1.5 times as likely, with pain relief starting roughly 4.8 hours earlier and complete resolution about 11 hours sooner. The absolute pain reduction at 24 hours on a 0–10 VAS was about 1.3 points, which exceeds the minimal clinically important difference of about 1 point [^115rpVFB] [^113PdqbD] [^116LEwRB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about immediate benefit in antibiotic-naive primary care. The TOAST trial, which enrolled adults not given immediate antibiotics, showed no significant benefit at 24 hours but a modest increase in complete resolution at 48 hours, with a number needed to treat around 12, so I should emphasize that the 24-hour signal is weaker in this specific context even though broader meta-analytic data still support benefit across settings [^115Jhqxu] [^1135Tkv1].

> I need to check safety next. Serious adverse events were not increased in the included trials, and when adverse effects were reported, they were mostly disease-related complications rather than steroid toxicities. However, the trials did not assess cumulative steroid exposure with recurrent episodes, so I should caution against repeated dosing and frame this as a single-dose strategy in shared decision-making [^115rpVFB] [^113PdqbD].

> Let me consider dosing and route, and I should double-check the practical details. The most common regimen is a single dose of oral dexamethasone 10 mg in adults, or 0.6 mg/kg up to 10 mg in children aged 5 years and older. Intramuscular dexamethasone has been studied and may show larger effects in some analyses, but guidelines prefer oral administration when feasible to avoid injections and facilitate single-dose, in-clinic use [^115BX2Xn] [^117EQMdg].

> Next, I should review special populations and contraindications. The evidence base excludes children under 5 years, immunocompromised patients, and those with peritonsillar abscess or infectious mononucleosis, so dexamethasone should not be used for these groups based on this evidence. I also need to screen for diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, psychiatric disorders, or other conditions where even short-course steroids may be risky, and I should avoid repeated dosing given uncertainty about cumulative harms [^115SB7kD] [^115BX2Xn].

> I will now examine the postoperative context briefly to ensure I'm not conflating indications. Multiple meta-analyses show that a single prophylactic dose of intravenous dexamethasone reduces the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat after tracheal intubation, with typical doses of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg or 8–10 mg total, and this is a different question from community-acute pharyngitis, so I should not generalize that acute-care data to the OR setting [^111JEKxX] [^116t9GU5].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to anchor practice. The BMJ Rapid Recommendation issues a weak recommendation to consider a single dose of corticosteroids for acute sore throat given modest benefits and low apparent risk, whereas ESCMID advises against routine corticosteroids, reflecting differing value judgments. This discordance supports shared decision-making that weighs patient preferences, severity, and the small absolute benefit, especially at 48 hours [^116kskpY] [^114WiSF5] [^113qrGFA].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach, and I should confirm each element against the evidence. For adults with acute sore throat who have moderate to severe pain, particularly if rapid relief is prioritized, a single 10 mg oral dose of dexamethasone can be offered alongside standard analgesia and appropriate antibiotic stewardship, with counseling that benefits are modest and most apparent by 48 hours. For children 5 years and older, 0.6 mg/kg up to 10 mg orally as a single dose is reasonable in similar circumstances, with explicit avoidance in children under 5 and careful screening for contraindications [^115BX2Xn] [^115rpVFB] [^115Jhqxu].

> But wait, what if the patient has mild symptoms or is concerned about steroids? Given the small absolute benefit and the weak recommendation, it is perfectly reasonable to decline steroids and rely on NSAIDs, acetaminophen, hydration, and local measures, and I should document this as shared decision-making. I should also advise that repeated steroid doses for recurrent sore throat are not supported by the evidence and should be avoided outside of research settings [^113qrGFA] [^115BX2Xn].

> Finally, I should double-check that my bottom line matches the data. Yes, a single low dose of dexamethasone provides a modest but real reduction in throat pain, with earlier onset of relief and higher likelihood of complete resolution by 48 hours, and no increase in serious adverse events in trials. The effect is smaller and not statistically significant at 24 hours in antibiotic-naive primary care, so expectations should be calibrated, and use should be individualized rather than routine [^115rpVFB] [^115Jhqxu] [^113PdqbD].

Dexamethasone provides **modest, short-term pain relief** for acute sore throat, with benefits most apparent at 24–48 hours and a low risk of serious adverse effects when used as a single dose [^115rpVFB] [^113GTnrG]. It is **not a substitute for antibiotics** and should be reserved for patients with significant pain who need faster relief, especially when antibiotics are not indicated or are deferred [^115Jhqxu]. Typical dosing is 10 mg orally or intramuscularly for adults, or 0.6 mg/kg (max 10 mg) for children ≥ 5 years [^115BX2Xn]. Routine use is not recommended; consider only for severe pain after discussing limited benefits and potential risks [^114WiSF5].

---

## Clinical evidence for dexamethasone in throat pain

Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses show that a single low dose of dexamethasone **modestly improves pain outcomes** in acute sore throat:

- **Complete pain resolution**: Patients are about twice as likely to have complete pain resolution at 24 hours (RR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2–4.3) and 1.5 times more likely at 48 hours (RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3–1.8) [^115rpVFB] [^114iZTSq].

- **Time to pain relief**: Onset of pain relief occurs approximately 4.8 hours earlier than with placebo (95% CI −1.9 to −7.8 hours) [^115rpVFB] [^116LEwRB].

- **Absolute pain reduction**: Mean pain scores at 24 hours are about 1.3 points lower on a 0–10 scale (95% CI 0.7–1.9), exceeding the minimal clinically important difference of 1.0 point [^115rpVFB] [^113PdqbD].

- **Time to complete resolution**: Complete pain resolution occurs about 11 hours earlier on average (95% CI −0.4 to −21.8 hours) [^115rpVFB] [^116LEwRB].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Short-course, low-dose dexamethasone is **generally well tolerated**. Serious adverse events are not increased in trials, and minor effects (e.g. insomnia, mild gastrointestinal upset) are infrequent and usually self-limited [^115rpVFB] [^113GTnrG]. However, rare adverse effects (e.g. hyperglycemia, mood changes, immunosuppression) can occur, especially with repeated dosing or in susceptible patients [^117EQMdg].

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

Dexamethasone is **adjunctive only** and does not replace standard care:

| **Treatment** | **Effectiveness** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) | Effective for pain and inflammation | First-line for mild to moderate pain |
| Acetaminophen | Effective for pain and fever | Alternative or adjunct |
| Antibiotics | Modest benefit in bacterial pharyngitis | Use only when indicated (e.g. GABHS) |
| Dexamethasone | Modest, short-term pain relief | Adjunct for severe pain or when antibiotics are deferred |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines offer a **weak recommendation** to consider a single dose of dexamethasone for acute sore throat, emphasizing shared decision-making and selective use rather than routine administration [^116kskpY] [^113qrGFA]. ESCMID advises against routine corticosteroids, reflecting concern about limited benefit and potential risks [^114WiSF5].

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

Dexamethasone is most appropriate for **severe odynophagia** or when rapid pain relief is prioritized, such as:

- **Severe exudative pharyngitis**: Particularly with significant dysphagia or systemic symptoms [^113PdqbD].

- **Deferred antibiotic use**: When antibiotics are not indicated or are delayed, dexamethasone can provide symptomatic relief [^115Jhqxu].

- **Postoperative sore throat**: Prophylactic dexamethasone reduces incidence and severity after tracheal intubation [^111JEKxX] [^111z9SPc].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current evidence

- **Long-term safety**: Data on repeated or cumulative dosing are limited; avoid repeated use [^115rpVFB].

- **Patient selection**: Optimal criteria for identifying who benefits most remain unclear [^113PdqbD].

- **Pediatric data**: Evidence is limited in children under 5 years; dexamethasone is not recommended for this age group [^115SB7kD].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Dosing**: Adults: 10 mg orally or intramuscularly as a single dose; children ≥ 5 years: 0.6 mg/kg (max 10 mg) orally or intramuscularly [^115BX2Xn].

- **Administration**: Give in clinic when possible to avoid repeated dosing; prescribe only one dose per visit [^115BX2Xn].

- **Patient counseling**: Explain modest benefits, potential risks, and that steroids are adjuncts to standard analgesia and hydration [^113qrGFA].

- **Contraindications**: Avoid in patients with diabetes, immunosuppression, or known steroid hypersensitivity.

---

Dexamethasone offers **modest, short-term pain relief** for acute sore throat, with the clearest benefit at 24–48 hours and a favorable safety profile with single-dose use. It should be reserved for select cases after discussing limited benefits and potential risks, and used alongside standard analgesia and appropriate antibiotic stewardship [^115rpVFB] [^115Jhqxu].

### Steroids as adjuvant therapy for acute pharyngitis in ambulatory patients: a systematic review [^116oGe8a]. Annals of Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

This review summarizes the evidence regarding the efficacy of adjuvant steroids for pain reduction in acute pharyngitis.

Methods

We searched for randomized controlled trials, using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, published between 1966 and December 2008. Two reviewers assessed the quality of each retrieved article and summarized the data.

Results

Our review found 8 relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 806 patients. There were 5 RCTs with adult patients and 3 with children. All RCTs found a statistically significant faster reduction of pain or complete pain relief from steroid use compared with placebo. The trials used different steroids (dexamethasone, betamethasone, prednisone), and most participants had received antibiotics at least initially. Analgesic medication, such as acetaminophen, was allowed in all studies, but this factor was not always controlled. No serious adverse side effects were reported.

Conclusions

Steroids are effective in relieving pain in acute pharyngitis. Although no serious adverse effects were observed, the benefits have to be balanced with possible adverse drug effects. There are safe and effective over-the-counter medications to relieve throat pain. Most patients received concomitant antibiotics; however, reducing the prescription of antibiotics for generally benign upper respiratory tract infection is a public health goal. We therefore recommend further studies to establish both the safety of steroids without antibiotic coverage and the additional benefits of steroids when used with regular administration of over-the-counter analgesic medications.

### Oral dexamethasone for the treatment of pain in children with acute pharyngitis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115ewNx3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We compare oral dexamethasone with placebo for the relief of pain in children with acute pharyngitis.

Methods

We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of children aged 5 to 16 years who presented to the emergency department with acute pharyngitis. Children rated their pain on a standardized color analog scale and had a rapid streptococcal antigen detection test performed to determine group assignment. Children were randomized to dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg, maximum dose 10 mg) or placebo. Blinded research assistants called all families daily to determine pain scores until the point of complete pain relief. The primary outcome measures were the time to clinically significant pain relief and the time to complete pain relief.

Results

A total of 184 children were enrolled in the study. There were 85 children in the antigen-positive group, of whom 45 were randomized to dexamethasone and 40 to placebo. In children with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, the median time to clinically significant pain relief was 6 hours in the dexamethasone group versus 11.5 hours in the placebo group (P = 0.02; effect size of 5.5 hours with 95% confidence interval [CI] of 1.0 and 10.0 hours), and the time to complete pain relief was similar (36 hours for placebo versus 40 hours for dexamethasone, P = 0.86; effect size of 4.0 hours with 95% CI of -9.3 and 17.3 hours) in the placebo group. There were 99 children enrolled in the antigen-negative group, of whom 47 received dexamethasone and 52 received placebo. In this group, the median time to clinically significant pain relief was 13 hours in the dexamethasone group versus 9 hours in the placebo group (P = 0.32; effect size of 4 hours with 95% CI of -2 and 10 hours), and the time to complete pain relief was similar (48 hours for placebo versus 50 hours for dexamethasone, P = 0.61; effect size of 2 hours with 95% CI of -11.8 and 15.8 hours).

Conclusion

For all children with acute pharyngitis, oral dexamethasone does not decrease the time to onset of clinically significant pain relief or time to complete pain relief. However, in the subset of children with positive antigen detection test results, there is a statistically significant improvement in time to onset of pain relief, but it is of marginal clinical importance.

### Effect of oral dexamethasone without immediate antibiotics vs placebo on acute sore throat in adults: a randomized clinical trial [^115Jhqxu]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute sore throat poses a significant burden on primary care and is a source of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. Corticosteroids could be an alternative symptomatic treatment.

Objective

To assess the clinical effectiveness of oral corticosteroids for acute sore throat in the absence of antibiotics.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial (April 2013-February 2015; 28-day follow-up completed April 2015) conducted in 42 family practices in South and West England, enrolled 576 adults recruited on the day of presentation to primary care with acute sore throat not requiring immediate antibiotic therapy.

Interventions

Single oral dose of 10 mg of dexamethasone (n = 293) or identical placebo (n = 283).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary: proportion of participants experiencing complete resolution of symptoms at 24 hours. Secondary: complete resolution at 48 hours, duration of moderately bad symptoms (based on a Likert scale, 0, normal; 6, as bad as it could be), visual analog symptom scales (0–100 mm; 0, no symptom to 100, worst imaginable), health care attendance, days missed from work or education, consumption of delayed antibiotics or other medications, adverse events.

Results

Among 565 eligible participants who were randomized (median age, 34 years [interquartile range, 26.0–45.5 year]; 75.2% women; 100% completed the intervention), 288 received dexamethasone; 277, placebo. At 24 hours, 65 participants (22.6%) in the dexamethasone group and 49 (17.7%) in the placebo group achieved complete resolution of symptoms, for a risk difference of 4.7% (95% CI, -1.8% to 11.2%) and a relative risk of 1.28 (95% CI; 0.92 to 1.78; P = 0.14). At 24 hours, participants receiving dexamethasone were not more likely than those receiving placebo to have complete symptom resolution. At 48 hours, 102 participants (35.4%) in the dexamethasone group vs 75 (27.1%) in the placebo group achieved complete resolution of symptoms, for a risk difference of 8.7% (95% CI, 1.2% to 16.2%) and a relative risk of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.68; P = 0.03). This difference also was observed in participants not offered delayed antibiotic prescription, for a risk difference of 10.3% (95% CI, 0.6% to 20.1%) and a relative risk of 1.37 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.87; P = 0.046). There were no significant differences in any other secondary outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults presenting to primary care with acute sore throat, a single dose of oral dexamethasone compared with placebo did not increase the proportion of patients with resolution of symptoms at 24 hours. However, there was a significant difference at 48 hours.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113PdY73]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Corticosteroids significantly increase the proportion of patients with sore throat who will experience complete resolution of pain at both 24 and 48 hours. Fewer than four patients need to be treated to prevent one patient continuing to experience a painful sore throat at 24 hours. Although corticosteroids decreased the mean time to onset of pain relief by 6 hours, pooled analysis showed significant heterogeneity. All effects were in addition to antibiotic use.

We found that the effects of corticosteroids on mean time to onset of pain relief were homogenous in severe, exudative, or bacterial pathogen positive sore throat alone. Our data do not support an effect in mild sore throat because only one study included patients with milder symptoms at baseline, and showed no significant effect. A meta-regression analysis showed no evidence of interactions across different subgroups (such as route of corticosteroid, age, severity) on the outcome of mean time to onset of pain relief.

The effects of corticosteroids on resolution of pain were most apparent in the initial 24 hours, which implies that a single dose of corticosteroids may be sufficient. This effect is similar to that seen in croup where a single dose is generally adequate. Furthermore, the one trial comparing three daily doses of dexamethasone with a single dose found no difference in effect. w2

### Efficacy of single-dose dexamethasone as adjuvant therapy for acute pharyngitis [^114xAusV]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

Pharyngeal inflammatory pain is reduced by a single dose of dexamethasone.

Study Design

Prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study.

Methods

From August 1998 to July 2000, a total of 118 patients were enrolled. We compared placebo (n = 37), a 10-mg single dose of intramuscular injection of dexamethasone (n = 39), and a 10-mg single dose of oral dexamethasone (n = 42). All patients were given oral antibiotics and had bacterial throat cultures.

Results

Complete telephone follow-up 12 hours after treatment was available in 111 patients, and 24-hour follow-up data were available in 116. The change in pain visual analogue scale scores (pretreatment score minus 12-h follow-up score) reported by patients who were given either intramuscular (median score, 4; mean score ± SD, 4.2 ± 2.3) or oral dexamethasone (median score, 3; mean score ± SD, 3.8 ± 2.3) was significantly greater than that of the patients who were given placebo (median score, 2; mean score ± SD, 2.1 ± 2.0) (P < .001 and P = 0.002, respectively). This difference in improvement was also evident when the percentage of change was compared in the three treatment arms at 12-hour and 24-hour follow-up. Patients who were given dexamethasone had the onset of pain relief a median of 4 hours earlier than those who were given oral and intramuscular placebo (P = 0.029). Statistically significant differences among the three treatment arms were confirmed when a bacterial pathogen was identified (n = 47) but not in a subset that did not have a pathogen identified.

Conclusions

Single-dose dexamethasone appears to be a safe, effective, and inexpensive adjunctive treatment for acute pharyngitis in patients 15 years of age and older. Patients treated with intramuscular or oral dexamethasone had significant relief of pain (relative to baseline) compared with patients who were given placebo. Identification of a bacterial pathogen had a significant impact on the response to dexamethasone.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113PdqbD]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In patients with acute sore throat, there is primarily moderate to high quality evidence that one or two low doses of corticosteroids reduces the intensity and duration of pain — pain scores at 24 hours, complete resolution of pain at 24 and at 48 hours, time to onset of pain relief, and time to complete pain relief. In this review, results were consistent across studies and across all pain outcomes (table 2). The reduction in pain achieved was modest — for example, mean time to complete resolution of pain was about 11 hours shorter, and about 18% more patients had complete pain relief at 48 hours. At 24 hours, the mean improvement in pain scores was about 13 mm on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100 mm (with the minimal important difference being about 10 mm). The relative effects were similar across severities, though patients with less severe sore throat had less absolute benefit from corticosteroids. The balance of benefits and harms therefore almost certainly depends on the severity of the patient's sore throat.

Whether corticosteroids reduce recurrence/relapse of symptoms, number of days missed from school or work, duration of bad/intolerable symptoms, or antibiotic use remains uncertain. Regarding the safety of the short courses and low doses of corticosteroids, studies reported few adverse effects, with no apparent increase in events in patients treated with corticosteroid.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113NZKzB]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection

We included only randomised controlled trials comparing systemic corticosteroids with placebo, in children or adults, in outpatient (ambulatory) settings. We also included studies of patients with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis (inflammation of the tonsils or oropharynx) and patients with a clinical syndrome of "sore throat" (painful throat, odynophagia). We excluded studies of infectious mononucleosis, sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

We searched Medline (1966 to 2008), Embase (1983 to 2008), the Cochrane Library including the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Database of reviews of effectiveness (DARE), and the NHS Health Economics Database from the beginning of each database until August 2008 using a maximally sensitive strategy. Terms used included "upper respiratory tract infection", "pharyngitis", "tonsillitis", "sore throat", and "corticosteroids" (including "dexamethasone", "betamethasone", "prednisone", and all variations of these terms) and viral and bacterial upper respiratory pathogens (full search strategy available from authors). Two authors independently reviewed the title and abstracts of electronic searches, obtaining the full articles to assess for relevance where necessary. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third author. We did citation searches of all full-text papers retrieved.

The evidence

The linked systematic review reports the effects of corticosteroids when added to standard care in patients with acute sore throat.

Figure 1gives an overview of the number and types of patients included, the study funding, and patient involvement, as well as a summary of the benefits and harms of corticosteroids for treating acute sore throat.

Fig 1 Characteristics of patients and trials included in systematic review of effects of corticosteroids on acute sore throat

The panel identified eight patient-important outcomes needed to inform the recommendation: complete resolution of pain, time to onset of pain relief, pain severity, need for antibiotics, days missed from school or work, recurrence of symptoms, duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms, and adverse effects. The included studies reported on all patient-important outcomes, except for duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms. Regarding pain, the panel appraised the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours and 48 hours, as well as the mean time to complete resolution of pain and the mean time to onset of pain relief.

Although most of the studies (80%) were conducted in emergency departments, they accounted for 54% of all patients enrolled across studies. The remaining 46% were enrolled in the studies conducted in primary care settings, and the panel was therefore confident that the evidence was applicable to them as well. Most of the studies focused in adults only (60%). The studies that focused only on children (three studies, 2% of all the patients enrolled in the studies) did not include children younger than 5 years old, and thus the recommendation does not apply to younger ages.

Since the randomised controlled trials focused on patients who did not have recurrent episodes of sore throat, the panel was less confident of the applicability of the evidence to such patients, and the recommendation therefore does not apply to them. Similarly, the panel did not consider patients with sore throat after surgery or intubation, nor immunocompromised patients.

### Corticosteroids as standalone or add-on treatment for sore throat [^113GTnrG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common condition associated with a high rate of antibiotic prescriptions, despite limited evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics. Corticosteroids may improve symptoms of sore throat by reducing inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. This review is an update to our review published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefit and safety of corticosteroids in reducing the symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (Issue 4, 2019), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 14 May 2019), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, 2002 to 2015), and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (inception to 2015). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared steroids to either placebo or standard care in adults and children (aged over three years) with sore throat. We excluded studies of hospitalised participants, those with infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included one new RCT in this update, for a total of nine trials involving 1319 participants (369 children and 950 adults). In eight trials, participants in both corticosteroid and placebo groups received antibiotics; one trial offered delayed prescription of antibiotics based on clinical assessment. Only two trials reported funding sources (government and a university foundation). In addition to any effect of antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours by 2.40 times (risk ratio (RR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 4.47; P = 0.006; I² = 67%; high-certainty evidence) and at 48 hours by 1.5 times (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.76; P < 0.001; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). Five people need to be treated to prevent one person continuing to experience pain at 24 hours. Corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief and the mean time to complete resolution of pain by 6 and 11.6 hours, respectively, although significant heterogeneity was present (moderate-certainty evidence). At 24 hours, pain (assessed by visual analogue scales) was reduced by an additional 10.6% by corticosteroids (moderate-certainty evidence). No differences were reported in recurrence/relapse rates, days missed from work or school, or adverse events for participants taking corticosteroids compared to placebo. However, the reporting of adverse events was poor, and only two trials included children or reported days missed from work or school. The included studies were assessed as moderate quality evidence, but the small number of included studies has the potential to increase the uncertainty, particularly in terms of applying these results to children.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, moderately increased the likelihood of both resolution and improvement of pain in participants with sore throat. Given the limited benefit, further research into the harms and benefits of short courses of steroids is needed to permit informed decision-making.

### The impact of prophylactic dexamethasone on postoperative sore throat: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^111NugzE]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative sore throat (POST) is common after tracheal intubation of general anesthesia. Numerous factors including age, female gender, smoking history, size of the endotracheal tube, cuff pressure, time and manipulations needed to insert the tube, and time of operation and anesthesia may affect the incidence of POST, with discomfort and dissatisfaction.–

A previous systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that single low-dose corticosteroids can provide pain relief in patients with sore throat, with no increase in serious adverse effects. Considering the involvement of inflammation in pathophysiology of POST, the use of steroidal or nonsteroidal anti-inflammation drug may be an effective pharmacological strategy to prevent POST after tracheal intubation. As glucocorticoid, dexamethasone was supposed to have anti-inflammatory and analgesic impact. A previous systematic review and meta-analysis has demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of POST from intubation at 24 hours in patients treated with intravenous dexamethasone compared with placebo, with similar results as another one. However, the relatively small sample size included in both the reviews precluded the authors from drawing definitive conclusions, and the optimal timing of dexamethasone administration, and combination effect of dexamethasone with other medicines, remains unclear.

Therefore, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the impact of prophylactic dexamethasone on POST for tracheal intubation of general anesthesia.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113jLX4r]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Despite previous evidence that corticosteroids might be beneficial, several groups and guidelines currently recommend against their routine use on the basis that evidence was applicable only to patients with severe pharyngitis who were also prescribed antibiotics in an emergency department. The body of evidence now includes a broader representation of patients. The largest and most recent randomised controlled trial included 565 patients presenting to their general practitioner rather than an emergency department, and none of the patients initially received antibiotics. We found no subgroup differences with respect to patient group: the evidence seems to apply equally to patients who did and did not receive antibiotics. The evidence also seems to apply equally to patients with sore throat from group A β haemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis and some with sore throat negative for group A β haemolytic streptococcus.

In the five trials that reported co-interventions, about 80% of the participants received additional analgesics such as paracetamol and NSAIDs. Therefore, a single dose of corticosteroids seems to further reduce pain when used in combination with other analgesics. Although the benefits are relatively small, many patients are likely to consider them important. Patients with less severe sore throat, however, will obtain less absolute benefit from corticosteroids. Thus, the balance of benefits and harms almost certainly depends on the severity of the patient's sore throat. With available evidence suggesting that serious adverse effects are rare or absent, the addition of one or two doses of steroids to the symptomatic management of sore throat is likely to appeal to many patients. More high quality data would be helpful to fully understand the net balance of benefits and harms according to severity of symptoms, particularly in primary care settings.

Practical issues and other considerations

Figure 2outlines the key practical issues for patients and clinicians discussing adjunct steroids for sore throat, which are also accessible along with the evidence as decision aids to support shared decision-making in MAGICapp. Steroids are typically given as 10 mg dexamethasone (or adapted to weight for children: 0.6 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 10 mg), typically taken as pill or intramuscular injection.

Fig2 Practical issues about use of corticosteroids to treat acute sore throat

The risks may outweigh the benefits when larger cumulative doses of corticosteroids are given to patients who experience multiple episodes of sore throat, either through multiple visits or for patients who self medicate if prescribed more than one pill for their previous episode. To mitigate this issue, clinicians should administer the medication in office if possible or prescribe only one dose per visit.

Costs and resources

The panel focused on the patient perspective rather than that of society when formulating the recommendation. Given the low cost of corticosteroids for treating sore throat, implementation of this recommendation is unlikely to have an important impact on the costs for health funders. The treatment is inexpensive and likely to be offered in the context of a consultation that would have taken place anyway. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether it may increase the proportion of patients visiting a doctor to get a prescription of corticosteroids.

### Clinical efficacy of dexamethasone for acute exudative pharyngitis [^1172CAmJ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether treatment with single-dose dexamethasone can provide relief of symptoms in acute exudative pharyngitis. A prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was undertaken over a 3-month period in a university-based Emergency Department. The study included all consecutive patients between 18 and 65 years of age presenting with acute exudative pharyngitis, sore throat, odynophagia, or a combination, and with more than two Centor criteria. Each patient was empirically treated with azithromycin and paracetamol for 3 days. The effects of placebo and a fixed single dose (8 mg) of intramuscular injection of dexamethasone were compared. The patients were asked to report the exact time to onset of pain relief and time to complete relief of pain. After completion of the treatment, telephone follow-up regarding the relief of pain was conducted. A total of 103 patients were enrolled. Thirty patients with a history of recent antibiotic use, pregnancy, those who were elderly (> 65 years of age) and patients who failed to give informed consent were excluded. Forty-two patients were assigned to the placebo group and 31 were assigned to the intramuscular dexamethasone group (8-mg single dose). Time to perceived onset of pain relief was 8.06 ± 4.86 h in steroid-treated patients, as opposed to 19.90 ± 9.39 h in the control group (p = 0.000). The interval required to become pain-free was 28.97 ± 12.00 h in the dexamethasone group, vs. 53.74 ± 16.23 h in the placebo group (p = 0.000). No significant difference was observed in vital signs between the regimens. No side effects and no new complaints attributable to the dexamethasone and azithromycin were observed. Sore throat and odynophagia in patients with acute exudative pharyngitis may respond better to treatment with an 8-mg single dose of intramuscular dexamethasone accompanied by an antibiotic regimen than to antibiotics alone.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^114UkFCK]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sore throat is among the most common presenting complaints in both emergency departments and outpatient care settings. It is the cause of about 5% of medical visits in children and about 2% of all outpatient visits in adults. The most common cause of sore throat is acute pharyngitis caused by self limiting viral infections. Pain management with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) therefore represents the mainstay of care. These drugs provide limited pain relief but also sometimes cause serious harm.

Treatment of sore throat with antibiotics also provides modest benefit in reduction of symptoms and fever when the infection is bacterial, but their use could contribute to antibiotic resistance. Although most cases of sore throat have a viral aetiology, and the risk of secondary complications is low, clinicians commonly prescribe antibiotics. Though this could be because clinicians think that patients seeking care expect a course of antibiotics, in reality pain relief might be more important to them.

Corticosteroids represent an additional therapeutic option for symptom relief. Randomised control trials suggest that a short course of low-to-moderate dose corticosteroids probably provides symptomatic benefit to patients with sore throat. Despite this evidence, clinicians do not commonly use steroids. Reasons might include uncertain applicability of the evidence to patients with less severe disease, as the initial studies enrolled only patients with severe sore throat presenting to emergency departments, almost all of whom received antibiotics.

This systematic review is part of the BMJ Rapid Recommendations project, a collaborative effort from the MAGIC research and innovation programme and BMJ. The aim of the project is to respond to new potentially practice changing evidence and provide a trustworthy practice guideline in a timely manner. In this case, the stimulus was the recent TOAST (Treatment Options without Antibiotics for Sore Throat) trial, which randomised over 500 patients with sore throat presenting to their primary care clinician who were not initially prescribed antibiotics; the TOAST authors reported beneficial effects of corticosteroids. In the light of this new potentially practice changing evidence, we updated the latest Cochrane reviewdealing with the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat in addition to standard care compared with standard care alone. This systematic review informed the parallel guideline published in a multi-layered electronic format on bmj.com and MAGICapp.

We explored and were able to dismiss subgroup effects, with one exception: the reduction in mean time to complete resolution of pain was greater with intramuscular than with oral corticosteroids. The subgroup effect and its direction was specified a priori, the difference between subgroups was relatively large (about 21 hours), and chance seems an unlikely explanation (P < 0.001). Credibility of the effect, however, is underminedas the effect modification is suggested by comparison between rather than within studies, and we found no similar difference in any other outcome. In addition, the only randomised controlled trial that compared oral and intramuscular treatment with dexamethasone reported no significant difference in any outcome.

The few serious adverse effects in the included trials occurred with similar frequency in the intervention and control groups, although some minor adverse effects reported by patients might not always have been noted. Potential adverse effects that appear later are more likely to occur after repeated use or are rare would not have been captured in the trials. Recent observational studies have raised the possibility of extremely rare but serious adverse effects after short courses of corticosteroids. The quality of this evidence is, for several reasons, low with respect to the current question. The studies used observational designs from large databases with suboptimal verification of diagnoses; serious confounding by indication raises the possibility that the association is a result of the underlying disease process (such as acute inflammation or exacerbation) rather than the corticosteroids themselves; and indirectness in that the doses used in the trials were lower and the duration of treatment was considerably shorter than the duration in the observational studies. Among children, a recent overview of reviews looked at evidence from 44 randomised controlled trials on conditions that required a short course of steroids (such as asthma, bronchiolitis, croup, wheeze, and pharyngitis/tonsillitis) and reported no major adverse events.

Pain

In the five randomised controlled trials that reported complete resolution of symptoms at 24 hours, patients who received a single dose of corticosteroids were twice as likely to experience complete symptom resolution than placebo patients (relative risk 2.24, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 4.29; I² = 69%, 22.4% v 10.0%; moderate quality evidence; fig 2, table 2). All studies reporting this outcome were at low risk of bias. Tests of interaction showed no evidence of any subgroup effect (table A in appendix 3).

Fig 2 Relative risk for complete resolution of pain at 24 hours for corticosteroid v placebo groups in review of treatment of sore throat. Pooled relative risk calculated by DerSimonian-Laird random effects model

In the four trials that reported complete resolution of pain at 48 hours, patients treated with corticosteroids were 50% more likely to experience complete resolution (relative risk 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.26 to 1.75; I² = 3%, 60.8% v 42.5%; high quality; fig 3, table 2). These four studies were all at low risk of bias, and tests of interaction showed no evidence of any subgroup effect (table A in appendix 3).

Fig 3 Relative risk for complete resolution of pain at 48 hours for corticosteroid v placebo groups in review of treatment of sore throat. Pooled relative risk calculated by DerSimonian-Laird random effects model

In the eight studies that reported mean time to onset of pain relief, patients who received corticosteroids experienced onset of pain relief on average 4.8 hours earlier than those who received placebo (95% confidence interval −1.9 to −7.8; I² = 78%; moderate quality; fig 4, table 2). We found no evidence of subgroup effect for this outcome (table A in appendix 3).

Recommendations for research

Future trials should be in antibiotic naïve patients, and include the number of patients who have resolution of symptoms at 24, 48, and 72 hours and standardised pain scores. They should be large enough to adequately assess adverse events and days missed from school or work. Use of the Centor criteria at baseline will facilitate classification of severity. Any effects of corticosteroids on potentially reducing antibiotic use will need to be balanced by the risk of medicalising what is usually a self limiting and short lasting infection. Further research should focus on the effects of corticosteroids on antibiotic use as well as longer term measures such as reattendance with recurrent sore throats. Additionally, further trials in children are warranted that adequately report the outcome measures outlined above.

Summary

Corticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, provide symptomatic relief of pain in sore throat. In the current analysis, most participants had severe or exudative sore throat. Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences between trials, including severe sore throats and those in which severity was not stated. We found no evidence of significant benefit in children. Further research should target corticosteroid use in antibiotic-naïve patients.

### A pilot study of 1 versus 3 days of dexamethasone as add-on therapy in children with streptococcal pharyngitis [^115WpFYd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Studies in adults, but not in children, have shown a beneficial effect of one dose of steroid on the severity and duration of throat pain in acute pharyngitis. The effectiveness of longer steroid treatment has not been evaluated in children.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind, 3-arm, placebo-controlled trial to estimate the effectiveness of one dose versus 3 daily doses of oral dexamethasone in the treatment of 4- to 21-year-old patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis. Participants used the Wong-Baker FACES scale to rate their symptoms at enrollment and twice daily for 5 days. Patient-completed diaries and telephone interviews provided follow-up data. Primary end points-severity of throat pain, improvement in general condition and improvement in activity level-were evaluated by survival analysis.

Results

Ninety patients were enrolled. For each end point, we rejected the null hypothesis of a common survival experience for the 3 study arms. With the exception of 2 days for throat pain in participants receiving one dose of dexamethasone, the median time to improvement for all end points was 1 day for both arms of dexamethasone and 2 days for placebo. There was no difference between study arms in return to a clinical setting for symptoms related to GABHS pharyngitis or absenteeism from work/school. No patient experienced complications related to GABHS pharyngitis in the 30 days after enrollment.

Conclusions

In this pilot study, children with GABHS pharyngitis who receive dexamethasone as add-on therapy have a more rapid improvement in general condition and level of activity and, for those receiving 3 daily doses of dexamethasone, in resolution of throat pain.

Values and preferences

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids reflects a high value on a modest reduction of symptom severity and the time that it takes to achieve such improvement, and a substantial and important increase in the chance of complete resolution of pain at 48 hours.

The panel, including the patient representatives, felt that the values and preferences are likely to vary greatly across patients, which justifies a weak recommendation. For example, achieving complete pain resolution 12 hours earlier may be of little importance for patients who feel less busy in their daily life, have higher tolerance to pain, or whose symptoms are not so severe; whereas it may be very important to patients whose ability to go to school or to perform at work are compromised, care givers wishing to reduce their children's pain, or patients experiencing their pain as severe.

The panel believes that there is great variability in how much reduction in pain severity or time to complete pain resolution each patient would consider important. However, the greater the reduction in hours to achieve complete resolution of pain, the more likely it is that typical patients would place high value on those outcomes. Patients who place a high value in reducing the symptoms by any amount (such as patients with lower tolerance to pain or with severe symptoms) are more likely to accept receiving corticosteroids.

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids also reflects the concerns that the panel had with acceptability. Specifically, how acceptable is it to treat a condition that is usually not severe and is self limiting with a drug that many patients, practitioners, and other stakeholders know is almost always used for more severe diseases.

The systematic search for empirical data on patients' values and preferences related to sore throat identified 4149 references that were screened at the title and abstract level. From these, we screened 99 full text articles, from which only two provided relevant information on patients' values and preferences (see appendix 1 on bmj.com). Neither of the studies provided additional data that had not been raised by the panel members: the panel had identified appropriate patient-important outcomes and considered the variability in patient values and preferences regarding sore throat management.

Results

Study characteristics

Of 3257 potentially relevant records identified, 26 were relevant to sore throat, tonsillitis, or pharyngitis (fig 1). A further 17 studies were excluded because they examined postoperative or postintubation sore throat (13 studies), included inpatients (one), did not have a placebo group (one), or were duplicate publications (two). Of the nine that met our inclusion criteria, one was excluded for not describing the method of randomisation.

Fig 1 Flowchart of search results

The eight studies included 743 patients (369 children, 374 adults): 348 (47%) had exudative sore throat, and 330 (44%) were positive for group A β-haemolytic streptococcus. Patients were recruited from emergency department and general practice settings in four countries: United States (five studies), Canada (one), Israel (one), and Turkey (one) (table 1). Corticosteroids used included betamethasone 2 mL (estimated dose 8 mg, one study), dexamethasone (up to 10 mg, six studies; or prednisone 60 mg, one study): doses were reasonably comparable for their potency. Corticosteroids were administered either intramuscularly (three studies), orally (four), or both (one). Six trials used one dose of corticosteroids, and two trials prescribed more than one dose of corticosteroids to a subgroup of participants. w1 w2 In the eight included studies, methodological quality was high with a low risk of bias (for example, all trials reported adequate allocation concealment and clear methods of randomisation). Table 2reports the specific elements of methodological quality in the selected studies.

Fig 4 Weighted mean difference in mean time to onset of pain relief (hours) between corticosteroids and placebo groups in review of treatment of sore throat. Pooled mean difference was calculated by DerSimonian-Laird random effects model

Time to complete resolution of pain was reported in six studies. On average, patients receiving a single dose corticosteroid experienced complete resolution 11.1 hours earlier (95% confidence interval −0.4 to −21.8; I² = 85%; low quality; fig 5, table 2). In our subgroup analysis, we found a significantly larger effect among those treated with intramuscular corticosteroids (mean difference −22.4 (95% confidence interval −27.3 to −17.5) and −1.5 (−12.6 to 9.5), for intramuscular and oral corticosteroids, respectively; P = 0.001 for interaction); however, the effect modification is suggested by comparison between rather than within studies. We found no other subgroup effect (table B in appendix 3).

Fig 5 Weighted mean difference in mean time to complete resolution of pain (hours) between corticosteroids and placebo groups in review of treatment of sore throat. Pooled mean difference calculated by DerSimonian-Laird random effects model

Meta-analysis from eight studies that assessed pain with a visual analogue scale (0 = no pain, 10 = maximum pain) at baseline and after 24 hoursshowed a 1.3 points lower pain score among patients treated with corticosteroids compared with those treated with placebo at 24 hours (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9; I² = 65%; moderate quality; fig 6, table 2). We found no evidence of subgroup effect for this outcome (table B in appendix 3).

Fig 6 Weighted mean difference in absolute reduction of pain at 24 hours (0–10; 0 = no pain, 10 = maximum pain) between corticosteroids and placebo groups in review of treatment of sore throat. Pooled mean difference calculated by DerSimonian-Laird random effects model

To assess the possibility that there was selective reporting, we examined the magnitude of effect on the time to onset of pain relief, time to complete resolution of pain, and absolute pain reduction in studies that did and did not report resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours. The magnitude of effect on the other pain outcomes was similar in both sets of studies, making selective reporting less likely (table C in appendix 3).

### Effectiveness of corticosteroid treatment in acute pharyngitis: a systematic review of the literature [^1112tdNR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to examine the effectiveness of corticosteroid treatment for the relief of pain associated with acute pharyngitis potentially caused by group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS).

Methods

This was a systematic review of the literature. Data sources used were electronic databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis Previews, Scopus, and Web of Science), controlled trial registration websites, conference proceedings, study references, experts in the field, and correspondence with authors. Selection criteria consisted of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which corticosteroids, alone or in combination with antibiotics, were compared to placebo or any other standard therapy for treatment of acute pharyngitis in adult patients, pediatric patients, or both. Two reviewers independently assessed for relevance, inclusion, and study quality. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) were calculated and are reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

From 272 potentially relevant citations, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. When compared to placebo, corticosteroids reduced the time to clinically meaningful pain relief (WMD = -4.54 hours; 95% CI = -7.19 to -1.89); however, they provided only a small reduction in pain scores at 24 hours (WMD = -0.90 on a 0–10 visual analog scale; 95% CI = -1.5 to -0.3). Heterogeneity among pooled studies was identified for both outcomes (I(2) = 81 and 74%, respectively); however, the GABHS-positive subgroup receiving corticosteroid treatment did have a significant mean reduction in time to clinically meaningful pain relief of 5.22 hours (95% CI = -7.02 to -3.42; I(2) = 0%). Short-term side effect profiles between corticosteroids and placebo groups were similar.

Conclusions

Corticosteroid administration for acute pharyngitis was associated with a relatively small effect in time to clinically meaningful pain relief (4.5-hour reduction) and in pain relief at 24 hours (0.9-point reduction), with significant heterogeneity in the pooled results. Decision-making should be individualized to determine the risks and benefits; however, corticosteroids should not be used as routine treatment for acute pharyngitis.

Introduction

Sore throat is a common reason for people to seek medical care, accounting for about one in 50 of all ambulatory care visits and resulting in considerable costs. Most sore throats are self limitingand are caused by rhinovirus, coronavirus, or adenovirus. Group A β-haemolytic streptococcus is responsible for about 10% of sore throats in adults and 15–30% of those in children.

Treatment of sore throat with antibiotics provides only modest beneficial effect in reducing symptoms and fever. 7 8 However, prescribing rates remain disproportionately high. High rates of antibiotic prescriptions contribute to antibiotic resistanceand also lead to the "medicalising" of sore throat, which can result in increased rates of patient (re)attendance. In developed countries, prescribing is no longer justified to prevent complications from group A β-haemolytic streptococcus infection. Peritonsillar abscess occurs in fewer than two in 10 000 patients presenting with acute respiratory tract infections, whereas non-suppurative complications (such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis) are extremely rare.

The pressure for clinicians to reduce antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat leaves a therapeutic vacuum. Corticosteroids inhibit transcription of proinflammatory mediators in human airway endothelial cells which cause pharyngeal inflammation and ultimately symptoms of pain. Corticosteroids are beneficial in other upper respiratory tract infections such as acute sinusitis, croup, and infectious mononucleosis. We therefore hypothesised that corticosteroids would offer similar symptomatic relief from sore throat because of their anti-inflammatory effects, and undertook a systematic review to examine the effect of systemic corticosteroids on adults and children with sore throat.

### The use of dexamethasone to reduce pain after tonsillectomy in adults: a double-blind prospective randomized trial [^116XEn66]. The Laryngoscope (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To determine the effectiveness of dexamethasone to reduce pain after tonsillectomy in adults by at least 13 mm on the visual analogue scale. The secondary objective was to reduce the use of narcotics by at least 20%.

Study Design

This multicentric study is a prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial.

Methods

A total of 102 patients were enrolled and received a 4-day trial either of dexamethasone in decreasing doses or placebo. The patients were asked to note the level of pain on the visual analogue scale daily for 7 days. They also had to record their consumption of analgesic and any eventual side effects.

Results

There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between the two groups for the level of pain noted on the visual analogue scale for the first 4 and 7 days. There were no statistical differences for the consumption of hydromorphone between the two groups.

Conclusion

We cannot recommend the use of dexamethasone on a routine basis following tonsillectomy in adults for the reduction of pain or narcotics consumption.

### Topical ropivacaine combined with dexamethasone spray relieves post-tonsillectomy pain in adults [^1117ByEL]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of ropivacaine with dexamethasone spray for postoperative pain relief in adults undergoing tonsillectomy.

Methods

A total of 172 adult patients were randomly assigned to four groups: RD group (n = 43) received topical 1% ropivacaine with dexamethasone spray, RP group (n = 43) received topical 1% ropivacaine spray, Saline group (n = 43) received topical saline spray, and Control group (n = 43): not receive any interventions. The groups were compared on resting pain scores at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10days, changes in pain scores over 10days, adverse reactions (including dizziness, nausea, difficulty opening the mouth, and pharyngeal foreign body sensation), the time to first solid food intake, the time to first oral pain medication, and total pain medication dosage within 10days postoperatively.

Results

The RD group had significantly lower resting pain scores at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10days compared to the other groups, as well as a greater decrease in pain scores over 10days, correlated with Body Mass Index (BMI) and independent of age. They also had earlier postoperative oral intake of solid food, reduced need for remedial analgesics, and lower incidence of difficulty opening the mouth, halitosis, and pharyngeal foreign body sensation compared to the RP, Saline, and Control groups.

Conclusion

Topical 1% ropivacaine with dexamethasone spray is easy to administer for postoperative tonsillar pain relief in adults. The dosage can be adjusted to meet patient needs, effectively addressing pain with fewer side effects, making it clinically useful and applicable.

### Corticosteroids in peritonsillar abscess treatment: a blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial [^111rLN2c]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Sore throat is a common, benign emergency department (ED) presentation; however, peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is a complication that requires aggressive management. Use of systemic corticosteroids (SCSs) in PTA is occurring without clear evidence of benefit. This study examined the efficacy and safety of SCS treatment for patients with PTA.

Study Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Methods

A controlled trial with concealed allocation and double-blinding was conducted at two Canadian EDs. Following written informed consent, eligible patients received 48 hours of intravenous clindamycin and a single dose of the study drug (dexamethasone [DEX] or placebo [PLAC], intravenously [IV]). Follow-up occurred at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 7 days. The primary outcome was pain; other outcomes were side effects and return to normal activities/diet.

Results

A total of 182 patients were screened for eligibility; 41 patients were enrolled (21 DEX; 20 PLAC). At 24 hours, those receiving DEX reported lower pain scores (1.4 vs. 5.1; P = 0.009); however, these differences disappeared by 48 hours (P = 0.22) and 7 days (P = 0.4). At 24 hours, more patients receiving DEX returned to normal activities (33% vs. 11%) and dietary intake (38% vs 25%); however, these differences were not significant and disappeared by 48 hours and 7 days. Side effects were rare and did not differ between groups (P > .05).

Conclusions

Combined with PTA drainage and IV antibiotics, 10 mg IV DEX resulted in less pain at 24 hours when compared to PLAC, without any serious side effects. This effect is short-lived, and further research is required on factors associated with PTA treatment success.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11465RgX]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Complete resolution of pain at 24 or 48 hours

In a pooled analysis of four trials w1 w2 w6 w7 patients treated with corticosteroids were three times more likely to have complete resolution of pain at 24 hours (relative risk 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 5.1, P < 0.001, I² = 44%) (fig 2). The number needed to treat was 3.7 (2.8 to 5.9). Significant effects were recorded in adult patients only (relative risk 4.3, 2.3 to 8.1, P < 0.001) w1 w6 w7 and in those receiving oral corticosteroids only (2.6, 1.6 to 4.3, P < 0.001). w1 w2 w6 Data were insufficient to undertake further subgroup analysis.

Fig 2 Effect of corticosteroids on number of patients experiencing complete pain relief at 24 and 48 hours. See web appendix for references

In three trials w1 w2 w7 corticosteroids also increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 48 hours (relative risk 1.7, 95%CI 1.3 to 2.1, P < 0.001), number needed to treat was 3.3 (2.4 to 5.6) (fig 2). Results were similar in trials with adult patients only (1.8, 1.3 to 2.3, P < 0.001) w1 w7 and in those receiving oral corticosteroids only (1.6, 1.2 to 2.1, P = 0.004). w1 w2

Mean time to onset of pain relief

Six trials reported the mean time to onset of pain relief, which occurred at an average of 6.3 hours earlier with corticosteroids than without (95% CI 9.3 to 3.4, P < 0.001) (fig 3). w3-w8 The wide variation in individual response times caused high heterogeneity (I 2 = 73%). A sensitivity analysis, which excluded each trial in turn, demonstrated a range of weighted mean difference of 5.1 to 7.2 hours, but no loss of significance. The majority of the heterogeneity arose from the trial by Tasar et al, which showed the largest benefit of corticosteroids with small standard deviations. w7 Removal of this trial from the meta-analysis gave a mean time to onset of pain relief 5.1 hours earlier in patients given corticosteroids.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^1147D17p]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Understanding the recommendation

The recommendation for using corticosteroids made by the panel was weak because of the modest reduction of symptoms and the large variability in patient preferences.

The panel is confident that the recommendation applies to almost all patients with acute sore throat: children 5 years and older and adults, severe and not severe sore throat, patients who receive immediate antibiotics and those who receive deferred antibiotics, patients with a viral or bacterial sore throat, and patients who seek care in the emergency department as well as those who attend primary care. The systematic review contained adequate representation from such groups and settings, and results were consistent (that is, absence of credible subgroup effects), for example, between trials of children and adults, and those seen in emergency departments and in primary care offices.

### Dexamethasone may reduce sore throat symptoms in… [^115PNBst]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Are oral steroids effective in the treatment of acute sore throat in adults. Bottom Line A single dose of oral dexamethasone is no more effective than placebo in resolving acute sore throat symptoms at 24 hours in adults who do not receive immediate antibiotic therapy. However, among a multitude of exploratory secondary outcomes, the authors found that, compared with placebo, dexamethasone increased the proportion of patients with symptom resolution at 48 hours. Synopsis These investigators identified adults, 18 years or older, who presented to primary care offices in England with acute symptoms of sore throat and odynophagia for which the treating clinician did not prescribe immediate antibiotic therapy.

Exclusion criteria included the recent use of inhaled or oral steroids, recent adenotonsillectomy, recent use of antibiotics, or a clear alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia. Eligible participants randomly received a single dose of dexamethasone or matching placebo; 11 patients were found ineligible and excluded after participation. Treating clinicians could decide to offer no antibiotics or a delayed antibiotic. Patients unaware of group assignment self-assessed outcomes including the primary outcome of complete resolution of sore throat symptoms at 24 hours.

Secondary exploratory outcomes included complete resolution of sore throat at 48 hours, duration of moderately bad symptoms, time to onset of pain relief and time to complete resolution of symptoms, consumption of delayed antibiotic prescription, time missed from work or education, attendance at or telephone contact with any heath care facility because of the sore throat, and use of over-the-counter medications and/or other prescription medications in the first seven days. Complete follow-up occurred for 94% of participants at one month. Using intention-to-treat analysis, no significant difference occurred among the steroid group and the placebo group in achieving complete resolution of symptoms at 24 hours. Results were similar between patients who were and were not offered a delayed antibiotic prescription. At 48 hours, significantly more participants who received dexamethasone reported complete resolution of symptoms compared with those who received the placebo. Neither severity of sore throat at baseline nor a positive throat culture for.

Fig 3 Effect of corticosteroids on mean time to onset of pain relief in hours. See web appendix for references

In patients with an exudative sore throat, corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief (weighted mean difference 6.2 hours, 8.4 to 4.0). Similarly, we recorded a reduction in mean time to pain relief in sore throat that was bacterial pathogen positive (5.3, 8.0 to −2.6) and in trials selecting for severe sore throat (7.2, 10.1 to 4.3). All three categories of sore throat (exudative, bacterial pathogen positive, and severe) were significant (P < 0.001) with no heterogeneity (I 2 = 0) (fig 4).

Fig 4 Effect of corticosteroids on mean time to onset of pain relief analysed by subgroup using meta-regression. PO = oral delivery. IM = intramuscular delivery

The direction of effect for mean time to onset of pain relief was similar in trials with adults only, in trials with intramuscular and oral routes of steroid administration, and in trials in which severe sore throat was not selected. The effect on children only, those with less than 50% exudative sore throat, and non-bacterial pathogen positive only did not reach significance. We did not find significant changes in mean time to onset of pain relief in trials with children only, trials with less than 50% exudative sore throat, and in the subgroup of patients with sore throat not positive for bacterial pathogens. Meta-regression analysis revealed no significant differences across all subgroups (fig 4).

Figure 5shows the change in visual analogue scale at baseline to 72 hours. The data from Bulloch et al's trial display the lowest baseline visual analogue scale score (that is, less severe) and the least response at 24 and 48 hours. w3 This finding is reflected in the non-significant effect (and the smallest effect) observed in the mean time to onset of pain relief for this trial.

### The impact of prophylactic dexamethasone on postoperative sore throat: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^1151hCve]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis demonstrated safety and efficacy of prophylactic dexamethasone in reducing the incidence of POST, hoarseness, and PONV in patients requiring tracheal intubation of general anesthesia compared with placebo, with or without concomitant drugs. Prophylactic dexamethasone ≥ 0.2 mg/kg administered intravenously within 30 minutes before or after induction of general anesthesia should be recommended as grade 1A evidence with safety and efficacy for patients without pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, or contraindications for corticosteroids.

Time to complete resolution of symptoms

Five trials assessed the mean time to complete resolution of pain. w3-w5 w7 w8 High heterogeneity prevented pooling: three studies showed a benefit of corticosteroids, w5 w7 w8 and two showed non-significant effects in opposing directions. Time to complete resolution ranged from 15 to 45 hours in the corticosteroid group and 35 to 54 hours in the placebo group.

Adverse events, relapse rates, and days missed from school or work

Only one trial w5 of 125 participants reported adverse events: five patients (three steroid, two placebo) were hospitalised for fluid rehydration, and three patients developed peritonsillar abscess (one steroid, two placebo). Three studies reported no significant differences in days missed from school or work. w1 w2 w4 Four trials reported no difference in the incidence of recurrent symptoms w1-w4 (measured between 5 days and 1 month after treatment), whereas one trial found significantly increased recurrence in the placebo group. w6

### Does dexamethasone with preemptive analgesia improve pediatric tonsillectomy pain? [^116XqLRi]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The study goal was to determine whether the combination of dexamethasone with preemptive analgesia has an additive effect in further improving recovery.

Study Design

We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial of 50 children undergoing tonsillectomy at a university ambulatory surgery center. One study group received 1 intravenous dose of dexamethasone, and another group received 1 dose of saline solution. All patients received tonsillar fossa injections of ropivacaine plus clonidine before tonsil excision.

Results

The 2 study groups were similar in main outcome measurements. Pain intensity and quality of life were not statistically different between the groups. There was a small trend to less trismus and less cumulative codeine use in the steroid group. Overall, there was a very low incidence of nausea and vomiting in both groups, which may have been due to the preemptive analgesia.

Conclusion

Dexamethasone does not significantly improve the morbidity of pediatric tonsillectomy when preemptive analgesia with ropivacaine and clonidine is used concurrently.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117TxTbJ]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

Strengths of this review include explicit eligibility criteria; a comprehensive search developed with a research librarian; duplicate assessment of eligibility, risk of bias, and data abstraction; consideration of all outcomes important to patients; consideration of selective reporting bias; consideration of possible subgroup effects; and rigorous use of the GRADE approach to rate quality of evidence. The limitations of our review have to do with the underlying evidence. Only three trials explicitly reported adverse events, and they did so inconsistently. We observed substantial statistical heterogeneity in some of the outcomes. We explored the source(s) of heterogeneity by subgroup analysis and rated down for inconsistency in GRADE assessments for outcomes with unexplained heterogeneity.

In comparison with previous systematic reviews, we included two additional randomised controlled trials, which almost doubled the number of participants. Results from our meta-analysis are consistent with previous findings that corticosteroids reduce pain at 48 hours and probably reduce other pain outcomes. In addition to enhanced precision with the additional studies, our meta-analysis adds to the existing evidence in that we considered absolute in addition to relative effect measures, providing a clear picture of the magnitude of effect. In part because of input from the guideline panel, we considered additional outcomes that participating patients considered important, including risk of recurrence of symptoms, duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms, need for antibiotics, and days missed from school or work. An important additional contribution of the new evidence is that it extends the applicability beyond patients with severe sore throat treated with antibiotics for group A β haemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis in the emergency department, to a broader range of patients not treated with antibiotics.

Results

Description of included studies

We identified 2349 titles and abstracts through our literature search, of which 46 were potentially eligible and 36 were excluded (19 were not randomised trials; 14 had no patients with sore throat/acute pharyngitis; in three corticosteroids were not among the interventions or were not compared with a placebo/usual care). Figure 1shows the details of study selection process.

Fig 1 Selection of studies in review of corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat

The 10 randomised controlled trials that proved eligible enrolled 1426 individuals. Eight studies recruited patients from hospital emergency departmentsand two from primary care. Three studies enrolled children, six studies enrolled adults, and one study included both children and adults. Oral dexamethasone (single dose of 10 mg for adults and 0.6 mg/kg, maximum 10 mg for children) was the most common intervention (five studies) followed by single dose intramuscular injection of dexamethasone (three studies). All patients in three trials received both antibiotics and analgesics as the usual care; in two trials, all patients received antibiotics, while analgesics were prescribed at the physician's discretion. In the five remaining trials, patients in usual care group received antibiotics or analgesics at the physician's discretion. Table 1presents study details.

### The impact of prophylactic dexamethasone on postoperative sore throat: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^116t9GU5]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Our systematic review and meta-analysis was reported according to the recommendations of the PRISMA statement.

Outcome measures

The incidence of POST during the immediate 24-hour postoperative period was defined as primary endpoint, while the incidence of hoarseness, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), cough, and adverse events were defined as secondary endpoints.

Data collection and analysis

Keywords were searched in Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library from their inception to December 12, 2017. RCTs were further identified by Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategies. Keywords and MeSH terms were used in combination as follows: 1) corticosteroid, glucocorticoid, steroid, or dexamethasone; AND 2) sore throat, or sore throats, as shown in Table S1. Additional studies were identified by searching Authors' names, "related articles" function, and screening the reference lists.

Section criteria

RCTs written in the English language assessing the prophylactic impact of dexamethasone vs placebo without other antiemetics, dexamethasone vs placebo plus concomitant administration of a different drug, dexamethasone vs a different drug, dexamethasone plus a different drug vs dexamethasone, or comparisons using different doses of dexamethasone for POST in patients with tracheal intubation of general anesthesia undergoing surgery except tonsillectomy were included. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) non-RCTs; 2) studies including patients undergoing tonsillectomy or laryngeal surgery; 3) studies without available data; 4) overlapping data; or 5) letters, reviews, case reports, and expert opinions.

Data extraction and management

The information and data we obtained were extracted from included studies by by Yaofei Jiang and Ruoxi Chen, and a third investigator was used to judge any disagreements. For each study, we recorded information and data of study population, interventions, and outcomes.

### Effect of oral dexamethasone without immediate… [^1135Tkv1]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Among adults presenting to primary care practices with acute sore throat, a single dose of oral dexamethasone did not increase the likelihood of symptom resolution at 24 hours but did increase the likelihood at 48 hours. Importance Acute sore throat poses a significant burden on primary care and is a source of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. Corticosteroids could be an alternative symptomatic treatment. Conclusions and Relevance Among adults presenting to primary care with acute sore throat, a single dose of oral dexamethasone compared with placebo did not increase the proportion of patients with resolution of symptoms at 24 hours. However, there was a significant difference at 48 hours. Trial Registration isrctn. org Identifier: ISRCTN17435450. For the primary outcome, a single dose of oral dexamethasone did not significantly increase the proportion of participants reporting complete resolution of their sore throat at 24 hours.

Among patients not offered a delayed antibiotic prescription, 43 participants of the 173 in the dexamethasone group and 32 of the 169 in the placebo group experienced complete resolution of sore throat for an RR of 1. 31 and a risk difference of
5. 9%. For patients seeking primary care for a sore throat that is not judged to require immediate antibiotics, no significant benefit of dexamethasone on complete resolution of symptoms at 24 hours was found. However, at 48 hours dexamethasone resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of participants reporting complete resolution, requiring an average of 12 patients to be treated for 1 additional patient to experience symptom resolution. A similar effect was evident in the subgroup of participants not offered a delayed antibiotic prescription.

No significant differences were observed in participant-reported duration of moderately bad symptoms, visual analog scale ratings, time to onset and time to complete resolution of symptoms, or time away from school or work when comparing dexamethasone with placebo groups. Three study participants, 2 receiving placebo and 1 dexamethasone, required hospitalization related to sore throat, which is a complication rate similar to previous observational studies of sore throat treated in primary care. 16 Reattendance with symptoms or complications of sore throat was similar in both groups.

### Comparative effectiveness of analgesia for early pain management after pediatric tonsillectomy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115EnGw5]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Timely and effective analgesia after tonsillectomy in children is crucial, but there is currently no consensus on the optimal analgesics. This analysis aimed to identify the most effective for this surgery.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis (random-effects model) of randomized controlled trials comparing analgesics for pediatric tonsillectomy. We searched relevant studies in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from database inception until June 30, 2023. Children (≤ 18 years old) who underwent tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy were eligible for inclusion. Primary outcomes encompassed pain score and postoperative complications; secondary outcomes included postoperative supplementary analgesia, functional evaluation, and sedation score.

Results

In total 82 randomized controlled trials involving 6110 patients were included, forming the primary network that comprised comparative data for 16 different interventions (including placebo) across 6 types of analgesics. The integrated analysis revealed that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs except ketoprofen had no significant effects in relieving postoperative pain (mean difference [MD], -2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.59 to -0.32; P = 0.10). Local anesthetic infiltration (bupivacaine: MD, -2.76; 95% CI, -3.88 to -1.64, P = 0.01; ropivacaine: MD, -2.49; 95% CI, -4.25 to -0.73, P = 0.02; lidocaine: MD, -1.86; 95% CI,-3.52 to -0.2, P = 0.02; levobupivacaine: MD, -1.06; 95% CI, -2.00 to -0.12, P = 0.01), analgesics (morphine: MD, -2.07; 95% CI, -3.14 to -1.00; P = 0.02), and glucocorticoids (dexamethasone: MD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.73 to -0.16; P = 0.01) were effective in relieving pain after pediatric tonsillectomy. In reducing incidence of postoperative complications, dexamethasone was superior to bupivacaine (relative risk [RR], 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43–0.83; P = 0.02). Regarding the number of patients needing rescue analgesic, levobupivacaine was superior to lidocaine (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32–0.81; P = 0.01). In rescue analgesia requirement, morphine outperformed lidocaine (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25–0.75; P = 0.01) and ropivacaine (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32–0.91; P = 0.01) in efficacy but not different from bupivacaine (P = 0.10) and levobupivacaine (P = 0.12).

Conclusions

Based on these results, we would recommend local bupivacaine infiltration or local levobupivacaine infiltration for older children and dexamethasone injection for younger children for early analgesia after tonsillectomy. However, clinicians should choose the optimal analgesic based on the individual child's condition and clinical situation.

### Steroids for post-tonsillectomy pain reduction: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116bFXnk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether meta-analysis supports the use of corticosteroids to reduce post-tonsillectomy pain for pediatric patients.

Methods

A systematic review of currently available randomized controlled trials using a single-dose, intravenous corticosteroid during pediatric tonsillectomy was performed. Visual analog pain scale (VAS) data was extracted with reviewers blinded to results. Meta-analysis was performed with weighted mean difference and random-effects model using Revman 4.2 software.

Results

Eight randomized trials were included in analysis of post-tonsillectomy pain. A statistically significant reduction in pain as measured by VAS on postoperative day 1 was noted (mean VAS difference = -0.97; CI 95% = -1.74,-0.19; P = 0.01).

Conclusions

A single, intraoperative dose of dexamethasone may reduce post-tonsillectomy pain on postoperative day 1, by a factor of 1 on a 10-point pain scale. As the side effects and cost of dexamethasone dose appear negligible, consideration of routine use seems reasonable.

Quality of evidence

As shown in Table 3, quality of GRADE evidence from available RCTs, upgraded by large-effect or dose–response gradient, and downgraded by publication bias (Pr > | z | ≤ 0.1), indirectness (variations in study setting), imprecision (sensitivity analysis with a significantly different conclusion), or inconsistency (statistical heterogeneity among studies).

Reliability and conclusiveness of composite outcome result

For conclusive and reliable meta-analysis, we calculated the optimal sample size by assuming a 40% control event rate of POST and a 25% relative risk reduction with 80% power and a two-sided a = 0.01. Our calculations with sequential monitoring boundary crossing indicated that the cumulative evidence is reliable and conclusive (Figure S3).

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115SB7kD]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Study selection

Reviewers (BS, RACS, DP, RBP) independently and in duplicate screened the titles and abstracts of all identified studies using a priori selection criteria. Subsequently, the samereviewersindependently assessed eligibility of the full texts of potentially eligible studies. Reviewers resolved discrepancies through discussion or, if needed, by adjudication from a third reviewer.

We included randomised controlled trials that compared corticosteroids with standard of care or placebo and enrolled adults and/or children aged 5 and over in emergency departments and primary care settings with a clinical syndrome of sore throat (painful throat, odynophagia, or pharyngitis).

We excluded studies of participants who were admitted to hospital or immunocompromised and those with infectious mononucleosis, sore throat after any surgery or intubation (postoperative sore throat), gastroesophageal reflux disease, croup, or peritonsillar abscess. We also excluded studies that enrolled children aged under 5 because they would not be able to provide trustworthy outcome measurements, especially for self reported pain.

Our outcomes of interest were complete resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours; mean time to onset of pain relief; mean time to complete resolution of pain; absolute reduction of pain at 24 hours; duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms (such as problems for eating, drinking, swallowing); recurrence/relapse of symptoms; days missed from school or work; need for antibiotics; and rate of adverse events related to treatment. We included any adverse events reported by the authors.

For patients experiencing tracheal intubation of general anesthesia, POST is a common but unpleasant complication. As glucocorticoid, dexamethasone has anti-inflammatory and analgesic impact. Therefore, prophylactic dexamethasone may be beneficial.

Our study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of prophylactic dexamethasone for patients undergoing sur gery requiring tracheal intubation of general anesthesia in reducing the incidence of POST, hoarseness, and PONV compared with placebo, with or without contaminant drugs. It may be explained that dexamethasone is anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agent, and it may exert its therapeutic actions through central inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, by decreasing serotonin turnover in the central nervous system, and by influencing the systemic inflammatory response in favor of anti-inflammatory mediators.

Besides, our meta-analysis demonstrated comparable efficacy of dexamethasone in reducing POST as other drugs including ondansetron, magnesium sulfate, ketamine gargle, betamethasone gel, and ketorolac in this patient population. Among these latter, ondansetron exerts positive effects on pain relief as a Na channel blocker, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, and μ-opioid agonist, while magnesium sulfate, and ketamine gargleboth as N -methyl — aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, betamethasone gel as corticosteroids, and ketorolac as an NSAID with analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting cyclooxygenase. Dexamethasone in combination with other drugs is most effective in reducing POST, perhaps due to its synergistic effects of pain relief through NMDA receptor antagonists. Although without other serious adverse events, dexamethasone was associated with increased level of postoperative blood glucose.

### Effectiveness of single intravenous dexamethasone in prolongation of spinal anesthesia for postoperative analgesia in elective cesarean section: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^1154M2cV]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Intraoperative administering of high-dose dexamethasone (greater than 0.2 mg/kg) reduces postoperative pain and spares opioids. After surgical procedures, an effective multimodal pain management strategy using intermediate dose dexamethasone (0.11 to 0.2 mg/kg) has been found to be safe with minimal side effects. During cesarean sections, preoperative IV dexamethasone administration has a stronger impact on postoperative pain management.

Intravenous dexamethasone prolongs spinal anesthesia during a cesarean section, improving pain control, and lowering postoperative pain and opioid consumption. It also lessens sore throats caused by intubation and reduces opioid consumption. Additionally, there is a decreased incidence of rebound pain when intraoperative IV dexamethasone is administered. Early postoperative administration of a single intravenous dose of dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg significantly reduces the need for overall analgesic medication and provides a substantial analgesic benefit.

Administering high-dose dexamethasone intraoperatively (greater than 0.2 mg/kg) reduces postoperative pain and spares opioids. Following surgery, an effective multimodal pain management strategy is the use of intermediate dose dexamethasone (0.11 to 0.2 mg/kg), which is safe and has few side effects. Preoperative IV dexamethasone administration has a stronger impact on postoperative pain control during cesarean delivery. Additionally, there is a decreased incidence of rebound pain when intraoperative IV dexamethasone is administered. A single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg reduces the need for overall analgesics by providing a substantial analgesic benefit in the early postoperative phase.

This systematic review set out to bring the body of research on dexamethasone's effectiveness for postoperative analgesia and spinal anesthesia prolongation in women having cesarean deliveries up to date and draw conclusions. Additionally, it offers dosage guidelines for achieving the best possible effects from this medication.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute sinusitis [^115ig6Gq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute sinusitis is a common reason for patients to seek primary care consultations. The related impairment of daily functioning and quality of life is attributable to symptoms such as facial pain and nasal congestion.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids in relieving symptoms of acute sinusitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 2, 2011, which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the NHS Health Economics Database, MEDLINE (1966 to June week 2, 2011) and EMBASE (January 2009 to June 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing systemic corticosteroids to placebo or standard clinical care for patients with acute sinusitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed methodological quality of the trials and extracted data.

Main Results

Four RCTs with a total of 1008 adult participants met our inclusion criteria. We judged studies to be of moderate methodological quality. Acute sinusitis was defined clinically in all trials. However, the three trials performed in ear, nose and throat (ENT) outpatient clinics also used radiological assessment as part of their inclusion criteria. All participants received oral antibiotics and were assigned to either oral corticosteroids (prednisone 24 mg to 80 mg daily or betamethasone 1 mg daily) or the control treatment (placebo in three trials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in one trial). In all trials, participants treated with oral corticosteroids were more likely to have short-term resolution or improvement of symptoms than those receiving the control treatment: at Days 3 to 7, risk ratio (RR) 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8; risk difference (RD) 20% (6% to 34%) and at Days 4 to 10 or 12, RR 1.3, 95% CI (1.0 to 1.7), RD 18% (3% to 33%). An analysis of the three trials with placebo as a control treatment showed similar results but with a lesser effect size: Days 3 to 6: RR 1.2, 95% CI (1.1 to 1.4), RD 12% (5% to 19%) and Days 4 to 10 or 12: RR 1.1, 95% CI (1.0 to 1.2), RD 10% (3% to 16%). Scenario analysis showed that outcomes missing from the trial reports might have introduced attrition bias (a worst-case scenario showed no statistically significant beneficial effect of oral corticosteroids). We did not identify any data on the long-term effects of oral corticosteroids on this condition, such as effects on relapse or recurrence rates. Reported side effects of oral corticosteroids were limited and mild.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that oral corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy to oral antibiotics are effective for short-term relief of symptoms in acute sinusitis. However, data are limited and there is a significant risk of bias. High quality trials assessing the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids both as an adjuvant and a monotherapy in primary care patients with acute sinusitis should be initiated.

### There is no dose-escalation response to dexamethasone (0.0625–1.0 mg / kg) in pediatric tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy patients for preventing vomiting, reducing pain, shortening time to first liquid intake, or the incidence of voice change [^116EY1Dd]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Tonsillectomy is associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) if no prophylaxis is administered. Previous studies have shown that a single dose of dexamethasone decreases the incidence of PONV. The most effective dose of dexamethasone to affect clinical outcome is yet to be defined.

Methods

One-hundred-twenty-five children were enrolled in a double-blind, prospective, randomized, dose-escalating study of dexamethasone: 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg/kg, maximum dose 24 mg. Nonparametric ANOVA was used to analyze the incidence of vomiting by treatment group for 0 to ≤ 5 h, > 5 to 24 h. The Cox Proportional Likelihood Ratio Test was used to compare the time of first vomit and time to first pain medication across treatment groups.

Results

There was no difference in the incidence of vomiting for the five escalating doses of dexamethasone in the time period. There were no differences in secondary outcomes (analgesic requirements, time to first liquid, and change in voice) across treatment groups.

Conclusion

We conclude that the lowest dose of dexamethasone (0.0625 mg/kg) was as effective as the highest dose of dexamethasone (1.0 mg/kg) for preventing PONV or reducing the incidence of other secondary outcomes following tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. There is no justification for the use of high-dose dexamethasone for the prevention of PONV in this cohort of children.

### Acute odynophagia: a new symptom of COVID-19 during the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant wave in Sweden [^114f32iJ]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Management

Treatments of odynophagia caused by viral or bacterial agents include treating the underlying infection. As there is no widely used specific treatment for COVID‐19, the first treatment choice is pain management including paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or diclofenac. In addition, affected patients may use a local anesthetic containing lidocaine in the form of a spray or oral solution to numb the throat. Antibiotics are not recommended if there is no suspicion of secondary bacterial infection. Antibiotics have been shown to have a modest beneficial effect over placebo in reducing the symptom of sore throat. In cases where antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V taken two or three times daily for 10 days is the treatment of choice.

Patients with severe symptoms may be given one dose of epinephrine in an inhaled form using a nebulizer to reduce airway inflammation. This can be repeated frequently. Epinephrine inhalation gives a quick effect and may relieve pain by reducing edema; however, its effect wears off quickly. Another alternative is a single dose of oral or intramuscular corticosteroids. Dexamethasone is the recommended corticosteroid due to its long‐lasting effects. Corticosteroids were shown to moderately reduce throat pain in several clinical trials.

### Effect of intravenous lidocaine, dexamethasone, and their combination on postoperative sore throat: a randomized controlled trial [^111z9SPc]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative sore throat (POST), hoarseness, and cough after tracheal intubation are not uncommon. Although both lidocaine and dexamethasone have been used independently to reduce these events, there is no study assessing the combined effects of lidocaine and dexamethasone.

Methods

This prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled study enrolled 180 patients requiring general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation for > 90 minutes. They received 1 of the 4 intravenous agents just before induction of anesthesia: lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) in group L, dexamethasone (8 mg) in group D, lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) with dexamethasone (8 mg) in group DL, and placebo as normal saline in group NS. Standard anesthesia protocol was followed. Incidence and severity of a sore throat, cough, and hoarseness of voice were assessed up to 24 hours postoperatively. The primary outcome was the incidence of POST, and the main effects of dexamethasone and lidocaine were the primary interest.

Results

Data of 45 patients in D, 44 in L, 44 in DL, and 43 in NS groups were analyzed. The incidence of a sore throat was 36%, 43%, 25%, and 56% in group D, L, DL, and NS, respectively (P = 0.02). Dexamethasone with or without lidocaine reduced the incidence of the POST (odds ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.82; P < .01). However, lidocaine was not effective in reducing POST (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–1.14; P = 0.12). No difference was observed in the severity of a sore throat, incidence and severity of a cough, and hoarseness among the groups.

Conclusions

Dexamethasone, with or without lidocaine, was effective in reducing the incidence of POST in patients requiring prolonged tracheal intubation.

### The impact of prophylactic dexamethasone on postoperative sore throat: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^116NmwuG]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Assessment of quality of evidence in included studies

Cochrane risk of bias instrument was used to assess the risk of bias for RCT quality by two reviewers independently. The following six items were examined including sequence generation, allocation concealment, double-blind evaluation, completeness of outcome data, selective reporting of outcome, and comparability of baseline characteristics between groups. The bias risk for each item was classified as high, low, or unclear. RCTs with no less than three items defined as high risk of bias were excluded for the meta-analysis. The seven matching criteria used to assess the baseline comparability between groups were as follows: age, gender, weight or BMI, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA), intubation attempts, time of operation, and time of anesthesia. We defined baseline as incomparability if the number of nonmatching criteria was no less than 3.

Statistical analysis

RevMan 5.0 and STATA 12.0 software were used to perform statistical analyses. Dichotomous variables were calculated with ORs and 95% CIs. We used random-effects model to pool data with statistical heterogeneity determined by the inconsistency index (I ≥ 50%) and the Chi-squared test (P ≤ 0.10). Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine the optimal dose and administration time. Sensitivity analyses were performed by omitting one study at a time. Begg's rank correlation test was used to assess the publication bias, determined as positive by Pr > | z | ≤ 0.1. The overall quality of evidence from available RCTs was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.

### Dexamethasone for the prevention of postoperative sore throat: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111JEKxX]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine the antiemetic efficacy of dexamethasone in the prevention of postoperative sore throat (POST) and postoperative hoarseness (PH).

Design

Meta-analysis.

Setting

Metropolitan university medical center.

Measurements

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported in agreement with the PRISMA guideline. We searched online databases of MEDLINE (from 1966 to August 2013), EMBASE (from 1982 to August 2013), Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review. Relative ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.

Results

Four trials with a total of 480 patients were included for the analysis: 283 received prophylactic dexamethasone and 197 received placebo. Pooled result by random-effects model showed that dexamethasone significantly decreased the incidence of POST at 1 hour (RR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27–0.94, P = 0.03; P for heterogeneity = .0005, I(2) = 83%) and at 24 hour postextubation (RR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.26–0.79, P < .05; P for heterogeneity = .01, I(2) = 72%). Our analysis indicated that dexamethasone significantly decreased the incidence of PH at 1 hour (RR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.11–0.46, P < .01; P for heterogeneity = .48, I(2) = 0%), but did not affect the incidence of PH at 24 hours postextubation (RR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.37–1.20, P > .1; P for heterogeneity = .12, I(2) = 59%).

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis suggested that intravenous dexamethasone can effectively reduce the incidence of POST both at 1 and at 24 hours postextubation. In addition, the present study showed that prophylactic dexamethasone reduced the incidence of PH at 1 hours but not at 24 hours postextubation.

### Analgesia and patient comfort after enhanced recovery after surgery in uvulopalatopharyngoplasty: a randomised controlled pilot study [^116vH37K]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Multimodal analgesia is the essential part of the ERAS protocol. In this study, we used a combination of NSAIDs and intra-operative ultrashort-acting opioids, which were also recommended by published guidelines, and local anaesthesia as perioperative multimodal analgesia. On the one hand, NSAIDs relieve pain by inhibiting the composition of prostaglandins and by preventing central or peripheral sensitization. A retrospective study demonstrated that perioperative application of NSAIDs provided adequate analgesia and reduced opioid use. On the other hand, the effects of anti-inflammation reduce postoperative occurrence of tissue oedema, potentially improving patient comfort by alleviating swallowing pain and breathing difficulties. Compared with the control group, the ERAS protocol significantly relieved pharyngeal pain in both resting and swallowing conditions after UPPP (all P < 0.001). Xie et al. showed that NSAIDs combined with local anaesthesia provides more adequate post-operative analgesia. However, their sample size was small (n = 40), and the comparison was performed only between local anaesthesia with and without NSAIDs. Ponstein et al. reported 3 cases in which continuous lesser palatine nerve block was used for post-operative analgesia after UPPP. However, the technique of catheter placement was not mature, resulting in catheter migration and leakage. Therefore, instead of nerve block, we chose to combine local anaesthesia with NSAIDs in this study. In addition, the dexamethasone used in this study also served as an adjunctive medication of multimodal analgesia. Dexamethasone was proven to have positive effects on reduction of postoperative swelling which leads to physical strain and increased pain. A meta-analysis showed that a single dose of systemic dexamethasone (more than 0.1 mg/kg) used as adjunct was effective in relieving postoperative pain at rest and with movement. Additionally, lower doses (4–5 mg, i.v.) were enough for prevention of PONV, potentially avoiding acute change of wound tensions along with fierce pharyngeal pain. Our results showed that multimodal analgesia provides a significant improvement in post-operative pain scores, and it was more feasible. Patient comfort was significantly promoted in the ERAS group in this study as well, and the multimodal analgesia may have played an important role in such improvement. In addition, the Riker sedation-agitation score was improved in the ERAS group (median: 4 [IQR: 4–4] vs. median: 4 [IQR: 3–4], P < 0.001) 30 min after operation. Abdelmageed et al. showed that adequate sedation decreases the duration of mechanical ventilation, PACU stay and bleeding, whereas Xu et al. showed that dexmedetomidine provided effective sedation after UPPP. As a highly selective alpha2 agonist, dexmedetomidine has both mild analgesic and sedative effects. Perioperative application of dexmedetomidine evidently reduces the total required dose of anaesthetics and opioids. Duan et al. demonstrated in 2018 that perioperative dexmedetomidine is effective for improving postoperative delirium. In our study, the incidences of symptoms related to delirium were significantly lower in the ERAS group than in the control group (p values for both disorientation and agitation were lower than 0.001). Meanwhile, fewer respiratory depressant effects were observed in dexmedetomidine than in other sedatives, implying potential benefits on reduction of perioperative airway complications in patients with OSA. In this study, dexmedetomidine was used as a sedative to relieve patient anxiety before operation, as an adjunctive medication for controlled hypotension procedures, and as an adjunct for early postoperative analgesia and sedation, leading to lower pharyngeal pain VAS scores and improvement of Riker sedation-agitation scores in the ERAS group. Although there was potentially increased risk of intraoperative bradycardia and hypotension with dexmedetomidine and remifentanil, the blood pressure in the ERAS group was controlled by vasoactive agents. Therefore, no hemodynamic events were observed in this study. Patients with bradycardia ≤ 50 bpm were treated with atropine and conditions were recorded as needed. However, no bradycardia treatment was necessitated during this study.

### Adjunct steroids in the treatment of peritonsillar abscess: a systematic review [^114EFqfJ]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study systematically reviews the existing literature on the efficacy of adjuvant corticosteroids in improving clinical outcomes after peritonsillar abscess (PTA) drainage.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Methods

We performed a literature search of MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to June 2016. Inclusion criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating adjuvant corticosteroids after PTA drainage. Data were systematically collected on study design, patient demographics, and clinical characteristics. Two independent investigators reviewed all manuscripts and summarized the data.

Results

Three RCTs comprising 153 patients were included. The results were not pooled due to heterogeneity in the method in which outcomes were measured and reported. The trials also varied on the type of steroid (dexamethasone, methylprednisolone) administered and method of drainage (incision, aspiration). All three RCTs reported statistically significant improvement in body temperature from adjuvant steroid administration compared to placebo. Pain scores, mouth opening, time to painless oral intake, and duration of hospitalization were significantly improved in only one or two of the three RCTs between the steroid and control group. No adverse side effects from steroid administration were reported.

Conclusions

Steroids as an adjunct therapy to the treatment of PTA may result in faster recovery. However, further investigation with larger RCTs and standardized outcomes are warranted.

### The impact of prophylactic dexamethasone on postoperative sore throat: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^116YP6Bd]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Secondary endpoints

Incidence of hoarseness: dexamethasone vs placebo, with or without concomitant drugs

The incidence of hoarseness was reported in six RCTs. Compared with placebo, a significant reduction in the incidence of hoarseness was found in patients treated with dexamethasone with or without concomitant drugs (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.31–0.58, P < 0.00001; Figure 5). No statistical heterogeneity was found among studies (P = 0.16, I = 32%).

Incidence of PONV: dexamethasone vs placebo, with or without concomitant drugs

The incidence of PONV was described in five RCTs. Compared with placebo, a significant reduction in the incidence of PONV was found in patients treated with dexamethasone with or without concomitant drugs (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.03–0.14, P < 0.00001; Figure 6). No statistical heterogeneity was found among studies (P = 0.19, I = 35%).

Incidence of cough: dexamethasone vs placebo, with or without concomitant drugs

The incidence of cough was reported in three RCTs. Compared with placebo, comparable incidence of cough was found in patients treated with dexamethasone with or without concomitant drugs (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.19–1.89, P = 0.38; Figure 7). Statistical heterogeneity was found among studies (P = 0.02, I = 71%).

Incidence of adverse events: dexamethasone vs placebo with or without concomitant drugs

Data on postoperative blood glucose in patients receiving dexamethasone were described in one RCT. Compared with magnesium sulfate, statistically higher level of postoperative blood glucose was described in patients treated with dexamethasone. Compared with controls, comparable incidence of other adverse events such as dysphonia, dysphagia, itching, wound infection, diarrhea, headache, muscle pain, dizziness, drowsiness, urinary retention, and abdominal distension was found in patients treated with dexamethasone.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^1174Sby7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Intraoperative steroids for pediatric tonsillectomy — intravenous dexamethasone: Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy; this is a strong recommendation based on randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with a preponderance of benefit over harm, with policy level: Strong recommendation and differences of opinions: none. Evidence notes aggregate evidence quality Grade A and level of confidence in evidence high, with benefits including decreased incidence of PONV up to 24 hours posttonsillectomy, decreased time to first oral intake, and decreased pain as measured by lower pain scores and longer latency times to analgesic administration; risks, harms, costs include no adverse events in all randomized controlled trials and the direct cost of medication; exclusions include patients in whom steroids are contraindicated. PONV occurs independent of dissection technique and in > 70% of children who do not receive prophylactic antiemetics, and a Cochrane review found children receiving dexamethasone were half as likely to vomit in the first 24 hours versus placebo (risk ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.41–0.58; P < .00001) and were more likely to advance to a soft or solid diet on posttonsillectomy day 1 (risk ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.15–1.83; P = 0.001); routine use in 5 children would be expected to result in 1 fewer patient experiencing posttonsillectomy emesis (risk difference, −0.24; 95% CI, −0.32 to −0.15; P < .00001). Dosing across trials ranged from 0.15 to 1.00 mg/kg with maximum 8 to 25 mg, and one trial reported increased postoperative bleeding in children randomized to 0.5 mg/kg of dexamethasone, although this was a secondary outcome that was not adjusted for other risk factors and lost significance when primary bleeding cases were excluded.

### Steroids for pediatric adenotonsillectomy pain – A prospective multicenter randomized trial [^115W1Ae6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary objective of this study was to compare two different oral steroid regimens in children undergoing AT to refine the type, dose, and duration of optimal therapy. We hypothesized that by comparing outcomes of administering dexamethasone on day 3 and prednisolone on days 1 to 3, the steroid with superior efficacy and fewer side effects could be identified with improved pain control, faster return to regular diet and activity, as well as fewer caregiver‐initiated phone calls and ED visits.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117TWuXQ]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Guideline panel and patient involvement

According to the BMJ Rapid Recommendations process, a guideline panel provided critical oversight to the review and identified populations, subgroups, and outcomes of interest. The panel included clinicians, methodologists, and patients with experience of sore throat. Patients received personal training and support to optimise contributions throughout the guideline development process. The patients on the panel led the interpretation of the results based on what they expected the typical patient values and preferences to be, as well as the variation between patients. Five patient representatives were full members of the guideline panel and contributed to the selection and prioritisation of outcomes, values and preferences assessments, and critical feedback to the protocol for the systematic review and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.

Search strategy

We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant published randomised controlled trials based on the strategy reported in the most recent Cochrane systematic review, modified under the guidance of a research librarian (appendix 1). We limited the search from 1 January 2010, which included a two month overlap with the previous Cochrane review search, to 1 May 2017. There were no language restrictions. We reviewed reference lists from eligible new trials and related reviews for additional eligible trials and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing or unpublished trials and for additional data from published trials.

### Effect of dexamethasone on nausea, vomiting, and pain in paediatric tonsillectomy [^116Bbw3z]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of dexamethasone (DEX) to reduce morbidity after paediatric tonsillectomy remains controversial. We evaluated the effect of 0.15 and 0.5 mg kg(-1) DEX on the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and on pain intensity after paediatric tonsillectomy.

Methods

A total of 147 children aged 2–8 yr undergoing elective tonsillectomy were included in this prospective randomized double-blind study. At the induction of anaesthesia, subjects received 0.15 mg kg(-1) (DEX 0.15), 0.5 mg kg(-1) (DEX 0.5) DEX, or an equivalent volume of saline solution (placebo). Anaesthetic and surgical techniques were standardized. The incidence of PONV and the need for anti-emetic drugs and additional analgesia (tramadol and/or morphine) were recorded. Postoperative pain was assessed using the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale, the visual analogue scale, and the postoperative pain measure for parents.

Results

The incidence of early PONV (primary outcome variable) was lower in both DEX groups (DEX 0.15: 21%; DEX 0.5: 22%; placebo: 49%; P = 0.001). The incidence of severe pain was reduced in the DEX groups on the second postoperative day (DEX 0.15: 20%; DEX 0.5: 5%; placebo: 47%; P < 0.001). The study was not powered to assess a difference between the two DEX dose groups.

Conclusions

A single i.v. injection of DEX at the induction of anaesthesia was effective in reducing the incidence of early and late PONV and the level of pain on the second postoperative day. A 0.15 mg kg(-1) DEX dose appeared to be as effective as a 0.5 mg kg(-1) dose to reduce the incidence of PONV.

### The impact of prophylactic dexamethasone on postoperative sore throat: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^115FdY7R]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Subgroup analyses

Incidence of POST: dose of dexamethasone

Subgroup analyses according to the dose of dexamethasone ranging from 4 to 0.2 mg/kg indicated that dexamethasone ≥ 0.2 mg/kg and 0.1–0.2 mg/kg both significantly reduced the POST incidence compared with controls (0.1–0.2 mg/kg: OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43–0.82; ≥ 0.2 mg/kg: OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.21–0.50), while dexamethasone ≤ 0.1 mg/kg did not (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.31–1.03), as shown in Figure 8. Dexamethasone ≥ 0.2 mg/kg had a significantly greater effect on reducing the POST incidence than dexamethasone 0.1–0.2 mg/kg (0.1–0.2 mg/kg: OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.18–0.31; ≥ 0.2 mg/kg: OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.28–0.55; P < 0.00001), as shown in Figure S1.

Incidence of POST: timing of dexamethasone administration

Patients in most of the trials were administered with dexamethasone that varied from 30 minutes to immediately before induction of anesthesia. The incidence of POST in patients treated with dexamethasone administered 30 minutes prior to intubation vs 30 minutes after tracheal intubation was described in two RCTs. Comparable incidence of POST at 24 hours was found in patients receiving dexamethasone administered 30 minutes prior to intubation vs 30 minutes after tracheal intubation (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.44–1.86, P = 0.79; Figure S2). No statistical heterogeneity was found among studies (P = 0.66, I = 0%).

Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analyses omitting one study at a time demonstrated a significantly different result of meta-analysis on POST incidence comparing dexamethasone with a different drug.

Publication bias

No statistical publication bias was found among studies by Begg's rank correlation test, except for the data on POST incidence in patients treated with dexamethasone vs placebo, with or without concomitant drugs (Pr > | z | = 0.008) (Table S2).

### Single-dose oral dexamethasone decreases sore throat pain… [^114JEfRk]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Do oral corticosteroids relieve pain in patients with acute sore throat. Bottom Line Sore throats are rarely fatal anymore, but there is really no such thing as "just a sore throat. " Whereas antibiotics have no analgesic activity, a single low dose of a corticosteroid such as oral dexamethasone — 0. 6 mg per kg for children at least five years of age and up to 10 mg for adults — is effective in decreasing pain in the first 24 hours. Synopsis To determine whether an oral corticosteroid aids in symptom resolution, these researchers searched four databases, including Cochrane Central, trial registries, and reference lists of retrieved studies, and identified 10 studies with a total of 1, 426 patients five years or older.

Two reviewers independently selected the studies for inclusion and abstracted the data, selecting randomized controlled trials that compared one or two daily doses of corticosteroid with standard treatment or placebo in patients who presented to an emergency department or primary care office with clinical sore throat. Five studies evaluated oral dexamethasone, and three studies evaluated a single intramuscular dose of dexamethasone, in addition to antibiotic treatment and analgesic treatment. Onset of pain relief was 4. 8 hours faster with the corticosteroid, with more than twice as many patients reporting complete resolution at 24 hours. There was no demonstrated difference in days missed from school or work, and no difference in adverse effect rates between groups.

### PROSPECT guideline for tonsillectomy: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^111i9AzV]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Gabapentinoids

Four studies assessing oral gabapentin (including two with children) [63, 64, 65, 66] and two studies examining oral pregabalin in adults [67, 68] were included. All but one study [66] showed an analgesic effect of gabapentinoids when compared with placebo or when administered with paracetamol [68]. No study included a comparison with a combined basic analgesia regimen. Three studies reported side‐effects of gabapentinoids. Mathiesen et al. [68] reported more dizziness with 300 mg pregabalin. There are no clear conclusions to be drawn on dosing level or whether the pre‐operative dose should be repeated or not from these studies. However, data from meta‐analyses report that at least 600 mg gabapentin or 150 mg pregabalin is needed in the otherwise healthy adult [69, 70].

Dexamethasone

The benefit of steroids in patients having tonsillectomy was investigated in 17 studies [13, 86] including 1943 patients; 14 studies examined dexamethasone. Dexamethasone showed a significant analgesic effect after tonsillectomy when administered alone or in combination with other analgesics. Dexamethasone consistently reduced the incidence of nausea and vomiting after tonsillectomy, being effective in low doses, that is, 2–4 mg i.v. There was no consistent evidence concerning the appropriate dose, or a dose‐dependent effect for analgesia, but studies showing an analgesic effect in children use a dose of at least 0.15 mg.kg –1, whereas the adult studies used a total of 8 mg or more. There was no evidence of an increase bleeding risk with dexamethasone, or other side‐effects from the glucocorticoids, although none of the included studies have systematically addressed these effects. Known side‐effects, such as increased blood glucose levels, increased alertness and restlessness during night, are not addressed in the studies reviewed. One study [81] suggested a more relevant and sustained effect on analgesia with peritonsillar infiltration of dexamethasone instead of i.v. or oral administration. Other glucocorticoids, for example, oral prednisolone [74], seem to perform similarly, but are less studied for this purpose. Four recent meta‐analyses on the subject draw the same conclusions [87, 88, 89, 90].

### The efficacy of levobupivacaine hydrochloride-dexamethasone infiltration for post-tonsillectomy pain in adults [^116Wbqt1]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of peritonsillar infiltration of a levobupivacaine hydrochloride and dexamethasone combination for post-tonsillectomy pain in adult patients.

Methods

A total of 40 patients were included in this double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled study. The patients were equally randomized into 2 groups by means of sealed envelopes. The study group (SG) received peritonsillar levobupivacaine hydrochloride and dexamethasone infiltration and the control group (CG) received peritonsillar saline infiltration. Pain scores at the second, fourth, eighth, 12th, 16th, and 24th hours and the second to seventh days after operation were recorded by the patients in each group using a visual analog scale. Duration of surgery and the total amount of blood loss during the surgery were also recorded for each patient.

Results

All pain scores in the SG were lower than those in the CG; however, the difference was significant at the second, 12th, and 16th hours, and the second and third day (P < 0.05). Postoperative morbidity parameters, including otalgia, nausea, vomiting, fever, halitosis, and bleeding were similar between the 2 groups. Total amount of analgesic consumption in the SG was significantly lower than in the CG on each day of the week after tonsillectomy.

Conclusions

Peritonsillar infiltration of a levobupivacaine hydrochloride and dexamethasone combination may provide pain reduction and decrease analgesic consumption in the postoperative period after adult tonsillectomy.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^111SM6Ga]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Data abstraction and risk of bias assessment

Reviewers extracted the following data, independently and in duplicate: general study information (authors, publication year, and study location); study population details (sample size, age, diagnosis, and percentage of participants with confirmed group A β haemolytic streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis or culture positive for bacterial pathogens); setting (primary care versus hospital emergency department); details on the intervention and comparison (for example, type, form, duration, and dose of corticosteroids; type of control group); co-interventions (proportion of participants who received antibiotics and/or analgesics); and outcomes as listed above.

In randomised controlled trials with more than two arms, we extracted data from the arm closest to a single dose regimen or data from the arm that received corticosteroid as adjunct treatment to standard of care rather than instead of standard of care. In trials with data for both oral and parenteral corticosteroids, we used oral data for the main analysis and intramuscular data for the appropriate subgroup analysis.

Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias using the modified Cochrane risk of bias instrument, which deals with random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of study participants, healthcare providers, and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; and other potential sources of bias. Reviewers classified studies at high risk of bias when they had rated at least one item as high risk of bias.

To assess the quality of evidence, we used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach that classifies evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low quality based on considerations of risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and publication bias. We resolved disagreements between reviewers in data extraction and assessments of risk of bias or quality of evidence by discussion and, if needed, by third party adjudication. We used the MAGICapp platform to generate the GRADE summary of findings table.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^111EoFQM]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Other outcomes

The authors of one study reported a possible decrease in the likelihood of receipt of antibiotics in patients treated with corticosteroids (relative risk 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.13; moderate quality). Three studiessuggested a possible lower risk of recurrence/relapse of the symptoms (0.52, 0.16to 1.73; I² = 23%; moderate quality, table D in appendix 3, table 2).

Kiderman and colleagues reported that 22/40 (55%) patients treated with corticosteroids and 27/39 (69%) taking placebo took time off work because of sore throat (relative risk 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.6 to 1.1). Marvez-Valls and colleagues reported that adult patients treated with corticosteroids missed an average of 0.4 (SD 1.4) days, whereas patients in the placebo arm missed an average of 0.7 (SD 1.4) days (mean difference −0.3 days, 95% confidence interval −0.87 to 0.27). None of the trials reported duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms.

All studies except one sought information on adverse effects using different methods including standardised questionnaire (two studies), open ended questions or diaries to capture self reported adverse events (five studies), or a checklist of complications (two studies). Table 3provides details of adverse effects assessed and methods used for capturing them. Six studies reported no adverse effects, and three studies reported adverse events, in both steroids and comparator arms, which were mostly complications related to disease and occurred with similar frequency in the intervention and control groups (table 3). Hayward and colleagues reported two serious adverse events (admission to hospital for pharyngeal or peritonsillar abscess, tonsillitis, and pneumonia) in the corticosteroids group (0.7%) and three in the placebo group (1.1%). Olympia and colleagues reported one out of the 57 (1.8%) children in the corticosteroids group and two out of the 68 (2.9%) children in the placebo group developed a peritonsillar abscess (moderate quality, table 2and table 3).

### Clinical practice guideline: improving voice outcomes after thyroid surgery [^113BK9Y9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Perioperative corticosteroids in thyroid surgery — randomized evidence reports that dexamethasone (8 mg) reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain, with mixed and early-resolving effects on voice metrics. Two randomized controlled studies have been performed using preoperative corticosteroids; in one double-blind trial with 2 cohorts (n = 51 each), dexamethasone-treated patients had significantly less nausea and vomiting and less pain with no differences in subjective voice analyses. In another double-blind thyroidectomy study of 72 patients randomized to control (n = 35) or dexamethasone (n = 37), dexamethasone significantly reduced the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting and postoperative pain; on the first postoperative day, reduced ability for vocal fold lengthening was more pronounced in the control group when reading standardized text and pronouncing a sustained "a" (P = 0.018 and .015, respectively), with no significant differences on voice disturbance indexes but significant differences on a nonvalidated subjective voice analysis (P < .003); between-group differences were no longer apparent by 24 hours, and no steroid-related complications were observed.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute sinusitis [^112U5ttG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute sinusitis is the inflammation and swelling of the nasal and paranasal mucous membranes and is a common reason for patients to seek primary care consultations. The related impairment of daily functioning and quality of life is attributable to symptoms such as facial pain and nasal congestion.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic corticosteroids on clinical response rates and to determine adverse effects and relapse rates of systemic corticosteroids compared to placebo or standard clinical care in children and adults with acute sinusitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (January 2009 to February 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing systemic corticosteroids to placebo or standard clinical care for patients with acute sinusitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data.

Main Results

Five RCTs with a total of 1193 adult participants met our inclusion criteria. We judged methodological quality to be moderate in four trials and high in one trial. Acute sinusitis was defined clinically in all trials. However, the three trials performed in ear, nose and throat (ENT) outpatient clinics also used radiological assessment as part of their inclusion criteria. All participants were assigned to either oral corticosteroids (prednisone 24 mg to 80 mg daily or betamethasone 1 mg daily) or the control treatment (placebo in four trials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in one trial). In four trials antibiotics were prescribed in addition to oral corticosteroids or control treatment, while one trial investigated the effects of oral corticosteroids as a monotherapy. When combining data from the five trials, participants treated with oral corticosteroids were more likely to have short-term resolution or improvement of symptoms than those receiving the control treatment: at days three to seven (risk ratio (RR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 1.6; risk difference (RD) 17%, 95% CI 6% to 29%) and at days four to 14 (RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.5; RD 14%, 95% CI 1% to 27%). A sensitivity analysis including the four trials with placebo as a control treatment showed similar results but with a lesser effect size: at days three to seven (RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3; RD 11%, 95% CI 4% to 17%) and days four to 14 (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.2; RD 8%, 95% CI 2% to 13%). Statistical heterogeneity was high for many analyses. Subgroup analyses revealed that corticosteroid monotherapy had no beneficial effects. Furthermore, scenario analysis showed that outcomes missing from the trial reports might have introduced attrition bias (a worst-case scenario showed no statistically significant beneficial effect of oral corticosteroids). No trial reported effects on relapse or recurrence rates. Reported side effects in patients treated with oral corticosteroids were mild (nausea, vomiting, gastric complaints) and did not significantly differ from those receiving placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral corticosteroids as a monotherapy appear to be ineffective for adult patients with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis. Current data on the use of oral corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy to oral antibiotics are limited: almost all trials are performed in secondary care settings and there is a significant risk of bias. This limited evidence suggests that oral corticosteroids in combination with antibiotics may be modestly beneficial for short-term relief of symptoms in acute sinusitis, with a number needed to treat to benefit of seven for resolution or symptom improvement. A large primary care factorial trial is needed to establish whether oral corticosteroids offer additional benefits over antibiotics in acute sinusitis.

### Prophylactic dexamethasone decreases the incidence of sore throat and hoarseness after tracheal extubation with a double-lumen endobronchial tube [^114bJeXM]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative sore throat and hoarseness are common complications after tracheal intubation, particularly after using a double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT). We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone for reducing the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat and hoarseness.

Methods

One hundred sixty-six patients (aged 18–75 yr) scheduled for thoracic surgery with a DLT were enrolled. Before induction of general anesthesia, 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone (Group D1), 0.2 mg/kg dexamethasone (Group D2), or a placebo (Group P) were infused i.v. in a double-blind and prospectively randomized manner. Glottic exposure as defined by Cormack and Lehane score, resistance to DLT insertion, number of intubation attempts, time to achieve intubation, and the duration of tracheal intubation were recorded. At 1 h and 24 h after tracheal extubation, the patients were evaluated for sore throat and hoarseness using a visual analog scale (VAS; where 0 = no pain and 100 = worst pain imaginable).

Results

One hour after tracheal extubation, the incidence of postoperative sore throat and hoarseness, along with the severity of sore throat were lower in Group D1 (31%, P = 0.021; 11%, P = 0.003; and VAS 12.4, P < 0.001, respectively) and D2 (11%, P = 0.001; 4%, P = 0.001; and VAS 6.6, P < 0.001, respectively) compared with Group P (53%, 36% and VAS 30.9, respectively). Twenty-four hours after tracheal extubation, the incidence of postoperative sore throat, hoarseness, and the severity of sore throat were significantly lower in Group D2 (27%, P = 0.002; 15%, P = 0.001; and VAS 29.9, P < 0.002, respectively) compared with Group D1 (47%, 31%, and VAS = 43.9, respectively) and Group P (57%, 45%, and VAS = 51.3, respectively). There was no complication associated with the dexamethasone administration.

Conclusion

The prophylactic use of 0.2 mg/kg of dexamethasone significantly decreases the incidence and severity of sore throat and hoarseness 1 h and 24 h after tracheal extubation of a DLT.

### Steroids for improving recovery following tonsillectomy in children [^114ai2hj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 2003. Tonsillectomy continues to be one of the most common surgical procedures performed worldwide. Despite advances in anesthetic and surgical techniques, post-tonsillectomy morbidity remains a significant clinical problem.

Objectives

To assess the clinical efficacy of a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone in reducing post-tonsillectomy morbidity.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN; and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 29 October 2010, following a previous search in September 2002.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of a single dose of intravenous, intraoperative corticosteroid for pediatric patients (age < 18 years) who underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy.

Data Collection and Analysis

The first author extracted data regarding the primary outcome measures and measurement tools from the published studies. The first author also recorded data regarding study design, patient ages, procedures performed, dose of corticosteroid and method of delivery, as well as methodological quality. When data were missing from the original publications, we contacted the authors for more information. We performed data analysis with a random-effects model, using the RevMan 5.1 software developed by the Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 19 studies (1756 participants). We selected only randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies to minimize inclusion of poor quality studies. However, the risk of bias in the included studies was not formally assessed. Children receiving a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone (dose range = 0.15 to 1.0 mg/kg) were half as likely to vomit in the first 24 hours compared to children receiving placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.58; P < 0.00001). Routine use in five children would be expected to result in one less patient experiencing post-tonsillectomy emesis (risk difference (RD) -0.24; 95% CI -0.32 to -0.15; P < 0.00001). Children receiving dexamethasone were also more likely to advance to a soft/solid diet on post-tonsillectomy day one (RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.83; P = 0.001) than those receiving placebo. Finally, postoperative pain was improved in children receiving dexamethasone as measured by a visual analog scale (VAS, 0 to 10) (MD -1.07; 95% CI -1.73 to -0.41; P = 0.001), which correlates clinically to a reduction in pain (on a VAS of 0 to 10) from 4.72 to 3.65. No adverse events were noted in the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that a single intravenous dose of dexamethasone is an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment for reducing morbidity from pediatric tonsillectomy.

### Effectiveness of preoperative ketamine gargle to reduce postoperative sore throat in adult patients undergoing surgery with endotracheal tube; systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials [^114DQWN3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This meta-analysis was conducted to compare the effectiveness of preoperative ketamine gargle and preoperative placebo gargle to reduce the occurrence of postoperative sore throats in adult patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. In this study, preoperative ketamine gargle is found to reduce the occurrence of postoperative sore throat compared to placebo (saline or drink water) gargle. The finding of this metanalysis is supported by another meta-analysis of RCT studies (RR = 0.53 and p < 0.015). Compared to this metanalysis, the previous metanalysis include five RCT studies and small sample size for analysis. In addition, to this, the robustness of findings were not confirmed by advanced statistical tests (test of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis).

Moreover, RCT study conclude that the onset of POST after extubation was significantly longer for patients in ketamine gargling compared to patients in lidocaine jelly. This may be explained by the mechanism of action of ketamine, which has both central nervous system (block of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA)) and peripheral nervous system (block ion channels and receptors, modulate transporters and anti-inflammatory action) actions to produce analgesic compared to a local effect of lidocaine jelly.

Studies also stated that other formulation of ketamine are effective to reduce postoperative sore throat. A network metanalysis stated that nebulized magnesium, corticosteroids and ketamine are effective to reduce postoperative sore throat but corticosteroids are superior to magnesium and ketamine. Another network metanalysis study stated that the use of topical pharmacologic agents including magnesium, ketamine, corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are more effective to reduce POST compared to lidocaine.

On the other hand another RCT study stated that the incidence of postoperative sore throat in preoperative ketamine gargle is higher compared to preoperative magnesium gargle. This may be explained by the muscle relaxant effect of magnesium. Similarly, a double blind RCT study stated that prophylaxis intravenous combination use of dexamethasone and ketamine gargle significantly reduce postoperative sore throat compared to using ketamine gargle alone. This may be attributed to blockade of additional pain pathways (inhibition of peripheral phospholipase) by dexamethasone which ketamine does not address. Another single blind RCT conclude that nebulized ketamine is more effective to reduce the incidence and severity of POST compared to ketamine gargle. This may be explained by nebulized ketamine can reach deeper into the airway has more efficient absorption to the blood stream compared to ketamine gargle.

### A comparison between dexamethasone and methylprednisolone for vomiting prophylaxis after tonsillectomy in inpatient children: a randomized trial [^115J7mrQ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The frequent incidence of postoperative vomiting in children undergoing tonsillectomy, in addition to the occurrence of severe pain, may delay postoperative oral intake and lead to increased risk of dehydration. Thus, prophylactic therapy is indicated in this high-risk group. Glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone and methylprednisolone, have anti-inflammatory and antiemetic properties with dexamethasone being frequently used. We hypothesized that methylprednisolone should be noninferior to dexamethasone for the prevention of vomiting in children after tonsillectomy.

Methods

We designed a randomized double-blind trial to compare the efficacy of a single prophylactic dose of 0.5 mg/kg dexamethasone with a dose of 2.5 mg/kg methylprednisolone on the incidence of postoperative vomiting during the first 24 hours (primary outcome) in children undergoing total or partial tonsillectomy with a noninferiority margin set at 9%. One hundred sixty children undergoing total or partial tonsillectomy under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to receive either IV dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg (n = 79) or methylprednisolone 2.5 mg/kg (n = 81) after induction of anesthesia. Secondary analysis of all studied outcomes was also performed according to the type of surgery.

Results

An intention-to-treat analysis showed an overall incidence of vomiting of 30% in the dexamethasone group and of 22% in the methylprednisolone group (difference: 8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -5% to 21%). A per protocol analysis showed an incidence of vomiting of 32% and 23%, respectively (difference: 9%, and 95% CI of the difference: -5 to 23%, P(sup) = 0.28). The time and quality of oral intake and the duration of IV hydration, as well as pain and satisfaction scores and the need for analgesics, were similar between the 2 groups. The incidence of vomiting was also similar in patients who had total versus partial tonsillectomy; however, time to first oral intake, duration of IV hydration, and the need for analgesics were less with better satisfaction scores in partial versus total tonsillectomy patients.

Conclusion

Methylprednisolone is at worst 5% less effective than dexamethasone by the intention-to-treat analysis, and by the per protocol analysis. Thus, it is noninferior to dexamethasone in preventing vomiting after tonsillectomy in children.

### Common questions about streptococcal pharyngitis [^1144dknB]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection causes 15% to 30% of sore throats in children and 5% to 15% in adults, and is more common in the late winter and early spring. The strongest independent predictors of GABHS pharyngitis are patient age of five to 15 years, absence of cough, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudates, and fever. To diagnose GABHS pharyngitis, a rapid antigen detection test should be ordered in patients with a modified Centor or FeverPAIN score of 2 or 3. First-line treatment for GABHS pharyngitis includes a 10-day course of penicillin or amoxicillin. Patients allergic to penicillin can be treated with firstgeneration cephalosporins, clindamycin, or macrolide antibiotics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are more effective than acetaminophen and placebo for treatment of fever and pain associated with GABHS pharyngitis; medicated throat lozenges used every two hours are also effective. Corticosteroids provide only a small reduction in the duration of symptoms and should not be used routinely.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^114i1pWY]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Intratympanic corticosteroid injections for tinnitus — dexamethasone and methylprednisolone — were evaluated in randomized trials versus placebo across idiopathic tinnitus unresponsive to medical treatment (n = 107), acute unilateral tinnitus of presumed cochlear origin (n = 54), and "refractory" tinnitus (n = 30). In the Yener trial, patients received six intratympanic injections as two injections per week for 3 weeks, and the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) was measured at baseline, 1 week, one month, and six months after protocol completion. No differences were reported at 1 week, but THI scores were lower at one (p = 0.05) and six months (p = 0.037) with dexamethasone versus placebo. In the Lee and Choi trials, injections were administered four times over 2 weeks and there were no statistical differences between groups after 4 weeks or at 4 weeks. Adverse events were not reported in any of the three dexamethasone RCTs. For intratympanic methylprednisolone, one RCT in subjective tinnitus of cochlear origin refractory to medical treatment (n = 70) used three injections once weekly for 3 weeks and observed no differences in THI or other outcomes at 5 weeks, with mild adverse events including pain on injection, vertigo, burning around the ear and throat, and bitter taste. The Work Group developed a Weak against recommendation for the use of intratympanic corticosteroids because of the lack of evidence to support the benefit of using these agents for tinnitus management.

### Dose ranging study on the effect of preoperative dexamethasone on postoperative quality of recovery and opioid consumption after ambulatory gynaecological surgery [^1173Zu3r]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Glucocorticoids are commonly administered before ambulatory surgery, although their effects on quality of recovery are not well characterized. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dose-dependent effects of dexamethasone on patient recovery using the Quality of Recovery 40 questionnaire (QoR-40) after ambulatory surgery.

Methods

This prospective, double-blind trial studied 106 female subjects undergoing outpatient gynaecological laparoscopy. Subjects were randomized to receive saline, dexamethasone 0.05 mg kg(-1) or dexamethasone 0.1 mg kg(-1) before induction. The primary outcome was global QoR-40 at 24 h. Postoperative pain, analgesic consumption, side-effects, and discharge time were also evaluated.

Results

Global median (IQR) QoR-40 after dexamethasone 0.1 mg kg(-1) 193 (192–195) was greater than dexamethasone 0.05 mg kg(-1) 179 (175–185) (P = 0.004) or saline, 171 (160–182) (P < 0.005). Median (IQR) morphine equivalents administered before discharge were 2.7 (0–6.3) mg after dexamethasone 0.1 mg kg(-1) compared with 5.3 (2.4–8.8) mg and 5.3 (2.7–7.8) mg after dexamethasone 0.05 mg kg(-1) and saline (P = 0.02). Time to meet discharge criteria was 30 min shorter after dexamethasone 0.1 mg kg(-1) compared with saline (P = 0.005). At 24 h, subjects receiving dexamethasone 0.1 mg kg(-1) had consumed less opioid analgesics, reported less sore throat, muscle pain, confusion, difficulty in falling asleep, and nausea compared with dexamethasone 0.05 mg kg(-1) and saline.

Conclusions

Dexamethasone demonstrated dose-dependent effects on quality of recovery. Dexamethasone 0.1 mg kg(-1) reduced opioid consumption compared with dexamethasone 0.05 mg kg(-1), which may be beneficial for improving recovery after ambulatory gynaecological surgery.

Data synthesis and statistical methods

For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference and its corresponding 95% confidence interval. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the relative risk and its corresponding 95% confidence interval and determined the absolute effect by multiplying the relative risk and its confidence interval with the estimated baseline risk. The median of the placebo group of included randomised controlled trials provided the baseline risk.

Statistical heterogeneity was determined with the Q statistic and I 2. We used the DerSimonian-Laird random effects model for the meta-analysis of all outcomes. Regardless of the observed statistical heterogeneity, we conducted the following prespecified subgroup analyses when each subgroup was represented by at least two studies: age (children v adults), postulating a larger effect in adults; route of administration of corticosteroids (oral v parenteral), postulating a larger effect for parenteral; presence or absence of positive results on culture for a bacterial pathogen or direct antigen test for group A β haemolytic streptococcus, postulating a larger effect in patients with positive test results; initial setting (emergency departments v family practice), postulating a larger effect in patients consulting the emergency department; and place of subsequent care (admitted to hospital v outpatient), postulating a larger effect among the patients admitted. For subgroup analysis, we tested for interaction using a χ 2 significance test. We planned to examine publication bias using funnel plots for outcomes for which data from 10 or more studies were available. Data were analysed with STATA software (version 14.2, TX, USA).

Patient involvement

Five patient representatives were full members of the guideline panel, and contributed to the selection and prioritisation of outcomes, values and preferences assessments, and critical feedback to the protocol for the systematic review and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^113ox9D4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children — perioperative management and monitoring: The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are < 3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA; apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir < 80%, or both).

Other adjuncts

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been found to relieve postoperative pain and reduce postoperative opioid consumption in many surgical settings via various routes. Intraoperative administration of DEX could reduce perioperative and PACU opioid consumption as well as postoperative pain intensity in the PACU after neurosurgery. IV DEX was proved effective for preventing emergence agitation and reducing severe pain and the requirement of rescue drugs in the PACU in children. IV DEX at sedative doses initiated at the end of main procedures of the surgery to the time in the PACU resulted in better postoperative hemodynamic stability than fentanyl or remifentanil with a similar effect of pain control in the PACU.DEX as an intrathecal adjuvant with ropivacaine for spinal anesthesia provided better postoperative analgesia after infraumbilical surgeries as compared with MgSO 4.DEX as an epidural adjuvant had a greater analgesic and local anesthetic-sparing effect, compared with fentanyl, in the early postoperative period in children undergoing major orthopedic lower extremity surgery. The use of DEX as an adjunct to an ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block resulted in reduced pain following pediatric inguinal hernia repair in the PACU and a prolongation of the period to first supplemental analgesia demand.DEX local wound infiltration 5 minutes prior to skin incision significantly reduced perioperative (including PACU) fentanyl consumption, and subsequently ensured earlier discharge from PACU and less side effects. Perioperative usage of DEX has been used for postoperative analgesia, although heart rate needs to be monitored cautiously.

Perioperative usage of dexamethasone has been frequently studied for effective postoperative analgesia as well. A meta-analysis indicated that a single perioperative dose of dexamethasone (IV) had significant analgesic benefits with decreasing postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption, increasing time for the first dose of analgesic and shortening stays in the PACU. A single dose of dexamethasone (IV) 15 minutes before the induction of anesthesia enhanced ketamine's postoperative analgesic effects in children after tonsillectomy in the PACU. Low doses of dexamethasone (IV) administered at the time of block completion significantly prolonged the postoperative analgesic duration of single-shot interscalene block after arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Perineural dexamethasone added as an adjuvant of ropivacaine was more effective than IV in extending the duration of ropivacaine in interscalene brachial plexus blocks with lowering pain scores within 24 hours after surgery. Epidural dexamethasone added to bupivacaine also prolonged the duration of postoperative analgesia. Further studies are warranted to determine the optimal dosage with the minimized risk.

### Lidocaine for preventing postoperative sore throat [^114M9Tbm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common side-effect of general anaesthesia and is reported by between 30% and 70% of patients after tracheal intubation. The likelihood of a sore throat varies with the type, diameter, and cuff pressure of the endotracheal tube used. If intubation is essential, it may be helpful to give drugs prophylactically to alleviate postoperative sore throat. Local anaesthetics and steroids have been used for this purpose. This review was originally published in 2009 and was updated in 2015.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and any harm caused by topical and systemic lidocaine used prophylactically to prevent postoperative sore throat in adults undergoing general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2013), and EMBASE (1980 to October 2013). We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field. The original search was undertaken in June 2007. We reran the search in February 2015 and found four studies of interest. We will deal with those studies when we next update the review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of topical and systemic prophylactic lidocaine therapy versus control (using air or saline) that reported on the risk and severity of postoperative sore throat as an outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information, such as the risk of any adverse effects.

Main Results

We included 19 studies involving 1940 participants in this updated review. Of those 1940 participants, 952 received topical or systemic lidocaine therapy and 795 were allocated to the control groups. Topical and systemic lidocaine therapy appeared to reduce the risk of postoperative sore throat (16 studies, 1774 participants, risk ratio (RR) was 0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.85), the quality of the evidence was low), although when only high-quality trials were included (eight studies, 814 participants) the effect was no longer significant (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.09). Lidocaine given systemically in two studies (320 participants) did not reveal evidence of an effect (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.05). The severity of sore throat as measured on a visual-analogue scale (VAS) was reduced by lidocaine therapy (six trials, 611 participants, (mean difference (MD) -10.80, 95% CI -14.63 to -6.98). The adverse effects of lidocaine were not reported in these studies, though toxicity is generally rare.

Authors' Conclusions

In our revised systematic review, although the results of included studies show generally positive results, they should be interpreted carefully. The effect size of lidocaine appeared to be affected by study quality; drug concentration; route of administration; management of cuff pressure during anaesthesia; the included population; and the type of outcome measured.

Other considerations — certainty of evidence ratings state that the panel agreed the overall certainty of the evidence for glucocorticoids in critical COVID-19 was moderate due to indirectness and imprecision, and for severe COVID-19 was moderate due to indirectness since the evidence was from dexamethasone.

### Budesonide for chronic asthma in children and adults [^1167y82r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled budesonide is a widely used inhaled corticosteroid for asthma.

Objectives

The objectives of this review was to compare the efficacy of budesonide with placebo in the treatment of chronic asthma.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group Trial Register and reference lists of articles was searched. We contacted trialists for additional studies and searched abstracts of major respiratory society meetings (1997–1999).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials in children and adults comparing budesonide to placebo in the treatment of chronic asthma.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion and methodological quality. One reviewer extracted data.

Main Results

43 studies met the inclusion criteria (2801 subjects). In non-oral steroid treated asthmatics, budesonide led to significant improvements in a number of measures of airway function. These included FEV1, Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 3.7% predicted (95% CI 0.1, 7.2%); improvement in morning peak flow (PEF) from baseline WMD 29 L/min (95% CI 22, 36 L/min); improvement in evening PEF from baseline WMD 21 L/min (95% CI 13, 29 L/min). Varying methods of reporting symptoms limited the pooling of studies but all high methodological quality studies demonstrated significant improvements compared to placebo. Health status was not reported. Risk of trial withdrawal due to asthma exacerbation was lower with budesonide compared to placebo, relative risk 0.17 (95% CI 0.09, 0.33). Doses of 500–800 mcg/d appeared to have slightly larger effect sizes than lower doses, but no advantage for high doses were apparent. A single high quality RCT reported significant reductions in daily prednisolone requirement and the number of patients able to discontinue prednisolone completely in budesonide treated subjects compared to placebo. No difference in risk of oropharyngeal soreness/hoarseness or oral Candidiasis was apparent for budesonide compared to placebo. Long-term risk of adrenal insufficiency was not reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review strongly supports use of budesonide in chronic asthma. Consensus guidelines for chronic asthma suggest titrating inhaled steroid dose to individual requirements. Evidence from this review of trials does not present a case for routine dose titration above 800 mcg/d.
