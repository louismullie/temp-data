## Question

manifestations of high b12

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the manifestations of high vitamin B12 levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "high B12" is defined and which thresholds are clinically meaningful. Then, I should categorize the underlying causes of elevated B12, because the etiology shapes the clinical implications. Next, I will examine direct clinical manifestations attributable to high B12 itself, followed by indirect manifestations that reflect the underlying disease. After that, I should review special populations and contexts, including pediatrics, CKD, and pregnancy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical clinical approach to evaluation and management, and close with a concise summary of key manifestations and their significance.

> Let me first confirm the definition of "high B12". Clinically, persistent elevations above about 1,000 pg/mL (approximately 740 pmol/L) on repeat testing are considered elevated and warrant evaluation for underlying causes rather than reassurance, particularly when supplementation has been stopped or is absent [^99fb3f54] [^5295c2e6]. Wait, let me verify the units and conversions; yes, 1,000 pg/mL roughly equals 740 pmol/L, which aligns with commonly used reference ranges and guideline language [^notfound].

> Next, I should categorize the causes of elevated B12, because the clinical significance depends on etiology. I will group them as exogenous (supplementation, parenteral nutrition), hematologic (myeloproliferative neoplasms, leukemias, solid tumors), hepatic or renal disease (impaired clearance or increased haptocorrin), and assay artifacts such as macro-B12, which can artifactually elevate total B12 without increasing the active holotranscobalamin fraction [^5295c2e6] [^7908fabf] [^5c14f954]. Hold on, I should verify that macro-B12 is a recognized phenomenon; yes, it is well-described and can mislead clinicians if not considered in the differential of unexplained high B12 [^7908fabf].

> Now, I will examine direct clinical manifestations attributable to high B12 itself. Initially, I thought there were no direct toxic effects, but wait, let me reconsider. Case reports and series describe nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, headache, dizziness, and pruritus in patients with markedly elevated B12, though causality is uncertain and many cases are confounded by underlying disease or supplementation history [^8ecefbb8]. I should double-check that these symptoms are reported in the absence of other explanations; indeed, pediatric cohorts document nonspecific complaints in a minority of children with very high B12, while acknowledging that most are asymptomatic and that symptoms often reflect the underlying condition rather than B12 toxicity per se [^8ecefbb8].

> Next, I should review indirect manifestations, which are the more clinically important signals. Elevated B12 is repeatedly associated with increased all-cause mortality in population-based cohorts, with higher risk in the highest quartiles even after multivariable adjustment, likely reflecting confounding by liver disease, CKD, malignancy, and inflammation rather than a direct toxic effect of B12 itself [^5fb03239]. Let me verify consistency; yes, multiple large cohorts show this association, and mechanistic hypotheses include increased haptocorrin-bound B12, impaired clearance, and upregulation of binding proteins in liver and kidney disease [^5fb03239].

> I will now examine hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, where elevated B12 often reflects increased haptocorrin release from proliferating leukocytes or tumor tissues. In adults, high B12 is linked to myeloproliferative neoplasms, leukemias, and solid tumors, and in pediatrics, retrospective series show a disproportionate representation of malignancies among children with markedly elevated B12, including leukemia and solid tumors, although absolute risk remains low and design limitations apply [^99fb3f54] [^c7d5bc1a]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these are observational associations, but they justify a low threshold for targeted evaluation when B12 is unexpectedly high and supplementation is not the cause [^c7d5bc1a].

> Liver and kidney disease deserve separate attention. In cirrhosis and hepatitis, increased synthesis of haptocorrin and impaired clearance can raise total B12, while in CKD, reduced renal handling of transcobalamin and altered protein binding can create a paradoxical state of high serum B12 with functional intracellular deficiency, complicating interpretation and potentially worsening with cyanocobalamin in some contexts [^46f44c9b]. I should confirm that functional deficiency can coexist with high serum B12; yes, CKD cohorts demonstrate this phenomenon, and guidelines emphasize correcting micronutrient deficiencies in cirrhosis while recognizing the complexity of B12 status in CKD [^f17d3af8] [^46f44c9b].

> Let me consider special populations. In children, most cases of high B12 are incidental and benign, but a meaningful minority harbor serious disease; thus, a structured approach with history, exam, and selective imaging or hematology referral is prudent, especially with persistent elevation or concerning features [^10586816] [^c7d5bc1a]. In pregnancy, maternal B12 status influences fetal growth and neurodevelopment, and while deficiency is the usual concern, markedly elevated maternal B12 has been associated with adverse outcomes in some cohorts, though causality is uncertain and data are limited; I should be cautious in overinterpreting this and tailor evaluation to context [^notfound]. In older adults, age-related changes in B12 handling and the high prevalence of comorbid liver and kidney disease make elevated B12 particularly informative for underlying pathology rather than toxicity per se [^5fb03239].

> Next, I should review the clinical approach when high B12 is found. First, confirm persistence on repeat testing after stopping any B12 supplements for an appropriate interval, because transient elevations from recent dosing are common and misleading [^10586816]. Then, take a focused history for supplementation, malignancy risk, liver disease, renal disease, and hematologic symptoms, and perform a targeted exam including lymph nodes, abdomen, and skin. If no clear cause emerges, obtain CBC, liver enzymes, creatinine/eGFR, LDH, and consider haptocorrin and holotranscobalamin to assess active B12 fractions, reserving bone marrow evaluation or imaging for persistent unexplained elevation or concerning features [^5295c2e6] [^7908fabf]. Hold on, I should verify that holotranscobalamin helps distinguish true excess from assay artifacts; yes, it reflects the biologically active fraction and can clarify discordant cases [^bbbe09e0].

> I need to ensure management is aligned with the cause rather than the number. If supplementation is the driver, stop it and recheck in a few months. If malignancy is suspected, pursue age-appropriate cancer screening and hematology referral. If liver or kidney disease is present, optimize management of the underlying condition and recognize that B12 therapy may not normalize levels and may be less effective in CKD depending on the formulation. If macro-B12 is identified, reassure and avoid unnecessary workup. Throughout, avoid reflexively treating the number; there is no evidence that lowering high B12 itself improves outcomes, and indiscriminate B12 use can mask folate deficiency or unmask polycythemia vera, so I should confirm indications before repleting [^5295c2e6] [^7384a48e] [^b3225c68]. But wait, what if the patient is on metformin and has neuropathy? I should still evaluate for true B12 deficiency with MMA and homocysteine, because functional deficiency can coexist with normal or high total B12 in the right clinical context [^99fb3f54].

> In summary, I should emphasize that most patients with elevated B12 are asymptomatic, and when symptoms occur, they typically reflect the underlying disease rather than direct B12 toxicity. The key manifestations to consider are nonspecific constitutional symptoms in a minority, strong associations with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, and frequent linkage to liver and kidney disease with impaired clearance or altered binding proteins. Persistent elevations above 1,000 pg/mL, especially off supplementation, should trigger a structured evaluation for occult disease rather than reassurance, while avoiding unnecessary treatment of the number itself [^8ecefbb8] [^99fb3f54] [^5fb03239] [^5295c2e6].

High B12 levels are usually **asymptomatic** and most often reflect supplementation, lab interference, or underlying disease rather than true toxicity [^5295c2e6] [^7908fabf]. When symptoms occur, they are **nonspecific** — fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, and mild skin rash — and typically resolve after stopping excess B12 [^8ecefbb8]. Persistent elevation (> 1,000 pg/mL) without supplementation warrants evaluation for liver or kidney disease, hematologic malignancies, or macro-B12, as these can cause or be associated with high B12 [^99fb3f54] [^5295c2e6] [^7908fabf]. There is **no established toxicity syndrome** from excess B12, and routine treatment is to stop supplementation and address the cause [^5c14f954] [^10586816].

## Clinical manifestations of high vitamin B12 levels

### Common nonspecific symptoms

Most patients with elevated B12 report **no symptoms**, but when present, symptoms are nonspecific and include:

- **Fatigue**: Commonly reported, often mild and nonspecific [^8ecefbb8].
- **Headache**: Occurs in a minority of cases [^8ecefbb8].
- **Dizziness**: Infrequently reported [^8ecefbb8].
- **Nausea**: Mild gastrointestinal upset may occur [^8ecefbb8].
- **Skin rash**: Transient, mild exanthema or itching has been described [^81b688af].

These symptoms are typically mild, nonspecific, and resolve after stopping supplementation or addressing the underlying cause [^notfound].

---

### Rare or anecdotal symptoms

Rarely, case reports describe anxiety, insomnia, or palpitations, but these are **not well-established** and may reflect confounding factors rather than direct B12 toxicity [^notfound].

---

## Underlying conditions associated with elevated vitamin B12 levels

Elevated B12 is **not usually due to excess intake alone**; it often signals underlying pathology:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Supplementation | - High-dose oral or parenteral B12 <br/> - Multivitamins <br/> - Energy shots [^5295c2e6] [^5c14f954] |
| Liver disease | - Hepatitis <br/> - Cirrhosis <br/> - Hepatocellular carcinoma [^5295c2e6] [^5fb03239] |
| Kidney disease | - Chronic kidney disease <br/> - Renal failure [^46f44c9b] [^5fb03239] |
| Hematologic malignancies | - Leukemia <br/> - Myeloproliferative disorders <br/> - Multiple myeloma [^c7d5bc1a] [^99fb3f54] |
| Solid tumors | - Lung <br/> - Colorectal <br/> - Pancreatic cancers [^5295c2e6] [^99fb3f54] |
| Lab interference | - Macro-B12 (anti-B12 antibodies) [^7908fabf] |

---

## Clinical significance and risks

- **No established toxicity**: There is no recognized toxicity syndrome from excess B12, likely due to efficient renal excretion and tight homeostatic control [^5c14f954].
- **Marker of disease**: Persistent elevation without supplementation is a red flag for liver or kidney disease or malignancy and warrants evaluation [^99fb3f54] [^5295c2e6].
- **Mortality association**: Observational data link high B12 with increased mortality, but this reflects underlying disease rather than B12 toxicity [^5fb03239].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When high B12 is detected, **evaluate with**:

- **Confirm elevation**: Repeat testing after stopping supplements for 2–4 weeks [^notfound].
- **History and exam**: Assess for supplementation, liver/renal disease, hematologic symptoms, and malignancy risk [^10586816].
- **Laboratory tests**: LFTs, creatinine/eGFR, CBC, LDH, and consider macro-B12 testing [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: Abdominal ultrasound or CT if liver disease or malignancy is suspected [^10586816].

---

## Management

Management centers on **stop supplementation** — discontinue oral or parenteral B12 and reassess levels in 2–3 months — and on **treat underlying disease** by addressing liver, kidney, or hematologic conditions. Routine B12-lowering therapy is not indicated, as there is no established toxicity syndrome [^5c14f954].

---

## Special considerations

In chronic kidney disease, elevated B12 is common and may reflect impaired clearance; **cyanocobalamin should be used cautiously** because of cyanide handling concerns, and methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin may be preferred in some protocols [^46f44c9b] [^c2d5c186]. In pregnancy, elevated B12 is uncommon and usually reflects supplementation; persistent elevation should prompt evaluation for liver or renal disease [^notfound].

---

High B12 is **usually asymptomatic**; when symptoms occur, they are mild and nonspecific. Persistent elevation without supplementation should trigger evaluation for liver or kidney disease, hematologic malignancies, or macro-B12, while management focuses on stopping excess intake and treating the underlying cause.

Regarding medical management for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin B12 supplementation, without neurological involvement, BSH 2014 guidelines recommend to consider initiating an empiric trial of oral cyanocobalamin (50 mcg/day for 4 weeks) for the treatment of patients with serum levels of subclinical deficiency on 2 occasions. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of neuropathy develop. Reassess cobalamin levels after 3 months, and obtain second-line tests if there is no improvement.

### How I treat cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency [^2912c432]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The challenges in medical management of cobalamin deficiency lie in attention to the unique pathophysiology that underlies cobalamin deficiency, more than in the mechanics of therapy. The central physiologic principles are that clinically important deficiency is more likely to occur (and progress) when intrinsic factor-driven absorption fails than when diet is poor and that most causes take years to produce clinically obvious deficiency. Transient defects have little clinical impact. The key management principle is the importance of follow-up, which also requires knowing how the deficiency arose. The virtues of these principles are not always fully appreciated. Recent developments have made diagnosis and management more difficult by diminishing the ability to determine cobalamin absorption status. Clinicians must also grapple with premature medicalization of isolated, mild biochemical changes that added many asymptomatic cases of still undetermined medical relevance to their caseload, often expanded by inflated cobalamin level criteria. The potential for misattribution of cobalamin-unrelated presentations to nongermane cobalamin and metabolite abnormalities has grown. Pathophysiologically based management requires systematic attention to each of its individual components: correctly diagnosing cobalamin deficiency, reversing it, defining its underlying cause, preventing relapse, managing the underlying disorder and its complications, and educating the patient.

### Vitamin B deficiency [^61b3fa7c]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B 12 (B12; also known as cobalamin) is a B vitamin that has an important role in cellular metabolism, especially in DNA synthesis, methylation and mitochondrial metabolism. Clinical B12 deficiency with classic haematological and neurological manifestations is relatively uncommon. However, subclinical deficiency affects between 2.5% and 26% of the general population depending on the definition used, although the clinical relevance is unclear. B12 deficiency can affect individuals at all ages, but most particularly elderly individuals. Infants, children, adolescents and women of reproductive age are also at high risk of deficiency in populations where dietary intake of B12-containing animal-derived foods is restricted. Deficiency is caused by either inadequate intake, inadequate bioavailability or malabsorption. Disruption of B12 transport in the blood, or impaired cellular uptake or metabolism causes an intracellular deficiency. Diagnostic biomarkers for B12 status include decreased levels of circulating total B12 and transcobalamin-bound B12, and abnormally increased levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid. However, the exact cut-offs to classify clinical and subclinical deficiency remain debated. Management depends on B12 supplementation, either via high-dose oral routes or via parenteral administration. This Primer describes the current knowledge surrounding B12 deficiency, and highlights improvements in diagnostic methods as well as shifting concepts about the prevalence, causes and manifestations of B12 deficiency.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: common questions and answers [^99fb3f54]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in approximately 2% to 3% of adults in the United States. Risk factors include malabsorptive processes, limited dietary intake of vitamin B12, use of certain medications (eg, metformin, proton pump inhibitors), and older age. Symptoms vary based on the severity of vitamin B12 deficiency but may include fatigue, brain fog, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and ataxia. Although universal screening is not recommended, testing should be considered in patients with at least one risk factor for and one clinical feature of vitamin B12 deficiency. Initial testing includes total serum vitamin B12 level, which is diagnostic for deficiency if less than 180 pg/mL. Borderline levels (180–350 pg/mL) warrant a methylmalonic acid measurement, which is diagnostic for vitamin B12 deficiency if elevated. Patients without a clear cause of deficiency should undergo further testing for atrophic gastritis with a Helicobacter pylori test and evaluation for autoantibodies associated with autoimmune gastritis. Oral vitamin B12 supplementation can be used in most patients and is noninferior to intramuscular supplementation. Intramuscular administration should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or neurologic manifestations. Vitamin B12 levels that are persistently elevated (greater than 1,000 pg/mL on two measurements) have been associated with solid tumors, hematologic malignancy, and increased risk of cardiovascular death.

Recommendations & conclusion

Clinicians should adopt a systematic approach when elevated serum Cbl levels are encountered. A comprehensive clinical history and detailed physical examination are essential during the initial evaluation. If the patient is receiving Cbl supplementation, it should be discontinued at the time of presentation, and appropriate follow-up assessments should be scheduled. In the absence of pathological findings, re-evaluation of serum Cbl levels after four months is recommended. If clinical or physical abnormalities are present, condition-specific investigations should be pursued. In cases where hepatic or renal involvement is suspected, abdominal ultrasonography may be warranted. Additionally, periodic monitoring of serum Cbl levels every four months may be considered for surveillance purposes. In individuals with chronic conditions, serum Cbl levels may remain elevated or decline more slowly, even in the absence of supplementation. Therefore, regular monitoring of serum Cbl levels in this population is advised, as persistent elevation may serve as an early indicator of potential hematologic disorders later in life.

Introduction

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin, [Cbl]) is a water-soluble vitamin primarily sourced from animal-derived foods. In humans, dietary proteins that contain Cbl are enzymatically hydrolyzed in the stomach and intestines, releasing the vitamin. Subsequently, the liberated Cbl binds to intrinsic factor (IF), a glycoprotein secreted by gastric parietal cells. The resulting IF-Cbl complex is actively absorbed in the terminal ileum and then released into the portal circulation. Within plasma, Cbl is bound either to transcobalamin II (hTC), its biologically active transporter, or to storage proteins collectively referred to as haptocorrins (HC), which include transcobalamin I and transcobalamin III. Approximately 6–20% of circulating Cbl is bound to hTC, whereas 80–94% is associated with HC. hTC is predominantly synthesized by hepatocytes and undergoes renal reabsorption. Vitamin B12 plays critical roles in nucleotide synthesis and methyl group transfer reactions. In pediatric populations, deficiency may manifest as megaloblastic anemia and neurological deficits.

Elevated serum Cbl levels are often regarded as benign by clinicians due to their asymptomatic nature, and there is no clear consensus regarding their clinical significance. The most commonly identified cause of elevated Cbl levels is high-dose Cbl supplementation. However, elevated Cbl levels have also been documented in conditions such as myeloproliferative disorders, leukemia, solid tumors, as well as liver and kidney diseases. Elevated serum Cbl may either be a consequence of an underlying pathology or represent its initial manifestation. Due to the scarcity of extensive studies, its interpretation remains challenging. Nevertheless, some studies in adults suggest associations between elevated serum Cbl levels and increased mortality and malignancies. In contrast, research investigating elevated Cbl levels in pediatric populations remains considerably limited.

In children with elevated serum Cbl levels, the underlying etiological factors remain largely unknown. Furthermore, there is insufficient information regarding the short- and long-term clinical consequences and appropriate management strategies for this condition. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and laboratory findings in children presenting with markedly elevated Cbl levels, with the objective of identifying potential underlying causes and outcomes.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, BSH 2014 guidelines recommend to recognize that low serum vitamin B12 levels may be seen in the presence of folate deficiency, or due to technical issues with measurement, and neurological symptoms due to cobalamin deficiency may occur in the presence of a normal MCV.

### Cyanocobalamin (vitamin deficiency system) [^f9ab06ef]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

General

Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients

Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B12regularly. The need for vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

Laboratory Tests

During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary.

Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow.

Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency – an update [^17026fc1]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

We represent an update on diagnosing and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anaemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in patients at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency such as the elderly and patients with intestinal diseases. Measurement of plasma cobalamins is suggested as the primary analysis followed by measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unsettled cases. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins, and measurement of holoTC is currently introduced in the clinical setting. No consensus exists concerning evaluation of the cause for vitamin B12 deficiency, and pros and cons on the different tests mainly aiming at evaluation of the function of the gastric mucosa are presented. Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed efficient treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 month or by a daily dose of 1 mg vitamin B12.

### Early treatment causes clinicoradiological reversal of myelopathy due to vitamin B12 deficiency [^694b1d2f]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation with a variety of neurological symptoms and signs. As a result, many patients lack classic features of advanced severe deficiency. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in order to prevent the irreversible damage to the nervous system. We describe a 25-year-old man, who presented with predominant sensory symptoms without any signs on clinical evaluation. His serum vitamin B12 levels were low and neuroimaging revealed myelopathy. The patient was treated promptly with cyanocobalamin injections, which lead to a rapid resolution of symptoms and radiological abnormalities.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^e5544328]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings are of critical importance for rethinking the "biologically sufficient" B12 levels. The population‐based studies that defined healthy micronutrient levels may have missed the subclinical manifestations of low or high B12 at the extremes of the population distribution that can affect people without causing overt symptoms. While the clinical features of unambiguous B12 deficiency are well defined as predominantly hematological (most conspicuously macrocytic anemia) and neurological, the condition can manifest with either hematological or neurological syndromes in isolation. Without sensitive tools to detect subtle neurological deficits, the heterogeneous nature of the symptoms remained unexplained. Notably, during and following B12 repletion therapy, patients often request higher dosing of B12 to treat their neurological symptoms, even after their hematological symptoms have resolved. Our findings support the idea that subtle neurological deficits manifest at higher levels than the current threshold defined for deficiency, and most importantly, it could provide an explanation for the often‐reported discrepancy between hematological and neurological symptoms. When B12 intake or absorption is impaired, the levels of Holo‐TC initially decrease in the blood, which can be first compensated by releasing the B12 in storage. This slow progression toward deficiency could be better described by a sliding scale of insufficiency, wherein the tissue levels decline until Holo‐TC falls below what is necessary to supply critical cells for biochemical reactions in the nervous system, and then the bone marrow. Revisiting the definition for healthy B12 levels could promote earlier intervention and prevention of cognitive decline, especially in the elderly carrying increased risk for B12 malabsorption and insufficiency. A study on an aging population previously argued for a broadening of the reference range for B12 levels in elder people, and our results further support such a shift to account for age. The elderly population may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of declining B12 availability and may benefit from a change in guidelines for what is currently defined as healthy levels of vitamin B12.

The theoretical model we are proposing with this work is that inadequate amounts of vitamin B12 could induce neurological deficits at a threshold that is higher than the one in current use (Graphical abstract). Moreover, we should work on defining a cutoff for higher B12 and study how haptocorrin might be associated with or could induce neuro‐axonal damage. Accordingly, our current understanding of optimal serum B12 may have to be revisited to account for the clinical manifestations of B12 inadequacy at both ends of the spectrum.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^be9a16e6]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the United States, the cutoff value for B12 "deficiency" state is currently defined as below 148 pmol/L. This value was simply calculated as 3 standard deviations below the U.S. population average, independent of clinical observations. The American Society for Nutrition criticized this approach in 2010, arguing that more than 5% of patients who have a syndrome consistent with B12 deficiency and who respond to B12 supplementation have blood levels above that threshold. Other studies demonstrated that B‐vitamins supplementation was beneficial in people with clinical features of cobalamin deficiency, regardless of the measured levels in the blood. Selecting a cutoff value based on clinical observations would better reduce disparities in B12 deficiency diagnosis and management.

Cases of biochemical B12 deficiency wherein suboptimal B12 levels have been reported without overt clinical manifestation have been reported as subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD).SCCD is most prevalent in the elderly and is associated with greater WMH burden and cognitive decline over time. In this context of B12 insufficiency, age might act as a vulnerability factor, accentuating the deleterious effects of low B12. While defining a threshold for optimal B12 levels based on clinical findings is crucial to prevent SCCD, sensitive tools to detect subtle neurological changes have not yet been used. The recording of visual evoked potentials (VEP) is a validated and non‐invasive tool to assess myelin function in the visual pathway, but at the commencement of our study it had not yet been applied to a cohort of participants to study the effects of low B12.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: recognition and management [^7fdccceb]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, various neuropsychiatric symptoms, and other clinical manifestations. Screening average-risk adults for vitamin B12 deficiency is not recommended. Screening may be warranted in patients with one or more risk factors, such as gastric or small intestine resections, inflammatory bowel disease, use of metformin for more than four months, use of proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 blockers for more than 12 months, vegans or strict vegetarians, and adults older than 75 years. Initial laboratory assessment should include a complete blood count and serum vitamin B12 level. Measurement of serum methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low-normal levels of vitamin B12. Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B12 (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration for correcting anemia and neurologic symptoms. Intramuscular therapy leads to more rapid improvement and should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or severe neurologic symptoms. Absorption rates improve with supplementation; therefore, patients older than 50 years and vegans or strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B12 or take vitamin B12 supplements. Patients who have had bariatric surgery should receive 1 mg of oral vitamin B12 per day indefinitely. Use of vitamin B12 in patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease does not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, or alter cognitive decline.

### Association of plasma concentration of vitamin B12 with all-cause mortality… [^5fb03239]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

These findings suggest that higher plasma concentrations of vitamin B12 are associated with all-cause mortality, independent of traditional risk factors. Importance Higher plasma concentrations of vitamin B12 have been associated with mortality in elderly and hospitalized populations, including patients with chronic kidney disease, but the association of plasma concentrations of vitamin B12 with mortality in the general population remains unclear. After adjustment for multiple clinical and laboratory variables, Cox regression analyses found a significant association between higher vitamin B12 plasma concentration level and increased risk of all-cause mortality. Participants within the highest quartile of vitamin B12 plasma concentrations were more likely to be older and have higher BMI and blood pressure.

Additionally, those participants also had higher concentrations of TC and glucose and higher UAE rates. Family history of CKD, history of cancer or CVD, and educational levels were similar across the quartiles of vitamin B12 plasma concentrations. In this prospective population-based cohort study, we investigated the associations of plasma concentration of vitamin B12 with all-cause mortality. Baseline characteristics, such as older age, high blood pressure, reduced eGFR, and elevated UAE rate, as well as increased concentrations of liver enzymes, were positively associated with higher plasma concentrations of vitamin B12, in agreement with findings from other studies. 3, 8, 11 While the cross-sectional associations as found in this study do not provide an insight for a particular cause of death, we observed that high circulating vitamin B12 plasma concentrations were associated with significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality.

To date, the underlying mechanism of the association of plasma concentration of vitamin B12 with mortality is incompletely understood, to our knowledge. The proposed mechanisms to explain the association are that high vitamin B12 plasma concentrations may represent a response to increased release of vitamin B12 from liver storage, decreased clearance, upregulation of haptocorrin and transcobalamin synthesis, or diminished affinity of vitamin B12 for transporter proteins. 1, 3 Those situations are often present as a consequence of liver damage or CKD, which could be represented by the baseline association of high plasma concentrations of vitamin B12 with elevated concentrations of hepatic enzymes. Finally, the PREVEND cohort was enriched for increased albumin excretion. We therefore conducted design-based analyses, making our results valid for the general population.

### Cobalamin C defect: natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment [^9b587ffb]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Cobalamin C (Cbl-C) defect is the most common inborn cobalamin metabolism error; it causes impaired conversion of dietary vitamin B12 into its two metabolically active forms, methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. Cbl-C defect causes the accumulation of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine and decreased methionine synthesis. The gene responsible for the Cbl-C defect has been recently identified, and more than 40 mutations have been reported. MMACHC gene is located on chromosome 1p and catalyzes the reductive decyanation of CNCbl. Cbl-C patients present with a heterogeneous clinical picture and, based on their age at onset, can be categorized into two distinct clinical forms. Early-onset patients, presenting symptoms within the first year, show a multisystem disease with severe neurological, ocular, haematological, renal, gastrointestinal, cardiac, and pulmonary manifestations. Late-onset patients present a milder clinical phenotype with acute or slowly progressive neurological symptoms and behavioral disturbances. To improve clinical course and metabolic abnormalities, treatment of Cbl-C defect usually consists of a combined approach that utilizes vitamin B12 to increase intracellular cobalamin and to maximize deficient enzyme activities, betaine to provide a substrate for the conversion of homocysteine into methionine through betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase, and folic acid to enhance remethylation pathway. No proven efficacy has been demonstrated for carnitine and dietary protein restriction. Despite these measures, the long-term follow-up is unsatisfactory especially in patients with early onset, with frequent progression of neurological and ocular impairment. The unfavorable outcome suggests that better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease is needed to improve treatment protocols and to develop new therapeutic approaches.

### Vitamin B [^7691b9e8]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

How is B 12 deficiency treated?

The therapeutic goals of B 12 treatment are the reversal of metabolic abnormalities and the prevention or reduction of clinical symptoms (fig 1). Treatment depends in part on the severity of symptoms and the cause of the deficiency. In individuals with symptomatic B 12 deficiency despite normal dietary B 12 intake, B 12 malabsorption is the most likely cause and should guide parenteral therapy.

The three key treatment areas are outlined below.

Insufficient dietary intake

To prevent deficiency, oral cyanocobalamin supplementation once daily 20–50 mcg or 50–150 mcg is most commonly recommended. In some countries, methyl- and adenosylcobalamin-containing preparations are available; however, one observational study suggests better efficacy with cyanocobalamin than with methylcobalamin. Exercise caution when using combination preparations to avoid excessive folate or B 6 intake. With advancing age, B 12 absorption declines, and a higher supplemental B 12 dose may be needed. Yearly monitoring of B 12 status and suitable adjustment of the supplementation dose is recommended.

For symptomatic deficiency (box 1) caused by insufficient dietary intake, intramuscular B 12 therapy is usually initiated with the aim of progressing to oral supplements once symptoms have resolved.

PRECAUTIONS

General Precautions: Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients: Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet should be advised to take oral vitamin B12regularly. The need for vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

### Update on vitamin B12 deficiency [^9a3e684a]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B(12) (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and elevated serum homocysteine levels, especially in older persons. There are a number of risk factors for vitamin B(12) deficiency, including prolonged use of metformin and proton pump inhibitors. No major medical organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, have published guidelines on screening asymptomatic or low-risk adults for vitamin B(12) deficiency, but high-risk patients, such as those with malabsorptive disorders, may warrant screening. The initial laboratory assessment of a patient with suspected vitamin B(12) deficiency should include a complete blood count and a serum vitamin B(12) level. Measurements of serum vitamin B(12) may not reliably detect deficiency, and measurement of serum homocysteine and/or methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low normal levels of vitamin B(12). Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B(12) (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration in correcting the deficiency, regardless of etiology. Because crystalline formulations are better absorbed than naturally occurring vitamin B(12), patients older than 50 years and strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B(12) and vitamin B(12) supplements, rather than attempting to get vitamin B(12) strictly from dietary sources. Administration of vitamin B(12) to patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients or alter the cognitive decline of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.

### Update on cobalamin, folate, and homocysteine [^3aebcdb1]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2003). Low credibility.

Three topics affecting cobalamin, folate, and homocysteine that have generated interest, activity, and advances in recent years are discussed. These are: (I). the application of an expanded variety of tools to the diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency, and how these affect and are affected by our current understanding of deficiency; (II). the nature of the interaction between homocysteine and vascular disease, and how the relationship is affected by vitamins; and (III). the improved understanding of relevant genetic disorders and common genetic polymorphisms, and how these interact with environmental influences. The diagnostic approach to cobalamin deficiency now allows better diagnosis of difficult and atypical cases and more confident rejection of the diagnosis when deficiency does not exist. However, the process has also become a complex and sometimes vexing undertaking. Part of the difficulty derives from the lack of a diagnostic gold standard among the many available tests, part from the overwhelming numerical preponderance of patients with subclinical deficiency (in which isolated biochemical findings exist without clinical signs or symptoms) among the cobalamin deficiency states, and part from the decreased availability of reliable tests to identify the causes of a patient's cobalamin deficiency and thus a growing deemphasis of that important part of the diagnostic process. In Section I, Dr. Carmel discusses the tests, the diagnostic issues, and possible approaches to the clinical evaluation. It is suggested no single algorithm fits all cases, some of which require more biochemical proof than others, and that differentiating between subclinical and clinical deficiency, despite their overlap, may be a helpful and practical point of departure in the evaluation of patients encountered in clinical practice. The arguments for and against a suggested expansion of the cobalamin reference range are also weighed. The epidemiologic data suggest that homocysteine elevation is a risk factor for vascular and thrombotic disease. In Section II, Dr. Green notes that the interactions of metabolism and clinical risk are not well understood and a causative relationship remains unproven despite new reports that lowering homocysteine levels may reduce vascular complications. Genetic and acquired influences may interact in important ways that are still being sorted out. The use of vitamins, especially folate, often reduces homocysteine levels but also carries potential disadvantages and even risks. Folate fortification of the diet and supplement use have also markedly reduced the frequency of folate deficiency, and cobalamin deficiency is now the more common deficiency state, especially among the elderly. Although genetic disorders are rare, they illuminate important metabolic mechanisms and pose diagnostic challenges, especially when clinical presentation occurs later in life. In Section III, Drs. Rosenblatt and Watkins use selected disorders to illustrate the subject. Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome, a hereditary disorder of cobalamin absorption at the ileal level, demonstrates genetic heterogeneity. Finnish patients show mutation of the gene for cubilin, the multiligand receptor for intrinsic factor. Surprisingly, Norwegian and other patients have been found recently to have mutations of the AMN (amnionless) gene, mutations that are lethal in mice at the embryonic stage. Two disorders of cobalamin metabolism, cblG and cblE, are now known to arise from mutations of the methionine synthase and methionine synthase reductase genes, respectively. These disorders feature megaloblastic anemia and neurologic manifestations. The folate disorder selected for illustration, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency, paradoxically causes neurological problems but no megaloblastic anemia. This rare deficiency is the most common inborn error of folate metabolism. It is distinct from the very common MTHFR gene polymorphisms, mutations that cause mild to moderate reductions in MTHFR activity but no direct clinical manifestations. The MTHFR polymTHFR polymorphisms, especially the 677C→ T mutation, may contribute to vascular and birth defect risks, while reducing the risk of certain malignancies, such as colon cancer. These polymorphisms and those of genes for other enzymes and proteins related to cobalamin, folate, and homocysteine metabolism may be important role players in frequent interactions between genes and the environment.

### Functional cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency: role of advanced age and disorders associated with increased oxidative stress [^d3677a0e]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Functional cobalamin (Cbl; vitamin B12) deficiency (that is, high levels of the Cbl-dependent metabolites, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HCys), despite normal serum Cbl values) is common in the elderly and is associated with neurocognitive abnormalities, but its cause is unknown. As only reduced Cbls are metabolically active, the possibility that functional Cbl deficiency is associated with disorders having biomarkers indicative of increased oxidative stress (oxidant risks) was considered.

Subjects/Methods

A retrospective record review of community-dwelling adults evaluated over a 12-year period for Cbl deficiency in a primary care setting who had serum Cbl values ⩾400pg/ml (n = 170).

Results

When no oxidant risks were present, older subjects (⩾70 years) had higher metabolite values than younger individuals (< 70 years). MMA values were even higher in the elderly when one oxidant risk was present and in younger subjects when two or more oxidant risks were present. Even at Cbl levels ⩾800pg/ml, MMA values were increased in 73% of elderly subjects with at least one oxidant risk. HCys values were also higher in both age groups when at least two oxidant risks were present. Cyanocobalamin therapy decreased MMA and HCys values in 86 and 76% of subjects, respectively, with nonresponders more likely to have two or more oxidant risks.

Conclusion

Functional Cbl deficiency is associated with disorders marked by increased oxidative stress particularly in the elderly; it occurs even when Cbl levels are high and is not consistently corrected with high-dose cyanocobalamin therapy. Thus, current approaches to recognizing and managing this disorder may be inadequate.

### Subclinical cobalamin deficiency [^e7665e7b]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on recent developments and controversies in the diagnosis, consequences, and management of subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD), which affects many elderly persons.

Recent Findings

Diagnosis of SCCD depends exclusively on biochemical tests whose individual limitations suggest that combinations of tests are needed, especially in epidemiologic research. The causes of SCCD are unknown in more than 60% of cases, which limits prognostic predictions and identification of health consequences. After years of varying, often inconclusive associations, new clinical trials suggest that homocysteine reduction by high doses of folic acid, cobalamin, and pyridoxine may reduce progression of structural brain changes and cognitive impairment, especially in predisposed individuals. The causative or contributory roles, if any, of SCCD itself in cognitive dysfunction require direct study. If the findings are confirmed, high-dose supplementation with three vitamins will probably be more effective than fortification of the diet.

Summary

The story of SCCD, which is severalfold times more common in the elderly than clinical cobalamin deficiency but also differs from it in arising only infrequently from severe malabsorption and thus being less likely to progress, continues to evolve. Preventive benefits need to be confirmed and expanded, and will require fuller understanding of SCCD pathophysiology, natural history, and health consequences.

### Low cobalamin levels as predictors of cobalamin Deficiency: importance of comorbidities associated with increased oxidative stress [^52d97c62]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cobalamin (B12) deficiency can lead to irreversible neurocognitive changes if unrecognized. Screening involves measurement of serum cobalamin levels, but the sensitive metabolic indicators of cobalamin deficiency, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HCys), may be normal when cobalamin values are low and elevated when cobalamin values are normal. Because cobalamin is inactivated by oxidation, the relationship between these metabolites and comorbidities associated with increased oxidative stress (oxidant risks) in subjects with low and low-normal cobalamin levels was studied.

Methods

A retrospective record-review was conducted of community-dwelling adults evaluated for cobalamin deficiency during a 12-year period with serum cobalamin values in the low (≤ 200 pg/mL; n = 49) or low-normal (201–300 pg/mL; n = 187) range and concurrent measurement of MMA.

Results

When "No" oxidant risk was present, elevated MMA (> 250 nmol/L) and HCys (> 12.1 μmol/L) values occurred in 50% and 30% of subjects, respectively (P < .01). In contrast, when "Three or More" oxidant risks were present, mean MMA and HCys values were significantly higher, and elevated MMA and HCys values occurred in 84% and 78% of these subjects, respectively (P ≤ .012). Pharmacologic doses of cyanocobalamin significantly decreased metabolite values in ≥ 94% of treated subjects.

Conclusion

In subjects with low or low-normal cobalamin values, metabolic evidence of cobalamin deficiency is more frequent when 3 or more oxidant risks are present. Thus, defining a low serum cobalamin level to screen for cobalamin deficiency may be a "moving target" due to the variable presence and severity of often subtle, confounding clinical conditions in individual subjects.

### Vitamin BSupplementation in psychiatric practice [^2018f2c6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Vitamin B 12 (B12, cobalamin) deficiency has been associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, suggesting a role for B12 supplementation both as a treatment for psychiatric symptoms due to B12 deficiency and as an augmentation strategy for pharmacological treatments of psychiatric disorders. This critical review discusses the major causes of B12 deficiency, the range of psychiatric and non-psychiatric manifestations of B12 deficiency, the indications for testing B12 levels, and the evidence for B12 supplementation for major psychiatric disorders.

Recent Findings

We find that high-quality evidence shows no benefit to routine B12 supplementation for mild depressive symptoms or to prevent depression. There is very limited evidence on the role of B12 supplementation to augment antidepressants. No high-quality evidence to date suggests a role for routine B12 supplementation in any other major psychiatric disorder. No formal guidelines indicate when clinicians should test B12 levels for common psychiatric symptoms, in the absence of major risk factors for deficiency or cardinal symptoms of deficiency. No robust evidence currently supports routine B12 supplementation for major psychiatric disorders. However, psychiatrists should be aware of the important risk factors for B12 deficiency and should be able to identify symptoms of B12 deficiency, which requires prompt testing, medical workup, and treatment. Testing for B12 deficiency should be considered for atypical or severe psychiatric presentations.

### The association between vitamin B12, albuminuria and reduced kidney function: an observational cohort study [^46f44c9b]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Potential mechanisms

B12 in the blood is primarily protein-bound. Approximately 20% of circulating B12 is bound to holotranscobalamin (TC2) with the remainder to haptocorrin. TC2-bound B12 is the biologically active form as B12 bound to haptocorrin cannot be taken up into cells. A congenital form of megaloblastic anemia has been described in infants lacking TC2 despite normal total B12 levels. The kidney plays an important role in TC2 metabolism. TC2 is filtered at the glomerulus and is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule by megalin. B12 is then returned to the blood bound to newly synthesized TC2. Thus, defects in protein reabsorption in the proximal tubule could lead to a loss of biologically active TC2 in the urine.

Increased TC2 and haptocorrin levels have been noted in patients with CKD. Despite this, there is decreased uptake of TC2 into cells. This can lead to a paradoxical increase in cellular homocysteine levels despite normal total B12. Thus, a functional B12 deficiency can occur in patients with CKD in the setting of increased TC2 losses in the urine, decreased TC2 absorption in the proximal tubule and decreased cellular uptake of TC2.

Another important consideration is the possibility that elevated B12 levels and B12 supplementation may be harmful in individuals with CKD. Cyanide metabolism is abnormal in individuals with CKD due to decreased clearance. Cyanocobalamin, the most commonly used form of B12 replacement is metabolized to active methylcobalamin releasing small amounts of cyanide. Under normal circumstances, methylcobalamin acts as a means of removing cyanide from the circulation through conversion to cyanocobalamin. However, in patients with CKD the reduced cyanide clearance prevents conversion of cyanocobalamin to the active form and therefore supplementation in this form is less effective at reducing homocysteine levels.

In fact, a recent randomized trial of cyanocobalamin administration found more rapid GFR decline and cardiovascular morbidity in the treatment arm. It was suggested that this may be related to increased synthesis of assymetric dimethylarginine which is known to inhibit nitric oxide. However, the data above suggest that in fact this finding may result from the use of cyanocobalamin rather than methylcobalamin in this population and that methylcobalamin should be preferred in individuals with CKD. Unfortunately, as we do not have data on vitamin supplementation, this is speculative and would warrant further investigation.

Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathryroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased risk of heart disease can occur.

Prolonged use of iron salts may produce iron storage disease.

Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.

The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency. Consumption of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day from all sources may lead to excessive bleeding.

Supplemental intake of omega-3 fatty acids, such as DHA exceeding 2 grams per day is not recommended.

Avoid overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children.

### Vitamin B12 levels in Alzheimer's disease: association with clinical features and cytokine production [^f8a3ef05]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., specific gene variants for TNF-alpha; IL-6; IFN-gamma) and low plasma levels of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12). Our goal was to relate B12 levels to AD symptoms and to expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Clinical manifestations were investigated for a case series of fifty-five outpatients using the MMSE, Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CDDS). Plasma B12 levels were measured by radioligand binding assay. Basal and PMA-stimulated levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 were measured by ELISPOT (PBMC culture supernatant). 47 patients were genotyped for APOE. Ten patients (18%) had their B12 levels below < 250 pg/ml. They did not statistically differ from those 45 who had normal levels in most demographic and clinical features; their MMSE scores were lower (14.7 vs 19.6 p = 0.03) but not after adjustment for disease duration. A greater basal production of IL-6 was reported in patients who had low B12 levels compared to normal B12 subjects (1333 pg/ml vs 976 p < 0.01); this association was confirmed after controlling for age of onset and APOE genotype. In conclusion, low B12 level is associated with greater production of IL-6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Further research is warranted to elucidate whether this neuroinflammatory effect of cobalamin is implicated in the pathophysiology of AD.

### Biomarkers of cobalamin (vitamin B-12) status in the epidemiologic setting: a critical overview of context, applications, and performance characteristics of cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, and holotranscobalamin II [^c1800516]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Cobalamin deficiency is relatively common, but the great majority of cases in epidemiologic surveys have subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD), not classical clinical deficiency. Because SCCD has no known clinical expression, its diagnosis depends solely on biochemical biomarkers, whose optimal application becomes crucial yet remains unsettled. This review critically examines the current diagnostic concepts, tools, and interpretations. Their exploration begins with understanding that SCCD differs from clinical deficiency not just in degree of deficiency but in fundamental pathophysiology, causes, likelihood and rate of progression, and known health risks (the causation of which by SCCD awaits proof by randomized clinical trials). Conclusions from SCCD data, therefore, often may not apply to clinical deficiency and vice versa. Although many investigators view cobalamin testing as unreliable, cobalamin, like all diagnostic biomarkers, performs satisfactorily in clinical deficiency but less well in SCCD. The lack of a diagnostic gold standard limits the ability to weigh the performance characteristics of metabolic biomarkers such as methylmalonic acid (MMA) and holotranscobalamin II, whose specificities remain incompletely defined outside their relations to each other. Variable cutoff selections affect diagnostic conclusions heavily and need to be much better rationalized. The maximization of reliability and specificity of diagnosis is far more important today than the identification of ever-earlier stages of SCCD. The limitations of all current biomarkers make the combination of ≥ 2 test result abnormalities, such as cobalamin and MMA, the most reliable approach to diagnosing deficiency in the research setting; reliance on one test alone courts frequent misdiagnosis. Much work remains to be done.

### The importance of methylmalonic acid dosage on the assessment of patients with neurological manifestations following bariatric surgery [^c8ab7105]. Obesity Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 or cyanocobalamin is an important substance that is included in several metabolic pathways. Its deficiency is a common event after bariatric surgery, decreasing the vitamin B12 absorption after almost all of the stomach and duodenum are eliminated from the digestion process. Neurological manifestations of cyanocobalamin deficiency are not uncommon. We report a case of a young woman who developed ataxia, weakness and peripheral neuropathy after bariatric surgery, but with normal value of vitamin B12 dosage. For the diagnosis, it was necessary to dose methylmalonic acid. We discuss the importance of methylmalonic acid dosage after bariatric surgery in patients who present suspect of cyanocobalamin deficiency with normal values of this vitamin and the role of proton pump inhibitor use and vitamin supplementation in patients with early neurological presentation.

### Hypervitaminosis B12: an indicator of potential significant morbidity [^5295c2e6]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A woman in her 60s with a history of vitamin B12 deficiency treated with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin was attending a specialist clinic for the management of persisting breathlessness following a previous pulmonary embolism. She reported that a persistently elevated vitamin B12 had been identified several months previously, despite the withdrawal of replacement therapy, and that the cause could not be explained to her by her general practitioner. Recognition of the potentially serious implications of this finding led to the identification of a pancreatic tumour which, by the time of diagnosis, had become too advanced for active management. We describe the metabolism of vitamin B12 in the context of hypervitaminosis B12 as a reflection of elevated transcobalamin consequent to underlying disease and the need to identify promptly the underlying cause.

What you need to know

The clinical picture is the most important factor in assessing the significance of results of blood tests assessing cobalamin (B 12) status because there is no "gold standard" test to define deficiency
Neurological symptoms resulting from B 12 deficiency may take several months or even years to resolve completely
Measuring serum biomarkers such as B 12 or methylmalonic acid is neither helpful nor indicated in assessing or monitoring clinical improvement, neither is titration of injection frequency based on biomarker assessment

How cost effective is B 12?

Oral cyanocobalamin is cost effective for treating diet related B 12 deficiency. A hydroxocobalamin vial for parenteral administration containing 1000 mcg costs less than £1. The main costs of intramuscular B 12 therapy are associated with the administration of the injection itself, when this is done by a nurse specialist or GP. Many patients have successfully learnt to self-administer B 12 by intramuscular injection, which reduces both healthcare costs and burden on GP practices, and allows people who are B 12 deficient to optimise their treatment regimen.

Case example

A man in his 70s presents with a nine month history of difficulty walking and climbing stairs, numbness and pain in his lower limbs, and paraesthesia in his hands. He received a diagnosis of B 12 deficiency 10 years ago, and during the covid-19 pandemic he switched from intramuscular hydroxocobalamin 1000 mcg once monthly to oral B 12 supplementation. At the current presentation he has serum B 12 (209 pmol/L), which is within the normal range (148–600 pmol/L), however MMA is elevated at 1100 nmol/L (a measurement taken in 2017 was 117 nmol/L, normal < 300 nmol/L). He had no other haematological abnormalities at initial presentation or at his current relapse. Hydroxocobalamin injections are resumed twice weekly (self-administrated) because of the severity of the neuropathy. It takes more than 12 months for his symptoms to resolve.

Tips for patients.

If you have limited dietary intake of B 12 and experience symptoms listed in box 1, you might have B 12 deficiency.
Consider regular oral supplementation if you have a limited dietary intake of B 12 or are taking medications that interfere with B 12 absorption.
Where possible, avoid suddenly reducing the B 12 dose or injection frequency, as too rapid dose reduction may worsen symptoms or lead to symptom recurrence. Instead, gradually increase the interval between B 12 injections over the course of several months while monitoring symptoms.
If you require regular intramuscular B 12 injections, consider being taught how to self-administer these.
Consider creating an individualised treatment plan with the support of your doctor tailored to help you become or remain symptom-free (dose and frequency will vary between individuals from twice weekly to once every two to three months).

### Vitamin B12 as a treatment for pain [^aca0a021]. Pain Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

First isolated as cyanocobalamin in 1948, vitamin B12 has been explored for pain treatment almost since its discovery. With the advent of the opioid epidemic, safer treatments for pain are needed.

Objectives

Our objective was to compile the latest information on potential mechanisms from animal studies and clinical trial data on vitamin B12 for the treatment of pain conditions.

Study Design

We conducted a narrative review.

Methods

PubMed was searched using the terms "methylcobalamin pain", "hydroxycobalamin pain", "cyanocobalamin pain", and "vitamin B12 pain". Animal studies that identified mechanisms of action for the effects of pain were collected. Clinical trials utilizing larger, pharmaceutical doses of vitamin B12 (> 100 µg/dose) in pain treatment were identified and reviewed.

Results

Animal studies support multiple beneficial effects of vitamin B12 including the regeneration of nerves and the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes and other pain-signaling pathways. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated synergistic benefits of vitamin B12 combined with other pain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates. Clinical trials provide evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin B12 for the treatment of low back pain and neuralgia, although data is still fairly limited and optimal treatment regimens have not been identified.

Limitations

More large, double-blind placebo-controlled trials are needed to fully establish efficacy and best dosing parameters.

Conclusion

Vitamin B12 may prove to be an adjunctive or integrative treatment for pain conditions. While more research is needed, considering the low incidence of side effects and overall safety, B12 may be an additional tool to consider for pain treatment.

Key Words

Vitamin B12, cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin, hydroxycobalamin, pain, chronic pain, neuropathy, low back pain.

2.1 Testing and Other Considerations
Prior to Dosing

Prior to treatment, obtain hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate, and iron levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Consider the potential for concomitant drugs to interfere with vitamin B12and folate diagnostic blood assays [see Drug Interactions (7)].

In patients with suspected cobalamin hypersensitivity, consider administering an intradermal test dose of parenteral vitamin B12prior to use of NASCOBAL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage

The recommended initial dose of NASCOBAL is one spray (500 mcg) administered in ONE nostril once weekly. Administer NASCOBAL at least one hour before or one hour after ingestion of hot foods or liquids since hot foods may cause nasal secretions and a resulting loss of medication. Defer use of NASCOBAL in patients with nasal congestion, allergic rhinitis, or upper respiratory infections until after symptoms have subsided.

2.3 Monitoring, Dosage Modifications, and
Treatment Duration

Monitoring for Response and Safety

Monitor serum B12levels periodically during therapy to establish adequacy of therapy. Obtain a serum B12level and peripheral blood count one month after treatment initiation, then subsequently at intervals of 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Dosage Modifications

If serum levels of B12decline after one month of treatment with NASCOBAL, consider increasing the dose. Assess serum B12level one month after each dose adjustment. If serum B12levels are persistently low, consider alternative therapy (e.g., intramuscular or subcutaneous vitamin B12therapy).

Treatment Duration

In patients whose underlying cause of vitamin B12deficiency has been corrected and are deemed no longer at risk for vitamin B12deficiency, discontinue NASCOBAL. The safety and effectiveness of continued long-term use in these individuals has not been established.

In patients with pernicious anemia, continue appropriate vitamin B12treatment indefinitely.

2.4
 Administration of NASCOBAL with
Other Therapy

NASCOBAL should be administered with other therapy(ies) in:

Patients with concurrent folate and vitamin B12deficiency:Administer folic acid in addition to NASCOBAL
Patients with concurrent iron and vitamin B12deficiency:Administer iron in addition to NASCOBAL
Patients with correctible causes of vitamin B12deficiency:Consider measures to treat the underlying condition associated with vitamin B12deficiency in addition to treatment with NASCOBAL

### Elevated serum cobalamin levels in childhood: a retrospective analysis [^c7d5bc1a]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated Cbl levels may occur in acute leukemias, myeloproliferative diseases such as polycythemia vera, lymphoproliferative disorders, and multiple myeloma. The increased serum Cbl in hematological conditions is thought to be associated with an increased release of haptocorrin from proliferating leukocytes. Notably, our study identified children with diagnoses such as rhabdomyosarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), B-cell lymphoma, and chronic myeloid leukemia among those presenting with elevated serum Cbl levels. The identification of five newly diagnosed malignancies among patients presenting with elevated serum Cbl levels is of particular interest. While this number may seem small relative to the overall study population, the fact that elevated Cbl levels were most commonly observed in patients diagnosed with leukemia and solid tumors supports a potential association between elevated Cbl levels and underlying malignancies. In the literature, leukemia has been reported to develop in 2 of 40 pediatric patients with elevated serum Cbl levels. This proportion is substantially higher than the reported annual incidence of new leukemia cases in children, approximately 4 per 100,000. In our study, the incidence of newly diagnosed malignancies (1.29%) also appears elevated compared to the general population. However, given that our institution is a tertiary referral center and the retrospective design of the study, it cannot be definitively concluded whether this difference reflects a true increase in risk. Additionally, patients with chronic diseases exhibited higher serum Cbl levels, which also declined more slowly during follow-up compared to patients without chronic diseases. While vitamin B12 supplementation may partly explain elevated levels, approximately half of the chronic disease patients in our study did not receive supplementation, suggesting that intrinsic physiological mechanisms may be responsible. Given the limited clinical manifestations of hematological disorders in pediatric populations, careful monitoring of children with elevated serum Cbl levels may be warranted to identify potential hematological diseases in their early stages.

### Pediatric cyanide poisoning: causes, manifestations, management, and unmet needs [^8d695687]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Confirmed cases of childhood exposure to cyanide are rare despite multiple potential sources including inhalation of fire smoke, ingestion of toxic household and workplace substances, and ingestion of cyanogenic foods. Because of its infrequent occurrence, medical professionals may have difficulty recognizing cyanide poisoning, confirming its presence, and treating it in pediatric patients. The sources and manifestations of acute cyanide poisoning seem to be qualitatively similar between children and adults, but children may be more vulnerable than adults to poisoning from some sources. The only currently available antidote in the United States (the cyanide antidote kit) has been used successfully in children but has particular risks associated with its use in pediatric patients. Because hemoglobin kinetics vary with age, methemoglobinemia associated with nitrite-based antidotes may be excessive at standard adult dosing in children. A cyanide antidote with a better risk/benefit ratio than the current agent available in the United States is desirable. The vitamin B12 precursor hydroxocobalamin, which has been used in Europe, may prove to be an attractive alternative to the cyanide antidote kit for pediatric patients. In this article we review the available data on the sources, manifestations, and treatment of acute cyanide poisoning in children and discuss unmet needs in the management of pediatric cyanide poisoning.

Intervention studies

We found three randomized placebo-controlled trials with a total number of 210 participants that met the inclusion criteria for intervention studies for our review (Table 2). Detailed information about the trials can be found in Additional file 7. These three trials included patients with low or subnormal vitamin B12 levels concentrations at the start of the study. The first trial by Hughes and colleagues included a random sample of 39 persons aged ≥ 65 years registered at general practices in a town in Wales, UK, that were treated for 4 weeks with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin or placebo. Haemoglobin was measured after 5 weeks. The second trial by Hvas et al. included 140 persons in Aarhus, Denmark, with elevated methylmalonic acid levels (median age 75 years in the treatment group and 74 years in the placebo group) that received weekly intramuscular injections of cyanocobalamin of placebo for 1 month. Haemoglobin was measured after 3 months (13 weeks). In the third trial by Seal and colleagues, 31 persons in two geriatric hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, (mean age ≥ 78 years) received two different doses of oral cyanocobalamin daily or placebo for 4 weeks.

Table 2
Summary of the results and quality assessment of the intervention studies included in this review

Based on checklist from Jadad et al. Higher scores indicate higher quality (range 0–5). Intervention studies that scored 3 points or more were considered 'high quality'.

Due to clinical heterogeneity (differences in methods of administration, dose of vitamin B12, outcome measures and treatment follow-up time) we did not combine the results in a meta-analysis. However, all three RCTs, of which two were regarded high quality ("see Additional file 8 "), showed no beneficial effect of vitamin B12 administration on haemoglobin concentrations and MCV. In the study by Hughes et al, there was, on average, a small decrease in haemoglobin level during the trial but the difference between the mean changes in those given vitamin B12 and those given placebo was very small and not statistically significant. In the study by Hvas et al, the change in haemoglobin level was the same in the vitamin B12 group and placebo group. In addition, no differences were observed in the mean change in haemoglobin level in the three treatment groups in the study by Seal et al.

Vitamin B12 requirements in parenteral nutrition — adult dose and rationale: Adult parenteral multivitamin products provide 5 mcg/d of crystalline cyanocobalamin. Serum B12 tends to be elevated in chronic parenteral nutrition, usually in the 700- to 900-pg/mL range, but there are several good reasons to continue this generous 5 mcg/d dose. Reasons include that although this dose yields serum B12 at the upper limits of normal there is no evidence for a B12 toxicity syndrome, high serum levels may reflect daily parenteral infusion rather than elevated tissue levels, parenteral B12 enters the systemic rather than portal circulation with first-pass uptake of 50% by the liver and 25% of systemic blood first passing the kidneys leading to probable urinary loss, B12 secreted into bile may not be recaptured due to loss of ileal receptors, and smokers have increased urinary B12 losses as thiocyanate.

### Reframing micronutrient deficiencies for modern times: a review [^6c4a98d5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Factors for Folate Deficiency

Low folate levels usually occur in the context of a restricted diet, bariatric surgery, or malabsorption. Increased cell turnover such as pregnancy, severe eczema, chronic hemolysis, or exfoliative skin disease can contribute as well. Folate losses can occur with chronic hemodialysis or external biliary drainage.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Vitamin B12 and Folate Deficiency

Evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiency often occurs simultaneously. A complete evaluation for deficiency would evaluate vitamin B12, folate, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and homocysteine levels. Anti-intrinsic factor and anti-parietal cell antibodies should be considered to evaluate for pernicious anemia. Patients on chronic dialysis should have RBC folate levels evaluated rather than serum folate. Homocysteine levels are increased in both folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies however MMA is only elevated in B12 deficiency. Of note, although elevated homocysteine is associated with increased thrombosis, folic acid supplementation has not been showed to reduce the risk of such events.

A vitamin B12 value < 200pg/ml is indicative of deficiency. Vitamin B12 levels 200-300pg/ml and folate levels between 2-4ng/mL are considered borderline and may warrant further investigation. Vitamin B12 levels may be normal in those with nitrous oxide overuse as the underlying etiology is inactivation rather than deficiency. However homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels will be elevated.

Vitamin B12 repletion should factor the underlying cause and severity of symptoms. Intramuscular route is preferred in patients with malabsorption or severe hematologic or neurologic symptoms. Initial dose can range from 1000mcg of intramuscular cyanocobalamin one to three times a week for 4 weeks or once daily for the first week followed by once a week doses for 4 weeks. Once symptoms improve, patients can be maintained on intramuscular preparation of 1000mcg once a month. Oral supplementation of 1000mcg can be used in those with milder symptoms and an intact gastrointestinal tract. A supratherapeutic oral dose has been used to promote passive absorption, bypassing the active transport mediated by intrinsic factor, in those with malabsorption who are unable to take intramuscular injections.

Folate repletion can start at 1 to 5mg a day until anemia improves followed by maintenance dose of 400mcg if the reason for deficiency persists. Vitamin B12 levels should be closely monitored as prolonged high dose folic acid supplementation may improve anemia but worsen an underlying vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to neurologic damage.

Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) and weight loss: Vitamin B-12 has a very limited role in promoting weight loss, and there are no studies evaluating weight loss with vitamin B-12 injections, tablets, sublingual pills, or drinks. Conversely, B-12 deficiency has been associated with weight loss, particularly after bariatric surgical procedures, and can lead to permanent nerve damage if left untreated; no weight loss should be anticipated as a result of the use of exogenous vitamin B-12, injection site reaction might be anticipated if that route is chosen, and in patients with normal renal function a hypervitaminosis state is unlikely.

Vitamin B(12) deficiency causes a wide range of hematological, gastrointestinal, and neurological manifestations. The most common neurological complication is subacute combined degeneration, sometimes associated with polyneuropathy. Isolated peripheral neuropathy due to cyanocobalamin deficiency is less frequent, and thus it may be overlooked. We describe 2 patients with isolated sensory axonal neuropathy secondary to vitamin B(12) deficiency who had complete clinical and electrophysiological recovery after cyanocobalamin replacement.

### Food-cobalamin malabsorption in elderly patients: clinical manifestations and treatment [^281b8723]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Approximately 15% of people aged more than 60 years old have a cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency, mainly in relation with food-cobalamin malabsorption (FCM). To date, no study has documented this disorder in the elderly. There is also little information on clinical consequences.

Subjects and Methods

We studied 92 elderly patients with well-established FCM who were extracted from an observational cohort study (1995–2004) of 172 consecutive elderly patients with documented cobalamin deficiency.

Results

The median patient age was 76 ± 8 years; 60 patients were women. The most common clinical manifestations were neurologic or psychologic: mild sensory polyneuropathy (44.6%), confusion or impaired mental functioning (22.8%), and physical asthenia (20.7%). Hematologic abnormalities were reported in at least one third of the patients: anemia (21%), leukopenia (10.9%), thrombopenia (8.7%), and pancytopenia (6.5%). All patients had low serum vitamin B12 levels (< 200 pg/mL), with a mean value (± standard deviation) of 131 ± 38 pg/mL and total serum homocysteine level of 22.1 ± 9.3 micromol/L. The mean hemoglobin level was 10.9 ± 2.5 g/dL and the mean erythrocyte cell volume 95.7 ± 12.7 fL. Correction of the serum vitamin B12 levels and hematologic abnormalities was achieved equally well in patients treated with either intramuscular or oral crystalline cyanocobalamin.

Conclusions

This study suggests that in elderly patients, FCM may be associated with significant neurologic, psychologic, and hematologic abnormalities, which seem to respond equally well to either oral or parenteral vitamin B12 therapy.

### Association between vitamin deficiencies and ophthalmological conditions [^d7609f73]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Ocular Manifestations

Similar to vitamin B9, cobalamin deficiency can lead to optic neuropathy. There can be recovery with supplementation, although it may be partial.

B9 and cobalamin are also similar in that both have been linked with age-related macular degeneration. An epidemiological study in 2013 found that those with vitamin B12 deficiencies (< 185 pmol/L) had a higher incidence of early and late AMD diagnosis. The association between B12 and AMD has been supported in subsequent studies.

Finally, cobalamin has been linked to dry eye disease and has been used as a treatment for pain associated with dry eye disease. A study by Ozen et al, found that treating vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with dry eye disease in addition to topical treatment improved the neuropathic pain. Another case report in 2015 of a 28-year-old patient with bilateral burning pain and foreign body sensation in both eyes was found to have cobalamin deficiency. Resolution of symptoms occurred after cobalamin supplementation and topical treatment.

Workup for Vitamin Deficiency

Similar to vitamin B9, patients who are being worked up for B12 (cobalamin) deficiency should also be investigated for vitamin B9 deficiency, macrocytic anemia and pernicious anemia. Patients who have a serum cobalamin level lower than 200 pg/mL are considered to be deficient. To confirm the diagnosis, further tests on methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine levels can be assessed. Elevated MMA and homocysteine levels is consistent with cobalamin deficiency.

An in-depth history on previous gastrointestinal surgeries, dietary habits, substance use and neurological findings should be taken from all patients. Signs and symptoms that can be seen during clinical assessment include, jaundice, peripheral neuropathy, enlarged tongue, diarrhea, headaches, weakness, fatigue, depression, memory loss, ataxia and neuropsychiatric findings.

Management

Management depends on the underlying etiology of the cobalamin deficiency. Most patients are recommended to take 1000 µg of cobalamin intramuscularly once a week for up to 4 weeks.

### Improved biochemical and neurodevelopmental profiles with high-dose hydroxocobalamin therapy in cobalamin C defect [^60dffa86]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cobalamin C (Cbl‐C) defect (OMIM #277400) is the most frequent disease involving intracellular cobalamin (vitamin B12) metabolism. Biochemically, the disease impairs the conversion of dietary cobalamin into its metabolically active forms, methyl‐cobalamin and adenosyl‐cobalamin, which act as coenzymes for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl‐CoA mutase. As a result, methionine (Met) synthesis decreases, and a combined elevation of total homocysteine (Hcy) and of methylmalonic acid (MMA) occurs in plasma and urine.

Clinically, Cbl‐C defect represents a paradigm of multisystem metabolic disease in which the central nervous system (CNS) and the eye are primarily affected. To a lesser and variable extent, other organs and tissues can be involved, with renal, cardiac, and hematological manifestations, and sometimes mild facial dysmorphisms.

On the basis of the age of symptoms appearance, an early‐onset (< 1 year) and a late‐onset (> 1 year) form are distinguishable. In early‐onset form, which represents the most frequent mode of appearance of the disease, symptoms manifest acutely or sub‐acutely with metabolic acidosis, anemia/cytopenia, hypotonus, lethargy, neurological deterioration, epilepsy and failure to thrive. Severe brain injury may cause cerebral atrophy, basal ganglia lesions or slowly progressive white matter changes. In most severe cases, life‐threatening manifestations may occur as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, pulmonary hypertension and hydrocephalus. Ophthalmological symptoms represent one of the most characteristic feature of the early‐onset forms, and include nystagmus, strabismus, optic nerve atrophy and macular/panretinal involvement of varying degree., Maculopathy is found in more than 50% of cases, generally begins before birth, and shows a progressive course over time despite therapy, severely compromising patients' vision and quality of life. Over time, patients develop neurocognitive deficits, varying from slight impairment in some specific tasks to global and severe developmental delay., Late‐onset forms are less frequent and can manifest at any age. Symptoms are variable and may include thrombosis, psychosis, myelopathy, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and pulmonary hypertension. Different from the early‐onset form, cognitive impairment and macular abnormalities are rare.

### Pernicious anemia presenting as catatonia: correlating vitamin B12 levels and catatonic symptoms [^15157b26]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Pernicious anemia has been associated with various psychiatric manifestations, such as depression, mania and psychosis. Psychiatric symptoms can sometimes occur without hematological and neurological abnormalities and can be prodromal of vitamin B12 deficiency. We report a case of autoimmune B12 deficiency presenting as catatonia without signs of anemia or macrocytosis, in which a correlation was found between the patient's B12 blood levels and catatonic symptoms over time. This catatonic episode was successfully treated with only lorazepam and adequate doses of cyanocobalamin.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: is routine screening and supplementation justified? [^d04df15a]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 is an essential micronutrient required for optimal hemopoetic, neuro-cognitive and cardiovascular function. Biochemical and clinical vitamin B12 deficiency has been demonstrated to be highly prevalent among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It presents with diverse clinical manifestations ranging from impaired memory, dementia, delirium, peripheral neuropathy, sub acute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, megaloblastic anemia and pancytopenia. This review article offers a current perspective on the physiological roles of vitamin B12, proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of vitamin B12 deficiency, screening for vitamin B12 deficiency and vitamin B12 supplementation among patients with diabetes mellitus.

### Age dependency of plasma vitamin B12 status markers in Dutch children and adolescents [^9c4e920f]. Pediatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin B12 deficiency in children may be associated with (severe) neurological manifestations, therefore recognition is important. Diagnosing vitamin B12 deficiency in children is challenging. This study aimed to investigate plasma methylmalonic acid, holotranscobalamin, and total cobalamin in children 0–18 years of age and to estimate age-dependent reference intervals.

Methods

Plasma vitamin B12 markers were measured in collected plasma samples of 170 children 0–18 years visiting a local primary care laboratory. All had within-reference hemoglobin and MCV values. Pediatric plasma vitamin B12 biomarkers were measured and reference values were derived thereof.

Results

Plasma methylmalonic acid was higher in young children, in particular between 1 and 6 months of age; total cobalamin and holotranscobalamin were highest from 0.5 to 4 years and decreased till 10 years of age. Plasma holotranscobalamin was highly correlated with plasma total cobalamin; their ratio was independent of age. Plasma methylmalonic acid was slightly more related to total cobalamin than to holotranscobalamin. A large proportion of mainly young children would be misclassified when adult references are applied.

Conclusions

Pediatric reference values for cobalamin markers are necessary to allow for early recognition and monitoring of children suspect of (clinical) cobalamin deficiency.

Impact

We analyzed three plasma vitamin B12 status markers, i.e. total cobalamin, holotranscobalamin, and methylmalonic acid, in the plasma of 170 children 0–18 years of age and were able to derive reference intervals thereof. Recognition of vitamin B12 deficiency in children is important but challenging as pediatric reference intervals for plasma vitamin B12 status markers, particularly plasma holotranscobalamin, are not well described. We think that our results may help early recognition and monitoring of children suspect of (clinical) vitamin B12 deficiency.

### Physicians ez use b-12 compliance [^9435d8bc]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than three months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg/day may result in hematologic remission in patients with Vitamin B12deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with Vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients

Patients with pernicious anemia should be instructed that they will require monthly injections of Vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of Vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any Vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet should be advised to take oral Vitamin B12regularly. The need for Vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

Laboratory Tests

During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary.

Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, Vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the 5th to 7th days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow.

Patients with pernicious anemia have about three times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated.

### Oral or intramuscular vitamin B12? [^e10cd858]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin B(12) deficiency is common, becoming more so with age, and estimates of its population prevalence have ranged from 1.5% to 15%. If untreated, it can lead to megaloblastic anaemia and irreversible neurological complications. In the UK, the usual treatment is regular intramuscular injections of hydroxocobalamin. High-dose oral vitamin B(12) replacement is standard practice in some other countries and less costly. Here we review issues around adopting an oral vitamin B(12) replacement regimen more widely in the UK.

### NHANES 2013–2014: vitamin B12 data documentation, codebook, and frequencies… [^47677066]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 is an essential cofactor for two enzymes involved in one-carbon metabolism: methylmalonyl CoA mutase levels) and methionine synthetase. A serum B12 level below the normal expected range may indicate B12 deficiency. However, a B12 level within the low normal range does not exclude B12 deficiency; symptomatic patients need to be further evaluated with MMA, folic acid, and homocysteine. A chronic dietary deficiency of either folate or vitamin B12 causes macrocytic anemia, although strict dietary deficiencies are rare. Most people who develop a vitamin B12 deficiency have an underlying stomach or intestinal disorder that limits the absorption of vitamin B12.

Subtly reduced cognitive function resulting from early vitamin B12 deficiency is sometimes the only symptom of these intestinal disorders. Untreated deficiencies will lead to megaloblastic anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency results in irreversible central nervous system degeneration. Hematologic signs, however, are not always present in vitamin B12 deficiency and hematologic signs and neurologic abnormalities can be inversely correlated. and cobas e immunoassay analyzers. The 1st step is to incubate 15 uL of sample with the vitamin B 12 pretreatment 1 and pretreatment 2 to release bound vitamin B 12.

### Elevated serum cobalamin levels in childhood: a retrospective analysis [^8ecefbb8]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Distribution of chronic diseases and supplementation rates

Of the patients without underlying diseases, 81.3% (n = 227) had incidentally detected elevated Cbl levels without any associated clinical symptoms, while 18.7% (n = 52) presented with nonspecific symptoms. The most frequently reported symptoms in these patients were loss of appetite (n = 11, 21.2%), fatigue (n = 10, 19.3%), headache (n = 6, 11.5%), and abdominal pain (n = 6, 11.5%). Less commonly reported symptoms included malaise (n = 5, 9.6%), nausea (n = 4, 7.7%), musculoskeletal pain (n = 3, 5.8%), palpitations (n = 3, 5.8%), dizziness (n = 2, 3.8%), and restlessness (n = 2, 3.8%). In contrast, patients with chronic diseases (n = 109) primarily presented due to disease-related symptoms or during routine follow-up visits.

Among patients without chronic diseases, the median serum Cbl level was 2693 pg/mL (IQR = 2288–3753) in those presenting with nonspecific symptoms, compared to 1759 pg/mL (IQR = 1581–2086) in asymptomatic individuals. A statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups (p < 0.001). In the nonspecific symptom group, 21.2% (n = 11) did not attend follow-up visits, and 26.9% (n = 14) exhibited persistently elevated Cbl levels at follow-up. The median time to normalization in this group was 3 months (IQR = 1–8). In the asymptomatic group, 58.6% (n = 133) did not attend follow-up visits, and 5.3% (n = 12) had persistently elevated Cbl levels at follow-up. The median time to normalization in this group was 4 months (IQR = 2–10). No significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of time to normalization (p > 0.05).

### Cobalamin status in children [^b8a31e55]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Cobalamin and the metabolic markers methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine undergo marked changes during childhood. In breastfed infants a metabolic profile indicative of cobalamin deficiency is common. Symptoms of cobalamin deficiency in children differ with age, presenting a continuum from subtle developmental delay to life-threatening clinical conditions. The symptoms may be difficult to detect, particularly in infants, and there tends to be a diagnostic delay of several months in this age group. Several reports show that even moderate deficiency in children may be harmful, and long-term consequences of neurological deterioration may persist after cobalamin deficiency has been treated. Given the crucial role of cobalamin for normal growth and development, possible widespread infantile deficiency needs attention. Cobalamin deficiency should be considered a differential diagnosis in children with subtle symptoms, and strategies to prevent cobalamin deficiency in mothers and children should be addressed.

### Laboratory testing for cobalamin deficiency in megaloblastic anemia [^bbbe09e0]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia in Western populations. Laboratory evaluation of megaloblastic anemia frequently includes the assessment of patient cobalamin and folate status. Current total serum cobalamin measurements are performed in the clinical laboratory with competitive binding luminescence assays, whose results may not always accurately reflect actual cobalamin stores. Surrogate markers of cobalamin deficiency such as methylmalonic acid and homocysteine have been utilized to improve diagnostic accuracy; however, the specificity of these tests by themselves is rather low. Measurement of the biologically active fraction of cobalamin, holotranscobalamin, has been proposed as a replacement for current total cobalamin assays. Although holotranscobalamin measurements appear to have slighter better sensitivity, the specificity of this assay remains to be determined. The relative merits and demerits of commonly available methods to assess cobalamin deficiency in patients with suspected megaloblastic anemia are discussed.

### B vitamins for stroke prevention [^c2d5c186]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Epidemiological studies report an independent, triangular association between MTHFR genotype, high tHcy and increased risk of stroke. RCTs show that B vitamin supplementation (vitamin B 9 (folic acid), vitamin B 12 and vitamin B6) lowers tHcy by about 25% and reduces the relative risk of stroke overall by about 10% compared with placebo.

Factors that appear to modify the effect of B vitamins on stroke risk include low folic acid status, high tHcy (and hence low B 12), high cyanocobalamin dose in patients with impaired renal function and concurrent antiplatelet therapy.

For patients with ischaemic stroke in whom the underlying cause is uncertain (ie, cryptogenic) after standard evaluation, it is recommended that tHcy be measured as part of the advanced evaluation.

If tHcy is raised, potential cause(s) of the hyperhomocysteinaemia (box 1) should be sought from the clinical assessment and measurement of renal function, thyroid function, glycated haemoglobin and holotranscobalamin or methylmalonic acid in the blood, and treated if possible.

If the cause of the hyperhomocysteinaemia remains unexplained and persistent, measurement of possible genetic determinants (eg, MTHFR) is indicated and daily supplementation with 0.5 mg folic acid and about 0.5 mg vitamin B 12 is recommended. This combination would be expected to reduce tHcy by about a quarter to a third (eg, from about 12 umol/L to 8–9 umol/L). While vitamin B 12 can be administered as cyanocobalamin in patients with normal renal function, it is recommended that vitamin B 12 be administered as methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin, particularly in patients with impaired renal function.

Any future trials of B vitamins for stroke prevention in regions without folic acid fortification should endeavour to determine whether the relative effects of B vitamin supplementation in reducing stroke risk are consistent throughout the range of baseline tHcy concentrations, or whether there is a threshold tHcy level below which B vitamins become ineffective (eg, as also for blood pressure-lowering and cholesterol-lowering).

### Improved biochemical and neurodevelopmental profiles with high-dose hydroxocobalamin therapy in cobalamin C defect [^03f74747]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

As for disease treatment, current guidelines indicate hydroxocobalamin (OH‐Cbl) and betaine as the therapeutic molecules with proven biochemical and clinical efficacy. However, beside a recommended parenteral OH‐Cbl starting dose of 1 mg/day at diagnosis, regardless of patients' age and/or weight, there is no consensus on dose adjustments throughout the course of the disease. Once OH‐Cbl therapy is initiated, patients undergo a relative clinical stabilization and do not experience further acute and life‐threatening events. Nevertheless, in the majority of early‐onset cases with severe genotypic variants, treatment allows only a partial improvement of metabolic profile, without leading to its normalization. The levels of total homocysteine remain well above the normal range and most patients, even those identified by NBS, develop cognitive and visual impairment, which therefore remain the two aspects with the greatest impact on disease course over time., Differently from early‐onset cases, milder genetic variants associated to a late‐onset disease subtype show a better response to treatment.

To explore the possibility of improving metabolic outcome, some studies have addressed the issue of OH‐Cbl dose escalation., Overall, these reports have shown improved biomarker trends in patients treated with higher doses of OH‐Cbl. However, these reports did not provide evidence for the optimal OH‐Cbl regimen, since they were conducted on small and heterogeneous case series and used different, non‐standardized OH‐Cbl dose protocols. With the aim of providing a uniform definition of the different therapeutic regimens, in this study we have arbitrarily distinct three types of OH‐Cbl dosages: "low dose" (< 0.3 mg/kg/day), "high‐dose" (≥ 0.30 to < 2.0 mg/kg/day), and "ultra high‐dose" (≥ 2.0 mg/kg/day).

To answer the question whether the use higher dose OH‐Cbl therapy may allow biochemical and clinical advantages, we performed a retrospective analysis of data collected from genetically homogeneous, age‐matched early‐onset Cbl‐C patients treated with different OH‐Cbl regimens.

### Cyanocobalamin (vitamin deficiency injectable system-B12) [^51ceabf1]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with cyanocobalamin suffered severe and swift optic atrophy.

Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely.

Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B12administration. An intradermal test dose is recommended before Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is administered to patients suspected of being sensitive to this drug.

This product contains Benzyl Alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal "Gasping Syndrome" in premature infants.

This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired.

Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.

Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.

The following main questions and outcomes of interest in males and females with any type of onset (early or late) of one of the diseases of interest were addressed (outcomes in parentheses).
Which clinical signs are characteristic and allow timely diagnosis (Outcome: timely clinical diagnosis; this outcome is considered important)
Which biochemical parameters allow timely and valid diagnosis? (Outcome: valid, timely laboratory diagnosis; this outcome is considered important)
How can we prevent death and avoid/treat severe organ damage (Outcome: survival, severe organ complications; this outcome is considered critical)
How can we prevent or treat eye disease and neurocognitive impairment? (Outcome: visual and neurocognitive function; this outcome is considered critical)

In a first step, all reports made available to the panelists were graded according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria by the authors who had assigned themselves according to their expertise to five major working groups focusing on the topics "clinical signs and symptoms"; "differential diagnosis"; "laboratory/biochemical parameters"; "disease course and outcome"; "treatment". Due to the rarity of the diseases, studies and reports of all types of designs (from case reports and case series to metaanalyses) were included; randomised controlled trials were not available.

The working groups prepared drafts on their topics, which were carefully evaluated in moderated discussion groups. Elaboration and grading of recommendations was accomplished by moderated, consensus-oriented discussions according to the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group" approach (Guyatt et al,); a patient representative was present at these meetings. Finally, for each outcome the quality of the evidence was rated in one of three categories (low, moderate, high) as defined by the GRADE working group. The strength of a recommendation (strong recommendation, recommendation and suggestion; for more information see Supplementary material) was summarised from written assessments from the panelist using the following set of questions:
Are you confident that the benefits outweigh the harms/burden or vice versa?
Is there high, moderate or low quality evidence? Please consider: Risk of bias Study design Directness and consistency of results Magnitude of effect Dose–response gradient Publication bias
Are you confident that the recommendation meets typical values and preferences of the target population (e.g. patients, parents)?
Are the resources worth the expected net benefit following the recommendation?
Overall strength of recommendation: weak or strong?

### Macro-bmasking B deficiency [^7908fabf]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

In many instances, high concentrations of serum B 12 are the consequence of the use of supplements containing a pharmacological concentration of B 12, or recent injections of hydroxocobalamin or cyanocobalamin. Elevated serum B 12 can also be found in patients with hepatic disease, myeloproliferative disorders, as well as metastasised cancers. Macro-B 12 is also a cause of high serum B 12 concentrations. Age of the patient, history, physical examination and additional laboratory investigations ruled out the major reasons or disorders associated with high serum B 12 concentrations in this patient. Therefore, we specifically focused on demonstrating macro-B 12 as a cause for the laboratory findings. With this, we specifically wondered whether the earlier diagnosis of B 12 deficiency could be demonstrated, now that supplementation with B 12 had been withheld for more than 2 years.

### Methaver [^15f8b31f]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Folic acid when administered as a single agent in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The 2 mgs of B12 (cyanocobalamin), the amount contained in Methaver, has been shown to provide an adequate amount of B12 to address this precaution. Unmetabolized folic acid has been shown in one study of 105 postmenopausal women (50–75 yrs) to have the potential to reduce natural killer cells' cytotoxicity, which may result in an impaired immune response.

B12 should not be used in those with Leber's optic atrophy. Decreased levels of B have been associated with reduced ability to detoxify the cyanide in exposed individuals and B may increase the risk of irreversible neurological damage from optic atrophy in those affected with the disorder. Hydroxocobalamin can aid in the detoxification of cyanide. This form of B12, although not in this product, is an acceptable form for > B12 supplementation in those with this disorder.

Caution should be exercised when Methaver is administered to patients with diabetic nephropathy. One published study showed that among patients with diabetic nephropathy given high dose folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B (pyridoxine) versus a placebo, there was a greater decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GRF).

Pregnant women and nursing mothers may be recommended to use 12 microgram doses of B12 from nutritional supplements, although higher doses should only be taken on the recommendations of a prescribing medical professional. Administration of doses of vitamin B12 greater than 10 micrograms daily may produce a hematological response in those with anemia secondary to folate deficiency.

Folate, when administered as a sing le agent in doses about 0.1 mg daily, may obscure the detection of vitamin B12 deficiency (specifically, the administration of folic acid may reverse the hematological manifestations of B12 deficiency, including pernicious anemia, while not addressing the neurological manifestations).

Folate therapy alone is inadequate for treatment of a vitamin B12 deficiency.

### The clinical presentation of cobalamin-related disorders: from acquired deficiencies to inborn errors of absorption and intracellular pathways [^478fca0f]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

This review gives an overview of clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of nutritional and acquired cobalamin (Cbl; synonym: vitamin B12) deficiencies, inborn errors of Cbl absorption and intracellular trafficking, as well as methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD1) and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiencies, which impair Cbl-dependent remethylation. Acquired and inborn Cbl-related disorders and MTHFR deficiency cause multisystem, often severe disease. Failure to thrive, neurocognitive or psychiatric symptoms, eye disease, bone marrow alterations, microangiopathy and thromboembolic events are characteristic. The recently identified MTHFD1 defect additionally presents with severe immune deficiency. Deficient Cbl-dependent enzymes cause reduced methylation capacity and metabolite toxicity. Further net-effects of perturbed Cbl function or reduced Cbl supply causing oxidative stress, altered cytokine regulation or immune functions are discussed.
