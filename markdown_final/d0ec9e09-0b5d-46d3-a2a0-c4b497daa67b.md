## Question

degenarative changes in the lumbar spine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, including definitions, pathophysiology, imaging features, clinical correlation, and management principles. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes "degeneration" versus normal aging. Then, I should verify the core pathophysiology and the functional spinal unit concept. Next, I will review imaging modalities and standardized grading systems. After that, I need to examine the strength of evidence linking imaging findings to symptoms. Then, I should consider special entities like Modic changes and spondylolisthesis. Finally, I will integrate management principles and outline a practical clinical approach with red flags and when to image or operate.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope. Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine reflect a spectrum of age-related and mechanically driven alterations of discs, facet joints, endplates, ligaments, and vertebral bodies; importantly, many of these changes are common and often asymptomatic, so I need to be careful not to equate imaging "degeneration" with a diagnosis of pain or disability [^111rgYMd] [^112YffQa] [^114UFad4].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — degeneration is not a single disease but a continuum influenced by mechanical loading, matrix biology, and inflammation. The intervertebral disc loses proteoglycans and water, endplles remodel, facet joints hypertrophy, and the ligamentum flavum thickens, all of which can narrow the canal or foramina and compress neural elements in some patients [^116HQY4e] [^113P3BZk] [^113DsGKv].

> Next, I should review imaging modalities and their roles. MRI is the preferred modality for soft tissues, neural compression, and marrow/endplate changes. Radiographs show alignment and osteophytes. CT delineates bony detail and is useful when MRI is contraindicated. Dynamic studies can unmask position-dependent instability, but I need to check whether they change management in typical cases before ordering them routinely [^116qTvTr] [^114nwx1D] [^113fUEde].

> Let me consider standardized grading systems. The Pfirrmann scale grades disc degeneration from normal to collapsed on T2 MRI, and Modic changes classify endplate marrow signals into types I–III. I should confirm that these schemes have at least substantial reliability and that structured reporting improves communication and clinical decision-making [^115C3XZo] [^112DVn27] [^111xdzkS].

> Now, I need to check the clinical correlation evidence. High-quality cohort data show that common radiographic and MRI degenerative changes, individually or in aggregate, have limited or no clinically important association with current or future low back pain severity; exceptions include disc bulge, extrusion, Modic type 1, and spondylolysis, which are modestly more prevalent in symptomatic cohorts, but even then effect sizes are small and not deterministic [^112BDazu] [^115XZJ6r] [^112UxuiY].

> Wait, let me verify a potential inconsistency. I initially thought "central canal stenosis" had an odds ratio around 20 in symptomatic versus asymptomatic adults; hold on, I should double-check that meta-analysis — on review, the wide CI and non-significant P value indicate no reliable association for central canal stenosis in that pooled analysis, so I should correct that assumption and avoid overinterpreting isolated stenosis on imaging without matching symptoms [^112UxuiY].

> I will now examine special entities. Modic changes, especially type 1, may track with inflammatory pain phenotypes and can evolve over time, but their predictive value for outcomes is inconsistent. Degenerative spondylolisthesis is an acquired anterior slip, most often at L4–L5, and may be position-dependent. Facet joint osteoarthritis is common with aging and correlates poorly with pain, so I should avoid anchoring on facet arthropathy alone as the pain generator [^116a3RQ9] [^112q1oZv] [^112Zy5hN] [^115BynDt].

> Let me think about the L5–S1 level specifically. The lumbosacral junction shows unique kinematics, with disc degeneration and facet arthropathy sometimes acting independently. Severe degeneration plus facet arthropathy can lead to biomechanical restabilization, which helps explain why some patients with advanced imaging changes are paradoxically less unstable clinically — this nuance matters when planning motion-preserving versus fusion strategies [^114Z1eBb].

> Next, I should review management principles. Conservative care is first-line for most degenerative lumbar conditions. Imaging is reserved for persistent symptoms, progressive neurologic deficits, or red flags. When surgery is considered, the goal is to treat the specific symptomatic pathology — decompression for stenosis, and decompression with fusion when instability is present or iatrogenic instability is likely — rather than "degenerative changes" per se [^117BSnWs] [^116xcjhc] [^111wShFo] [^111EdTWf].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of dynamic imaging and discography. Routine dynamic flexion–extension radiographs rarely add actionable information beyond standing films unless instability is suspected. Similarly, provocative discography has limited standalone value and should not be used in isolation for surgical decision-making, so I need to ensure these tests are used selectively and in context [^1137gtaG] [^115RFR59] [^116TSGp5].

> I need to ensure the clinical approach is coherent. Start with a careful history and exam to define pain pattern, neurogenic claudication, or radiculopathy. Reserve MRI for persistent or severe symptoms or neurologic compromise. Interpret imaging in light of prevalence of age-related change. Align treatment with the anatomic pain generator and patient goals, documenting that imaging alone does not dictate therapy [^116uB3HJ] [^111ofHNU] [^116xcjhc].

> Finally, let me reconsider the overarching message. Degenerative lumbar spine changes are ubiquitous with aging and often incidental. Robust data show weak, non-deterministic links between most imaging findings and pain, so I should avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment while remaining vigilant for the subset of patients with clinically significant stenosis, instability, or inflammatory endplate disease who may benefit from targeted interventions [^111rgYMd] [^112BDazu] [^115XZJ6r].

Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine are **common with aging** [^111rgYMd] and often asymptomatic, yet they can cause significant pain and disability when they compress neural structures or destabilize the spine [^115QsBLy]. MRI is the **preferred imaging modality** [^116qTvTr] for detecting and grading degeneration, while CT is useful when MRI is contraindicated or for detailed bony assessment [^114nwx1D]. Management is **primarily conservative** [^117BSnWs], with surgery reserved for persistent symptoms or neurologic compromise [^111wShFo]. The clinical impact depends on the **extent of degeneration** and the presence of neural compression or instability [^11177gSD].

---

## Pathophysiology

Degeneration reflects a **combination of mechanical, biochemical, and genetic factors** [^114UFad4]:

- **Intervertebral discs**: Loss of proteoglycans and water content leads to disc height loss, bulging, and herniation [^113akint].

- **Facet joints**: Cartilage degeneration, osteophyte formation, and synovitis cause pain and stiffness [^notfound].

- **Ligaments**: Hypertrophy and calcification, especially of the ligamentum flavum, contribute to spinal canal and foraminal narrowing [^11177gSD].

- **Vertebral bodies**: Endplate changes, osteophytes, and sclerosis develop with age and mechanical stress [^111vUMks].

---

## Clinical presentation

Symptoms vary with the **degree of degeneration** and neural involvement:

- **Axial pain**: Localized low back pain from disc degeneration, facet arthropathy, or muscle strain [^notfound].

- **Radiculopathy**: Nerve root compression from disc herniation or foraminal stenosis causing radiating leg pain, numbness, or weakness [^115QsBLy].

- **Neurogenic claudication**: Central canal stenosis causing leg pain, numbness, or weakness worsened by walking and relieved by sitting or flexion [^112gNrYn].

- **Instability**: Degenerative spondylolisthesis or scoliosis causing mechanical pain and deformity [^notfound].

---

## Imaging findings

MRI is the **gold standard** for evaluating soft tissues, discs, and neural structures [^115QsBLy]; CT is preferred for detailed bony assessment, especially when MRI is contraindicated [^114nwx1D]:

| **Imaging modality** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|
| MRI | - Disc degeneration (Pfirrmann grading) [^115C3XZo] <br/> - Disc herniation <br/> - Modic endplate changes [^112DVn27] <br/> - Facet arthropathy <br/> - Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy <br/> - Spinal canal and foraminal stenosis [^116qTvTr] |
| CT | - Bony osteophytes <br/> - Facet joint degeneration <br/> - Calcification <br/> - Detailed assessment of spinal canal dimensions [^114nwx1D] |
| Radiographs | - Disc space narrowing <br/> - Osteophytes <br/> - Endplate sclerosis <br/> - Alignment abnormalities (spondylolisthesis, scoliosis) [^115QsBLy] |

---

## Clinical significance and correlation with symptoms

Imaging findings often correlate poorly with symptoms; many degenerative changes are **asymptomatic** [^111rgYMd], and their presence alone does not explain pain [^115XZJ6r]. Clinically significant degeneration typically involves **neural compression**, **inflammation**, or **instability** [^11177gSD].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **tailored to symptoms**, severity, and patient factors:

---

### Conservative management

- **Physical therapy**: Core strengthening, flexibility, and aerobic conditioning [^notfound].

- **Medications**: NSAIDs, acetaminophen, muscle relaxants, and neuropathic pain agents [^notfound].

- **Epidural steroid injections**: For radiculopathy or neurogenic claudication [^notfound].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, ergonomics, and activity modification [^notfound].

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is considered for **persistent symptoms despite conservative care**, progressive neurologic deficits, or significant instability [^111wShFo]. Options include **decompression** (laminectomy, foraminotomy) for stenosis or radiculopathy [^115QsBLy]; **fusion** for instability or spondylolisthesis [^111EdTWf]; and **disc replacement** for select patients with isolated disc degeneration [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with the **extent of degeneration**, patient factors, and treatment. Many patients improve with conservative care, but some require surgery for persistent symptoms or neurologic compromise [^117BSnWs].

---

Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine are common and often asymptomatic, but they can cause significant pain and disability when they compress neural structures or destabilize the spine. MRI is the **preferred imaging modality**, and management is primarily conservative, with surgery reserved for persistent symptoms or neurologic compromise.

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a frequent cause of low back pain among adults, caused by a narrowing impinging on the spinal cord or nerve roots. Several conditions cause LSS, including disc herniation, spondylolisthesis, tumor, fractures, and other degenerative changes. Back pain is frequently experienced. MRI is the radiologic modality of choice. Radiographic evidence of LSS may not correlate well with symptoms. An increase in utilization of surgery has been noted. However, surgery has no significant benefit over more conservative options. An appropriate risk/benefit discussion between the patient and an interdisciplinary medical team is optimal.

### Prevalence of degenerative changes and overlap with spondyloarthritis-associated lesions in the spine of patients from the DESIR cohort [^111tFJLA]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Imaging studies and clinical data collected at baseline of patients included in the DESIR cohort (DEvenir des Spondylarthropathies Indifférenciées Récentes) were used (database was locked on 30 June 2010). Inclusion criteria were age over 18 and under 50 years; inflammatory back pain in the buttock(s), lumbar spine or thoracic spine fulfilling either the Calin or the Berlin criteria for inflammatory back pain for longer than 3 months but no longer than 3 years; and a SpA probability score of at least 5/10 on a numerical rating scale (0, not suggestive at all; 10, highly suggestive) as determined by the local investigator. For exclusion criteria and more details, see the original article written by Dougados et al introducing the cohort. Based on the ASAS axSpA criteria, patients were categorised as no-axSpA (not fulfilling ASAS axSpA criteria) or axSpA (fulfilling ASAS criteria) based on the central reading (see 'Axial spondyloarthritis parameters' section below).

Imaging

Sagittal T1-weighted spin echo and STIR MR images of the whole spine and sagittal cervical and lumbar radiographs were used. All four readers were educated on degenerative and axSpA findings on radiographs as well as MRI (supervised by MR and AF, musculoskeletal radiologists with an extensive experience). Readers were blinded for clinical information, the reading of the SpA lesions and the other imaging modality.

### Neurogenic vs. vascular… [^116QRJbr]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

As shown in Figures 1 and 2, entrapment of the cauda equina roots, which pass within the dural sac, can occur as a result of progressive hypertrophy of any of the osseocartilaginous and ligamentous elements surrounding the spinal canal. Moreover, the intervertebral disc, which is composed of a gelatinous, centrally located nucleus pulposus and a peripherally located annulus fibrosus, is prone to rupture or herniate posteriorly or posterolaterally as a result of degenerative changes or trauma, producing neural element compromise. In most cases, stenosis of the lumbar canal may be attributed to acquired degenerative or arthritic changes of the intervertebral discs, ligaments and facet joints surrounding the lumbar canal. These changes include cartilaginous hypertrophy of the articulations surrounding the canal, intervertebral disc herniations or bulges, hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum and osteophyte formation.

Compression of the microvasculature of the lumbar nerve roots, resulting in ischemia, is believed to be a major contributing factor in the development of neurogenic claudication. Wilson. Some patients actually obtain transient relief of pain by assuming a squatting position, which flexes the trunk. Conversely, lying prone or in any position that extends the lumbar spine exacerbates the symptoms, presumably because of ventral in-folding of the ligamentum flavum in a canal already significantly narrowed by degenerative osseus changes. Degenerative subluxation of lumbar vertebrae is another cause of acquired stenosis of the lumbar spinal canal, particularly at the L4 and L5 levels, and may manifest clinically with neurogenic intermittent claudication as well. 5 Lumbar stenosis sometimes occurs following posterior lumbar fusions, possibly as a result of reactive bony hypertrophy at or adjacent to the fused segments.

Results of Surgical Treatment Most patients benefit from wide decompression of the lumbar canal. Some reports place the percentage of patients benefiting from surgery at 95 percent, with greater than 90 percent of patients returning to their previous activity levels, regardless of age. 12 However, recent reports 2, 12 dismiss these figures as optimistic, instead claiming long-term neurologic improvement in approximately 65 percent of patients. It is fairly clear, however, that in most patients with clear radiographic and clinical evidence of stenosis, decompressive surgery provides significant relief.

### Association of lumbar spine radiographic changes with severity of back pain-related disability among middle-aged, community-dwelling women [^112BDazu]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are lumbar spine radiographic changes associated with severity of back pain–related disability among middle-aged, community-dwelling women?

Findings

In this population-based cohort study of women from the UK, there was no evidence to support an association between a higher number of lumbar segments with radiographic changes (Kellgren-Lawrence grade, osteophytes, and disc space narrowing) and more severe back pain–related disability in cross-sectional (650 women) or longitudinal (443 women) analyses.

Meaning

The findings suggest that the changes detected on lumbar radiographs provide limited value for decision-making regarding back pain management in this population.

### Determinants of evolution of endplate and disc degeneration in the lumbar spine: a multifactorial perspective [^116xobrn]. European Spine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Evolution and progression of disc and endplate bone marrow degeneration of the lumbar spine are thought to be multifactorial, yet, their influence and interactions are not understood. The aim of this study was to find association of potential predictors of evolution of degeneration of the lumbar spine.

Methods

Patients (n = 90) who underwent two lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams with an interval of at least 4 years and without any spinal surgery were included into the longitudinal cohort study with nested case-control analysis. Disc degeneration (DD) was scored according to the Pfirrmann classification and endplate bone marrow changes (EC) according to Modic in 450 levels on both MRIs. Potential variables for degeneration such as age, gender, BMI, scoliosis and sagittal parameters were compared between patients with and without evolution or progression of degenerative changes in their lumbar spine. A multivariate analysis aimed to identify the most important variables for progression of disc and endplate degeneration, respectively.

Results

While neither age, gender, BMI, sacral slope or the presence of scoliosis could be identified as progression factor for DD, a higher lordosis was observed in subjects with no progression (49° ± 11° vs 43° ± 12°; p = 0.017). Progression or evolution of EC was only associated with a slightly higher degree of scoliosis (10° ± 10° vs 6° ± 9°; p = 0.04) and not to any of the other variables.

Conclusion

While a coronal deformity of the lumbar spine seems associated with evolution or progression of EC, a higher lumbar lordosis is protective for radiographic progression of DD. This implies that scoliotic deformity and lesser lumbar lordosis are associated with higher overall degeneration of the lumbar spine.

### Baastrup's disease (kissing spines syndrome): a pictorial review [^111Um6r5]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Imaging findings

X-rays

In standard lateral X-rays of the spine the most common finding is the close approximation and contact of adjacent spinous processes with sclerosis of the articulating surfaces. Additionally, in more severe cases there is flattening and enlargement of the articulating surfaces or articulation of the two affected spinous processes (Fig. 1). Furthermore, general degenerative changes in the spine can be seen, usually most prominent at the pathological level. Advantages of radiographic imaging include the low cost and wide availability of the technique and a relatively low ionising radiation dose. On the other hand, there is poor imaging quality especially at the lower lumbar levels of obese patients.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^114GjHNP]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Natural history of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — prior consensus stated that the majority of patients with symptomatic degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis and an absence of neurologic deficits will do well with conservative care, that patients who present with sensory changes, muscle weakness or cauda equina syndrome are more likely to develop progressive functional decline without surgery, that progression of slip correlates with jobs that require repetitive anterior flexion of the spine, and that slip progression is less likely to occur when the disc has lost over 80% of its native height and intervertebral osteophytes have formed while progression of clinical symptoms does not correlate with progression of the slip; the current guideline reports this topic is not addressed due to limited literature and that natural history questions have been eliminated from this guideline.

### A comparative roentgenographic analysis of the lumbar spine in male army recruits with and without lower back pain [^113BnM9e]. Clinical Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine whether there is an association between lumbar spine radiographic findings and reported current and/or past lower back pain (LBP).

Materials and Methods

Four hundred and sixty-four age-matched (mean age 18 years ± 2 months) consecutive male army recruits were examined. Half of them had a history of episodes of LBP. An orthopaedic evaluation (including radiographs of the lumbar spine) is part of the routine medical examination for all military recruits. Two senior orthopaedic surgeons and one radiologist who performed the morphological measurements assessed the radiographs.

Results

We found an increased frequency of right-sided scoliosis, lumbar lordosis, sacral lumbarization, wedge vertebra, bilateral spondylolysis of L5 and/or a sagittal diameter of less than 12 mm among the recruits with LBP. No such association was found with spina bifida, left-sided scoliosis, hemi-lumbarization, sacralization and hemi-sacralization, Schmorl's nodules or mild degenerative changes.

Conclusion

Given that radiographic screening shows that LBP is more common in those with spinal deformity it may be a reasonable means of predicting which individuals are more likely to develop LBP.

### Radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration and bone mineral density in men and women [^117SCXye]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the association between individual radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration and bone mineral density (BMD) at the spine and hip.

Subjects

were recruited from a population register for a screening survey of vertebral osteoporosis. BMD was assessed at the spine and hip using dual energy x ray absorptiometry. Lateral spinal radiographs were evaluated for features of lumbar disc degeneration. Each vertebral level from L1/2 to L4/5 was assessed for the presence and severity of osteophytes, end plate sclerosis, and disc space narrowing. Linear regression was used to determine the association between each of these features and BMD at the spine and hip, with adjustments for age, body mass index, and levels of physical activity. Analyses were done separately in men and women.

Results

250 women and 256 men (mean age around 65 years) were studied. At the lumbar spine, after age adjustment there was an increase in BMD with increasing grade for all radiographic features of disc degeneration in both men and women. At the femoral neck, after age adjustment there was an increase in BMD with increasing osteophyte and end plate sclerosis grade though not disc space narrowing. Adjusting for body mass index and physical activity did not influence the strength of the associations.

Conclusions

Radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration are associated with an increase in BMD at the spine. Osteophytes and end plate sclerosis, but not disc space narrowing, are associated with an increase in BMD at the hip.

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. part 10: lumbar fusion for stenosis without spondylolisthesis [^112AXDTx]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Lumbar stenosis is one of the more common radiographic manifestations of the aging process, leading to narrowing of the spinal canal and foramen. When stenosis is clinically relevant, patients often describe activity-related low-back or lower-extremity pain, known as neurogenic claudication. For those patients who do not improve with conservative care, surgery is considered an appropriate treatment alternative. The primary objective of surgery is to reconstitute the spinal canal. The role of fusion, in the absence of a degenerative deformity, is uncertain. The previous guideline recommended against the inclusion of lumbar fusion in the absence of spinal instability or a likelihood of iatrogenic instability. Since the publication of the original guidelines, numerous studies have demonstrated the role of surgical decompression in this patient population; however, few have investigated the utility of fusion in patients without underlying instability. The majority of studies contain a heterogeneous cohort of subjects, often combining patients with and without spondylolisthesis who received various surgical interventions, limiting fusions to those patients with instability. It is difficult if not impossible, therefore, to formulate valid conclusions regarding the utility of fusion for patients with uncomplicated stenosis. Lower-level evidence exists, however, that does not demonstrate an added benefit of fusion for these patients; therefore, in the absence of deformity or instability, the inclusion of a fusion is not recommended.

### Active discopathy: a clinical reality [^112BSkz1]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is the first cause of years lived with disability. The aetiological diagnosis of LBP is challenging because a consistent anatomoclinical correlation is usually lacking. However, the development of lumbar MRI and studies of large cohorts of patients with LBP have allowed for isolating lesions involving the vertebral endplates adjacent to degenerative disc disease (DDD) that seem closely related to persistent painful symptoms. These lesions were classified in 1988 by Modic and colleagues: Modic 1 changes correspond to inflammatory signal of the vertebral endplates, Modic 2 to fatty signal and Modic 3 to fibrous signal.

As early as 1990, Revel and colleagues, on the basis of X-ray findings, reported that rapid intervertebral space narrowing ≥ 50% in less than 2 years, in the absence of specific causes of disc disease, was associated with inflammatory-like LBP, which responded better to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs than did other causes of non-specific LBP. The authors suggested that this imaging and clinical phenotype could be related to an 'active' process of discolysis and named it 'rapidly destructive intervertebral disc disease'. They further related this condition to Modic 1 changes. They also observed that the condition was associated with increased serum levels of inflammatory markers such as highly sensitive C-reactive proteinand therefore might reflect an 'active discopathy'. The concept of active discopathy now encompasses clinical, biological and imaging features that reflect an 'activation' (ie, 'inflammatory flare') of a previously unremarkable DDD in a subgroup of patients with chronic LBP.

Active discopathy shares some similarities with acute flares of peripheral osteoarthritis. Likewise, what triggers disc disease activation and how it self-limits remain unknown. A better understanding of mechanisms underlying disc disease activation and its self-limitation, with a specific focus on adverse biomechanical and biochemical factors, could be of clinical relevance. Here, we narratively review current disc-centred biomechanical and biochemical hypotheses of disc disease activation.

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^116xcjhc]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Diagnostic tests for low back pain (LBP) — imaging and other diagnostic testing: Lumbar spine x-rays are not recommended in patients with LBP without red flags for serious spinal pathology within the first 4 to 6 weeks, and among patients with evidence of radiculopathy, imaging in the acute setting is also not recommended; however, an imaging study may be appropriate when limitations from consistent symptoms have persisted for 1 month or more or when potentially serious pathology or progressive neurologic deficit(s) are concerns. Pretest probability and test characteristics are critical, as lumbosacral spine MRIs are more likely to be "abnormal" by age 40 in normal individuals and herniated discs are not infrequently found in asymptomatic teenagers and young adults; at present, no single imaging modality shows a clear overall advantage, though MRI is superior for soft tissues including intervertebral disc herniations. In the absence of moderate- to high-quality studies, additional diagnostic tests for LBP and spinal conditions are Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I), Low Confidence.

### An objective assessment of lumbar spine degeneration / ageing seen on MRI using an ensemble method – A novel approach to lumbar MRI reporting [^116YEfFC]. Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective, randomized, radiographic study assessing age-related changes (ARCs) on lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using an ensemble method.

Objectives

This study proposed to develop a novel reporting method to calculate a predicted "age estimate" for the ARC seen on lumbar MRI.

Summary Of Background Data

Lumbar MRI reports include pathological findings but usually not the prevalence data of common findings which has been shown to decrease the need for narcotics in the management of non-specific lower back pain (NSLBP). Comparing the normal age estimation for lumbar spine degenerative changes/ARC on MRI and comparing this to the patient's real age may improve patient outcome in the management of NSLBP.

Methods

A total of 60 lumbar MRI were taken from patients aged between 0 and 100years. Lumbar MRI features reported as associated with age on review of the literature were measured on each MRI and statistically evaluated for correlation with age. Factors found to be associated were then entered into an ensemble model consisting of several machine learning techniques. The resulting ensemble model was then tested to predict age for a further 10 random lumbar MRI scans. One further lumbar MRI was then assessed for observer variability.

Results

Features that correlated with age were disc signal intensity, the appearance of paravertebral and psoas muscle, disc height, facet joint size, ligamentum flavum thickness, Schmorl nodes, Modic changes, vertebral osteophytes, and high-intensity zones. With the ensemble model, 80% of estimated spinal age were within 11years of the subjects' physical age.

Conclusion

It would appear that the intervertebral discs, and many other structures that are subjected to loading in and around the lumbar spine change their lumbar MRI appearance in a predictable way with increasing age. ARC on lumbar MRI can be assessed to predict an "expected age" for the subject. Level of Evidence: 2.

### Degenerative disorders of the lumbar and cervical spine [^117BSnWs]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Degenerative disorders in the spine are normal, age-related phenomena and largely asymptomatic in most cases. Conservative management of lumbar and cervical spondylosis is the mainstay of treatment, and most patients with symptomatic degenerative changes respond appropriately with nonsurgical management. Surgical intervention can be considered an appropriate and viable option when conservative measures have failed. Treatment options should always be directed toward the specific nature and location of the patient's individual pathology. Although current standards in the surgical management of lumbar and cervical degenerative disorders include discectomy, neural decompression, and instrumented spinal arthrodesis, new approaches that address this often-challenging clinical entity are on the horizon.

### Effective disc age: a statistical model for age-dependent and level-specific lumbar disc degeneration using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [^112NS26J]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Assessment of disc degeneration is an important part of efforts to understand and treat low back pain. Accordingly, many degeneration grading schemes can be found in the literature. However, the concept of "disc degeneration" combines many processes and phenotypes. Degenerative changes may be caused by mechanical injury, genetics, environmental factors, or simply normal aging. Multiple etiologies may affect a disc simultaneously. Currently, a critical problem in low back pain etiology is an inability to distinguish pathological from non-pathological disc degeneration. Although some weak associations have been reported between degeneration and low back pain, most disc degeneration is asymptomatic and of little clinical concern. This problem is in part due to an inability to distinguish age-related degeneration ("normal aging"), which is ubiquitous, from all other forms of degeneration.

To support hypothesis testing, diagnosis, and treatment, a critical need exists to isolate and quantify expected degenerative changes associated with normal aging. In an effort to remove normal aging from the definition of disc degeneration, degeneration has been redefined as cell-mediated, progressive structural failure combined with "accelerated or advanced signs of aging". We subsequently refer to such degeneration as accelerated degeneration. However, there is currently no tool to quantify whether a disc has normal or accelerated/advanced signs of aging. As the prevalence of lumbar disc degenerative features increases with age, and the prevalence of each feature increases at different rates, it may be feasible to quantify normal aging and thus accelerated degeneration of lumbar discs in a data-driven manner.

### Facet joint syndrome: from diagnosis to interventional management [^115BynDt]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

There is currently no consensus on how best to evaluate lumbar FJ osteoarthritis with imaging. It has been reported that in clinical practice, imaging findings of degenerative abnormalities (including radiographs, MRI, CT, SPECT) have been assumed to be associated with nonspecific low back pain. Radiographic changes secondary to osteoarthritis are equally reported among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Radiological investigations report a poor correlation between clinical symptoms and degenerative spinal changes. Therefore, the role of FJ imaging in patient with LBP is still debated. The interest of imaging often lies in its ability to rule out differential diagnosis, commonly referred to as "red flag indications", rather than to prove a symptomatic condition. Red flag indications are intended to represent the potential for life or limb threatening conditions (suspicion of aortic aneurysm or dissection, neoplasm, infection, cauda equina syndrome, fracture, motor weakness). Advanced diagnostic imaging of the symptomatic level is appropriate and/or work-up for a non-spinal source of spine pain.

Imaging findings (Table 1)

X-ray imaging: Radiographs and computed tomography (CT)

The initial radiographic assessment of patients presenting with lumbar facet-mediated pain includes AP, lateral, and oblique views. Oblique radiographs are the best projections for assessing FJs of the lumbar spine because of their oblique position ("Scottie dog"). Lateral films, however, may provide useful information from the isthmus profile such as the pars interarticularis defect. Because of its ability to provide cross-sectional images and to provide a higher contrast between bony structures, CT improves anatomic evaluation of the FJs and is the preferred method for imaging FJ osteoarthritis. However, standard radiographs can also show pathological changes especially in severe disease. Degeneration is characterized by joint space narrowing, sclerosis, subchondral sclerosis and erosions, cartilage thinning, calcification of the joint capsule, hypertrophy of articular processes and of the ligamentum flavum causing impingement of the foramina and osteophytes. Secondary signs include vacuum joint phenomenon (intra-articular gas), joint effusion and associated degenerative spondylolisthesis. Synovial and subchondral cysts can extend posterior to the FJ but also anterior in the spinal cord or neuroforamen. Kalichman et al. showed 24% of X-rays FJOA before 40 years and 89% in the 60–69 years population, but once again with no correlation between abnormal morphology on radiologic findings and back pain.

### Degenerative disorders of the spine [^112Ac8wZ]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with back pain and degenerative disorders of the spine have a significant impact on health care costs. Some authors estimate that up to 80% of all adults experience back pain at some point in their lives. Disk herniation represents one of the most frequent causes. Nevertheless, other degenerative diseases have to be considered. In this paper, pathology and imaging of degenerative spine diseases will be discussed, starting from pathophysiology of normal age-related changes of the intervertebral disk and vertebral body.

### Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of work-related chronic low back pain: comparisons of different lumbar disc patterns [^111VZ4qW]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Currently, numerous pathogenic factors of CLBP have been reported, such as work-related risk factors, traumatic factors, spinal degenerative diseases, aging, inflammation, tumor, and even psychosocial factors. As we all know, intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and intervertebral disc herniation (IDH) are the most common sources of work-related CLBP due to long-term unhealthy posture or manual handling of heavy objects. However, the correlation between the presence of radiographic degenerative changes in intervertebral discs and the presence or severity of back pain was still uncertain, which has drawn increased attention. It is an established fact that back pain is a typical symptom associated with degenerative discs (DD) because of direct stimulation caused by structural abnormalities, facet joint arthritis associated with disc height collapse or segmental micro-instability, and induced neurological symptoms. Additionally, however, more than 30% of asymptomatic volunteers without any history of back pain have different forms of degenerative changes. Besides individual levels of pain sensitivity, the main reason for this uncertain correlation is probably the lack of identified relationship between DD and herniated discs (HD), since disc degeneration does not always precede herniation, and some degenerative changes can follow herniation. Therefore, further comprehensive investigation into the correlation between various patterns of disc degeneration and back pain was urgently needed to elucidate the etiological and pathological mechanisms of CLBP.

In the present study, we retrospectively investigated 283 cases with CLBP by using MRI analysis. Four different lumbar disc patterns, including normal discs (ND), DD, bulging discs (BD), and HD, were found in CLBP and compared in detail regarding various aspects based on MRI findings. The aim of this study was to identify MRI differences according to different lumbar disc patterns in CLBP.

Endplate Defects

Structural changes at the vertebral endplates are scored according to their appearance into degenerative changes (e.g. erosive intervertebral osteochondrosis), Scheuermann variant, and osteoporotic fractures. Erosive intervertebral osteochondrosis entails widespread erosions of the vertebral body endplates with disc degeneration, commonly leading to findings of vacuum phenomenon within the intervertebral disc, hypointensity within the intervertebral disc on T2-weighted images, band-like subchondral edema, and fat accumulation or sclerosis for affected vertebral bodies. Scheuermann variant is a developmental disorder with a hereditary predisposition component, with characteristic features of thoracic spine kyphosis > 40° or thoraco-lumbar spine kyphosis > 30° and vertebral wedge configuration of at least 5° at each level, involving at least three adjacent vertebral bodies according to the Sorensen criteria. A differential diagnosis is represented by changes of vertebral body configuration due to osteoporotic fractures, which can also appear as wedging of one or more vertebral bodies. However, the entity is different, with osteoporosis being characterized by low bone mineral density in combination with micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue, thus increasing the risk for fragility fractures. To provide further insights into the distinct appearance of endplate defects, they are further categorized according to shape as well as size and depth for a representative section (Table 4). Example cases for endplate defects are illustrated by Figure 2.

Intervertebral Disc Changes

Lumbar disc degeneration is graded according to the widely used Pfirrmann classification, which defines five grades in total according to the intervertebral disc height as well as signal characteristics shown on T2-weighted sequences. Specifically, it spans from grade I for a homogeneous disc with normal height and bright hyperintense white signal intensity to grade V for an inhomogeneous disc with collapsed disc space and a hypointense black signal intensity. The Pfirrmann classification for degenerative disc disease has been reported to show substantial to excellent inter-rater (κ > 0.65) and intra-rater (κ > 0.73) reliability. This grading is supplemented by information on potential contact between disc material and nerve roots, or deviation or compression of nerve roots due to disc degeneration (Table 5).

### Radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration and self-reported back pain [^111vUMks]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the occurrence of radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration including the presence of osteophytes, endplate sclerosis, and disc space narrowing and to determine their relationship with self-reported back pain.

Methods

Subjects aged 50 years and over were recruited from a primary care based community health index in Aberdeen, UK. Subjects were invited to complete an interviewer administered questionnaire and to have lateral spinal radiographs performed. The questionnaire included questions concerning the occurrence of back pain, both ever and in the past year. The inter-vertebral disc spaces (L1/2 to L4/5) were evaluated for the presence and severity of anterior osteophytes, endplate sclerosis, and disc space narrowing using a semi-quantitative score (grade 0–3). Logistic regression was used to determine the association between these individual radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration (using for each feature, the most severely affected vertebra) and back pain, with adjustments made for age and gender.

Results

There were 286 men (mean age 65.3 years), and 299 women (mean age 65.2 years) with spinal radiographs. Osteophytes were the most frequent radiographic feature. Osteophytes and endplate sclerosis were more frequent in men than women, but there was no gender difference in the frequency of disc space narrowing. All radiographic features increased in frequency with age; for osteophytes this was true only after excluding mild (grade 1) osteophytes. Compared to those without, those with disc space narrowing were more likely to report back pain both ever, [odds ratio (OR) = 2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5 to 3.0] and in the past year (OR = 1.7) with the strength of the association increasing with increasing severity of narrowing. Endplate sclerosis was not linked with back pain although moderate (grade 2) sclerosis was associated with back pain, both ever and in the past year. Compared to those without, or those with mild osteophytes, those with more severe osteophytes (grade > 1) were more likely to report back pain ever (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.5).

Conclusion

These data highlight the frequent occurrence, and the increase in frequency with age, of the individual radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration in population samples of men and women. Disc space narrowing appeared more strongly associated with back pain than the other radiographic features.

### Is L5-S1 motion segment different from the rest? A radiographic kinematic assessment of 72 patients with chronic low back pain [^114Z1eBb]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The relationship between biomechanical instability and degenerative changes in the lumbar spine in chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients remains controversial. The main objective of this retrospective radiographical study was to evaluate changes in kinematics at different lumbar levels (in particular the L5-S1 level) with progressive grades of disc degeneration and facet joint osteoarthritis in CLBP patients.

Methods

Using standing neutral and dynamic flexion/extension (Fx/Ex) radiographs of the lumbar spine, in vivo segmental kinematics at L1-L2 through L5-S1 were evaluated in 72 consecutive CLBP patients. Disc degeneration was quantified using changes in signal intensity and central disc height on mid-sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) scans. Additionally, the presence or absence of facet joint osteoarthritis was noted on T2-weighted axial MR scans.

Results

Disc degeneration and facet joint osteoarthritis occurred independent of each other at the L5-S1 level (p = 0.188), but an association was observed between the two at L4-L5 (p < 0.001) and L3-L4 (p < 0.05) levels. In the absence of facet joint osteoarthritis, the L5-S1 segment showed a greater range of motion (ROM) in Ex (3.3° ± 3.6°) and a smaller ROM in Fx (0.6° ± 4.2°) compared with the upper lumbar levels (p < 0.05), but the differences diminished in the presence of it. In the absence of facet joint osteoarthritis, no change in L5-S1 kinematics was observed with progressive disc degeneration, but in its presence, restabilisation of the L5-S1 segment was observed between mild and severe disc degeneration states.

Conclusion

The L5-S1 motion segment exhibited unique degenerative and kinematic characteristics compared with the upper lumbar motion segments. Disc degeneration and facet joint osteoarthritis occurred independent of each other at the L5-S1 level, but not at the other lumbar levels. Severe disc degeneration in the presence of facet joint osteoarthritis biomechanically restabilised the L5-S1 motion segment.

Clinical aspects of degenerative spine disease and reporting

The role of imaging is to provide accurate morphological information and influence therapeutic decision-making. The presence of degenerative change is not itself an indicator of symptoms. In the majority of cases, when patients with degenerative spine diseases are referred for imaging, clinicians are looking for answers to two simple questions: what is the cause of the patient's pain or neurological symptoms, and what treatment option should be primarily considered in this particular situation? Therefore, these imaging findings must be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical condition. In the majority of cases, even in advanced cases of degenerative spine disease with multilevel involvement, it is possible to identify one leading cause of the patient's problem or to provide a list of potential choices or culprits so that the referring physician can select the right answer based on the presentation, clinical symptoms and physical examination of the patient.

Potential biomarkers of LBP that are commonly detected on routine clinical scans include BM lesions at the vertebral endplates, disc bulges and herniation, and spondylolysis. The proposed comprehensive scoring system is based on visual reading of T1- and T2-weighted sequences with structured reporting. A strength is that this scoring system integrates previously established grading schemes within a standardized approach. The majority of such schemes has demonstrated at least substantial inter- and/or intra-rater reliability (e.g. classification of Modic-type endplate changes or Pfirrmann grading for degenerative disc disease). On the other hand, potential weaknesses include the qualitative/semi-quantitative nature of analyses by visual image reading and bias towards only structural findings rather than compositional findings. Related to this, the relationships between pathologies evaluated by these established grading schemes and pain might be variable, and thus, the clinical implications are unclear. For instance, it has been reported that Modic-type endplate changes have inconsistent associations with pain. Inconsistencies may stem from several sources, including imprecise description of Modic-type endplate changes for clinical reports, utilization of MRI equipment that introduces grading bias, or acquisition of imaging sequences that inadvertently misrepresent these changes. Specifically, omission of basic methodological details and, most notably, restriction to mainly qualitative/semi-quantitative, non-standardized evaluation of MRI data for Modic-type endplate changes make it difficult to draw more final conclusions about the correlation of LBP and vertebral endplate pathology.

Several novel MRI-based methods are undergoing research and development that may allow detection of biomarkers not seen on conventional lumbar MRI on the way to improved understanding of LBP mechanisms. For example, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to quantify spectral features related to intervertebral disc structure and acidity, and results from MRS correlated well with provocative discography, thus could potentially support improved surgical outcomes among patients with chronic LBP. Furthermore, ultra-short echo-time (UTE) imaging and chemical shift encoding-based water-fat MRI (CSE-MRI) have been proposed to be more sensitive to endplate damage or BM pathology and allow both to be quantified, yet without the need for specialized MRI hardware or application of contrast agents. Structural damage of the endplate is believed to trigger endplate neo-innervation and painful endplate BM lesions, and cartilage endplate fibrosis blocks nutrient transport to the disc cells, thereby hindering cell survival, disc matrix homeostasis, and regenerative potential.

### A three-year follow-up of lumbar spine endplate (modic) changes [^116a3RQ9]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

A longitudinal follow-up of Modic changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Objectives

To assess the prevalence and natural course Modic changes over a 3-year follow-up period.

Summary Of Background Data

Modic changes are bone marrow and endplate lesions visible on MRI. To the authors' knowledge, no follow-up studies on their natural course have been published.

Methods

The study population consisted of 60 unoperated sciatica patients 23 to 76 years of age. Baseline and 3-year lumbar MR images from L1-L2 through L5-S1 were analyzed independently by 2 radiologists and a consensus reading was performed.

Results

At baseline, the prevalence of Modic changes was 23%. Seven discs had mixed Type I/II, and 63 Type II change. Changes typically occurred at L4-L5 and L5-S1, and associated positively with age (P = 0.009). Ten of 70 discs (14%) with Modic changes at baseline displayed another type at 3 years. Furthermore, the nonconverted changes increased significantly in size. The incidence of new Modic changes during the follow-up was 6% (13 of 230).

Conclusions

Modic changes are common MRI findings in patients with degenerative lumbar disc disease. We found evidence that Modic Type II changes may be less stable than previously assumed.

### Association of lumbar MRI findings with current and future back pain in a population-based cohort study [^115XZJ6r]. Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Population-based cohort study.

Objective

We examined associations between common lumbar degenerative changes observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and present or future low back pain (LBP).

Summary Of Background Data

The association between lumbar MRI degenerative findings and LBP is unclear. Longitudinal studies are sparse.

Methods

Participants (n = 3369) from a population-based cohort study were imaged at study entry, with LBP status measured at baseline and 6-year follow-up. MRI scans were reported on for the presence of a range of MRI findings. LBP status was measured on a 0 to 10 scale. Regression models were used to estimate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between individual and multiple MRI findings and LBP severity. Separate longitudinal analyses were conducted for participants with and without baseline pain.

Results

MRI findings were present in persons with and without back pain at baseline. Higher proportions were found in older age groups. 76.4% of participants had a least one MRI finding and 8.3% had five or more different MRI findings. Cross-sectionally, most MRI findings were slightly more common in those with LBP and pain severity was slightly higher in those with MRI findings (ranging from 0.06 for high intensity zone to 0.83 for spondylolisthesis). In the longitudinal analyses, we found most MRI findings were not associated with future LBP-severity regardless of the presence or absence of baseline pain. Compared to zero MRI findings, having multiple MRI findings (five or more) was associated with mildly greater pain-severity at baseline (0.84; 0.50–1.17) and greater increase in pain-severity over 6years in those pain free at baseline (1.21; 0.04–2.37), but not in those with baseline pain (-0.30; -0.99 to 0.38).

Conclusion

Our study shows that the MRI degenerative findings we examined, individually or in combination, do not have clinically important associations with LBP, with almost all effects less than one unit on a 0 to 10 pain scale. Level of Evidence: 3.

### Prevalence of degenerative changes and overlap with spondyloarthritis-associated lesions in the spine of patients from the DESIR cohort [^112DxmrF]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

For both MRI and radiographic images, degenerative changes were found predominantly in the lumbar spine. Especially at L4–L5 and L5–S1, the prevalence of degeneration was high. Overall, 292/366 (79.8%) patients with degeneration in the lumbar spine had degeneration at this location. Degenerated discs (grade 2 or higher) were found in 211/366 patients (57.7%) at level L4–L5, L5–S1 and herniation in 149/366 patients (40.7%) in L4–L5 or L5–S1. Schmorls nodes were an exception as these were most prevalent in the lower thoracic spine. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the degenerative changes in the spine per VU.

### Modic changes: a systematic review of the literature [^112q1oZv]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Modic changes (MC) are a common phenomenon on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in spinal degenerative diseases and strongly linked with low back pain (LBP). Histology, radiology, potential mechanisms, natural history and clinical studies of MC has formed the foundation on which our understanding of spinal degenerative diseases is built. The objective of this study was to provide a review of recent important advances in the study of MC and their clinical significance. This review article summarizes these studies, by delineating the possible mechanisms, and raising doubts and new questions. The related aspects such as discography and differential diagnosis with spinal infection and tumor on MRI are also discussed. Although most of researchers believe that MC are common findings in patients with spinal degenerative diseases and have an association with discogenic LBP, different results between studies may be produced from the differences in study design, inclusion criteria, and sample size. How the present knowledge of MC affects the management of spinal degenerative diseases remains unclear. Further studies of MC will explore therapeutic possibilities for future treatments of spinal degenerative diseases.

Surgical treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — Surgery is recommended for treatment of patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis associated with low grade degenerative spondylolisthesis whose symptoms have been refractory to a trial of medical/interventional treatment. Grade of Recommendation: B. The current update notes that natural history questions were not addressed: Not addressed in guideline update; the literature to address natural history is limited and efforts to develop recommendations are often unsuccessful. Therefore, natural history questions have been eliminated from this guideline.

### Upright positional MRI of the lumbar spine [^113fUEde]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Supine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely used in the assessment of low back pain and radiculopathy. However, imaging findings often correlate poorly with clinical findings. This is partly related to the positional dependence of spinal stenosis, which reflects dynamic changes in soft-tissue structures (ligaments, disc, dural sac, epidural fat, and nerve roots). Upright MRI in the flexed, extended, rotated, standing, and bending positions, allows patients to reproduce the positions that bring about their symptoms and may uncover MRI findings that were not visible with routine supine imaging. Assessment of the degree of spinal stability in the degenerate and postoperative lumbar spine is also possible. The aim of this review was to present the current literature concerning both the normal and symptomatic spine as imaged using upright MRI and to illustrate the above findings using clinical examples.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (update) [^112gNrYn]. The Spine Journal (2013). Medium credibility.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis — working definition: Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis describes a condition in which there is diminished space available for the neural and vascular elements in the lumbar spine secondary to degenerative changes in the spinal canal, producing when symptomatic a variable clinical syndrome of gluteal and/or lower extremity pain and/or fatigue which may occur with or without back pain. Symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis has characteristic provocative and palliative features, with provocative features including upright exercise such as walking or positionally-induced neurogenic claudication and palliative features commonly including symptomatic relief with forward flexion, sitting and/or recumbency.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^116J29io]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and imaging — history and physical examination: the work group stated that obtaining an accurate history and physical examination is essential to the formulation of the appropriate clinical questions to guide the physician in developing a plan for the treatment of patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, and that in older patients presenting with radiculopathy and neurogenic intermittent claudication, with or without back pain, a diagnosis of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis should be considered (Grade of Recommendation: B); in the absence of evidence, the current work group's opinion is that obtaining an accurate history and physical examination is important for diagnosis and treatment, and that in patients with imaging evidence of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, reported clinical characteristics include asymptomatic with only occasional back pain; chronic low back pain with or without radicular symptoms and with or without positional variance; radicular symptoms with or without neurologic deficit, with or without back pain; and intermittent neurogenic claudication.

Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine involve intervertebral disks and intervertebral posterior elements at different extents. Much less attention has been directed toward degenerative changes of the posterior vertebral elements, however, when compared with intervertebral disk degeneration. These changes may involve the apophyseal joints, the bony elements of the neural arch, the intervening soft tissues, and the spinal longitudinal ligament. Roentgenographic, CT, and MR findings in these changes are depicted.

### Degenerative spine disorders in the context of clinical findings [^112mQeBu]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Hardly any other structure in the human body is held responsible for so many complaints, pain, and costs as the spine and its degenerative disorders. In the following article, the role of imaging procedures in diagnosing disorders of the spine is presented. Due to the fact that disk herniation represents the most frequent cause for degenerative disorders the anatomy of the intervertebral disk and the pathology of the entities that can cause diseases of the disks are described. In particular, the authors focus on the significance of radiological findings with respect to patient history, subjective symptoms, and objective clinical findings. In addition to presenting the technical procedures and their indications and contraindications also practical tips and tricks in conducting these examinations are presented in this paper.

### Degenerative lesions in the cervical portion of the spine… [^113akint]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The current concept that the hypertrophic variety of spondylitis is not an arthritis but a spondylosis arising as a reaction to changes primary in the intervertebral disks is based on the views promulgated by Schmorl and his followers. 1 The intervertebral disks, through the effect of age and of continuous functional stress, pass through stages of fibrillation, dehydration, fissuring and "brown degeneration". Defects in the cartilage plates, which may be congenital, traumatic or infectious in origin, permit extrusion of disk material into the vertebral bodies and penetration of vessels from the spongiosa into the normally avascular intervertebral disks, which may become calcified or ossified. The thinning of the disks and the loss of their normal buffer effect are attended by sclerosis of the adjacent vertebral borders and by marginal proliferation which may proceed to bony ankylosis. This progressive series of events has been duplicated experimentally.

### Frequency and clinical meaning of long-term degenerative changes after lumbar discectomy visualized on imaging tests [^111XFmVc]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this retrospective controlled study was to evaluate radiographic degeneration in the lumbar spine of patients who had undergone lumbar discectomy minimum 21 years earlier and its clinical meaning. Indeed, no previous investigation on degenerative changes occurring after lumbar discectomy with a comparable long follow-up has been published. The study participants consisted of 50 patients who had undergone discectomy for lumbar disc herniation. The mean length of follow-up was 25.3 ± 3.0 years. Patients were assessed by Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), Oswestry Disability Index, and a study-specific questionnaire. Radiographic views of the lumbar spine were obtained from all patients and compared to those of 50 asymptomatic controls. A five-step published classification was used to assess the increasing severity of radiographic changes. CT or MRI scans were also available for 27 patients who had undergone discectomy. Moderate to severe radiographic changes were present in 45 patients (90%) and 34 controls (68%), respectively (P = 0.013). The most prevalent MRI/CT changes were loss of disc height (89%), facet joint arthritis (89%), and endplate changes (57%). Thirty-two of 33 subjects (97%) reporting pain during the last 12 months had significant degeneration on their radiographs, and the frequency of changes was higher with respect to subjects without pain (P = 0.040). In conclusion, standard lumbar discectomy frequently leads to long-term degenerative changes on imaging tests. The presence of moderate to severe degeneration is associated with self-reported pain.

### A longitudinal study for incidence of low back pain and radiological changes of lumbar spine in asymptomatic Japanese military young adults [^113F6635]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The relation between radiological abnormalities on lumbar spine and low back pain (LBP) has been debated, presumably because of potential biases related to heterogeneity in selection of the subjects, radiological abnormalities at entry, or its cross-sectional observation in nature. Therefore, the aim of this study of a selected population of asymptomatic Japanese Self Defense Forces (JSDF) young adults male with normal lumbar radiographs was to investigate the incidence of newly developed lumbar degenerative changes at middle age and to study their association to LBP.

Subjects and Methods

In 1990, 84 JSDF male military servicemen aged 18 years, without a history of LBP and radiological abnormal findings, were enrolled. After 20 years, 84 subjects were underwent repeated X-ray and completed questionnaires on current LBP and lifestyle factors.

Results

The prevalence of LBP was demonstrated 59%, with 85% of them showing mild pain. Analysis of lumbar radiographs revealed that 48% had normal findings and 52% had degenerative changes. The association between LBP and life style factors was not demonstrated. Lumbar spine in subjects with LBP was more degenerated than in those without. Although disc space narrowing and LBP did not achieve a statistical significance, a significant correlation existed between vertebral osteophyte and LBP in univariate and multivariate analysis (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.227–7.333).

Discussion and Conclusions

This longitudinal study demonstrated the significant association between vertebral osteophyte and incidence of mild LBP in initially asymptomatic and radiologically normal subjects. These data provide the additional information concerning the pathology of LBP, but further study is needed to clarify the clinical relevance.

### Inflammatory and degenerative sacroiliac joint disease in a primary back pain cohort [^1157FPt4]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The prevalence of sacroiliac (SI) joint abnormalities in a primary low back pain population remains unresolved. The aims of our study were to define the prevalence of SI joint disease in this cohort, and to identify clinical features that might accurately predict radiographic changes in the SI joint and spine.

Methods

Lumbar spine and anteroposterior pelvis radiographs taken over a 3-year period for the evaluation of back pain at a major chiropractic college were scored for the presence of inflammatory or degenerative features. Data were subsequently extracted by means of a predetermined template from the clinical notes. The outcomes were correlated using Spearman's correlation coefficients.

Results

We identified 315 patients (173 men, 142 women), ages 18–60 years. Of these, 100 patients (31.7%) demonstrated SI joint abnormalities: 75 (23.8%) degenerative, 25 (7.9%) inflammatory. Sex was strongly associated with type of SI joint pathology; degenerative disease was predominantly found in women (68%), whereas inflammatory disease was predominantly found in men (63%). In women there was no correlation between degenerative SI joint abnormalities and degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. Of the clinical descriptors evaluated, none were associated with the radiographic findings with the exception of buttock pain, which was associated with inflammatory sacroiliitis. Neither being overweight nor pregnancy history was associated with degenerative changes in the SI joint.

Conclusion

In a primary back pain cohort, degenerative SI joint disease may be an under-recognized clinical entity. It is strongly influenced by sex but is unrelated to degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. Currently proposed clinical discriminators performed poorly in correlating with radiographic changes in the SI joint.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis — work group consensus for mild symptoms states that, in the absence of evidence for or against any specific treatment, it is the work group's recommendation that medical/interventional treatment is considered for patients with mild symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis, and patients with mild symptoms are generally excluded from comparative studies because they would not be considered surgical candidates.

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. part 6: discography for patient selection [^116TSGp5]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Identifying the etiology of pain for patients suffering from chronic low-back pain remains problematic. Noninvasive imaging modalities, used in isolation, have not consistently provided sufficient evidence to support performance of a lumbar fusion. Provocative testing has been used as an adjunct in this assessment, either alone or in combination with other modalities, to enhance the diagnostic capabilities when evaluating patients with low-back pain. There have been a limited number of studies investigating this topic since the publication of the original guidelines. Based primarily on retrospective studies, discography, as a stand-alone test, is not recommended to formulate treatment strategies for patients with low-back pain. A single randomized cohort study demonstrated an improved potential of discoblock over discography as a predictor of success following lumbar fusion. It is therefore recommended that discoblock be considered as a diagnostic option. There is a possibility, based on a matched cohort study, that an association exists between progression of degenerative disc disease and the performance of a provocative discogram. It is therefore recommended that patients be counseled regarding this potential development prior to undergoing discography.

### Study of the distribution of lumbar modic changes in patients with low back pain and correlation with lumbar degeneration diseases [response to letter] [^115Ae46o]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

2. The available evidence for the relationship between low back pain and Modic changes is not uniform. A recent review suggests that intervertebral disc calcification is associated with Modic changes that are highly correlated with pain and disability. This may be similar to the development of subchondral bone marrow lesions in the knee, which are associated with osteoarthritis-related pain. However, further mechanistic studies are needed. Moreover, there is a new systematic review suggesting that the available evidence is not sufficient to judge whether most MRI findings are associated with future pain and disability. However, the only exceptions are Modic changes and disc degeneration, which are associated with slightly worse pain and disability outcomes. And, this study, similar to the studycited in the letter to illustrate the relationship between low back pain and Modic changes, concluded that imaging should not be overly prioritised for low back pain. And we read through the latter, however it does not mention any Modic changes. We read through the other two studies, and indeed, as Kovacs et al state, there are instances where MRI degenerative findings have no clinically significant association with low back pain. However, Kaschspeculates that for Modic changes, the difference in conclusions may be due to differences in study design, sample characteristics, and so on.

3. We have read the study by Kovacs et al and agree with their conclusions. However, in the discussion in studyon Modic changes in patients with chronic low back pain in Southern Europe, they also mention that although there is a limitation in the reliability of MRI assessment, this limitation is real regardless of the strength of the magnetic field, the terminology used, or the clinician's experience and expertise, and that it should be recognised as an inherent limitation when using lumbar spine MRI in both experimental and clinical settings. We also agree with the above. We did write slightly briefly about the acquisition of the MRI diagnosis, which was performed by two experienced radiologists, with concordant results completing the diagnosis, and discordant results resulting in a final diagnosis by another chief physician, none of whom had any knowledge of the patient's clinical symptoms.

### The modic vertebral endplate and marrow changes: pathologic significance and relation to low back pain and segmental instability of the lumbar spine [^111evXmB]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2008). Low credibility.

Two decades following their description, the significance of Modic vertebral endplate and marrow changes remains a matter of debate. These changes are closely related to the normal degenerative process affecting the lumbar spine, and their prevalence increases with age. However, the exact pathogenesis underlying these changes and their relation to segmental instability of the lumbar spine and to low back pain remain unclear. In this paper, we review the literature relevant to this topic and discuss the currently available evidence regarding the pathologic and clinical significance of Modic changes.

### Patient information: lumbar spinal stenosis… [^115QsBLy]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Walter KL, O'Toole JE. Lumbar Spinal Stenosis. JAMA. 2022; 328:

310. doi: 10.1001/jama.2022.6137 Lumbar spinal stenosis involves narrowing of the spinal canal, which extends through the center of the spinal vertebrae, in the lower back area. Lumbar spinal stenosis may cause pressure on the nerve roots that branch out from the spinal cord, which can result in pain, tingling, numbness, muscle fatigue, and, if severe, weakness in the legs. Lumbar spinal stenosis typically results from degenerative changes in the spine associated with aging, including formation of bony spurs, thickening of spinal ligaments, and degeneration of the disks between the vertebrae. These processes can result in loss of space between the vertebral bones and bulging of the disk into the spinal canal. Other spinal conditions may worsen lumbar spinal stenosis, such as displacement of a vertebra over an adjacent vertebra and degenerative curvature of the spine.

Common symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis are pain and achiness extending from the lower back to the buttocks and often to one or both legs. Sometimes the pain is accompanied by numbness or tingling in the lower legs or feet. Pain due to lumbar spinal stenosis typically increases with standing or walking and is relieved with sitting or leaning forward. Due to gradual worsening of pain over time, some patients may develop severe limitations in activity. Clinicians usually diagnose lumbar spinal stenosis based on a patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Imaging scans are often used to confirm the diagnosis, including an x-ray scan to evaluate the alignment of the spinal bones and magnetic resonance imaging to visualize the spinal cord, spinal nerve roots, joints, disks, and ligaments. Computed tomography is an alternative imaging mode for patients who are unable to undergo MRI.

Surgical procedures can be performed for lumbar spinal stenosis to remove some of the bone, ligament, or disk tissue that is pressing on lumbar nerve roots. Surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis typically reduces pain and improves overall function in carefully selected patients whose symptoms fail to improve with nonsurgical treatment. Any patient with spinal stenosis who develops loss of bowel or bladder function or has rapidly progressive leg weakness should undergo urgent evaluation for surgery.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis — systematic review of CT, MRI, and myelography diagnostic accuracy: A systematic review identified 14/116 relevant studies with a reference standard other than another imaging test and reported sensitivity ranges of MRI 81–97%, CT 70–100%, and myelography 67–78%. All studies received a grade of C or D, and this provides Level II diagnostic evidence suggesting that each of these diagnostic studies is useful and that none of the three is unequivocally superior in the diagnosis of adult lumbar spinal stenosis.

### Guidelines for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. part 6: magnetic resonance imaging and discography for patient selection for lumbar fusion [^115RFR59]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Discography is an exquisitely sensitive but not specific diagnostic test for the diagnosis of discogenic low-back pain. The restriction of the definition of a positive discographic study to one that elicits concordant pain from a morphologically abnormal disc improves the definition's accuracy. Fusion surgery based on discography alone, however, is not reliably associated with clinical success. Therefore, discography is not recommended as a standalone test for treatment decisions in patients with low-back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging is a sensitive and noninvasive test for the presence of degenerative disc disease. Discography should not be attempted in patients with normal lumbar MR images. Discography appears to have a role in the evaluation of patients with low-back pain, but it is best limited to the evaluation of abnormal interspaces identified on MR imaging, the investigation of adjacent-level disc disease, and as a means to rule out cases of nonorganic pain from surgical consideration.

### The utility of dynamic flexion-extension radiographs in the initial evaluation of the degenerative lumbar spine [^1137gtaG]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective radiographic review.

Objective

To assess the utility of lateral dynamic flexion-extension radiographs in the initial evaluation of the degenerative lumbar spine.

Summary Of Background Data

Most surgeons obtain standing anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs in the initial evaluation of patients presenting with lumbar complaints. The potential role of dynamic films in this population has not been established.

Methods

Of a 390 radiograph series, 342 met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. After assessment of the AP and lateral radiographs, dynamic films were evaluated to determine if additional information was obtained.

Results

Only 2 of the 342 radiographic series had new findings seen on dynamic films not appreciated on the AP and lateral films (a L3-L4 anterolisthesis of 3 mm with flexion and a L5-S1 retrolisthesis of 4 mm with extension). Fifteen additional radiographic series were noted to have a change in the amount of anterolisthesis or retrolisthesis on the dynamic films (changes ranged from 2 to 5 mm).

Conclusion

In the population studied, dynamic radiographs did not significantly alter the initial course of clinical management beyond standing AP and lateral lumbar images.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (update) [^111ofHNU]. The Spine Journal (2013). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and imaging — assessing evidence for diagnostic tests in degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis defines accuracy in terms of sensitivity and specificity and links predictive value to disease prevalence, emphasizing that one purpose of history and physical examination is to increase the prevalence of disease in patients sent for advanced testing and that this review attempted to identify symptoms and signs with a high likelihood ratio for lumbar spinal stenosis; cross-sectional imaging exams have a low intrinsic specificity in asymptomatic populations, so the accuracy of a spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) study should incorporate direct visualization of neurologic structures, while the frequent use of surgery as a gold standard can be questioned, outcome can also be used as a gold standard but is confounded by treatment and patient variables, and although a case can be made to use the best available cross-sectional imaging exam as a gold standard this too can be problematic; positive CT or MRI findings in the population with symptoms or findings expected in patients diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis are stated to have greater relevance relative to treatment and should lead to better outcomes.

### Imaging the degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine [^114T5crf]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Degenerative changes of the spine may involve the disc space, the facet joints, or the supportive and surrounding soft tissues. MR imaging is ideally suited for delineating the presence, extent, and complications of degenerative spinal disease. Other imaging modalities such as radiography, myelography, and CT may provide complimentary information in selected cases. Percutaneous procedures may be used to confirm that a morphologic abnormality is the source of symptoms. Correlation with clinical and electrophysiologic data is also helpful for accurate diagnosis. Combining the information obtained from imaging studies with the patient's clinical presentation is mandatory for determining the appropriate patient management strategy, especially true in patients afflicted with any condition directly attributed to the degenerative processes of the spine.

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. part 9: lumbar fusion for stenosis with spondylolisthesis [^111EdTWf]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with stenosis associated with a spondylolisthesis will often describe signs and symptoms consistent with neurogenic claudication, radiculopathy, and/or low-back pain. The primary objective of surgery, when deemed appropriate, is to decompress the neural elements. As a result of the decompression, the inherent instability associated with the spondylolisthesis may progress and lead to further misalignment that results in pain or recurrence of neurological complaints. Under these circumstances, lumbar fusion is considered appropriate to stabilize the spine and prevent delayed deterioration. Since publication of the original guidelines there have been a significant number of studies published that continue to support the utility of lumbar fusion for patients presenting with stenosis and spondylolisthesis. Several recently published trials, including the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, are among the largest prospective randomized investigations of this issue. Despite limitations of study design or execution, these trials have consistently demonstrated superior outcomes when patients undergo surgery, with the majority undergoing some type of lumbar fusion procedure. There is insufficient evidence, however, to recommend a standard approach to achieve a solid arthrodesis. When formulating the most appropriate surgical strategy, it is recommended that an individualized approach be adopted, one that takes into consideration the patient's unique anatomical constraints and desires, as well as surgeon's experience.

### Height of lumbar discs measured from radiographs compared with degeneration and height classified from MR images [^11287CPh]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

The relation between height of lumbar discs (measured from lateral radiographic views) and disc degeneration (classified from MR images) deserves attention in view of the wide, often parallel or interchanged use of both methods. The time sequence of degenerative signs and decrease of disc height is controversial. To clarify the issue, this cross-sectional study documents the relation between disc degeneration and disc height in a selected cohort. Forty-three subjects were selected at random from a cohort examined for potential disc-related disease caused by long-term lifting and carrying. From each subject a lateral radiographic view of the lumbar spine as well as findings from an MR investigation of (in most cases) levels T12/L1 to L5/S1 were available; thus, n = 237 lumbar discs were available for measurement and classification. Disc height was measured from the radiographic views with a new protocol compensating for image distortion and permitting comparison with normal, age- and gender-appropriate disc height. Degeneration as well as disc height were classified twice from MR images by independent observers in a blinded fashion. Disc degeneration classified from MR images is not related to a measurable disc height loss in the first stage of degeneration, whereas progressive degeneration goes along with progressive loss of disc height, though with considerable interindividual variation. Loss of disc height classified from MR images is on average compatible with loss of disc height measured from radiographs. In individual discs, however, classification of height loss from MR images is imprecise. The first sign of disc degeneration (a moderate loss of nucleus signal) precedes disc height decrease. As degeneration progresses, disc height decreases. Disc height decrease and progress of degeneration, however, appear to be only loosely correlated.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^111xdzkS]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging Assessment

Imaging of the lumbosacral spine is essential in the workup of patients with the heretofore-described clinical features of discogenic pain. Specifically, the minimum imaging to classify the degree of degenerative changes in the disc requires a sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) view (Figure 1, Box 3). This imaging sequence allows for the grading of intervertebral disc degeneration based on MR signal intensity, disc structure, distinction between nucleus and annulus, and disc height. Originally devised by Pfirrmann et aland later modified to an eight-category rating scale, this system describes the progression from a normal disc to severely degenerated disc. Grade 1 corresponds to no disc degeneration while Grade 8 corresponds to end-stage degeneration.

Grades 1, 2, and 3 are based on the signal intensity of the nucleus (ie, hyperintense ranging from cerebrospinal fluid [grade 1] to presacral fat [grade 3]) with a distinct junction between the inner and outer fibers of annulus posteriorly and normal disc height. For Grade 4, the margins between the inner and outer fibers of the annulus at the posterior margin of the disc are indistinct with normal disc height. For Grade 5, the disc is uniformly hypointense (ie, equal to outer annulus fibers) with an indistinct junction between inner and outer annular fibers and no loss of disc height. For Grades 6, 7, and 8, there is a hypointense MR signal and progressive loss of disc space height. These are broadly classified as mild (< 30%), moderate (30–60%), to severe (> 60%) loss of disc height, respectively (Figure 1, Box 4).

Sagittal MRI views should also be evaluated for the presence or absence of Modic changes. These vertebral bone marrow signal intensity changes are graded as absent, 1, 2 or 3. Briefly, type 1 changes represent bone marrow edema and inflammation; type 2 changes represent normal red haemopoietic bone marrow conversion into yellow fatty marrow as a result of marrow ischemia; and, type 3 changes represent subchondral bony sclerosis.

Katz et al assessment of history and physical findings — diagnostic study and likelihood ratios: The study included 93 consecutive patients evaluated in a spine center, and imaging was available in 88% of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and confirmed the diagnosis. Historical findings most strongly associated with lumbar spinal stenosis, with a likelihood ratio greater than two, were greater age (LR 2.5), severe lower extremity pain (LR 2.0), absence of pain when seated (LR 6.6), and improvement of pain with sitting (LR 3.1), and symptoms worse with walking had a negative likelihood ratio of 0.96. Physical findings most strongly associated were wide-based gait (LR 1.43), abnormal Romberg test (LR 4.3), and thigh pain after 30 seconds of lumbar extension (LR 2.5).

### Degeneration of the lumbar spine and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements in patients without osteoporosis [^116jmjdA]. Clinical Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of degenerative findings on the accuracy of readings obtained by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in patients without osteoporosis.

Methods

Twenty-four female patients who had undergone both DXA and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging were included in the study.

Conclusion

This study has demonstrated that degenerative radiologic changes, especially in the osteophyte area, affect bone mineral density measurements, so degeneration should be considered in the evaluation of this measurement.

### ABCs of the degenerative spine [^116HQY4e]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Degenerative changes in the spine have high medical and socioeconomic significance. Imaging of the degenerative spine is a frequent challenge in radiology. The pathogenesis of this degenerative process represents a biomechanically related continuum of alterations, which can be identified with different imaging modalities. The aim of this article is to review radiological findings involving the intervertebral discs, end plates, bone marrow changes, facet joints and the spinal canal in relation to the pathogenesis of degenerative changes in the spine. Findings are described in association with the clinical symptoms they may cause, with a brief review of the possible treatment options.

### Degenerative joint disease of the spine [^114UFad4]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Degenerative changes are the manifestations of metabolic disturbances in the matrix of intervertebral disks and zygapophysial joints. Genetic factors and physical loading contribute, but the strongest correlation is with age. Degenerative changes lack any significant correlation with spinal pain. Therefore, they do not constitute a diagnosis. Internal disk disruption is a distinctive condition that is independent of degeneration and age. Its biophysical and morphologic features correlate with back pain, as do its manifestations on magnetic resonance imaging.

### Classification of degenerative segment disease in adults with deformity of the lumbar or thoracolumbar spine [^111mXe3Z]. European Spine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Lumbar and thoracolumbar deformity in the adult is a condition with impairment of health status that can need surgical treatment. In contrast with adolescent deformity, where magnitude of the curve plays a significant role in surgical indication, the aspects relevant in adult deformity are pain and dysfunction that correlate with segment degeneration and imbalance. Previous classifications of adult deformity have been of little use for surgical planning.

Methods

Chart review and classification of radiographic and clinical findings. A classification of degenerative disc disease based on distribution of diseased segments and balance status of the spine is presented.

Results

Four main categories are presented: Type I (limited nonapical segment disease), Type II (limited apical segment disease), Type III (extended segment disease — apical and nonapical), Type IV (imbalanced spine: IVa, sagittally imbalanced; IVb, sagittally and coronally imbalanced).

Discussion and Conclusion

Types I and II can be treated by fusion of a selective area of the curve. Type III needs fusion of all the extension of the coronal curve. Type IV usually needs aggressive corrective procedures, frequently including posterior tricolumnar osteotomies. This classification permits interpreting the extension and magnitude of the disease and can help establish a surgical plan regarding selective fusion and methods of sagittal correction. Future research is needed to validate the classification.

Natural history of clinically or radiographically severe degenerative lumbar stenosis — the work group's opinion, in the absence of reliable evidence, is that literature is insufficient to define the natural history because all reviewed series excluded patients with severe neurological compromise (or loss or dysfunction) regarded as surgical candidates; therefore, no conclusions can be drawn about this population.

Diagnosis/imaging — proposed imaging criteria and grading considerations note that a decrease in the dural sac diameter to below 100 mm² at more than one of the three levels was highly associated with the presence of intermittent claudication, and due to anatomic variability any grading system for lateral recess and foraminal stenosis will have to incorporate some measure of perineural effacement, neural displacement, and neural compression.

### Association of lumbar spine radiographic changes with severity of back pain-related disability among middle-aged, community-dwelling women [^117CCQTE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Possible explanations for the unwarranted prevalence of imaging referrals for LBP are (1) the patient's expectation that imaging results could provide valuable information on the cause and, consequently, the appropriate management of her or his condition and (2) the clinician's desire to reassure the patient of the absence of any underlying pathologic condition. Previous studies have confirmed that imaging does not improve clinical outcomes for patients with LBP. However, the definition of normal or abnormal imaging diagnostic findings is still debatable. Currently, the presence of osteophytes and disc space narrowing are the most frequent changes detected on radiographs (hereafter referred to as radiographic changes) that may be indicative of spinal pathologic conditions, and the Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grade is the tool commonly used to assess the severity of osteoarthritis. A study including elderly women who lived in rural South Korea showed a positive association of the presence of osteophytes (grade ≥ 2), disc space narrowing (grade ≥ 2), and K-L grade (grade ≥ 2) with the severity of disability, measured by a validated Korean version of the Oswestry Disability Index. However, a study conducted in Sri Lanka including patients with LBP concluded that neither disc space narrowing nor the presence of osteophytes was associated with the severity of disability (also measured with the Modified Oswestry Disability Index). Both studies are cross-sectional and failed to adjust their analyses for important confounders, including smoking status, level of participation in physical activity, and medication use. Past studies have also failed to identify whether the number of affected lumbar segments is associated with the severity of back pain–related disability. Therefore, the role of radiographic findings as a potential prognostic factor of the clinical course of LBP is still unclear and needs to be fully explored in population-based cohort studies. Previous studies of radiographic changes in knee osteoarthritis have indicated that the presence of osteophytes may be used to diagnose the condition and that the presence of joint space narrowing may be used to assess both the diagnosis and the progression of osteoarthritis. This is still to be elucidated among patients with LBP.

### Lumbar stenosis with spondylolisthesis: current concepts of surgical treatment [^111Mk639]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

As degenerative changes progress in the aging population, more patients will present with degenerative spondylolisthesis. The clinical picture is usually of a woman older than 50 years of age with a degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis at L5 with symptoms of neurogenic claudication or radiculopathy. Imaging studies will reveal a central recess, a lateral recess or both, and/or neuroforaminal stenosis. When patients do not respond to nonoperative treatments, surgical intervention is indicated. Most studies have concluded that the addition of an arthrodesis improves the clinical outcome. A recent longterm study showed that a solid fusion and an adequate decompression is the procedure offering the best outcome. The current authors will review the pathogenesis, clinical picture, and treatment recommendations for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.

### Degenerative disc disease: what is in a name? [^111y5Ghr]. Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A systematic search and review OBJECTIVE.: The aim of this study was to investigate the term, degenerative disc disease, to elucidate its current usage and inform clinical, research, and policy recommendations.

Summary Of Background Data

Degenerative disc disease has long been a dominant concept in common, painful spinal disorders. Yet, despite its pervasiveness and important clinical consequences and controversies, there has not been a systematic examination of its use and meaning in the scientific literature.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search of publications using the term degenerative disc disease from 2007 through 2016 in Ovid MEDLINE (R), Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus. Two investigators independently reviewed all publications in the primary sample. Publication and author identifiers, and qualitative study descriptors were extracted. Finally, the definition of degenerative disc disease was placed in one of eight categories. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics.

Results

Degenerative disc disease appeared in the titles of 402 publications in the primary sample and increased in frequency by 189% from the first to the last 3 years of the decade. No single definition was used in the majority of publications, and most frequently, the term was used without any definition provided (30.1%). In other cases, degenerative disc disease specifically included radiculopathy or myelopathy (14.4%), or only back or neck pain (5.5%), or was equated with disc degeneration regardless of the presence of symptoms (15.4%), or with discogenic pain or disc degeneration as a presumed cause of axial pain (12.7%). Another 7.2% comprised a mix of broad ranging findings and diagnoses. The most notable differences in definitions occurred between surgeons and other disciplines, and when applied to cervical versus lumbar regions.

Conclusion

Despite longstanding use and important consequences, degenerative disc disease represents an underdeveloped concept, with greatly varying, disparate definitions documented. Such inconsistencies challenge clear, accurate communication in medicine and science, create confusion and misconceptions among clinicians, patients and others, and hinder the advancement of related knowledge.

### Imaging of the aging spine [^111rgYMd]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Degeneration of the spine is a normal aspect of aging. The associated changes of spine degeneration seen on imaging are typically asymptomatic. However, distinguishing normal age-related change from symptomatic pathologic change can be challenging owing to the overlap in imaging features. Understanding the general prevalence, timing, and evolution of age-related change can aid in this differentiation and help prevent imaging overdiagnosis and unnecessary workup.

Evaluation of Imaging Data

Based on the MRI data acquired, we propose qualitative/semi-quantitative image evaluation (e.g. using ordinal rating scales) using structured reporting with a predefined scoring system that incorporates the different structures and related grading of pathology as captured by the FOV of the T1- and T2-weighted sequences (Modic-type endplate changes, endplate defects, intervertebral disc changes, FJ and SIJ changes, and stenosis).

Modic Changes

Modic-type endplate changes summarize three categories based on specific signal characteristics of vertebral BM adjacent to the endplates in MRI. Most commonly, type 1 changes are considered an inflammatory, fibrovascular stage and may indicate an ongoing active degenerative process (e.g. disruption and fissuring of endplates and formation of granulation tissue). Type 2 changes are related to fatty degenerative remodeling processes, with replacement of red by yellow BM within the vertebrae. Furthermore, type 3 changes reflect the sclerotic stage. Related to their suggested pathophysiological entity, the three different types of Modic-type endplate changes differ in their appearances using the combination of sagittal T1- and T2-weighted sequences, with Modic changes type 1 typically showing hypointense signal on T1- and hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images, Modic changes type 2 showing hyperintense signal on T1- and hyper- or iso-intense signal on T2-weighted images without FS (typically relatively hypointense on T2-weighted images with FS), and Modic changes type 3 showing hypointense signal on T1- and T2-weighted images. However, mixed types can be observed frequently for one lumbar segment (e.g. presence of signal characteristics indicative of Modic changes type 1 and type 2), and categorization may be done by reporting the dominant type.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^113LyxdX]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Lumbar facet joint pain diagnosis — clinical features, imaging, and diagnostic blocks: Conventional clinical features are unreliable in diagnosing lumbar zygapophysial (facet) joint pain, and randomized investigations show no correlation between clinical symptoms of low back pain and degenerative spinal changes on radiologic imaging, including radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and radionuclide bone scanning. A systematic review reported that none of the tests for facet joint pain were informative, and consequently controlled local anesthetic blocks of the facet joint or its nerve supply are routinely employed to diagnose facet joint pain. There is no universally accepted gold standard for the diagnosis of low back pain, and the association between degenerative changes in lumbar facet joints and symptomatic low back pain remains unclear and is a subject of ongoing debate.

### Current understanding of lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration: a review with emphasis upon etiology, pathophysiology, and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging findings [^113P3BZk]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Degeneration of the lumbar intervertebral discs (IVDs) is highly prevalent in adults and is nearly universal in the elderly population. Degenerative changes within, and adjacent to, the IVDs are likely to contribute to a variety of pain syndromes; however, the exact association between these findings and symptoms remains speculative. Recent research has provided new information regarding the etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical relevance of degeneration of the IVD. This information will assist clinicians and researchers in understanding the development and clinical course of lumbar disc degeneration, as well as its potential impact upon patients seeking physical therapy care for back pain. The purposes of this clinical commentary are to review the structure and metabolic capacity of the normal and degenerative lumbar IVD, and to discuss factors that influence the onset and progression of disc degeneration. Lumbar magnetic resonance images will be used to illustrate the common findings associated with this condition.

### Study of the distribution of lumbar modic changes in patients with low back pain and correlation with lumbar degeneration diseases [^1145YiqS]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) is anatomically defined as pain extending from the 12th rib to the iliac crest. Degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine are the most common causes of low back pain. Anatomically, disc degeneration, radicular pain, facet arthropathy, and myofascial pain can be used as its pathogenesis. Etiologically, the most common is degenerative lumbar spine pathology. Modic changes are changes in the spinal endplate and subendplate bones on MRI and are seen as a spinal degeneration and an etiology of low back pain. It was first reported by De Roos in 1987, and later by Modic in 1988, who described the types of signal changes, typing criteria and pathological changes on MRI, The etiology of Modic changes is unknown, and most of the current studies are limited to epidemiological and clinical correlations, and there are no consistent conclusions yet. Specifically, Modic changes are pathological changes that occur when the protective effect of the cartilage endplate is weakened or lost, leading to oedema of the adjacent cancellous bone, followed by fatty infiltration of the vertebral body, and ultimately fibrosis and calcification. This continuous pathological process divides Modic changes into three types (I, II, III). The above pathologies appear to be causally related to common lumbar spine disorders (lumbar disc degeneration, lumbar spondylolisthesis, lumbar spinal stenosis, etc.). However, there have been few comprehensive studies involving large sample sizes on the relationship between the above. There is still controversy over the results of the studies. Therefore, there is a need for research on this topic.

Diagnosis and Evaluation of Lumbar Spinal Stenosis

There are no widely accepted gold standard diagnosis criteria for LSS, but the presence of imaging showing narrowing of the spinal neural structure is a necessary finding. Confirmatory diagnosis typically consists of assessing history, physical examination, and radiographic images. History should be consistent with pain while standing or walking that is relieved by forward flexion or sitting. Typical clinical features include lower extremity pain with equivocal straight leg raise testing and softs signs of radiculopathy. In many cases, the physical examination is normal while sitting, including reflexes, strength, and sensation. Imaging showing disc bulging, loss of disc height, facet joint arthropathy, osteophyte formation, and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy can lead to narrowing of the spinal canal. With the extension of the spine, the laminar edges of adjacent vertebral bodies overlap with relaxation and inward buckling of the ligamentum flavum, along with the movement of the superior facets in a rostral-anterior direction. Neurogenic claudication occurs as a result of ischemia (due to venous congestion and diminished arterial blood flow) or mechanical compression of nerve roots and is defined by pain or radiculopathy in the buttocks and/or lower extremities that worsens with walking and improves with forward bending or sitting. Walking may additionally exacerbate symptoms, as the demand for increase in oxygen in the spinal nerve roots may exceed the available blood flow.

Spinal canal narrowing might also be exacerbated by the shifting of one vertebral body anteriorly or posteriorly, relative to the adjacent vertebral body. This condition is known as spondylolisthesis. The lumbosacral joint is exposed to extensive anterior-directed shear forces. The paired facet joints, pars interarticularis, and intervertebral discs are the main anatomical structures that are subjected to these forces. Degenerative spondylolisthesis occurs due to the aging process. It is associated with the occurrence of marked facet joint arthritis with rotatory vertebral slip and occurs most frequently at L4–5, although it can be seen at other levels. Isthmic spondylolisthesis occurs due to a defect in the pars interarticularis (whether congenital or acquired) and occurs most often at L5-S1. In isthmic spondylolisthesis, the intervertebral disc preserves the stability of the spinal segment. Once disc degeneration occurs, the main source of stability is lost and the vertebral slip increases. This is an important differentiating factor when determining treatment options for lumbar spinal stenosis.

### MRI findings of disc degeneration are more prevalent in adults with low back pain than in asymptomatic controls: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112UxuiY]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Imaging features of spine degeneration are common in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. We compared the prevalence of MR imaging features of lumbar spine degeneration in adults 50 years of age and younger with and without self-reported low back pain.

Materials and Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of studies reporting the prevalence of degenerative lumbar spine MR imaging findings in asymptomatic and symptomatic adults 50 years of age or younger. Symptomatic individuals had axial low back pain with or without radicular symptoms. Two reviewers evaluated each article for the following outcomes: disc bulge, disc degeneration, disc extrusion, disc protrusion, annular fissures, Modic 1 changes, any Modic changes, central canal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, and spondylolysis. The meta-analysis was performed by using a random-effects model.

Results

An initial search yielded 280 unique studies. Fourteen (5.0%) met the inclusion criteria (3097 individuals; 1193, 38.6%, asymptomatic; 1904, 61.4%, symptomatic). Imaging findings with a higher prevalence in symptomatic individuals 50 years of age or younger included disc bulge (OR, 7.54; 95% CI, 1.28–44.56; p = 0.03), spondylolysis (OR, 5.06; 95% CI, 1.65–15.53; P < .01), disc extrusion (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 1.98–9.68; P < .01), Modic 1 changes (OR, 4.01; 95% CI, 1.10–14.55; p = 0.04), disc protrusion (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.52–4.62; P < .01), and disc degeneration (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.21–4.15, P = 0.01). Imaging findings not associated with low back pain included any Modic change (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 0.48–5.41, P = 0.43), central canal stenosis (OR, 20.58; 95% CI, 0.05–798.77; p = 0.32), high-intensity zone (OR = 2.10; 95% CI, 0.73–6.02; p = 0.17), annular fissures (OR = 1.79; 95% CI, 0.97–3.31; p = 0.06), and spondylolisthesis (OR = 1.59; 95% CI, 0.78–3.24; p = 0.20).

Conclusions

Meta-analysis demonstrates that MR imaging evidence of disc bulge, degeneration, extrusion, protrusion, Modic 1 changes, and spondylolysis are more prevalent in adults 50 years of age or younger with back pain compared with asymptomatic individuals.

### Association of lumbar spine radiographic changes with severity of back pain-related disability among middle-aged, community-dwelling women [^112kg4DF]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Considering that the number of lumbar spine segments with radiographic changes detected and the various types of radiographic changes might be associated with the results, we generated 3 composite scores: a K-L grade–based score, an osteophyte grade–based score, and a disc space narrowing grade–based score; at each segment, a binary exposure variable of 1 (K-L grade ≥ 2, which means at least definite osteophyte and possible narrowing of disc space are present; disc space narrowing and osteophyte grade ≥ 1, which means at least mild or definite changes are present) vs 0 (K-L grade 0 or 1; disc space narrowing and osteophyte grade 0) was used. The composite score was then calculated as the final L1-L2 score + L2-L3 score + L3-L4 score + L4-L5 score, with values ranging from 0 to 4 (where 0 indicates no lumbar spine segments with radiographic changes detected and 4 indicates 4 lumbar spine segments with radiographic changes detected). The K-L grade–based score was defined as the primary exposure. Osteophyte and disc space narrowing grade–based scores were set as secondary exposures.
