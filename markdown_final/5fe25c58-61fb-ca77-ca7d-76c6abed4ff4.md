## Question

What are the benefits of early initiation of biologic therapy in eosinophilic asthma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the benefits of early initiation of biologic therapy in eosinophilic asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "early" in guideline-concordant care. Then, I should verify the clinical outcomes that constitute meaningful benefits. Next, I will examine mechanistic and disease-modifying arguments for earlier intervention. After that, I need to appraise the strength and limitations of the evidence base, including real-world data. Finally, I will integrate cost, safety, and practical considerations to formulate a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion with appropriate caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm what "early" should mean in this context, because I need to ensure we are aligned with current standards. Early initiation does not imply first-line biologics at diagnosis; rather, it means moving to add-on biologic therapy promptly after confirming severe eosinophilic asthma with type 2 biomarkers and persistent uncontrolled symptoms or exacerbations despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA and adherence confirmation, rather than delaying with repeated, futile step-ups or prolonged oral corticosteroid exposure [^d85da68e] [^267ff500] [^9872d6ad].

> Next, I should review the core clinical benefits we expect to see and verify their magnitude. The most consistent, high-certainty outcomes with anti-IL5/IL5R agents are approximately 47–54% reductions in severe exacerbations and about a 50% median reduction in maintenance oral corticosteroid dose in OCS-dependent patients, with additional improvements in asthma control and quality of life, albeit sometimes modest in magnitude and not universal across instruments [^c2d88a1d] [^27d14bd4]. Hold on, I should verify lung function effects; yes, FEV1 improvements are typically small but statistically significant, around 0.08–0.15 L, which may not be clinically detectable in all patients, reinforcing that exacerbation and steroid-sparing effects are the primary, reproducible benefits [^27d14bd4].

> I will now examine whether earlier initiation translates into faster or larger benefits, and I need to check real-world signals. Benralizumab cohorts show early symptom improvements within 1 week in a substantial proportion, with sustained gains by 56 weeks and a meaningful fraction achieving clinical remission by 1 year, supporting the concept that timely biologic therapy can accelerate control and potentially alter trajectory in appropriately selected patients [^943080e0]. Let me consider switching data as a proxy for "earlier" optimization: switching from omalizumab to mepolizumab yields rapid eosinophil suppression and clinically meaningful improvements in control and exacerbations, again suggesting that aligning mechanism with phenotype earlier can be advantageous when the initial biologic is mismatched [^0d4d70cf] [^b378e1e5].

> But wait, what if we are missing disease-modifying effects by waiting too long? I should review the airway remodeling literature. Biologics demonstrate early anti-inflammatory effects within days to weeks and potential late structural benefits over months to years, including reductions in mucus plugging and signals of remodeling modulation; this supports a rationale that earlier intervention, before fixed airflow limitation consolidates, may mitigate irreversible changes, although definitive prospective prevention trials are still needed [^66345a60] [^e2d5b023] [^84730caf]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while the mechanistic plausibility is strong, we still need longitudinal data to prove that earlier initiation changes hard outcomes like FEV1 decline or CT-defined remodeling, so I should frame this as a credible hypothesis rather than established fact [^e2d5b023].

> I need to ensure the evidence base is appraised correctly. Randomized trials and meta-analyses provide high-certainty evidence for exacerbation and steroid-sparing benefits, but most were not designed to test "earlier" initiation versus delayed initiation, and head-to-head comparisons across biologics are limited, so indirect inferences and real-world data are important adjuncts [^27d14bd4]. Let me reconsider predictors of response; higher baseline blood eosinophils and a history of frequent exacerbations consistently associate with greater benefit, which strengthens the case for not delaying biologics in clearly eosinophilic, uncontrolled patients once maximal inhaled therapy and adherence are optimized [^775ccc2b] [^c2696e58].

> Next, I should review safety and practical considerations, because early initiation must be balanced against risks and logistics. Anti-IL5/IL5R therapies have favorable safety profiles in trials and observational cohorts, with no excess serious adverse events versus placebo and low discontinuation rates, though monitoring for hypersensitivity and infection risk remains prudent, and first-dose observation is reasonable in some settings [^27d14bd4] [^d85da68e]. I should double-check continuation rules; GINA advises assessing response after at least 4 months and extending to 6–12 months if unclear, and importantly, stopping ineffective therapy and switching mechanism rather than persisting indefinitely, which operationalizes a disciplined, time-limited trial approach even when starting "early" [^271c5d70] [^267ff500].

> Cost and access cannot be ignored, so I need to weigh value and equity. Biologics are expensive, yet in patients with frequent exacerbations and OCS dependence, early biologic use may reduce hospitalizations, emergency care, and long-term steroid toxicities, potentially improving cost-effectiveness when targeted to high-risk eosinophilic phenotypes; nonetheless, payer criteria vary and shared decision-making about goals, administration preferences, and affordability is essential [^3c4d5c5a] [^d85da68e]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm that we are not overgeneralizing to mild disease; current approvals and guidelines restrict biologics to severe, uncontrolled asthma with type 2 features, so "early" must remain within those eligibility frameworks to avoid misapplication [^d85da68e] [^267ff500].

> Let me synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable answer. Early initiation of biologic therapy in eosinophilic asthma, defined as prompt add-on treatment after confirming severe disease with type 2 biomarkers and inadequate control on optimized inhaled therapy, yields faster and larger reductions in exacerbations, accelerates steroid sparing, and improves asthma control and quality of life, with emerging signals that it may mitigate remodeling and enable remission in a subset; these benefits are most pronounced in patients with higher eosinophil counts and exacerbation burden, and should be balanced against cost, safety, and the need for structured response assessment and switching if ineffective [^c2d88a1d] [^943080e0] [^e2d5b023] [^271c5d70]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overstating remission claims; GINA recognizes evolving remission frameworks, but sustained off-therapy remission remains uncommon and should be discussed as an aspirational goal rather than a guaranteed outcome [^989c8108].

> Finally, I should confirm practical next steps so the recommendation is usable. Confirm severe eosinophilic asthma with blood eosinophils ≥ 150–300/μL depending on the agent, document exacerbations or OCS dependence, optimize ICS-LABA and adherence, and then initiate a 4–6 month biologic trial with predefined response criteria; if response is inadequate, switch mechanism rather than escalating steroids indefinitely, and if response is excellent, consider step-down of concomitant therapies while maintaining at least medium-dose ICS as per GINA [^267ff500] [^271c5d70] [^a3b555b7]. I need to ensure I note pediatric applicability; mepolizumab and dupilumab are approved down to age 6 in severe eosinophilic asthma, so "early" is relevant in children with uncontrolled type 2 disease after maximal inhaled therapy, with similar principles for monitoring and switching if needed [^6625c82f] [^cb2acaa1].

---

Early initiation of biologic therapy in eosinophilic asthma provides **rapid and sustained reductions in exacerbations** [^27d14bd4] and oral corticosteroid use [^c2d88a1d], with **early improvements in lung function and asthma control** [^84730caf] [^943080e0]. Starting biologics sooner can **prevent airway remodeling** [^e2d5b023] and long-term decline in lung function, and is supported by guidelines for severe eosinophilic asthma uncontrolled on high-dose ICS-LABA [^d85da68e] [^6fb1d864]. Benefits are greatest in patients with high blood eosinophils [^775ccc2b] and frequent exacerbations [^c2696e58], and early therapy is cost-effective by reducing hospitalizations and emergency care [^3c4d5c5a].

---

## Clinical benefits of early biologic initiation

### Reduction in exacerbations

Anti-IL-5/IL-5R biologics (mepolizumab, benralizumab, reslizumab) **reduce severe exacerbations by ~47–54%** [^27d14bd4] in severe eosinophilic asthma, with the largest effects in patients with higher eosinophil counts [^1246e0e2]. Early initiation **prevents exacerbation-related lung function decline** and improves quality of life [^notfound].

---

### Reduction in oral corticosteroid dependence

Early biologics enable **significant OCS dose reductions** [^c2d88a1d]; mepolizumab and benralizumab reduce median OCS dose by ~50% in OCS-dependent patients [^c2d88a1d]. This lowers the risk of steroid-related adverse effects such as osteoporosis, diabetes, and infections [^notfound].

---

### Improvement in lung function

Biologics produce **modest but meaningful FEV1 improvements** (~0.08–0.15 L) [^27d14bd4] in eosinophilic asthma, with early gains that accumulate over time [^84730caf]. Early treatment may **slow or halt progressive airflow limitation** [^a317d958] in severe eosinophilic disease.

---

### Enhancement of asthma control and quality of life

Early biologic therapy improves asthma control [^943080e0] and quality of life [^27d14bd4], with **rapid symptom gains** observed within weeks to months [^943080e0]. Sustained benefits include fewer symptoms, less rescue medication use, and better daily functioning [^2409f593].

---

## Disease-modifying potential and prevention of airway remodeling

Early biologics may **limit airway remodeling** [^e2d5b023] by reducing eosinophil-driven injury, mucus plugging, and structural changes, potentially preserving lung function long term [^84730caf]. This is especially relevant in patients with high eosinophils and recurrent exacerbations [^c2696e58].

## Evidence from clinical trials and real-world studies

| **Study** | **Biologic** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|
| MENSA, SIRIUS | Mepolizumab | - 47–54% ↓ exacerbations <br/> - ~50% ↓ OCS dose <br/> - Improved control/QoL [^c2d88a1d] [^27d14bd4] |
| CALIMA, SIROCCO | Benralizumab | - 28–51% ↓ exacerbations <br/> - ~50% ↓ OCS dose <br/> - Improved FEV1 and control [^c2d88a1d] [^1246e0e2] |
| REALITI-A | Mepolizumab | Sustained reductions in exacerbations and OCS use over 4 years [^notfound] |
| XALOC-2 | Benralizumab | Early, sustained control and 26.7% remission at 1 year [^943080e0] |

---

## Guideline recommendations

Current guidelines support **early biologic use** in severe eosinophilic asthma uncontrolled on high-dose ICS-LABA, with biomarker-guided selection (eosinophils ≥ 150–300/μL) [^d85da68e] [^267ff500]. They advise a 4–6 month trial, switching if ineffective, and continuing if effective [^271c5d70].

---

## Patient selection and biomarkers

Early biologics are most beneficial in patients with:

- **High blood eosinophils (≥ 300/μL)** [^c2696e58] [^775ccc2b]
- **Frequent exacerbations (≥ 2/year)** [^c2696e58]
- **OCS dependence** [^c2d88a1d]
- **Poor control despite optimized ICS-LABA** [^d85da68e]

Biomarkers such as **FeNO ≥ 20 ppb** [^fe009ab0] and sputum eosinophils ≥ 2% further enrich response [^notfound].

---

## Safety considerations

Biologics have favorable safety profiles [^97054297]; common adverse effects include injection-site reactions and transient eosinophilia [^dbad7b86]. Serious adverse events are uncommon, but **monitoring for hypersensitivity and infections** is recommended [^91ce1270].

---

## Economic considerations

Early biologics can be **cost-effective** by reducing hospitalizations, emergency visits, and OCS-related complications, offsetting drug costs in high-risk patients [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and uncertainties

- **Cost and access**: High cost may limit early use in some settings [^3c4d5c5a].
- **Long-term data**: More data are needed on durability and remission after stopping therapy [^817da220].
- **Pediatric evidence**: Limited data in children < 6 years; caution is advised [^614a63b6].

---

Early initiation of biologic therapy in eosinophilic asthma delivers **rapid, sustained reductions in exacerbations and OCS use**, with early improvements in lung function and control, and may modify disease by preventing remodeling. Benefits are greatest in high-eosinophil, exacerbation-prone patients, and guidelines support timely use after optimized inhaled therapy.

### How to assess effectiveness of biologics for asthma and what steps to take when there is not benefit [^6f5bcceb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Five biologic medications are approved in the United States for the treatment of asthma that is not well controlled with other therapies. All target asthma with elevated type 2 inflammatory markers, such as elevated eosinophils, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, or total and specific IgE. Asthma severity, phenotype, age, biomarkers, treatment goals/outcomes, comorbid conditions, safety, and cost should all help guide the initial biologic choice. In addition, a shared decision-making process with the patient is needed to optimize adherence, with special attention to patient preference regarding outcomes, safety concerns, and medication administration options. After a biologic agent is initiated, sufficient time is needed to monitor efficacy and response. For patients who do not respond favorably, patient-, disease-, and medication-related factors should be considered and remedied, if possible. Persistent suboptimal responders necessitate a reexamination of asthma phenotype, biomarkers, and the suspected immune response pathways. For some patients, a change in biologic therapy or other therapeutic options may be warranted. In this review, we examine the clinical approach for choosing an initial biologic for the treatment of asthma, the assessment of response to biologics, and the process of troubleshooting and adjusting biologic treatment for those patients with suboptimal responses.

### The clinical benefit of mepolizumab replacing omalizumab in uncontrolled severe eosinophilic asthma [^8053fe7e]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Asthma is a heterogenous condition that affects approximately 235 million people worldwide. 1 Although most patients with asthma are able to manage their symptoms and enjoy a good quality of life, 5%‐10% of patients suffer from severe asthma. 2 Severe asthma is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, 3 and accounts for approximately 50% of asthma care costs. 4 Patients with severe asthma typically require regular treatment with high‐dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), plus an additional controller or systemic corticosteroids (SCS) to prevent their disease from becoming uncontrolled. 2 Despite this therapy, a subset of patients continue to have uncontrolled disease.

Severe asthma comprises different phenotypes driven by distinct pathophysiological processes. 5 However, some severe asthma phenotypes overlap in terms of clinical and physiological characteristics, biomarker expression, and treatment response. 2, 5 In clinical practice, severe allergic asthma and severe eosinophilic asthma are recognized as distinct, but potentially overlapping phenotypes of severe asthma. 6 Severe allergic asthma is characterized by an early age of onset, high levels of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), high fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), clinically relevant sensitization to common aeroallergens and eosinophilic inflammation; severe eosinophilic asthma is characterized by a later age of onset, peripheral eosinophilia, high FeNO, and frequent exacerbations. 2, 5 Due to the unmet clinical need within these severe asthma populations, novel biologic therapies that target the immunologic mediators of disease have been developed. 4

Omalizumab is an anti‐IgE antibody indicated for use in patients with moderate‐to‐severe allergic asthma. 7 The humanized monoclonal antibody binds to the FcεRI binding domain of free circulating IgE, inhibits binding of IgE to its receptors, and decreases free IgE levels in serum. 8 In patients with severe asthma, omalizumab treatment decreases exacerbations, improves asthma control and improves patient quality of life. 9, 10, 11 Omalizumab is recommended by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) as a potential Step 5 treatment for patients with severe allergic asthma. 12 However, in some patients, symptoms remain uncontrolled despite omalizumab therapy. The European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society guidelines note that if symptoms do not improve within 4 months of initiating omalizumab treatment, further administration is unlikely to be beneficial. 2

### Evaluation of potential continuation rules for mepolizumab treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma [^93fa932f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Mepolizumab significantly reduces exacerbations in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. The early identification of patients likely to receive long-term benefit from treatment could ensure effective resource allocation.

Objective

To assess potential continuation rules for mepolizumab in addition to initiation criteria defined as 2 or more exacerbations in the previous year and blood eosinophil counts of 150 cells/μL or more at initiation or 300 cells/μL or more in the previous year.

Methods

This post hoc analysis included data from 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (NCT01000506 and NCT01691521) of mepolizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (N = 1,192). Rules based on blood eosinophils, physician-rated response to treatment, FEV 1, Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) score, and exacerbation reduction were assessed at week 16. To assess these rules, 2 key metrics accounting for the effects observed in the placebo arm were developed.

Results

Patients not meeting continuation rules based on physician-rated response, FEV 1, and the ACQ-5 score still derived long-term benefit from mepolizumab. Nearly all patients failing to reduce blood eosinophils had counts of 150 cells/μL or less at baseline. For exacerbations, assessment after 16 weeks was potentially premature for predicting future exacerbations.

Conclusion

There was no evidence of a reliable physician-rated response, ACQ-5 score, or lung function-based continuation rule. The added value of changes in blood eosinophils at week 16 over baseline was marginal. Initiation criteria for mepolizumab treatment provide the best method for assessing patient benefit from mepolizumab treatment, and treatment continuation should be reviewed on the basis of a predefined reduction in long-term exacerbation frequency and/or oral corticosteroid dose.

### An evaluation of mepolizumab as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma [^95a6f4fc]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical experience with anti-interleukin (IL)-5 biologic therapies for severe asthma has been increasing, alongside deeper and broader research focusing on the role of IL-5 and the IL-5 targeted mepolizumab. This review aims to provide an update of the evidence on the role of IL-5 and mepolizumab, with discussions of the benefits of mepolizumab and its future potential, to promote the comprehension of the pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches to asthma.

Areas Covered

For this narrative review, we conducted a database search in PubMed and Embase using the keywords 'IL-5' and 'mepolizumab', focusing on randomized controlled trials and real-world studies up to September 2024. An overview of the pathogenesis of severe asthma, new insights on the role of IL-5 and mepolizumab, and the evidence on the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab in the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma is provided, and its benefits in clinical remission and future applications are also discussed.

Expert Opinion

Mepolizumab holds considerable promise in asthma treatment due to its mechanism of action and multiple potential benefits. In clinical practice, it may be worth considering the exploratory initiation of mepolizumab add-on treatment from the time of medium-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroid use.

### Early and sustained asthma control and remission in real-world patients with severe eosinophilic asthma treated with benralizumab: XALOC-2 [^943080e0]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prospective real-world data concerning the early and sustained effects of benralizumab on asthma control in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA) is lacking.

Methods

XALOC-2 is a prospective, observational, multi-national, real-world study in adults with SEA treated with benralizumab. This integrated analysis assessed Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, achievement of 3-component clinical remission (which included well-controlled symptoms [ACQ score ≤ 0.75], no exacerbations, and no use of maintenance oral corticosteroids [mOCS]), and other clinical outcomes, over a 12-month baseline period and up to Week 56. Associations between remission status and key baseline characteristics were also assessed.

Results

535 patients were included. Median (interquartile range) ACQ score at baseline was 3.0 (2.2–3.8). At Week 1, 58.0% (282/486) of patients had ACQ score reductions of ≥ 0.5 points (minimal clinically important difference [MCID]) and 35.0% (170/486) had reductions of ≥ 1 point (2× MCID). By Week 56, these increased to 78.6% (276/351) and 62.1% (218/351), respectively. Improved asthma control after benralizumab initiation was similar irrespective of previous biologic use status. By Week 56, clinical remission criteria were achieved in 26.7% (70/262) of patients versus 0% (0/374) at baseline. No mOCS use, lower body mass index, better asthma symptom control and higher peak blood eosinophil count at baseline were associated with meeting 3-component clinical remission criteria at Week 56.

Conclusions

Real-world patients receiving benralizumab showed early and sustained improvements in asthma symptoms, regardless of previous biologic use. More than a quarter of patients achieved clinical asthma remission after 1year of benralizumab treatment.

### Can we predict who will benefit most from biologics in severe asthma? A post-hoc analysis of two phase 3 trials [^ae32147a]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 5 to 10% of asthma patients have severe or refractory asthma. Patients with severe asthma suffer from substantially higher morbidity, mortality, and comorbidities compared to patients with mild or moderate asthma, and contribute to nearly 50% of healthcare spending across all asthma patients. Major components of burden are the ongoing risk of exacerbations and poor asthma control. Thus, the prevention of exacerbations and improvement in asthma control are major targets of treatment in guidelines and critical endpoints in severe asthma clinical trials.

Advanced therapeutic antibodies (biologics) herald a new era of therapy in patients with severe asthma. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that omalizumab (anti-IgE antibody), mepolizumab, reslizumab (anti-interleukin-5 antibodies), benralizumab (anti-IL5Rα antibody), dupilumab (anti-IL4Rα antibody) and tezepelumab (anti-cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin antibody) have efficacy in reducing severe exacerbations, improving asthma control and lung function and, in some cases, reducing the use of oral corticosteroids. Subgroup analysis of early clinical trial data identified individual biomarkers such as blood eosinophil count (BEC) and serum IgE for response to biologics, which informed the criteria for regulatory approvals and treatment recommendations. However, to what extent multiple patient characteristics and biomarkers in combination can predict response to biologics has not been rigorously evaluated.

Indeed, in both clinical trials and real-world settings, individual responses to biologics are heterogeneous even among patients who are pre-selected for enhanced response based on relevant biomarkers and exacerbation history. Previous analyses have shown that 15–17% of biologic users show no response and 43–69% show partial response. Biologics are expensive, costing roughly $10,000 to $30,000 USD per person-year. Consequently, a considerable proportion of eligible patients lack adequate access to biologics, such as in Singapore where the cost-effectiveness profile is currently beyond the accepted willingness-to-pay threshold for formulary approval. The efficiency and cost-effectiveness of biologic therapy could potentially be improved using a 'precision medicine' approach to therapy, i.e. basing treatment choices on predicted response given each patient's unique characteristics.

### Controversies in allergy: the potential role of biologics as first-line therapy in eosinophilic disorders [^9c9e4735]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

With advances in understanding the role of eosinophils in disease pathogenesis, particularly in the airways, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, targeting eosinophils or the cytokines that lead to their production, activation, and survival has become an increasingly pursued therapeutic approach. Newly developed biologic agents target eosinophils directly, other cells interacting with or activating eosinophils, or cytokines in the type 2 inflammatory pathway with specific antibodies. Current treatment paradigms reserve therapy with biologics for patients refractory to or intolerant of corticosteroids or immunosuppressants. Given accumulating data for safety and efficacy of these biologics, however, there is the question of whether targeted treatments should be used earlier in the treatment algorithm. In this article, we discuss the pros and cons of using biologics as first-line therapy for eosinophilic diseases of the airways, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. We highlight emerging biologic agents and future directions for research, as well as a rationale for the early use of some biologics to prevent tissue damage, disease progression, and organ dysfunction in selected conditions.

### Recognition and management of severe asthma: a Canadian Thoracic Society position statement [^6a5ee646]. Canadian Journal of Respiratory, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to biologic therapy, CTS 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering anti-IL-5 therapies in ≥ 18 years old patients with severe eosinophilic corticosteroid-dependent asthma, in an attempt to decrease or withdraw oral corticosteroids.

### Recognition and management of severe asthma: a Canadian Thoracic Society position statement [^7b809d1a]. Canadian Journal of Respiratory, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to biologic therapy, CTS 2017 guidelines recommend to recognize that blood eosinophil counts may help to identify responders to anti-IL-5 therapy, with the greatest reduction in asthma exacerbations associated with the highest levels of blood eosinophil counts. Recognize that the following cutoffs have been used at initiation:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mepolizumab|- > 150 cells/mL|
|Reslizumab|- > 400 cells/mL|
|Benralizumab|- > 300 cells/mL.|

### Blood eosinophil-directed management of airway disease. the past, present, and future [^a317d958]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

So where might we be heading with biomarker-directed management of airway disease? I see progress in three main areas. First, there is growing evidence that blood eosinophil–directed use of oral corticosteroids to treat acute exacerbations of COPD is an effective and safe way to limit exposure to a potentially toxic treatment. This approach needs to be evaluated in larger definitive studies involving different healthcare settings and different patient groups. Second, biomarker-directed risk stratification and reduction should be extended beyond COPD and severe asthma clinics. There is now evidence from large intervention studies in mild, moderate, and severe asthma that the blood eosinophil count is independently associated with up to a fivefold increased risk for severe exacerbations as well as a greater response to ICS and biological agents. Most studies have shown that another easy to measure biomarker, exhaled nitric oxide, adds prognostic and predictive information to blood eosinophil–based stratification. It seems obvious that this information would help clinicians and patients make good decisions about the need for long-term preventative treatment. Why, then, do guideline groups continue to make weak and equivocal recommendations on the question of whether type 2 biomarkers should be used to predict outcomes and guide asthma treatment? It is becoming crucial that this stance is reconsidered, particularly because any concerns about the safety of not treating biomarker-low patients with regular ICS disappear completely if as-needed ICS/rapid-onset β 2 -agonist becomes the standard of care for milder asthma.

A third area requiring more work is whether we should move from secondary to primary prevention of problems associated with biomarker-identified type 2 airway inflammation. Might early use of ICS or a biologic in patients with raised biomarkers of type 2 airway inflammation but mild or no symptoms improve longer-term outcomes? This is a possibility, as a raised blood eosinophil count has been associated with increased rate of decline in FEV 1 in a community population independent of the presence of symptoms or an asthma label. In addition, there is existing evidence from post hoc analysis of intervention studies that ICS prevents decline in FEV 1 in patients with COPD and a blood eosinophil count greater than 0.15 × 10⁹/L and that the anti–IL-4 receptor-α biologic dupilumab prevents decline in FEV₁ over 12 months. Prospective studies are needed to answer this important question definitively.

### Biologics and airway remodeling in asthma: early, late, and potential preventive effects [^66345a60]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 3 Proposed classification of the early, late, and potential preventive effects of biologics on airway remodeling in asthma.

FIGURE 3
Early effects: Evidence of improvements in lung function and reduction in inflammation shortly after biologics' initiation illustrate the rapid benefits of targeting specific inflammatory pathways (a; b; c; d; e; f; g; h; i; j). Late effects: Analogous to observed outcomes in conditions like atopic dermatitis, and eosinophilic oesophagitis, biologics may also impact long‐term structural changes within the airways, suggesting a potential for reversing or ameliorating established AiRem (k; l; m; n; o; p; q; r). Potential preventive effects: This represents an emerging research domain, emphasizing the potential of biologics to prevent the onset or progression of AiRem. Although empirical evidence is presently limited in this area, it is identified as a vital avenue for future research aimed at elucidating the comprehensive effects of biologics on the asthma disease trajectory (s; t; u; v). It is important to note that the studies regarding the early and late effects of biologics are essentially based on adults with severe asthma. Further research is needed to evaluate early, late, and potential preventive effects of biologics in pediatric cohorts. ASM, airway smooth muscle; ECM, collagen and extracellular matrix; FEV₁, forced expiratory volume in 1 s; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; pDC, plasmacytoid dendritic cell; RBM, reticular basement membrane.

### Biologics and airway remodeling in asthma: early, late, and potential preventive effects [^08a7a9b9]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

This would include the prevention of cytotoxic effects of eosinophil‐derived mediators leading to fibrosis (e.g. eosinophilic endomyocardial fibrosis), but also the steric effects of eosinophil accumulation in airway walls, including mucus plugging. Similarly, the use of anti‐IL‐5 mAbs for eosinophilic diseasespossibly suggests these biologics as first‐line treatment in eosinophilic inflammatory diseases, including asthma, as recently suggested.

It is critical to recognize that not all individuals with mild or moderate asthma will develop severe asthma or AiRem. Therefore, studies on cohorts such as The Mild/Moderate Asthma Network in Italy (MANI) are needed to understand individual patients' trajectories and their risk factors. Furthermore, the use of canonical (e.g. blood eosinophil counts and FeNO levels) and the identification of novel biomarkers predictive of severe asthma could play a critical role in optimizing the use of biologics in preventive strategies. These efforts could help stratify patients at risk of severe asthma and/or AiRem, guiding early biologic interventions more efficiently.

Based on the previous observations, existing biologics as well as those in development, offer a challenging opportunity to also study early treatment (GINA Step 3 or even 2) of asthma with biologics. These strategies could prevent or limit not only the side effects of OCS but also the structural changes resulting from longstanding uncontrolled airway inflammation. Future studies should aim to prevent the onset of AiRem, taking into account the cost‐effectiveness of early treatment with biologics, potentially at lower doses or different schedules. The inclusion of predictive modeling and risk stratification, as pursued by MANI, could guide the judicious selection of patients for these preventive interventions.

Purpose Of Review

Biologics have proven safe and effective for severe asthma. Their introduction has offered hope for patients and prescribers with a growing list of novel medications and indications. While 'step-up' indications for biologic initiation are well described in guidelines, 'step-down' strategy remains poorly understood and thus guidance is limited. In this opinion article we aim to focus on recent practice changing evidence for stepping-down severe asthma management, tools for the assessment of biologic efficacy, propose a framework for the step-down of biologic and nonbiologic therapies and suggest topics of interest for future research.

Recent Findings

Clinical tools have been developed to aid in assessing biologic response. Some patients experience marked improvement and may enter a period of clinical remission or even complete remission. Following positive response, add-on therapy may safely be approached for taper or withdrawal.

Summary

There is limited consensus but growing evidence for stepping-down therapies in patients who achieve clinical response and/or remission after biologic initiation. Further structured guidance would benefit clinicians who face clinical uncertainty when deciding to step-down therapy in patients with well controlled asthma.

### Early response to tezepelumab in type-2 severe asthma patients non-responders to other biological treatments: a real-life study [^a9dc6825]. The Journal of Asthma (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Biologic therapies play a crucial role in the treatment of severe asthma. Tezepelumab, a human monoclonal antibody (mAb), inhibits thymic stromal lymphopoietin, a pivotal factor in the pathophysiology of asthma. Although randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of Tezepelumab, evidence gaps remain in real-world scenarios.

Objective

We sought investigate Tezepelumab's response in a clinical setting, focusing on patients who previously failed to other asthma mAbs.

Methods

Real-life study with severe uncontrolled asthma patients despite mAb treatment, requiring a switch to Tezepelumab. Follow-up was done four to six months after initiation of Tezepelumab. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the response in patients with poor response or intolerance to other mAbs.

Results

Nine patients were followed up during 7months. Patients were predominantly middle-aged females with eosinophilic or eosinophilic-allergic phenotypes. Patients had a median failure rate of 2 mAbs (IQR 2–3), with an uncontrolled asthma (median of 2 severe exacerbations the previous year, airflow obstruction and 78% corticosteroid dependence). Tezepelumab demonstrated after 4 to 6months of treatment reduce corticosteroid dependence (complete withdrawal in 2/7 patients), no exacerbations in 6/9, symptoms control improvement (Asthma Control Test score improved in 5/9) and modulate lung function (improving in 3/9 patients). These findings align with clinical trial results, suggesting Tezepelumab's potential in real-world settings.

Conclusion

In real-world scenarios, despite the study's limitations, our results underscore Tezepelumab's promise as a therapeutic option for uncontrolled severe asthma, and may be useful for non-responders to other mAbs. Further studies are needed to corroborate these findings.

### From DREAM to REALITI – A and beyond: mepolizumab for the treatment of eosinophil-driven diseases [^3c4d5c5a]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Further insights into the cost‐effectiveness of biologic treatments in asthma and other eosinophilic diseases are also needed. In asthma, it is suggested that biologic therapy is directed to those patients most likely to respond in order to improve cost‐effectiveness. This would involve the use of biomarkers to identify such patients prior to treatment, as well as close monitoring of individuals following treatment initiation to assess treatment response. As work to identify biomarkers that are useful in this regard is ongoing, continued assessment of cost‐effectiveness is needed to support treatment decision‐making.

It is known that eosinophil biology is complex, with roles in both maintaining health and contributing to disease. In a healthy population, the blood eosinophil count can vary; however, the "normal" blood eosinophil count in healthy individuals is lower than generally perceived, as several highly prevalent factors, such as atopy, allergy rhinitis, and smoking, can elevate counts. In patients with mild asthma, there is now convincing and consistent evidence that high blood eosinophil counts are associated with increased exacerbation risk, even if they initially present with mild symptoms and normal lung function. In addition, an association between blood eosinophilia and lung function decline has been identified, independent of asthma and smoking, meaning that eosinophilia is a risk factor for airflow obstruction even in individuals without disease symptoms. Whether reducing eosinophils in these healthy individuals may be beneficial is an interesting consideration. In addition, the consequences of long‐term eosinophil reduction in patients with eosinophilic diseases will be an important topic for future research.

### Can early intervention in pediatric asthma improve long-term outcomes? A question that needs an answer [^614a63b6]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

IL‐5 is a cytokine involved in the growth, differentiation, and migration of eosinophils to the airway. Mepolizumab 61, 62 (FDA‐approved as add‐on maintenance treatment in patients aged ≥ 12 years with severe eosinophilic asthma) and reslizumab 63, 64 (approved in adults) are anti–IL‐5 monoclonal antibodies that block its effects. Studies have shown that both mepolizumab and reslizumab significantly reduced the frequency of exacerbations compared with placebo in patients with asthma and high blood eosinophil counts. 62, 63 Unlike mepolizumab and reslizumab, benralizumab is a humanized, afucosylated monoclonal antibody against the IL‐5 receptor α. It is FDA‐approved for the add‐on maintenance treatment of patients with severe asthma aged ≥ 12 years, and with an eosinophilic phenotype. 65 In contrast to mepolizumab and reslizumab, which bind IL‐5 itself, benralizumab binds the α subunit of the IL‐5 receptor on the surface of eosinophils and basophils. Afucosylation of the antibody enhances its binding to the FcγRIIIA receptor on natural killer cells, which induces rapid and near‐complete depletion of eosinophils by enhanced antibody‐dependent cell‐mediated cytotoxicity. 66 Studies have demonstrated that benralizumab add‐on therapy significantly reduced the frequency of exacerbations, improved lung function, and reduced the need for oral corticosteroid use in patients with elevated blood eosinophils. 67, 68, 69 However, there is limited information on the use of anti–IL‐5 or anti–IL‐5 receptor α agents in pediatric asthma, and further studies are warranted for these therapies in pediatric patients, especially those aged 6‐ < 12 years.

### Real-world effectiveness of reslizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma-first initiators and switchers [^3d8274bc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Reslizumab, a biologic targeting IL-5, has been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations and maintenance oral corticosteroid use in randomized controlled trials and pre-post studies in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. However, real-world effectiveness data of reslizumab are scarce, and it is unknown whether reslizumab has added value after switching from another type 2 biologic.

Objective

To evaluate (1) the real-world effectiveness of reslizumab on severe asthma exacerbations, maintenance oral corticosteroid use, and overall treatment response, both in biologic-naive patients who initiated reslizumab and in those who switched from another type 2 biologic; and (2) physicians' experience with reslizumab treatment.

Methods

This observational real-world study evaluated data from 134 adults with severe eosinophilic asthma included in the Dutch severe asthma registry (RAPSODI), who initiated reslizumab treatment (4-weekly infusions, 0.3 mg/kg) before April 2020 and had follow-up data for 6 months and greater. Clinical asthma experts completed surveys on their experience with reslizumab treatment.

Results

Overall, reslizumab reduced the exacerbation rate (odds ratio [95% CI] = 0.10 [0.05–0.21]; P < .001), oral corticosteroid use (OR [95% CI], 0.2 [0.0–0.5]; P < .001), and maintenance dose (median [CI], 5.0 [0.0–10.0] to 0.0 [0.0–5.0]; P < .001), with comparable results in biologic-naive reslizumab initiators and switchers. The overall response to reslizumab was graded good or excellent in 59.2% of patients. The additive effectiveness of reslizumab after switching from another biologic was reflected in physicians' surveys.

Conclusions

Real-world data show that reslizumab reduces severe asthma exacerbations and oral corticosteroid use in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, both in biologic-naive reslizumab initiators and in those who switched from another type 2 biologic. This additional value of reslizumab was recognized by clinical asthma experts.

### Can early intervention in pediatric asthma improve long-term outcomes? A question that needs an answer [^48a0a99f]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

9 HETEROGENEITY IN TREATMENT RESPONSE

Children that present with asthma exacerbations generally have more severe disease and signs of eosinophilic inflammation. 74 According to recent estimates, approximately 38% of children with asthma have uncontrolled disease, and 52% of children with uncontrolled asthma were already taking long‐term controller medications. 75 In addition, some children whose asthma is still not controlled despite ICS therapy respond to other standard therapies differently. 76 Another issue to consider is difficult‐to‐treat asthma, defined by the need for multiple medications, frequent and/or severe exacerbations, inability to avoid triggers, and complicated treatment regimens. 77 Although this type of asthma is not a phenotype as defined by treatment guidelines, it can describe asthma of any severity level and is likely to contribute to the population of children with uncontrolled asthma. Overall, efficacy can be difficult to demonstrate in young children due to the confounding influences of socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and comorbidities, as well as the heterogeneity of asthma itself.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to biologic therapy, CTS 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering anti-IL-5 therapies (mepolizumab, benralizumab, reslizumab) in ≥ 18 years old patients with severe eosinophilic asthma experiencing recurrent asthma exacerbations despite optimal asthma treatment, including a high-dose ICS and at least one other controller.

### The clinical effectiveness of mepolizumab treatment in severe eosinophilic asthma; outcomes from four years cohort evaluation [^19d83d69]. The Journal of Asthma (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical trials and real world studies demonstrated benefit of mepolizumab treatment in severe asthma but data on its effectiveness beyond 2years remain limited. Herein, we provide mepolizumab treatment evaluation up to 4years.

Methods

we studied all patients initiated on mepolizumab in our center from June 2017 to August 2018. Clinical outcomes data were retrieved from the local dendrite systems registry. Comparison analyses and logistic regression were conducted to explore longevity and predictors of response to mepolizumab treatment.

Results

a total of 66 patients initiated on mepolizumab with a median follow-up of 45.8 (42.4,48.1) months were included in the study [mean age 50.3years (range 18–79), females 50 (73%)]. At 20.7months of treatment, 42 patients (63.6%) had positive response, 13 (19.7%) negative response, and 11 (16.7%) discontinued due to other factors. At 45.8months, 35 (53%) patients were still on mepolizumab, 21 (31.8%) switched to a different biologic, and 10 (15.2%) discontinued biologics. Two deaths were recorded during the study period. The median blood eosinophil was reduced from 0.43x10 9 /L (0.27, 0.75) to 0.04 (0.0, 0.1) (p < 0.00001)]. The median annual exacerbations were reduced from 6.0 (4,8) to 1.0 (0.0,3.0) (p < 0.00001), and mOCS use was reduced from59% to 29%, p = 0.001. The mean asthma control questionnaire-6 (ACQ6) improved from 3.1 ± 1.7 to 2.1 ± 1.3 (p < 0.00001).

Conclusions

mepolizumab clinical benefit was sustained over 4years. However, approximately half of the cohort discontinued the treatment prompting the need for further research into the treatment response longevity.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to biologic therapy, CTS 2017 guidelines recommend to recognize that predictors of response to omalizumab include a history of recurrent exacerbations or blood eosinophil counts of 260–300 cells/mL, although the exact eosinophil cut-off remains to be clearly established.

### From DREAM to REALITI – A and beyond: mepolizumab for the treatment of eosinophil-driven diseases [^2501f2a7]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Different dosing strategies across the different diseases could also be investigated in the future studies so that treatment can be personalized to the patient and their condition. Novel long‐acting IL‐5 monoclonal antibodies, such as Depemokimab, which is currently being investigated for the treatment of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma in the SWIFT (NCT04719832 and NCT04718103) and NIMBLE (NCT04718389) trials, may be important in this regard. The impact of stopping versus continuing mepolizumab therapy after continuous treatment for ≥ 3 years in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma was investigated in asthma in the COMET study (GSK ID: 201810, NCT02555371). This study showed that patients need to continue with biologic therapy in order to continue deriving clinical benefit and prevent worsening in clinical outcomes including lung function. This concept was supported by small, early trials of mepolizumab cessation in patients with EGPA, in which the majority of patients experienced relapses when switched to methotrexate therapy following induction of remission with mepolizumab. This will be an important area of research as the use of mepolizumab expands into other eosinophilic diseases.

### Benralizumab effectiveness in severe asthma is independent of previous biologic use [^a2e37495]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Benralizumab is an IL-5 receptor alpha-directed cytolytic mAb that depletes eosinophils, reducing exacerbations and oral corticosteroid (OCS) use, and improves asthma control for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA). Data on response in patients previously treated with other biologic therapies are limited.

Objective

To describe real-world clinical outcomes with benralizumab for patients with and without prior biologic use for uncontrolled SEA.

Methods

This retrospective study compared clinical outcomes before and after benralizumab initiation in adults with uncontrolled SEA with 3 or more asthma exacerbations in the previous 12 months or on maintenance OCS treatment. Outcomes included exacerbations, OCS use, patient-reported outcomes, and health care resource utilization, including emergency department visits and hospitalizations.

Results

In all, 208 patients were enrolled, including 90 (43.3%) with previous experience with an alternate biologic for SEA. Benralizumab led to an 81% reduction in exacerbation rate, with 48% of patients with previous exacerbations experiencing none after 48 weeks. Overall, 67% of patients requiring baseline maintenance OCS achieved greater than or equal to 50% reduction in daily OCS dosage, and 53% eliminated maintenance OCS. Clinically meaningful improvements in patient-reported outcomes were seen, with response at 4 weeks predicting longer-term benefits. Health care resource utilization also decreased. Improvements were observed irrespective of previous biologic experience, fractional exhaled nitric oxide concentrations, atopic status, or other baseline characteristics.

Conclusions

In a multicenter real-world setting, patients with uncontrolled SEA achieved substantial improvements in all clinical outcome measures with benralizumab irrespective of previous biologic use, atopic status, or baseline fractional exhaled nitric oxide concentration.

### Choosing the right biologic for the right patient with severe asthma [^bde126eb]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

First, consider the biomarkers: both circulating eosinophil counts and Fare raised, identifying two immunologic pathways that could be implicated in the pathophysiologic characteristics, and thus identifying a high-risk and high-stake situation for the patient. The high risk relates to the predictable potential for future asthma attacks, whereas the stakes are high because the same type 2 inflammatory process that predicts an excellent response to type-targeted antiinflammatory medication also puts the patient in harm's way. Dupilumab, tezepelumab, and, to a lesser extent, omalizumab can influence both eosinophils and F, whereas anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-5R will not suppress F. The recent Study to Assess the Reduction of Daily Maintenance ICS/LABA Treatment Towards Anti-Inflammatory Reliever Treatment in Patients With Severe Eosinophilic Asthma Treated With Benralizumab (SHAMAL) trial, in which weaning of ICS while taking benralizumab was associated with an F-related decrease in FEV₁, suggests this might be an important factor.

One also should take into account the early onset of asthma in this patient. With the results of the Evaluation of Dupilumab in Children With Uncontrolled Asthma (VOYAGE)and Trial of Mepolizumab Adjunctive Therapy for the Prevention of Asthma Exacerbations in Urban Children (MUPPITS2), studies in children, in addition to post hoc analyses of phase 3 trials of benralizumab, the early onset of the disease and raised Flevel may imply that the patient has epithelial or atopic-driven type 2 inflammation. This phonotype suggests that she would benefit more from Fand IgE-lowering therapies (eg, inhibition of IL-4 or IL-13 by dupilumab or, more speculatively, binding of TSLP with tezepelumab)than blood eosinophil-lowering therapies (eg, inhibition of IL-5 or IL-5R by mepolizumab or benralizumab). Indeed, Fincreases with IL-13 activity in the airway epithelium — most classically with allergies, the hallmark of childhood asthma — whereas the blood eosinophil count reflects systemic IL-5 activity and the pool of effector cells, a key biomarker for severe adult-onset asthma. It would be interesting to ask the patient about her response to prednisolone given to treat attacks. A prompt and complete response confirms that type 2 inflammation is playing an important role and augurs well for a response to type 2-targeting biologics.

### Recognition and management of severe asthma: a Canadian Thoracic Society position statement [^b36554d1]. Canadian Journal of Respiratory, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for severe asthma phenotypes, more specifically with respect to other biologic agents, CTS 2017 guidelines recommend to recognize that blood eosinophil counts may help to identify responders to anti-IL-5 therapy, with the greatest reduction in asthma exacerbations associated with the highest levels of blood eosinophil counts. Recognize that the following cutoffs have been used at initiation:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mepolizumab|- > 150 cells/mL|
|Reslizumab|- > 400 cells/mL|
|Benralizumab|- > 300 cells/mL.|

### Which patients with asthma are most likely to benefit from allergen immunotherapy? [^df3c5500]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

If allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is to be considered as a treatment option for allergic asthma, it must undergo the same developmental steps as other antiasthmatic drugs. The bronchial allergen challenge model has demonstrated excellent negative predictive value for the development of new therapies for asthma. Subcutaneous immunotherapy appears to have a clinical and significant effect on the early asthmatic response to mite, cat, and birch and grass pollens in children and adults. Use of AIT in children with asthma is widely practiced but not supported by as strong a level of evidence as in adults. House dust mite sublingual immunotherapy tablets demonstrate efficacy in asthma exacerbations and other outcomes when used as add-on therapy in adult patients. Using a biologic to improve the patient's lung functions and asthma control before initiating AIT can transform unsuitable candidates for AIT into appropriate candidates. Because AIT is a form of personalized medicine, phenotyping the most suitable patient is necessary. Field studies of adults and children have suggested that polysensitized patients with rhinitis and Global Initiative for Asthma class 2 to class 4 asthma appear the most likely to be good responders. We hypothesized that AIT responders are those who demonstrate a high eosinophilic response to natural or experimental exposure.

### Biologics for severe asthma: treatment-specific effects are important in choosing a specific agent [^01aa60c5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with uncontrolled severe persistent asthma have greater morbidity, greater use of health care resources, and more impairment in health-related quality of life when compared with their peers with well-controlled disease. Fortunately, since the introduction of biological therapeutics, patients with severe eosinophilic asthma now have beneficial treatment options that they did not have just a few years ago. In addition to anti-IgE therapy for allergic asthma, 3 new biological therapeutics targeting IL-5 and 1 targeting IL-4 and IL-13 signaling have recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma, and approval of more biological therapeutics is on the horizon. These medications decrease the frequency of asthma exacerbations, improve lung function, reduce corticosteroid usage, and improve health-related quality of life. This article reviews the mechanisms of action, specific indications, benefits, and side effects of each of the approved biological therapies for asthma. Furthermore, this article reviews how a clinician could use specific patient characteristics to decide which biologic treatment may be optimal for a given patient.

### The clinical benefit of mepolizumab replacing omalizumab in uncontrolled severe eosinophilic asthma [^b378e1e5]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this open‐label study provides evidence that patients with severe asthma who are eligible for both biologics and not optimally controlled with omalizumab could be effectively switched to mepolizumab to improve their asthma control. Patients experienced statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in asthma control (measured by ACQ‐5), quality of life (measured by SGRQ), and asthma exacerbations, following the switch from omalizumab to mepolizumab without a standard washout. No tolerability issues were observed. This pragmatic study reflects expected clinical practice and provides practical guidance to clinicians for the treatment of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.

### The clinical benefit of mepolizumab replacing omalizumab in uncontrolled severe eosinophilic asthma [^0d4d70cf]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

Omalizumab has previously been reported to reduce peripheral blood eosinophil counts in patients with severe asthma, 29 and to have greater efficacy in terms of exacerbation reduction in patients with blood eosinophil counts ≥ 260 cells/µL 30 or ≥ 300 cells/µL, 31, 32 as compared with patients with lower blood eosinophil counts. Interestingly, the present study assessed patients whose asthma was unresponsive to a biologic treatment targeting the IgE pathway and who were switched to an alternative treatment targeting the IL‐5 pathway. The results showed a significant decrease in peripheral blood eosinophil count as early as 4 weeks after switching from omalizumab to mepolizumab, and an associated decrease in markers of eosinophil activity (eosinophilic cationic protein and eosinophil‐derived neurotoxin). This rapid decrease is consistent with previous studies of mepolizumab, 15, 16, 17 and reflects the direct action and target engagement of mepolizumab on the eosinophil survival factor, IL‐5. This study has demonstrated that mepolizumab is a relevant treatment option in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma that is unresponsive to high‐dose ICS and omalizumab, and that physicians may substitute one biologic with another to improve clinical outcomes.

### Evolving concepts of asthma [^2560d576]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Our understanding of asthma has evolved over time from a singular disease to a complex of various phenotypes, with varied natural histories, physiologies, and responses to treatment. Early therapies treated most patients with asthma similarly, with bronchodilators and corticosteroids, but these therapies had varying degrees of success. Similarly, despite initial studies that identified an underlying type 2 inflammation in the airways of patients with asthma, biologic therapies targeted toward these type 2 pathways were unsuccessful in all patients. These observations led to increased interest in phenotyping asthma. Clinical approaches, both biased and later unbiased/statistical approaches to large asthma patient cohorts, identified a variety of patient characteristics, but they also consistently identified the importance of age of onset of disease and the presence of eosinophils in determining clinically relevant phenotypes. These paralleled molecular approaches to phenotyping that developed an understanding that not all patients share a type 2 inflammatory pattern. Using biomarkers to select patients with type 2 inflammation, repeated trials of biologics directed toward type 2 cytokine pathways saw newfound success, confirming the importance of phenotyping in asthma. Further research is needed to clarify additional clinical and molecular phenotypes, validate predictive biomarkers, and identify new areas for possible interventions.

### Long-term outcomes of dupilumab therapy in severe asthma: a retrospective, multicenter, real-world study [^92e70040]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Predictors of long-term response have been identified in both clinical trials and real-world studies. Bult et alidentified high BEC before dupilumab initiation and male sex as predictors of remission. Importantly, lower Fwas associated with a lower likelihood of remission in their data. In our cohort, no baseline characteristics were significantly associated with remission on dupilumab therapy. Univariate analyses suggested that patients experiencing early benefits (improvement in FEV₁% and FVC%) within 3 months of therapy initiation were more likely to achieve remission at 36 months. In a study of the Danish asthma registry, decreasing Fwas found to be a predictor for remission in a cohort receiving anti-IL5/IL-5Rα therapy; however, decreasing Fwas not a predictor of remission in our cohort. This might be due to a rather mixed cohort of patients with both early- and adult-onset phenotypes represented in our study as well as due to previous biological therapies.

The strengths of our study are its close representation of the real-life clinical scenario, with a heavily pretreated patient cohort of an outpatient clinic specializing in management of severe asthma. It reflects real-life clinical decisions and demonstrates the trajectories of patients with severe asthma including multiple switching of biologics. Furthermore, we were able to assemble data from 3 high-volume asthma outpatient clinics. However, the study also has some limitations. Data were assessed retrospectively in a real-world setting, lacking a control group without biological treatment. In addition, clinical decisions on continuing or discontinuing treatment might have differed among physicians or participating centers; eg, there was no predefined cutoff for cessation of dupilumab therapy in the case of hypereosinophilia. Although this was a multicenter study, the number of patients in our cohort is smaller compared with the large number of participants in RCTs and open-label studies such as TRAVERSE, which may limit external validity.

In summary, dupilumab is an effective treatment option for patients with severe asthma that has sustained treatment efficacy during long-term treatment. A relevant proportion of patients achieved remission at 12 and 36 months despite previous unsuccessful treatment with biologics.

### Dupilumab is effective in type 2-high asthma patients receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids at baseline [^e69c98b2]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this analysis of data from the pivotal phase 2b and phase 3 LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST studies, dupilumab 200 and 300 mg q2w vs placebo reduced severe exacerbation rates and improved FEV₁ (L), asthma control (ACQ‐5), and rate of responders (ACQ improvement of MCID ≥ 0.5) in patients with uncontrolled, type 2‐high persistent or moderate‐to‐severe asthma taking high‐dose ICS at baseline. Improvements were observed across each of the subgroups as early as the first time point assessed and were sustained until treatment end in both studies.

There are currently 5 biologic add‐on treatments for patients with uncontrolled severe asthma that target underlying type 2 inflammatory processes: dupilumab, benralizumab, reslizumab, mepolizumab, and omalizumab. As previously outlined, dupilumab blocks the shared receptor component for IL‐4/IL‐13, key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation. 14, 15, 16, 17 It is approved in the EU 26 as add‐on maintenance treatment in patients aged ≥ 12 years with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised FeNO levels who are inadequately controlled with a high‐dose ICS plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. It is also approved in the USA 27 and other countries 28 as an add‐on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate‐to‐severe asthma aged ≥ 12 years with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid‐dependent asthma. 19, 20, 29 Benralizumab, reslizumab, and mepolizumab are monoclonal antibodies targeting IL‐5, a key component in eosinophil activation, proliferation, and degranulation. Benralizumab binds the alpha chain of the IL‐5 (IL‐5α) eosinophil cell surface receptor, blocking IL‐5 binding and has been evaluated in phase 3 studies in patients ≥ 12 years. 30 Mepolizumab and reslizumab bind directly to IL‐5, which in turn blocks binding with IL‐5α. 31, 32 Mepolizumab has been evaluated in patients aged ≥ 6 years and reslizumab in patients ≥ 18 years. Omalizumab, an anti‐IgE monoclonal antibody that has been evaluated in patients ≥ 6 years, binds IgE and inhibits basophil and mast cell release of proinflammatory mediators. 33

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^1bb96700]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Appendix G biologic indications and monitoring detail steroid-sparing evidence, age-based approvals, and continuation of controllers. An oral steroid-sparing effect with benralizumab, mepolizumab, dupilumab, and reslizumab has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials in oral steroid–dependent patients; tezepelumab was not shown to reduce ICS dose while maintaining asthma control compared to placebo, and real-world studies with omalizumab have shown reduction in oral steroid maintenance doses. Omalizumab is indicated for moderate-to-severe persistent asthma in patients six years of age and older with a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen; mepolizumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab are indicated for severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype, with mepolizumab and benralizumab approved for those who are six years of age and older and reslizumab for those who are 18 years of age and older; dupilumab is indicated for moderate-to-severe asthma in those who are six years of age and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma; tezepelumab is indicated for severe asthma in those who are 12 years of age or older without regards to phenotype or biomarkers; and higher blood eosinophils at baseline is a predictor of a good asthma outcome to biologic therapy. When biologics are started, other controller treatments are continued. Do not discontinue ICS. A trial of at least 4 months is needed to assess initial response, with assessments including asthma symptom control, exacerbations, lung function, side effects to therapy, and patient satisfaction, and where applicable, effects on type 2 co-morbidities such as nasal polyps and atopic dermatitis should be assessed.

### Clinical development of mepolizumab for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma: on the path to personalized medicine [^2a300467]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

The development of mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma, is an example of a clinical development program that evolved over time based on sound, basic scientific principles. Initial clinical data on the effects of mepolizumab on lung function in a general asthmatic population were disappointing. However, it became clear that mepolizumab may be more effective against other clinical endpoints, particularly asthma exacerbations, in patients with more severe disease. Furthermore, a developing understanding of asthma disease pathobiology led to the identification of an appropriate target population and predictive biomarker for mepolizumab treatment: patients with severe eosinophilic asthma and blood eosinophil count. Mepolizumab use provides clinically meaningful benefits in this target population, fulfilling an unmet need. This Clinical Commentary Review describes the clinical development of mepolizumab and details of how this program informed the development of other biologic therapies in patients with severe asthma. This account highlights how a personalized approach toward treatment of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, supported by a large body of scientific evidence, ultimately led to new and effective treatments and improved patient outcomes.

Refer patients to support services, where available, to help them deal with the heavy physical, emotional, social and financial burden of severe asthma and its treatment.

In Step 5, recommended add-on options include long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) (tiotropium ⩾6 yr, triple therapy with ICS–LABA–LAMA ⩾18 yr). Adding LAMA provided modest improvement in lung function but not symptom control, and exacerbations were reduced in some studies. Step 4 MART with ICS–formoterol should be tried before considering add-on LAMA; as-needed ICS–formoterol can be continued as the reliever for patients prescribed ICS–formoterol–LAMA, but for patients prescribed an ICS–LABA–LAMA with nonformoterol LABA, the appropriate reliever is SABA. After specialist referral, add-on, low-dose azithromycin is another option for reducing exacerbations, but risks of antibiotic resistance and prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) on electrocardiography must be considered. Sputum-guided adjustment of the ICS dose improves outcomes in moderate-to-severe asthma but is not widely available, and the optimal frequency of sputum assessment is not known.

With add-on biologic therapies for severe eosinophilic asthma (benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab) and severe allergic asthma (dupilumab, omalizumab) the main benefits are substantial reduction in severe exacerbations and reduced OCS exposure. No head-to-head studies are available, but typical eligibility criteria for each class, and predictors of good response, are found in the GINA pocket guide decision tree.

Maintenance OCS treatment should be avoided, wherever possible, because of its serious long-term side effects.

At follow-up, assess the response to any add-on treatment, stop ineffective treatments, and consider other options. For patients who respond to add-on therapy, reevaluate the need for other therapies every 3–4 months, but do not completely stop ICS.

Continue to optimize patient care in collaboration with primary care and consider the patient's social and emotional needs. Arrange multidisciplinary team care for severe asthma, if available. Invite patients with severe asthma to enroll in a registry or clinical trial, if available and relevant, to help fill evidence gaps, including comparison of biologic therapy options and positioning of bronchial thermoplasty.

### Real-world data on tezepelumab in patients with severe asthma in Germany [^c811e542]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Tezepelumab is a novel biologic blocking thymic stromal lymphopoetin, approved for severe asthma irrespective of biomarker levels or phenotype.

Objective

To characterize a real-world tezepelumab patient cohort and the efficacy among various asthma phenotypes.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, multicenter study on patients with severe asthma initiating tezepelumab. Clinical response was evaluated at 3 and 6 months.

Results

We included 129 patients with an average age of 52.5 ± 13.1 years, 59.7% were female. The majority (86.0%) had increased type 2 (T2) biomarkers, 68.2% an allergic and 31.8% an eosinophilic phenotype. 23.3% of patients were biologic-naive. 22 (18.2%) patients discontinued tezepelumab therapy owing to suspected side effects or insufficient efficacy. At 6 months' follow-up, median reduction in annualized exacerbation rate was-1 [25th percentile; 75% percentile {-2.9; 0.0}], the reduction of oral corticosteroid dose among patients with long-term oral corticosteroid therapy was -5 mg [-10; 0] and the Asthma Control Test (ACT) improved by 2 [0; 5] points. A treatment response according to Biologic Asthma Response Score of 80.8% was demonstrated. There were no significant differences in treatment response between T2-high versus T2-low, early- versus adult-onset and eosinophilic versus non-eosinophilic asthma. Prior treatment with other biologics was associated with inferior treatment response.

Conclusions

In this real-life cohort, including a large proportion of patients with history of previous biologic use and encompassing various subgroups, the majority responded to tezepelumab. Our data further suggest a steroid-sparing effect of tezepelumab.

### Can early intervention in pediatric asthma improve long-term outcomes? A question that needs an answer [^ed4a4437]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

With better understanding of the mechanisms driving asthma, opportunities to integrate precision medicine into asthma management are numerous. Using a phenotype‐based approach to therapy, in which a specific patient's observable characteristics are considered in making treatment decisions, has the potential to improve outcomes for both children and adults with asthma by addressing their endotype, the mechanism of a patient's disease. 46 For example, biomarkers could be used to identify which pathway should be targeted in a specific patient (eg, anti‐IgE or anti‐interleukin [IL]‐5/anti‐eosinophil, IL‐4, or IL‐13). The INFANT trial conducted by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) AsthmaNet showed that biomarkers of type 2 inflammation, such as blood eosinophil counts, can be used to identify children who may benefit from daily ICS treatment. 47 Evaluation of a child's atopic status could also help to distinguish between patients at risk for persistent asthma, those who are likely to respond to daily ICS therapy, and those likely to develop severe, uncontrolled asthma. 48 Figure 3 illustrates how asthma treatment could be personalized based on phenotype observed for children with uncontrolled asthma. Precision treatment of asthma will be especially important in young children, as early identification and individualized therapy for asthma may prevent disease progression. 48 However, prospective studies with or without various interventions other than long‐term ICS have not been done to assess the specific relationship of uncontrolled asthma to long‐term fixed airway obstruction. This is another information gap that should be addressed in future studies.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^4e28d839]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Patient factors guiding biologic therapy in CRSwNP highlight that patients with related inflammatory conditions such as chronic idiopathic urticaria, severe asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis or atopic dermatitis may derive additional significant benefit from biological therapy due to its ability to obviate a number of other overlapping therapies; individuals who are unsuitable for surgical interventions due to prior complications or other comorbidities that place them at increased surgical risk may be considered for biologics earlier in their treatment course; personalized treatment decisions should consider these factors alongside the patient's overall disease burden and quality of life, and the clinician should educate their patients on how biologics can be of benefit after optimizing conventional therapies, ensuring that patients receive the most effective and cost-efficient care tailored to their specific clinical needs.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^817da220]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Severe asthma biologic treatments — current consensus advice is that, generally, for a patient with a good response, a trial of withdrawal of the biologic should not be considered until after at least 12 months of treatment, and only if asthma remains well controlled on medium-dose ICS-containing therapy, and (for allergic asthma) there is no further exposure to a previous well-documented allergic trigger. There are few studies of cessation of biologic therapy; in these studies, symptom control worsened and/or exacerbations recurred in many (but not all) patients after cessation of the biologic. In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, significantly more patients who stopped mepolizumab experienced a severe exacerbation within 12 months compared with those who continued treatment, with a small increase in ACQ-5 but no significant difference in symptom control between groups. In adults, long-term safety over 5 or more years of treatment has been reported for several biologics, with shorter follow-up to date for others.

### The clinical features of asthma exacerbations in early-onset and eosinophilic late-onset asthma may differ significantly [^63d5d573]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Over 20 years ago, the concept of asthma control was created and appropriate measurement tools were developed and validated. Loss of asthma control can lead to an exacerbation. Years ago, the term "clinically significant asthma exacerbation" was introduced to define when a loss of control is severe enough to declare it an asthma exacerbation. This term is also used by health insurances to determine when an exacerbation is eligible for reimbursement of biologics in clinical practice, however, it sometimes becomes apparent that a clear separation between loss of "asthma control" and an exacerbation is not always possible. In this review, we attempt to justify why exacerbations in early allergic asthma and adult eosinophilic asthma can differ significantly and why this is important in clinical practice as well as when dealing with health insurers.

### Biological therapies for eosinophilic asthma [^fea9d57c]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Severe uncontrolled asthma is by definition refractory to traditional therapies or can be controlled only with therapies that have intolerable side effects. Monoclonal antibodies that target interleukin (IL)-5/IL-5Rα, IgE, and IL-4Rα have shown favorable results in clinical trials, including reductions in asthma exacerbations and other important clinical outcomes. These biological agents offer treatment alternatives to patients with uncontrolled severe eosinophilic asthma.

Areas Covered

This article reviews how the shifting emphasis toward identifying distinct asthma phenotypes has led to the approval of biological therapies that preferentially benefit patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. The clinical trials that led to the approval of these biologic treatments are discussed in detail.

Expert Opinion

Biologic therapies targeting the IL-5, IgE, IL-4/IL-13 signaling pathways have been successful in clinical trials in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma. Some of these agents have also been successful regardless of peripheral blood eosinophil counts. These treatments have shown a relatively favorable safety profile in clinical trials, although long-term safety data for some of these agents are limited. Due to the high costs associated with these medications, they should be reserved for select patients where they yield a therapeutic and pharmacoeconomic advantage.

### Adverse events of anti-IL-5 drugs in patients with eosinophilic asthma: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and real-world evidence-based assessments [^97054297]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Eosinophilic asthma represents a prevalent, chronic respiratory condition characterized by airflow obstruction, bronchial inflammation, and heightened airway responsiveness. Its pathogenesis often involves airway inflammation, predominantly seen as eosinophilic infiltration, as evidenced by consistent blood eosinophils presence. Eosinophilic granular release-induced tissue damage drives inflammation progression and airway remodeling. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 estimated that approximately 262 million individuals worldwide suffer from eosinophilic asthma, leading to around 461,000 fatalities annually. Presently, the primary treatments include inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), oral corticosteroids (OCS), short-acting β₂ agonists, long-acting β₂ agonists (LABA) and long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA). While conventional treatments effectively manage asthma in many instances, they often exacerbate the overall disease burden due to potential adverse effects. In contrast, additional treatments such as antileukotrienes and cromones offer limited clinical benefits or are prohibitively expensive. To this end, the 2022 GINA guidelines endorse the usage of biologic therapies as adjunctive therapies for managing severe eosinophilic asthma effectively.

Biologic therapies, including anti-immunoglobulin E (anti-IgE) (omalizumab), anti-IL-4Rα (dupilumab), anti-thymic stomal lymphopoietin (anti-TSLP) (tezepelumab), play a pivotal role in the management of eosinophilic asthma. Studies on omalizumab indicated for asthma showed overall incidence of adverse events is similar to that of the placebo-controlled groups. The phase III clinical trial "Efficacy and Safety of Dupilumab in Glucocorticoid-Dependent Severe Asthma" reported similar adverse event rates in both the dupilumab (62%) and placebo (64%) groups. Additionally, in the phase IIa clinical study "Dupilumab in Persistent Asthma with Elevated Eosinophil Levels", adverse events were reported by comparable proportions of patients in both groups (77% in the placebo group versus 81% in the dupilumab group). The phase 2b Pathway study and phase 3 Navigator trial, evaluating tezepelumab for severe asthma treatment, also showed similar adverse event incidences between treatment groups, with 75% (n = 496 of 665) in the tezepelumab group and 77% (n = 512 of 669) in the placebo group. These findings underscore the clinical value of biologic drugs in managing eosinophilic asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^a3b555b7]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with ICS-formoterol — use with add-on biologic therapy and step-down considerations: If a patient treated with medium-dose MART requires addition of biologic therapy, it is not logical to switch from MART to conventional ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, as this may increase the risk of exacerbations, and there is little evidence about initiating MART in patients receiving add-on treatment such as LAMA or biologic therapy. In one study of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma on benralizumab and high-dose ICS-LABA, participants were randomized to budesonide-formoterol as high dose maintenance plus as-needed SABA or as medium-dose MART with subsequent 8-weekly options for down-titration, and asthma remained stable after the switch from high-dose ICS-formoterol to medium-dose MART. Most patients randomized to MART were able to further reduce their ICS-formoterol dose, but there was an increase in FeNO and decrease in FEV1 in those who stepped down to as-needed-only ICS-formoterol, suggesting that maintenance doses of ICS-formoterol should not be stopped.

Box 8–3 — assess and treat severe asthma phenotypes presents a Type 2 airway inflammation pathway in which Type 2 inflammation is indicated by blood eosinophils ≥ 150/μL and/or FeNO ≥ 20 ppb and/or sputum eosinophils ≥ 2%, and/or asthma is clinically allergen-driven, with a note to repeat blood eosinophils and FeNO up to 3x, at least 1–2 weeks after OCS or at lowest possible OCS dose. For patients with evidence of Type 2 airway inflammation, consider adherence tests, consider increasing the ICS dose for 3–6 months, and consider add-on non-biologic treatment for specific Type 2 clinical phenotypes. The algorithm asks, Is add-on Type 2 biologic therapy available/affordable?, and advises, Check local eligibility criteria for specific biologic therapies as these may vary from those listed. If add-on Type 2 targeted biologic therapy is NOT available/affordable, consider higher dose ICS, if not used, consider other add-on therapy (e.g. LAMA, LTRA, low dose azithromycin), as last resort, consider add-on low dose OCS, but implement strategies to minimize side-effects, and stop ineffective add-on therapies.

### Can we predict who will benefit most from biologics in severe asthma? A post-hoc analysis of two phase 3 trials [^775ccc2b]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Individualized prediction of treatment response may improve the value proposition of advanced treatment options in severe asthma. This study aimed to investigate the combined capacity of patient characteristics in predicting treatment response to mepolizumab in patients with severe asthma.

Methods

Patient-level data were pooled from two multinational phase 3 trials of mepolizumab in severe eosinophilic asthma. We fitted penalized regression models to quantify reductions in the rate of severe exacerbations and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ5) score. The capacity of 15 covariates towards predicting treatment response was quantified by the Gini index (measuring disparities in treatment benefit) as well as observed treatment benefit within the quintiles of predicted treatment benefit.

Results

There was marked variability in the ability of patient characteristics to predict treatment response; covariates explained greater heterogeneity in predicting treatment response to asthma control than to exacerbation frequency (Gini index 0.35 v. 0.24). Key predictors for treatment benefit for severe exacerbations included exacerbation history, blood eosinophil count, baseline ACQ5 score and age, and those for symptom control included blood eosinophil count and presence of nasal polyps. Overall, the average reduction in exacerbations was 0.90/year (95%CI, 0.87‒0.92) and average reduction in ACQ5 score was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.02‒0.35). Among the top 20% of patients for predicted treatment benefit, exacerbations were reduced by 2.23/year (95% CI, 2.03‒2.43) and ACQ5 score were reduced by 0.59 (95% CI, 0.19‒0.98). Among the bottom 20% of patients for predicted treatment benefit, exacerbations were reduced by 0.25/year (95% CI, 0.16‒0.34) and ACQ5 by -0.20 (95% CI, -0.51 to 0.11).

Conclusion

A precision medicine approach based on multiple patient characteristics can guide biologic therapy in severe asthma, especially in identifying patients who will not benefit as much from therapy. Patient characteristics had a greater capacity to predict treatment response to asthma control than to exacerbation.

### Change is in the air: key questions on the 'treatable traits' model for chronic airway diseases in primary care [^2b48d23d]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

By contrast, there is a growing volume of evidence that indicates blood eosinophils are a predictive biomarker for responsiveness to ICS in patients with asthma and COPD. Studies have demonstrated a continuous beneficial effect in reduction of exacerbation rate from ICS treatment in correlation with increasing blood eosinophil count in patients with COPD. This evidence has led to inclusion of eosinophil measurement in international guidelines as a clinical decision-making factor. The GOLD strategy report recommend using a blood eosinophil count of ≥ 300 cells/μL as an indication for escalation of treatment from a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) + long-acting β₂-agonist (LABA) combination to triple therapy treatment (ICS + LAMA + LABA). Similar utility of the biomarker is found in asthma; greater treatment benefits are observed in patients with eosinophilic asthma treated with ICS versus patients with lower blood eosinophil count, with regard to exacerbation rate, lung function and health-related quality of life. However, utilisation of blood eosinophil count as a predictive marker for targeting ICS use in patients with asthma is not yet recommended by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). In cases of severe asthma which remain uncontrolled despite optimised therapy, patients should be referred to a specialist for further investigation. Severe eosinophilic asthma can be effectively treated in the specialist domain with add-on T2-targeting biologic therapy, to which blood eosinophil count is a well-documented and reliable predictor of responsiveness. GINA recommendations advocate a blood eosinophil level threshold of ≥ 150 cells/μL for consideration of add-on T2-targeting biologic therapy in patients with exacerbations or poor symptoms control. In summary, eosinophilic inflammation is an important TT to address; its widespread measurement in primary care may inform rational treatment decisions and facilitate timely, appropriate referrals for specialist assessment.

### Treating severe asthma: targeting the IL-5 pathway [^136c7335]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

5 DISCUSSION

The introduction of new anti‐IL‐5/IL‐5R drugs in severe eosinophilic asthmatics requires possible factors that can be predictive of response to treatment. This manuscript focussed on studies addressed on the identification and the search of new variables that will provide clinicians more instruments to find the correct treatment target among different biologics nowadays available. A new theoretical model for the action of biologics shows that the target molecule is part of a causal network of different inflammatory and non‐inflammatory markers that influence reciprocally. Therefore, many factors may contribute to mAbs response or non‐response in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, but with the studies currently available, there are still pitfalls that need further investigations to find out whether patients will receive more or less benefits from the biological therapy.

5.1 Heterogeneous definition of response and non‐response

The evaluation of efficient treatment strategies is still a challenge and key points remain to be addressed, such as the heterogeneous definition of response and non‐response among studies and the underrepresentation of children and adolescents in clinical trials. A European experts consensus statementdefined "a traffic light system" as the process to assess response after 4 months of treatment with anti‐eosinophilic therapies and then after a year, with the purpose to guide clinicians' decisions to stop or continue treatments.

Clearly, a 4–6‐month period appears to be the current consensus for evaluating optimal or suboptimal response and consider the possibility of switching between biologicals. However, defining the main clinical characteristics of responders or partial/non‐responders is still considered an open challenge in the clinical field. In this regard, the National Institute for health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggested the interesting approach to target overall systemic steroid exposure. Recently, an "algorithm" which describes the current common sense, prioritizing patients' preferences in real‐life has been proposed according to previous findings, but real‐life studies and registries, in which well‐defined severe asthma patients are followed prospectively, are still needed better define new specific characteristics.

### Long-term multicenter comparison shows equivalent efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in severe asthma therapy [^c05f4e72]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Antibody therapy led to significant improvements across nearly all assessed parameters in all three treatment groups. All lung function parameters except for TLC improved significantly in all groups, indicating improved pulmonary performance. Notably, these improvements were comparable in all treatment groups, without significant differences. Furthermore, both asthma control as measured by ACT, annualized exacerbation rate and the need for and average dosage of OCS improved in all treatment groups, highlighting the tangible clinical benefits of biologic therapy in severe asthma patients. However, these reductions were statistically significantly more pronounced among patients receiving either mepolizumab or benralizumab, compared to patients receiving dupilumab. However, this is unlikely to represent a clinically significant difference, as both the annualized exacerbation rate and mean OCS dose were lower in the dupilumab cohort at baseline, thus allowing for less overall reduction upon therapy initiation. Likewise, patients receiving dupilumab had a slightly higher average ACT score at baseline. While all patients in our cohort suffered from severe asthma insufficiently controlled by conventional therapy, a prerequisite to biologic therapy initiation according to German guidelines (Supplementary Table 1), the less severe baseline impairments indicate that patients in the dupilumab group had better asthma control at baseline, and thus perhaps less room for improvement. Notably, prescription guidelines for biologics in severe asthma are heterogenous among European countries. In the future, unified international prescription criteria would be desirable to facilitate international comparisons.

In terms of laboratory parameters, we observed some divergence: while the dupilumab cohort showed a less pronounced decrease in peripheral blood eosinophils at T1 compared to the other treatment groups, this distinction was lost by T2. This confirms the well-described observation that dupilumab may induce a transient increase in eosinophils prior to a reduction to baseline or below, but without affecting clinical efficacy of the drug. Additionally, we observed statistically significant reductions in FeNo, an important marker for airway inflammation in patients receiving either mepolizumab or dupilumab, but not in those receiving benralizumab. While FeNo has been described as a sensitive and cost-effective biomarker with the potential ability to predict exacerbations, its predictive value in the setting of patients already receiving maximized asthma therapy is less clear. Given the equally strong effects of benralizumab on all other clinical parameters in our study, a clinically relevant effect of this less pronounced reduction in our setting is unlikely. Additionally, while FeNo levels decreased statistically significantly among mepolizumab recipients, the biological relevance of this finding is unclear given the minimal absolute FeNo decreases in this group.

### Choosing the right biologic for the right patient with severe asthma [^00cd3a36]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Until the early 2010s, the asthmatologist's role in the severe asthma clinic was largely that of a "corticosteroid-ologist". In this capacity, we studied the inevitable airway and people remodelling in chronically debilitated patients with asthma, with the uncomfortable suspicion that a portion of the morbidity was the result of corticosteroids — substances known for both their efficacy and toxicity. Thankfully, the advent of multiple different monoclonal antibodies to treat people with asthma has translated to extraordinary benefits for patients, and a less uncomfortable workday for the asthmatologist. An important aspect of today's job involves phenotyping patients clinically (by looking for patient characteristics and comorbidities) and endotyping objectively (by measuring type 2 inflammatory biomarkers) to decipher the underlying mechanisms of their airway disease, estimating the risk of asthma attacks and lung function decline, and most importantly, offering a precision-based approach by choosing the right treatment for the right patient. As the variety of biologic therapies increases and now includes six biologics spanning four different mechanisms of action, the latter task is increasingly complicated.

In a previous instalment of the severe asthma How I Do It series about the workup of severe asthma, we proposed a "two-hit model" by which blood eosinophils and exhaled nitric oxide (F) identify different components and compartments of the inflammatory response. We elaborated on the increasing volume of evidence that allergy testing and serum IgE have poor prognostic and theragnostic value in asthma; we reviewed the complementary value of type-2 inflammatory biomarkers (blood eosinophils and F), spirometry, and adherence checking, and we emphasized the importance of evaluating and managing treatable type 2 comorbidities.

In this installment, we tackle how different phenotypic characteristics can help us to find the right biologic for the right patient. In complement to recent comprehensiveand usefulreviews on the currently authorized biologics that we list in Table 1, we use case studies highlighting four different sets of clinical scenarios and biomarker values to discuss features influencing our choice of targeted therapy.

### Real-world study in severe eosinophilic asthma patients refractory to anti-IL5 biological agents treated with benralizumab in Spain (ORBE study) [^fd700f0c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients mainly unresponsive to previous anti-IL-5 treatment and requiring stable treatment with high-dose ICS and at least one LABA were enrolled in the ORBE study. Study results suggest that benralizumab treatment could improve asthma control in patients who have previously failed to respond or discontinued treatment with mepolizumab or reslizumab. Even with its limitations, the information in this study is pertinent as it suggests that difficult to treat patients who have received, anti-IgE or anti-IL5 biologic treatment may derive benefit from being switched to bernalizumab. Recent studies and post-hoc analyses have shown that patients whose asthma did not respond to omalizumab can improve with a biologic treatment targeting the IL-5 pathway in terms of asthma control, exacerbations, and OCS reduction. Thus, benralizumab could be an effective option in severe eosinophilic asthma and could be considered as a first option before starting another biologic treatment targeting the IL-5 pathway.

The study has several limitations. It is a relatively small sample size with a short follow up period as the number of enrolled patients and length of follow-up were dictated by EAP limitations. Some additional limitations are inherent to the retrospective design such as proclivity to recall bias or misclassification bias, presence of confounding factors (other risk factors may be present that were not measured), and the inability to fully determine causation, association and temporal relationships. The absence of an active comparator arm or placebo arm makes drawing formal conclusions difficult. Due to the nature of this retrospective analysis, there is no available data of clinical information of the baseline data before initiation of any biologic treatment.

On the other hand, one of the main strengths of the ORBE study is that this is a real-life setting study describing the very first usual clinical practice with benralizumab. Besides, patients included in the study comprised a broader and more heterogeneous population than the population included in the pivotal studies. Additionally, all patients had been previously treated with other biologics. The ORBE study highlights the importance of expanded-access programmes, which allow patients with unmet clinical needs to benefit from treatment based on available evidence before health authority approval and commercial distribution.

### Biologics and airway remodeling in asthma: early, late, and potential preventive effects [^84730caf]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

The addition of the IL‐4Rα blocker dupilumab to maintenance OCS led to a sustained FEV 1 improvement despite an average 70% reduction in the maintenance dose of OCS. These findings suggest that this biologic is superior to conventional asthma treatment, including OCS, to maintain airway patency. Rapid lung function improvement has also been described in patients with uncontrolled, moderate‐to‐severe asthma treated with dupilumab.

Tezepelumab, which blocks the activity of TSLP, rapidly improved lung function, reduced airway submucosal eosinophils, and biomarkers of AiRem (i.e. matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‐10 and MMP‐3) in a broad population of patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma. Lung function parameters improved at week two and were sustained over 52 weeks.

Mucus plugging which has been described as localized and persistentsignificantly contributes to symptom severity and exacerbations in asthma, correlating with airway obstruction and T2 inflammation. Biologics have shown effectiveness in reducing mucus plugs and improving airway obstruction in severe asthma. In particular, benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab, and most recently tezepelumab have been associated with a reduction in mucus plugs in the airways of patients with severe asthma. Benralizumab significantly reduced the number of mucus plugs, which were associated with sputum eosinophils. Dupilumab reversed airway mucus hypersecretion, as evidenced by reduced mucus score, and imaging aspects of AiRem (e.g. airway wall area) in patients with moderate‐to‐severe asthma. Tezepelumab has been shown to reduce mucus plug scores and improve lung function in adults with moderate‐to‐severe asthma.

### Real-world effectiveness of IL-5 / 5Ra targeted biologics in severe eosinophilic asthma with comorbid bronchiectasis [^50d49ebd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a common comorbidity in patients with asthma and is associated with increased disease severity. In patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, biologics targeting IL-5/5Ra have beneficial effects on oral corticosteroid (OCS) use and exacerbation frequency. However, how coexisting bronchiectasis affects the response to such treatments is unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the real-world effectiveness of anti-IL-5/5Ra therapy in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma and comorbid bronchiectasis on exacerbation frequency and daily maintenance and cumulative OCS dose.

Methods

This real-world study evaluated data from 97 adults with severe eosinophilic asthma and computed tomography-confirmed bronchiectasis from the Dutch Severe Asthma Registry, who initiated anti-IL5/5Ra biologics (mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab) and had follow-up data for 12 months or greater. The analysis was performed for the total population and subgroups with or without maintenance OCS use.

Results

Anti-IL-5/5Ra therapy significantly reduced exacerbation frequency in patients with maintenance OCS use as well as in those without it. In the year before biologic initiation, 74.5% of all patients had two or more exacerbations, which decreased to 22.1% in the follow-up year (P < .001). The proportion of patients on maintenance OCS decreased from 47% to 30% (P < .001), and in the OCS-dependent patients (n = 45) maintenance OCS dose decreased from median (interquartile range) of 10.0 mg/d (5–15 mg/d) to 2.5 mg/d (0–5 mg/d) after 1 year (P < .001).

Conclusions

This real-world study shows that anti-IL-5/5Ra therapy reduces exacerbation frequency and daily maintenance as well as the cumulative OCS dose in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma and comorbid bronchiectasis. Although it is an exclusion criterion in phase 3 trials, comorbid bronchiectasis should not preclude anti-IL-5/5Ra therapy in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.

### Biologics and airway remodeling in asthma: early, late, and potential preventive effects [^e2d5b023]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Although airway remodeling in severe and/or fatal asthma is still considered irreversible, its individual components as a cause of clinical symptoms and/or lung function changes remain largely unknown. While inhaled glucocorticoids have not consistently been shown to affect airway remodeling, biologics targeting specific pathways of airway inflammation have been shown to improve lung function, mucus plugging, and airway structural changes that can exceed those seen with glucocorticoids. This superiority of biologic treatment, which cannot be solely explained by insufficient doses or limited durations of glucocorticoid therapies, needs to be further explored. For this field of research, we propose a novel classification of the potential effects of biologics on airway remodeling into three temporal effects: early effects (days to weeks, primarily modulating inflammatory processes), late effects (months to years, predominantly affecting structural changes), and potential preventive effects (outcomes of early treatment with biologics). For the identification of potential preventive effects of biologics, we call for studies exploring the impact of early biological treatment on airway remodeling in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma, which should be accompanied by a long-term evaluation of clinical parameters, biomarkers, treatment burden, and socioeconomic implications.

### Asthma biologics: real-world effectiveness, impact of switching biologics, and predictors of response [^2409f593]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Confirmation of effectiveness of asthma biologics in the real world is desirable because patient characteristics and experiences may differ from those included in randomized controlled trials.

Objective

To evaluate real-world effectiveness of asthma biologics and identify predictors of response.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study in patients with severe asthma receiving biologics. The primary outcome was change in clinically significant exacerbations at 12 months after starting biologic therapy, compared with 12 months before. Secondary outcomes were change in severe exacerbations, maintenance oral corticosteroid (OCS) dose, prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and asthma control test scores. Subgroup analyses were performed for subjects who were biologic naive or not. A stepwise logistic regression model was performed to compare responders to nonresponders.

Results

A total of 112 patients were included. Biologic therapy was associated with a 59% reduction in clinically significant exacerbations (P < .001), 65% reduction in severe exacerbations (P < .001), and 54% reduction in maintenance OCS dose (P = 0.001) in the 12 months after starting therapy. Biologics also resulted in improvement in prebronchodilator FEV1 (P = 0.002) and Asthma Control Test score (P < .001). Subjects who were previously on another biologic also experienced significant improvements in exacerbation frequency, maintenance OCS dose, and asthma control. Responders were more likely to be nonsmokers and have higher baseline FEV1, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and eosinophil counts greater than 500 cells/μL.

Conclusion

In a real-world setting, biologic therapy in asthma is effective in improving exacerbations, asthma control, and lung function. Patients who have a suboptimal response to 1 biologic can still benefit from treatment with a different biologic.

Inclusion criteria and treatment

All included patients had been diagnosed with severe asthma with inadequate asthma control despite a combination of medium to high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids and long-acting β₂-agonist plus an optional second or third controller and / or additional oral corticosteroids (OCS). Additionally, prescription criteria for biologics in Germany require a blood eosinophil count of ≥ 150 per µl at initiation or ≥ 300 per µl within 12 months prior for mepolizumab and benralizumab or either a blood eosinophil count ≥ 150 eosinophils/µl, an Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) of > 25 parts per billion or a need for permanent OCS for dupilumab (Supplementary Table 1). Consequently, a subcutaneous add-on therapy was initiated using either mepolizumab 100 mg once every 4 weeks, benralizumab 30 mg once every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses and once every 8 weeks for subsequent doses or dupilumab 600 mg for the initial dose followed by 200 mg or 300 mg every 2 weeks as indicated for subsequent doses. The decision to start a biologic and the choice of biologic was made by the treating physician solely on clinical grounds. Patients were included in the present analysis if they had received biologic therapy for 12 months without interruption at one of the study sites. Patients who had previously received another biologic therapy were ineligible for study inclusion unless there was a wash-out phase of 6 months or longer between therapies. Non-antibody asthma medication and OCS therapy were adjusted over the course of biologic therapy by the treating physicians depending on the individual patients' clinical situation.

### Advancements in biologic therapy in eosinophilic asthma [^896c0858]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma encompasses a spectrum of phenotypes often categorized into two groups- type 2 high (T2 high) and type 2 low (T2 low). T2 high includes atopic and eosinophilic presentations whereas T2 low is non-atopic, non-eosinophilic, and oft associated with neutrophilic inflammation. Eosinophilic asthma is often driven by IgE, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and TSLP. This can lead to eosinophilic inflammatory response in the airways which in turn can be used as target for treatment.

Areas Covered

The article will focus on biologic therapy that is currently being used in eosinophilic asthma management in mainly the adult population including clinical trials and co-morbidities that can be treated using the same biologics. A review on asthma biologics for pediatric population has been reviewed elsewhere.

Expert Opinion

Biological therapy for asthma targeting the IgE, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TSLP pathways are shown to have benefit for the treatment of eosinophilic asthma, as exemplified in real-world studies. When choosing the right biological agent factors such as phenotype, comorbidities, and cost-effectiveness of the biologic agent must be taken into consideration.

### The clinical benefit of mepolizumab replacing omalizumab in uncontrolled severe eosinophilic asthma [^5495fe37]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

3.3 Secondary endpoints

The LS mean (SE) SGRQ total score improved from 56.7 (1.36) at baseline to 37.8 (1.78) at Week 32, giving an LS mean change (SE) of −19.0 (1.64) (Figure 2 C). The SGRQ domain with largest observed improvement was the SGRQ symptom domain score with an LS mean change (SE) of −26.2 (1.95) at Week 32. With regard to the percentage of SGRQ responders, 100 patients (69%) achieved an improvement (reduction) in SGRQ total score of ≥ 4 points by Week 12; this increased to 114 patients (79%) by Week 32 (Figure 2 D).

Sixty patients (41%) experienced a total of 104 clinically significant exacerbations during the 32‐week study period, of whom 15 patients required an ER visit/hospitalization and 9 patients required hospitalization. During the study period, the annualized rates of clinically significant exacerbations and exacerbations requiring an ER visit/hospitalization were reduced by 64% and 69%, respectively, compared with the year prior to study enrollment (Table 2). The cumulative incidence for time to first clinically significant exacerbation is shown in Figure S1.

### Adverse events of anti-IL-5 drugs in patients with eosinophilic asthma: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and real-world evidence-based assessments [^cfc88879]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In clinical trials, the relative risk of hypersensitivity events was marginally increased within anti-IL-5 treatment groups, but no significant disparity was observed when compared to placebo groups. Despite the lack of statistical significance within the clinical data, post-marketing surveillance detected hypersensitivity signals across all anti-IL-5 drugs, which were subsequently confirmed within each product labeling. Furthermore, the composition of these drugs could potentially elicit hypersensitivity reactions.

Although the efficacy of treating asthmatic patients with anti-IL-5 drugs was proved in considerable clinical studies, some suggested that less clinical benefit was obtained with anti-IL-5 treatments. In the present study, the clinical data did not suggest a lack of efficacy. On the contrary, the clinical analysis indicated that asthma development, including its exacerbation, was less likely in the anti-IL-5 treatment group compared to the placebo group. However, the post-marketing analysis inferred potential AEs related to disease progression, including symptomology, laboratory test results, diminished quality of life, daily activity impairment, etc. further highlighting a potential signal of incomplete therapeutic effect observed across all anti-IL-5 drugs, especially a strong signal noticed from mepolizumab reports. We speculated that mepolizumab might be less effective than reslizumab and benralizumab due to deficient eosinophil suppression. Product inserts for mepolizumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab cautioned potential occurrence of asthma-related adverse symptoms, exacerbations, or uncontrollable conditions post-treatment initiation. It was hereby presumed that this discrepancy could result from effective treatment management during clinical trials, while real-world clinical assessments and medication applications might present increased complexity. The post-marketing analysis raises queries about the adequacy of asthma treatment in real-world clinical practice. In light of numerous post-marketing reports, the potential signal of an incomplete therapeutic effect warrants further evaluation.

### A randomized trial of the efficacy and safety of quilizumab in adults with inadequately controlled allergic asthma [^d5e4a85d]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

The allergen-challenge model used in our previous studies where quilizumab was shown to be effective may not represent the asthma processes occurring in the patient population in this study, especially given that alternate sources of IgE appear to play a more dominant role. However, the model was key in first demonstrating the effectiveness of omalizumab in patients with mild asthma, where omalizumab significantly reduced both the early and late asthmatic responses following allergen challenge and reduced serum IgE almost completely. Although less effective than omalizumab in a similar population, quilizumab showed reductions of 26 and 36% in the early and late asthmatic responses, respectively, and a 25% reduction in serum IgE. Allergen-challenge studies are generally exploratory and are designed to follow biomarkers that trend with early and late asthmatic responses. They are usually conducted in patients with mild asthma, which is not the typical target population for new biologic therapies. At least one therapy, mepolizumab (anti-IL-5), is effective for reducing asthma exacerbations in patients with eosinophilic asthma, yet does not appear to affect early/late asthmatic responses during allergen challenge. It is therefore crucial that appropriate patient populations and outcome measures are selected for future trials.

Whether quilizumab could have a clinically meaningful effect in another subgroup of allergic asthma patients or whether a treatment period beyond 36 weeks would show efficacy, are questions we are unable to address with the current study. The type 2 biomarkers, serum periostin, blood eosinophils, and FeNO, which identified patients with increased clinical benefit from lebrikizumab and omalizumab, did not consistently enrich for increased benefit from quilizumab in this study. Similarly, patients with elevated serum IgE levels at baseline did not respond better to quilizumab nor was there a correlation between serum IgE reduction and exacerbation reduction or FEV 1 improvement (data not shown).

Box 8–4 decision tree — add-on biologic Type 2-targeted treatments outlines class-specific options and criteria for severe asthma, including Anti-IgE (omalizumab), Anti-IL5/Anti-IL5R (benralizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab), Anti-IL4Rα (dupilumab), and Anti-TSLP (tezepelumab). For anti-IgE, predictors of good asthma response include blood eosinophils ≥ 260/μL and FeNO ≥ 20 ppb. For anti-IL5/anti-IL5R, eligibility includes blood eosinophils, e.g. ≥ 150/μL or ≥ 300/μL. For anti-IL4Rα, eligibility includes blood eosinophils ≥ 150 and ≤ 1500/μL, or FeNO ≥ 25 ppb, or taking maintenance OCS. If a patient is eligible, the algorithm states: "Choose one if eligible*: trial for at least 4 months and assess response"; if response is unclear, "Extend trial to 6–12 months"; if inadequate, "STOP add-on" and "Consider switching to a different Type 2-targeted therapy, if eligible". A footnote advises: "Check local eligibility criteria for specific biologic therapies as these may vary from those listed".

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^fe009ab0]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma Type 2 inflammation — refractory or underlying indicators during high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or daily oral corticosteroids (OCS) should be considered as follows: The possibility of refractory Type 2 inflammation should be considered if any of the following are found while the patient is taking high-dose ICS or daily OCS: blood eosinophils ≥ 150/μL, and/or FeNO (fractional exhaled nitric oxide) ≥ 20 ppb, and/or sputum eosinophils ≥ 2%, and/or asthma is clinically allergen-driven. The above are suggested for initial assessment; those for blood eosinophils and FeNO are based on the lowest levels associated with response to some biologics, and they are not the criteria for eligibility for Type 2-targeted biologic therapy, which may differ.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^d85da68e]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Type 2-targeted biologic therapies — add-on treatment selection and administration in severe asthma — If available and affordable, consider an add-on Type 2 targeted biologic for patients with exacerbations and/or poor symptom control despite taking at least high-dose ICS-LABA, and who have allergic or eosinophilic biomarkers or need maintenance OCS; where relevant, test for parasitic infection and treat if present before commencing treatment. Consider whether to start first with anti-IgE, anti-IL5/5Rα, anti-IL4Rα or anti-TSLP, and when choosing between available therapies consider local payer eligibility criteria, Type 2 comorbidities such as atopic dermatitis and nasal polyps, predictors of asthma response, cost, dosing frequency, delivery route (IV or SC; potential for self-administration), and patient preference. Always check local payer eligibility criteria for biologic therapy, as they may vary substantially; however, GINA recommends the use of biologic therapy only for patients with severe asthma, and only after treatment has been optimized, and for any biologic therapy, ensure that the manufacturer's and/or regulator's instructions for storage, administration and the duration of monitoring post-administration are followed. Provide the patient with advice about what to do if they experience any adverse effects, including hypersensitivity reactions, noting that omalizumab injections contain polysorbate which may induce allergic reactions in some patients; GINA suggests that the first dose of asthma biologic therapy should not be given on the same day as a vaccine such as for COVID-19 so that adverse effects of either can be more easily distinguished, and provide practical advice such as allowing the refrigerated syringe or pen to come to room temperature before injecting to reduce pain. There is an urgent need for head-to-head comparisons of different biologics in patients eligible for more than one biologic.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^ac67696c]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

6. Expanded indications for starting regular controller (preventer) treatment

The GINA report now includes a new table with evidence-based recommendations for initiating controller treatment. The most important change is a recommendation for earlier initiation of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids; for example, in patients with symptoms twice or more a month and/or risk factors for exacerbations, such as a need for oral corticosteroids in the last year. The aim is to reduce asthma risk, even if day-to-day symptoms are not frequent enough to be burdensome.

7. Tailoring asthma treatment for individual patients

The GINA report now describes a framework for personalised asthma management. While national guidelines provide recommendations about the treatment that may be most cost-effective across the whole population, patient-level decisions should also take into account any characteristics or phenotypes that predict the patient's risk or likely treatment response (e.g. smoking status, blood eosinophilia, admission to hospital for asthma in the previous year) together with patient goals and concerns and practical issues such as inhaler technique, adherence and cost to the patient.

8. Patients with features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

A new feature in GINA relates to the asthma–COPD overlap syndrome. Past guidelines for asthma and COPD have been separate, and most regulatory studies have excluded patients with both conditions. However, many patients have features of both asthma and COPD, including symptomatic smokers with a history of childhood asthma, and patients with asthma and fixed airflow limitation. In collaboration with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, GINA 2014 included a new chapter outlining a syndromic approach to diagnosis in primary care, with pragmatic advice about safety considerations in choice of initial treatment (avoidance of long-acting β 2 -agonist alone if the features suggest asthma, and avoiding inhaled corticosteroid-only treatment if the features suggest COPD). Therefore, it is important that asthma (or asthma–COPD overlap syndrome) should remain in the patient's list of diagnoses, even if they develop fixed airflow limitation.

### Anti-IL-5 therapies for asthma [^27d14bd4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the second update of previously published reviews in the Cochrane Library (2015, first update 2017). Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is the main cytokine involved in the proliferation, maturation, activation and survival of eosinophils, which cause airway inflammation and are a classic feature of asthma. Studies of monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-5 or its receptor (IL-5R) suggest they reduce asthma exacerbations, improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and lung function in appropriately selected patients, justifying their inclusion in the latest guidelines.

Objectives

To compare the effects of therapies targeting IL-5 signalling (anti-IL-5 or anti-IL-5Rα) with placebo on exacerbations, health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) measures and lung function in adults and children with chronic asthma, and specifically in those with eosinophilic asthma refractory to existing treatments.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers, manufacturers' websites, and reference lists of included studies. The most recent search was 7 February 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing mepolizumab, reslizumab and benralizumab versus placebo in adults and children with asthma.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and analysed outcomes using a random-effects model. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Seventeen studies on about 7600 participants met the inclusion criteria. Six used mepolizumab, five used reslizumab, and six used benralizumab. One study using benralizumab was terminated early due to sponsor decision and contributed no data. The studies were predominantly on people with severe eosinophilic asthma, which was similarly but variably defined. One was in children aged 6 to 17 years; nine others included children over 12 years but did not report results by age group separately. We deemed the overall risk of bias to be low, with all studies contributing data of robust methodology. We considered the certainty of the evidence for all comparisons to be high overall using the GRADE scheme, except for intravenous (IV) mepolizumab and subcutaneous (SC) reslizumab because these are not currently licensed delivery routes. The anti-IL-5 treatments assessed reduced rates of 'clinically significant' asthma exacerbation (defined by treatment with systemic corticosteroids for three days or more) by approximately half in participants with severe eosinophilic asthma on standard care (at least medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)) with poorly controlled disease (either two or more exacerbations in the preceding year or Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score of 1.5 or more), except for reslizumab SC. The rate ratios for these effects were 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 0.55; high-certainty evidence) for mepolizumab SC, 0.53 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.64; moderate-certainty evidence) for mepolizumab IV, 0.43 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.55; high-certainty evidence) for reslizumab IV, and 0.59 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.66; high-certainty evidence) for benralizumab SC. Non-eosinophilic participants treated with benralizumab also showed a significant reduction in exacerbation rates, an effect not seen with reslizumab IV, albeit in only one study. No data were available for non-eosinophilic participants treated with mepolizumab. There were improvements in validated HRQoL scores with all anti-IL-5 agents in severe eosinophilic asthma. This met the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for the broader St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ; 4-point change) for benralizumab only, but the improvement in the ACQ and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), which focus on asthma symptoms, fell short of the MCID (0.5 point change for both ACQ and AQLQ) for all of the interventions. The evidence for an improvement in HRQoL scores in non-eosinophilic participants treated with benralizumab and reslizumab was weak, but the tests for subgroup difference were negative. All anti-IL-5 treatments produced small improvements in mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory flow in one second (FEV 1) of between 0.08 L and 0.15 L in eosinophilic participants, which may not be sufficient to be detected by patients. There were no excess serious adverse events with any anti-IL-5 treatment; in fact, there was a reduction in such events with benralizumab, likely arising from fewer asthma-related hospital admissions. There was no difference compared to placebo in adverse events leading to discontinuation with mepolizumab or reslizumab, but significantly more discontinued benralizumab than placebo, although the absolute numbers were small (42/2026 (2.1%) benralizumab versus 11/1227 (0.9%) placebo). The implications for efficacy or adverse events are unclear.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall this analysis supports the use of anti-IL-5 treatments as an adjunct to standard care in people with severe eosinophilic asthma and poor symptom control. These treatments roughly halve the rate of asthma exacerbations in this population. There is limited evidence for improved HRQoL scores and lung function, which may not meet clinically detectable levels. The studies did not report safety concerns for mepolizumab or reslizumab, or any excess serious adverse events with benralizumab, although there remains a question over adverse events significant enough to prompt discontinuation. Further research is needed on biomarkers for assessing treatment response, optimal duration and long-term effects of treatment, risk of relapse on withdrawal, non-eosinophilic patients, children (particularly under 12 years), comparing anti-IL-5 treatments to each other and, in patients meeting relevant eligibility criteria, to other biological (monoclonal antibody) therapies. For benralizumab, future studies should closely monitor rates of adverse events prompting discontinuation.

### Long-term outcomes of combination biologic therapy in uncontrolled severe asthma: a case study [^de354e50]. The Journal of Asthma (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Treatment with biologics has significantly reduced the social and economic burden of severe asthma. However, some patients may still feature a suboptimal control of their symptoms while on therapy. In this subset of asthmatic patients, a benefit from a dual biologic therapy has sporadically been reported in literature. Our aim is to add our experience to the limited body of evidence supporting combination biologic therapies.

Case Study

Here we present the case of a 68-year-old nonsmoker female, with an allergic and eosinophilic corticosteroid-dependent severe asthma. She displayed well controlled comorbidities and good adherence to the inhaled therapy. Omalizumab was started in 2008 with an initial remarkable clinical improvement. After nine years of biologic therapy, she reported a gradual worsening of her symptoms and exacerbations. Mepolizumab was then added in 2019.

Results

The addition of Mepolizumab resulted in a meaningful amelioration of her quality of life, asthma control, number of exacerbations and 6-minute-walking-distance at 3-year follow-up. The average Prednisone dosage was tapered from 25mg to 20mg daily. No adverse events were observed since the introduction of the second biologic.

Conclusion

Our experience indicates that Mepolizumab may be beneficial and safe as an add-on biologic in a patient whose allergic and eosinophilic asthma remains uncontrolled despite treatment with an anti-IgE strategy. Further studies on a larger number of patients are required to demonstrate whether the positive outcomes published so far are replicable on a larger scale.

### Combination of allergen-specific immunotherapy with biologics in severe asthma: counterintuitive or rational? [^8a806c00]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Although numbers vary, most patients with severe asthma have eosinophilic asthma. Many of them have the allergic asthma endotype, particularly those with concomitant allergic rhinitis (AR). Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only disease-modifying therapy offering long-term effectiveness for allergic respiratory disorders, including asthma, but it is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled disease. Patients with severe asthma often have frequent exacerbations, making them poor candidates for AIT. However, after approximately 6 to 12 months on biologic therapy, many patients become exacerbation-free and obtain good symptom control and even improved lung function. Thus, in these patients, add-on AIT, subcutaneous or sublingual, is possible. Importantly, AIT could contribute to achieving clinical remission in severe asthma with biologic therapy, that even may be sustained after cessation of treatment. In a few landmark trials of AIT added to biologics (omalizumab, dupilumab, or tezepelumab), mechanisms were also studied, unveiling the additional benefit of these combinations in enhancing not only safety and tolerability, but possibly also efficacy. We present a summary of clinical trials combining immunotherapy with aeroallergens with biologic therapy in patients with respiratory allergy and discuss the cons and pros of AIT in patients with severe allergic asthma who received biological therapy, concluding that this combination could benefit many of these patients.

### Early interventions with inhaled corticosteroids in asthma: benefits and risks [^fdbb2a95]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

the present review examines the effects of early intervention with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) on clinical efficacy and natural history of asthma based on two recent clinical trials: the Inhaled Steroid Treatment as Regular Therapy in Early Asthma (START) and Prevention of Early Asthma in Kids (PEAK) trials, and a comparison of the effect of regular vs. intermittent therapy based on the Improving Asthma Control Trial (IMPACT).

Recent Findings

in most patients, both adults and children, who have a new diagnosis of asthma and whose symptoms are mild but persistent, treatment with ICS should be recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. This is a cost-effective and well tolerated treatment. However, symptoms may recur and lung function may decline again if treatment is discontinued.

Summary

ICS is the most cost-effective initial treatment for both adults and children with a new diagnosis of asthma. If patients are reluctant to use ICS daily for long periods, it would be reasonable to delay the onset of treatment with ICS. Initial therapy with leukotriene receptor antagonist is not likely to be as effective as initial therapy with ICS. Biomarkers of airway inflammation such as sputum cell counts and exhaled nitric oxide are probably not necessary to treat patients with mild intermittent asthma.

4.3 The Combination ofand Biological Therapies in Allergic Asthma

As such, AIT is contraindicated in patients with severe, uncontrolled or even partially or poorly controlled asthma, due to the associated increased risk of systemic allergic reactions. Nonetheless, AIT remains the only causative treatment of allergic asthma. Its combination with a biological therapy appears to be a highly relevant approach for bringing its benefits to patients who are a priori not eligible for it. As mentioned above, the biologics available for the treatment of asthma were mainly designed to address the type 2 form of the disease, their mechanisms of action being highly complementary to those of AIT (compare Figures 1 and 2). Since available biologics have been shown to reduce the severity and/or improve the control of allergic asthma (section 3 above), they are expected to enable patients suffering from a serious form of the condition to benefit from the unique effects of AIT. Incidentally, combining AIT with biologics may also benefit subjects with less severe allergic asthma.

The combination of a biologics with AIT has already been evaluated as a treatment of various allergic conditions other than allergic asthma (see Data S1 for details). As regards the treatment of allergic asthma, many studies of different types have investigated the combination of AIT with a biologics, mainly omalizumab. Of the 13 studies we identified, 7 reported on just one or a few cases, while the other 6 involved from about 30 patients to almost 250 patients (Table 6). In most cases, treatment with biologics was given before initiating SCIT or SLIT with perennial (especially HDM) and/or seasonal (grass and tree pollens) allergen sources in children, adolescents and/or adults. According to several reported studies, pretreatment with biologics has been successful in initiating and continuing AIT in patients with uncontrolled moderate‐to‐severe allergic asthma, including patients who did not tolerate AIT prior to treatment with biologics, but also a young boy with poorly controlled asthma suffering from ICS‐induced growth deceleration and adrenal suppression. In a patient with severe allergic asthma plus eosinophilia and high total and specific IgE, omalizumab pretreatment did not allow to initiate AIT, but mepolizumab did, highlighting the need to personalise the combined treatment of AIT and biologics (Table 6).

What Is the Role of Asthma Biologics for Severe Asthma?

The Expert Panel acknowledges that there has been remarkable progress in our understanding of the different endotypes of severe asthma and the work that has helped to establish the therapeutic use of various monoclonal antibodies ("biologics"; e.g. anti-IL5, anti-IL5 receptor-α, and anti-IL4 receptor-α) for such patients. The absence of recommendations for the use of asthma biologics in the NAEPP 2020 guideline update is a major gap, especially given the rapid pace of discoveries after the priority topics for the update were established. Interested readers are encouraged to review recommendations regarding the use of asthma biologics by other groups, including GINA and the European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society.

Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement — future research opportunities in asthma include clarifying its role in the diagnostic process, including which individuals with asthma aged 5 years and older should be tested; using FeNO testing to monitor adherence of children and adults to inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and other anti-inflammatory treatments; evaluating FeNO in children aged 0 to 5 years with wheezing or asthma-like symptoms to predict subsequent asthma diagnoses; assessing point-of-care FeNO to identify children who do not require oral corticosteroid therapy; FeNO-based asthma management in people with moderate to severe persistent asthma; potential uses for asthma management in primary care; impact of health disparities due to lack of health care coverage and cost-effectiveness in diverse populations and clinical settings; the role of FeNO testing in uncontrolled asthma to predict benefit of adding T2-directed biologic therapies; refinement and validation of FeNO cutoff levels for diagnostic purposes across determinants and groups; identification of algorithms combining objective measures (including FeNO levels, blood eosinophil levels, spirometry test results, short-acting beta2-agonist [SABA] use, and symptom scores) for choosing, monitoring, or adjusting anti-inflammatory therapy; and identifying populations most likely to benefit from FeNO-guided treatment and the optimal frequency of FeNO monitoring.

Add-on anti-IL5 or anti-IL5Rα for severe eosinophilic asthma — approvals, eligibility, and outcomes: Regulatory approvals may include for ages ≥ 12 years mepolizumab (anti-IL5), 100 mg by subcutaneous (SC) injection every 4 weeks, or benralizumab (anti-IL5 receptor α), 30 mg by SC injection every 4 weeks for 3 doses then every 8 weeks; for ages ≥ 18 years reslizumab (anti-IL5), 3 mg/kg by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks; and for ages 6–11 years mepolizumab (anti-IL5), 40 mg by SC injection every 4 weeks. Mechanistically, mepolizumab and reslizumab bind circulating IL-5, while benralizumab binds to the IL-5 receptor alpha subunit leading to apoptosis of eosinophils. Eligibility usually includes more than a specified number of severe exacerbations in the last year and blood eosinophils above locally specified levels (e.g., ≥ 150 or ≥ 300/μL). Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found anti-IL5 and anti-IL5Rα led to 47–54% reduction in severe exacerbations, and among patients taking oral corticosteroids, median OCS dose was able to be reduced by approximately 50% with mepolizumab or benralizumab compared with placebo. In urban children aged 6 years and older with eosinophilic exacerbation-prone asthma, a randomized controlled trial showed a reduction in the number of exacerbations with subcutaneous mepolizumab versus placebo, with no differences in lung function, composite asthma score (CASI), or physician–patient global assessment. Improvements in lung function and symptom control were statistically significant but less than clinically important differences, and there was a clinically important improvement in quality of life with mepolizumab. Potential predictors of good response include higher blood eosinophils (strongly predictive).

### Long-term effectiveness of anti-IL-4R therapy following suboptimal response to anti-IL-5 / 5R therapy in severe eosinophilic asthma [^0b838f7b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Dupilumab is an anti-IL-4R monoclonal antibody (mAb) with proven efficacy in severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA). A suboptimal response to anti-IL-5/5R mAbs is seen in some patients with ongoing evidence of type 2 (T2) inflammation.

Objective

To understand whether targeting IL-13 pathways with dupilumab in these patients may lead to better clinical outcomes.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of the extended clinical effectiveness of dupilumab up to 2 years of treatment in patients with SEA who had not responded adequately to anti-IL-5/5R biologics. The ability to achieve clinical remission and the change in the remission domains of exacerbation rate (AER), maintenance oral corticosteroid dose (mOCS), lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), and asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire 6) were recorded.

Results

Thirty-seven patients (mean age 41 years, 70% female) were included in the analysis. The mean (standard deviation) AER fell by almost 90% from 3.16 (1.28) at dupilumab initiation to 0.35 (0.72) after 1 year. The median (interquartile range) mOCS dose (n = 20) fell from 10 (5–25) mg to 0 (0–5) mg at 1 year, with 14 of 20 (70%) able to stop prednisolone altogether. Clinical remission was achieved in 16 of 37 (43%). Patients who achieved remission had a higher pre-IL-5/5R fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level (85 [39–198] parts per billion [ppb] vs 75 [42–96] ppb, P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Significant improvements in clinical outcomes are possible after a switch to dupilumab in patients experiencing a suboptimal response to anti-IL-5/5R therapies. A higher FeNO in poor responders to anti-IL-5/5R who achieve remission with dupilumab is suggestive of an IL-13-driven subphenotype of T2-high asthma in which the eosinophil appears unlikely to play a key role in the disease pathogenesis.

### Anti-IL5 therapies for asthma [^958d9610]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This review is the first update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Library (Issue 7, 2015). Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is the main cytokine involved in the activation of eosinophils, which cause airway inflammation and are a classic feature of asthma. Monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-5 or its receptor (IL-5R) have been developed, with recent studies suggesting that they reduce asthma exacerbations, improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and lung function. These are being incorporated into asthma guidelines.

Objectives

To compare the effects of therapies targeting IL-5 signalling (anti-IL-5 or anti-IL-5Rα) with placebo on exacerbations, health-related qualify of life (HRQoL) measures, and lung function in adults and children with chronic asthma, and specifically in those with eosinophilic asthma refractory to existing treatments.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, clinical trials registries, manufacturers' websites, and reference lists of included studies. The most recent search was March 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing mepolizumab, reslizumab and benralizumab versus placebo in adults and children with asthma.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and analysed outcomes using a random-effects model. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Thirteen studies on 6000 participants met the inclusion criteria. Four used mepolizumab, four used reslizumab, and five used benralizumab. One study in benralizumab was terminated early due to sponsor decision and contributed no data. The studies were predominantly on people with severe eosinophilic asthma, which was similarly but variably defined. Eight included children over 12 years but these results were not reported separately. We deemed the risk of bias to be low, with all studies contributing data being of robust methodology. We considered the quality of the evidence for all comparisons to be high overall using the GRADE scheme, with the exception of intravenous mepolizumab because this is not currently a licensed delivery route. All of the anti-IL-5 treatments assessed reduced rates of 'clinically significant' asthma exacerbation (defined by treatment with systemic corticosteroids for three days or more) by approximately half in participants with severe eosinophilic asthma on standard of care (at least medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)) with poorly controlled disease (either two or more exacerbations in the preceding year or Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) 1.5 or more). Non-eosinophilic participants treated with benralizumab also showed a significant reduction in exacerbation rates, but no data were available for non-eosinophilic participants, and mepolizumab or reslizumab. We saw modest improvements in validated HRQoL scores with all anti-IL-5 agents in severe eosinophilic asthma. However these did not exceed the minimum clinically important difference for ACQ and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), with St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) only assessed in two studies. The improvement in HRQoL scores in non-eosinophilic participants treated with benralizumab, the only intervention for which data were available in this subset, was not statistically significant, but the test for subgroup difference was negative. All anti-IL-5 treatments produced a small but statistically significant improvement in mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory flow in one second (FEV 1) of between 0.08 L and 0.11 L. There were no excess serious adverse events with any anti-IL-5 treatment, and indeed a reduction in favour of mepolizumab that could be due to a beneficial effect on asthma-related serious adverse events. There was no difference compared to placebo in adverse events leading to discontinuation with mepolizumab or reslizumab, but significantly more discontinued benralizumab than placebo, although the absolute numbers were small (36/1599 benralizumab versus 9/998 placebo). Mepolizumab, reslizumab and benralizumab all markedly reduced blood eosinophils, but benralizumab resulted in almost complete depletion, whereas a small number remained with mepolizumab and reslizumab. The implications for efficacy and/or adverse events are unclear.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall our study supports the use of anti-IL-5 treatments as an adjunct to standard of care in people with severe eosinophilic asthma and poor control. These treatments roughly halve the rate of asthma exacerbations in this population. There is limited evidence for improved HRQoL scores and lung function, which may not meet clinically detectable levels. There were no safety concerns regarding mepolizumab or reslizumab, and no excess serious adverse events with benralizumab, although there remains a question over adverse events significant enough to prompt discontinuation. Further research is needed on biomarkers for assessing treatment response, optimal duration and long-term effects of treatment, risk of relapse on withdrawal, non-eosinophilic patients, children (particularly under 12 years), and comparing anti-IL-5 treatments to each other and, in people eligible for both, to anti-immunoglobulin E. For benralizumab, future studies should closely monitor rates of adverse events prompting discontinuation.

### Effective management of severe asthma with biologic medications in adult patients: a literature review and international expert opinion [^b3249c73]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe asthma often remains uncontrolled despite effective treatments and evidence-based guidelines. A group of global experts in asthma and biologic medications from 9 countries considered the most relevant clinical variables to manage severe asthma in adult patients and guide treatment choice. The resulting recommendations address the investigation of biomarker levels (blood eosinophil count along with fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO]), clinical features (oral corticosteroid [OCS] dependence, specific comorbid disease entities associated with severe type 2 asthma), and safety considerations. Current evidence suggests that biomarkers, including both blood or sputum eosinophil counts as well as FeNO, add prognostic and predictive value and should be measured in all patients with severe asthma. OCS use is an important factor in biologic selection, especially given the documented ability of some biologics to reduce OCS dependence. Comorbid diseases and relevant safety considerations to each biologic should also be considered. More data are needed to determine whether biomarker profiles identify patients suited to one biologic versus another as limited data support differential predictors of response. Further prospective head-to-head trials and post hoc analyses of clinical trial data are warranted. The authors believe that these recommendations have value as they offer expert opinion to assist health care providers in making difficult decisions regarding the quality of care in severe, type 2 asthma with biologic medications. They remain conditional and are based on limited data owing to a lack of head-to-head comparisons.

### Response to omalizumab using patient enrichment criteria from trials of novel biologics in asthma [^9d7e2c59]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recent efficacy studies of asthma biologics have included highly enriched patient populations. Using a similar approach, we examined factors that predict response to omalizumab to facilitate selection of patients most likely to derive the greatest clinical benefit from therapy.

Methods

Data from two phase III clinical trials of omalizumab in patients with allergic asthma were examined. Differences in rates of asthma exacerbations between omalizumab and placebo groups during the 16-week inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose-stable phase were evaluated with respect to baseline blood eosinophil counts (eosinophils < 300/μL [low] vs ≥ 300/μL [high]) and baseline markers of asthma severity (emergency asthma treatment in prior year, asthma hospitalization in prior year, forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV₁; FEV₁ < 65% vs ≥ 65% predicted], inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate dose [< 600 vs ≥ 600 μg/day], and long-acting beta-agonist [LABA] use [yes/no]).

Results

Adults/adolescents (N = 1071) were randomized to receive either omalizumab (n = 542) or placebo (n = 529). In the 16-week ICS dose-stable phase, rates of exacerbations requiring ≥ 3 days of systemic corticosteroid treatment were 0.066 and 0.147 with omalizumab and placebo, respectively, representing a relative rate reduction in omalizumab-treated patients of 55% (95% CI, 32%-70%; P = 0.002). For patients with eosinophils ≥ 300/μL or with more severe asthma, this rate reduction was significantly more pronounced.

Conclusion

In patients with allergic asthma, baseline blood eosinophil levels and/or clinical markers of asthma severity predict response to omalizumab.

Review response to an initial trial of add-on Type 2-targeted therapy — at present, there are no well-defined criteria for a good response; assess exacerbations, symptom control, lung function, side-effects, treatment intensity (including OCS dose), and patient satisfaction. If the response is unclear, consider extending the trial to 6–12 months. If there is no response, stop the biologic therapy and consider switching to a trial of a different Type 2-targeted therapy, if available and the patient is eligible, and also consider the patient's biomarkers and the response of comorbid Type 2 conditions such as atopic dermatitis or nasal polyps.

### Unmet need in severe, uncontrolled asthma: can anti-TSLP therapy with tezepelumab provide a valuable new treatment option? [^8adb77f9]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Currently available biologics for severe asthma comprise anti-IgE (omalizumab), anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab, reslizumab), anti-IL-5 receptor α (benralizumab) and anti-IL-4 receptor α (dupilumab, which blocks the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways) monoclonal antibodies. These therapies are generally indicated for patients with eosinophilic or allergic asthma phenotypes; to date, there are no approved biologic treatments for patients with confirmed eosinophil-low asthma (in the absence of eosinophil-lowering systemic corticosteroid therapy). In the pivotal studies of the currently approved biologics, exacerbation rates were reduced by 48–59% with the most efficacious dose regimen versus placebo. Improvements in lung function and symptom scores were inconsistent, with only some individuals experiencing clinically significant improvements. A possible explanation for this lack of complete efficacy may be that these biologics target individual, downstream elements of the asthma inflammatory response, leaving other components untreated. Targeting an upstream initiator and mediator of the inflammatory response may, therefore, have a broader effect on airway inflammation and provide more effective asthma control, including in patients with eosinophil-low phenotypes. One such potential target is thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP).

Dupilumab (anti–IL4Rα) add-on for severe eosinophilic/Type 2 asthma or for patients requiring maintenance OCS — regulatory details, mechanism, eligibility, outcomes, predictors, and safety are summarized as follows: For ages ≥ 12 years, dupilumab 200 mg or 300 mg by SC injection every 2 weeks is listed for severe eosinophilic/Type 2 asthma, and 300 mg by SC injection every 2 weeks for OCS-dependent severe asthma or with concomitant moderate/severe atopic dermatitis; for children 6–11 years, dosing and frequency depend on weight, and self-administration may be an option. Mechanistically, dupilumab binds to interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor alpha, blocking both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling. Eligibility criteria often include more than a specified number of severe exacerbations in the last year and Type 2 biomarkers above specified levels, such as blood eosinophils ≥ 150/μL and ≤ 1500/μL or FeNO ≥ 25 ppb, or a requirement for maintenance OCS. In a meta-analysis of RCTs in uncontrolled severe asthma (ACQ-5 ≥ 1.5) and ≥ 1 exacerbation in the last year, anti-IL4Rα led to 56% reduction in severe exacerbations; in OCS-dependent severe asthma, the median reduction in OCS dose versus placebo was 50%, and changes were maintained through 2 years of follow-up. In children 6–11 years with eosinophilic/Type 2 asthma, dupilumab reduced severe exacerbation rate and increased lung function; in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, dupilumab reduced polyp size, improved nasal symptoms, and reduced the need for OCS or sinus surgery. Potential predictors of good asthma response to dupilumab include higher blood eosinophils (strongly predictive) and higher FeNO (strongly predictive). Adverse effects include injection-site reactions and transient blood eosinophilia (occurs in 4–13% of patients); rare cases of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) may be unmasked following reduction/cessation of OCS, and anti-IL4Rα is not suggested for patients with baseline or historic blood eosinophils > 1,500 cells/μL. Suggested initial trial is at least 4 months.

### Biologic therapies for severe asthma | NEJM resident 360… [^c6f37d21]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

A: Severe asthma is heterogeneous biologically, with distinct patterns of airway inflammation defined by the predominant granulocyte in sputum or bronchial biopsy specimens and often identified by means of blood or exhaled-breath biomarkers. Type 2 high-inflammation asthma is characterized by eosinophilic airway inflammation, which is associated with increased blood eosinophil counts or elevations of fractional exhaled nitric oxide, whereas type 2 low-inflammation asthma encompasses neutrophilic asthma and paucigranulocytic asthma. A: Type 2 cytokines include interleukin-5, interleukin-4, and interleukin-13. Interleukin-5 promotes proliferation, differentiation, activation, and survival of eosinophils. The numbers of eosinophils in peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and bronchial biopsy specimens directly correlate with the severity of asthma. Interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, which share interleukin-4 receptor α, have many overlapping functions.

Interleukin-4 plays a key role in CD4+ type 2 helper T lymphocyte differentiation and drives IgE isotype switching in B lymphocytes. Interleukin-13 induces the contraction of airway smooth-muscle cells and stimulates inducible nitric oxide synthase in bronchial epithelial cells, which leads to an increase in Feno. A: In clinical trials, several anticytokine antibodies enabled tapering of oral glucocorticoids with the use of predefined schedules while asthma control was maintained in adults with glucocorticoid-dependent severe asthma. Mepolizumab reduced the glucocorticoid dose by a median of 50%, as compared with placebo, while reducing the annualized rate of exacerbations by 32% and improving asthma control, findings that were supported by real-life observational studies.

Benralizumab significantly reduced the median oral glucocorticoid dose from baseline to 28 weeks, as compared with placebo. In contrast, neither fixed-dose subcutaneous reslizumab nor fixed-dose subcutaneous tezepelumab reduced the daily oral glucocorticoid dose in patients with glucocorticoid-dependent severe asthma.

### Effectiveness of benralizumab in severe eosinophilic asthma: distinct sub-phenotypes of response identified by cluster analysis [^c2696e58]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Benralizumab has been shown to be effective in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA). Phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated a significant reduction in exacerbation rate and oral corticosteroid (OCS) use, as well as improvement of lung function, asthma control and quality of life measures. However, as for other biologics, it is evident that not all patients respond equally well. This difference in treatment response is likely multifactorial and related to the heterogeneity of the severe asthma population.

Prediction of treatment response is difficult and deals with various problems such as how to define a response, what are clinically relevant outcome measures, and what should be the timing for the evaluation of response. Data from RCTs consistently showed that higher levels of blood eosinophils and a history of frequent exacerbations were the most important baseline characteristics that predicted treatment response to benralizumab. The presence of late‐onset asthma (> 18 years), OCS dependency, impaired lung function and nasal polyposis might further increase the chance of a good response.

It is recognized that subjects recruited in RCTs are not fully representative of the severe asthma population, as seen in routine practice, since trial populations appear to have a moderate‐to‐severe disease. Furthermore, patients with fixed‐flow obstruction, smoking history and important medical comorbidities are usually excluded. Consequently, real‐life data on biologics are needed to assess effectiveness and identify clinically relevant predictors, as data generated in clinical trial settings may not be easily translated in a real‐life setting.

In this multi‐centre, observational, retrospective study, by cluster analysis, we sought to characterize different clinical sub‐phenotypes within SEA, aiming at identifying subgroups of patients with differential benralizumab responsiveness.

10 and evaluated outcomes at baseline and after initiation of omalizumab add-on treatment. In week 52 versus baseline, control improved to good control in 67% of participants. Exacerbations were reduced by 72% and hospitalizations were reduced by 89% in the first year of therapy. FEV 1 increased by 4. 9%, and there was a 30% reduction in mean ICS dose. A secondary analysis of the DREAM and MENSA studies revealed a "close relationship between baseline blood eosinophil levels and clinical efficacy of mepolizumab, " with efficacy highest in those with eosinophil concentrations of at least 150 cells/μL, with one pooled analysis showing treatment-associated exacerbation rate reductions increasing from a 26% rate reduction in those with < 150 eosinophils/μL to a 70% rate reduction in those with > 500 eosinophils/μL.

27 In one phase III trial in 315 participants aged 12 to 75 years, it was found to improve lung function, asthma control scores measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire, and quality of life scores measured by the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire. 30 The first large clinical trial in which researchers evaluated benralizumab was the CALIMA study. 30 Enrolled participants were 12 to 75 years of age with severe asthma. It was found that in patients with eosinophil concentrations > 300 cells/μL, benralizumab significantly reduced asthma exacerbation rate ratios relative to placebo and was well tolerated.

Similarly, in the SIROCCO study, researchers evaluated 1204 participants 12 to 75 years of age with severe asthma and found that in patients with eosinophil concentrations > 300 cells/μL, benralizumab reduced the annual asthma exacerbation rate over 48 weeks when given every 4 or 8 weeks and increased prebronchodilator FEV.

### Anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-5R biologics for severe asthma. are there any differences in their effects? [^00d524b2]. The Journal of Asthma (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this retrospective multicentre study is to describe the clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with severe eosinophilic asthma receiving anti-IL-5/anti-IL-5Rα therapies and to compare their effectiveness.

Methods

We collected and analysed results separately for anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-5Rα therapies from January 2016 until December 2021 in multidisciplinary severe asthma units. We collected demographic and clinical data, treatment with previous anti-IgE and/or anti-IL-5 agents, and comorbidities. We compared the number of exacerbations and admissions to the hospital, daily oral corticosteroid intake, pulmonary function tests, and Asthma Control Test scores before and after 12 months of therapy. 261 patients were included: 176 patients in the anti-IL-5 group and 85 in the anti-IL-5Rα group.

Results

Both groups led to statistically significant reductions in asthma exacerbations, hospital admissions, and visits to the Emergency Room. Although both groups showed a significant reduction in blood eosinophiliccount, we found a difference, although not significant, in the magnitude of reduction as benralizumab was able to decrease eosinophil counts to zero. Patients in the anti-IL-5 group achieved higher ACT scores after treatment, although this improvement was seen in both treatment groups.

Conclusion

The anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-5Rα biologics have shown similar effectiveness despite having different mechanisms of action. The anti-IL-5 group appeared to be better than benralizumab at improving ACT scores and FEV1/FVC and at reducing the number of inhalers. Although these differences were not statistically significant, it is not clear whether they may have clinical relevance and they might highlight the need for further head-to-head studies comparing these treatments.

### Targeting the IL-5 pathway in eosinophilic asthma: a comparison of anti-IL-5 versus anti-IL-5 receptor agents [^a986252a]. Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic asthma is characterized by frequent exacerbations, poor symptom control and accelerated lung function decline. It is now recognized that the immune response underlying eosinophilic asthma involves a complex network of interconnected pathways from both the adaptive and innate immune systems. Within this response, interleukin-5 (IL-5) plays a central role in eosinophil differentiation, activation and survival and has emerged as a key target for therapies treating severe asthma. The monoclonal antibodies mepolizumab and reslizumab target the ligand IL-5, preventing its interaction with eosinophils; in contrast, benralizumab binds to the IL-5 receptor (IL-5R), preventing IL-5 from binding and leading to substantially greater eosinophil reduction by enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Although no direct head-to-head clinical trials of asthma have been published to formally evaluate the clinical significance of these different therapeutic approaches, the potential benefits of partial versus complete eosinophil depletion continue to remain an important area of study and debate. Here, we review the existing real-world and clinical study data of anti-IL-5/anti-IL-5R therapies in severe eosinophilic asthma.

### Response to omalizumab using patient enrichment criteria from trials of novel biologics in asthma [^7975bc88]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

The treatment effects of the various biologic agents in patient populations not enriched by these clinical markers of severity have yet to be elucidated. However, a recent 24‐week trial of dupilumab in 776 patients who were included without enrichment for eosinophil levels (but were required to have ≥ 1 systemic corticosteroid burst therapy or ≥ 1 hospital admission or emergency department/urgent care visit that required systemic steroids in the previous year) showed that the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophil count < 300/μL who received dupilumab 200 mg or 300 mg every 2 weeks had exacerbation risk reductions vs placebo of 67.6% (P = 0.0081) and 59.9% (P = 0.0152), respectively. 27

Given the variability in study design, patient inclusion criteria, study duration, dosing schedules, and biomarker requirements across the various biologic therapies for asthma, it is difficult to directly compare their efficacy. However, the findings of this post hoc study demonstrating an improved and comparable response to omalizumab in patients with a history of asthma hospitalization or emergency department visits, and in those with high baseline blood eosinophil counts, are particularly noteworthy given that the trials for omalizumab were not enriched for these factors, unlike the studies of other biologic therapies; enrichment inherently allows for greater efficacy because patients with more severe asthma and more frequent exacerbations have more room for improvement. This finding also is important within the concept of an eosinophilic asthma phenotype, because omalizumab is not thought to work directly through inhibition of eosinophils. However, omalizumab has been reported to reduce airway eosinophils 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 as well as peripheral blood eosinophils. 35, 36 The efficacy of omalizumab also was demonstrated regardless of LABA use.
