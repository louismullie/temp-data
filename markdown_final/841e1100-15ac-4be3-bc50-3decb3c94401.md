## Question

What risks are associated with combining Adderall and cannabis use?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what risks are associated with combining Adderall (mixed amphetamine salts) and cannabis (THC/CBD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and adverse effect profiles of each agent. Then, I should evaluate pharmacodynamic interactions on the cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric systems. Next, I will examine pharmacokinetic interactions via CYP pathways that could alter exposure. After that, I need to assess abuse, dependence, and clinical management considerations, including special risk groups. Finally, I will synthesize harm-reduction advice and monitoring recommendations to guide safer care.

> Let me first confirm Adderall's core profile so I'm not missing anything important. Adderall increases synaptic norepinephrine and dopamine and predictably raises heart rate and blood pressure; it carries boxed warnings for abuse, misuse, and addiction, and can precipitate or exacerbate psychosis or mania even at therapeutic doses, with labels emphasizing careful screening and ongoing monitoring for psychiatric and cardiovascular risks [^113SkjeN] [^111AyoaD] [^114HGnQ6] [^111fjY3r] [^113djw4w].

> Now, I should review cannabis effects and variability. THC is a partial CB1 agonist that acutely causes intoxication, memory impairment, psychotomimetic effects, anxiety, and tachycardia, while CBD has complex and sometimes moderating effects but also meaningful drug–drug interaction potential via CYP inhibition; medical dronabinol labeling additionally flags hemodynamic instability and seizure risk, highlighting that route and formulation matter and that patient responses vary widely [^111uaWs7] [^115wQEHG] [^116WTozp] [^111s8qjT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — let me carefully examine cardiovascular pharmacodynamic interactions. Adderall increases blood pressure and heart rate, and THC acutely increases cardiac workload and tachycardia, so concurrent use plausibly adds sympathetic and chronotropic load, which could unmask arrhythmias or ischemia in susceptible patients or those with occult heart disease; Adderall labeling already advises avoiding stimulants in serious cardiac disease and screening for cardiac risk before initiation [^113SkjeN] [^111AyoaD] [^113djw4w] [^111uaWs7]. Wait, let me verify a statement I recall about regulatory warnings on cannabis and coronary events; I initially thought the FDA explicitly warned about cannabis precipitating coronary syndromes with synergistic risk when combined with stimulants, but on checking, that source is a Journal of the American Heart Association report signaling increased cardiovascular events in young users and potential compounding with other stimulants like cocaine, not an FDA label, so any extrapolation to amphetamines is a biologically plausible but unproven extension and should be framed cautiously [^112pmw3h].

> Next, I should review central nervous system interactions and psychiatric risk. Stimulants can improve attention but commonly provoke anxiety and insomnia, while THC acutely impairs memory and can induce psychotomimetic symptoms; combining them can yield unpredictable net cognitive and affective effects with a realistic risk of additive anxiety, sleep disruption, and perceptual changes, especially at higher THC potency or doses [^115D7pDY] [^114EtjgK] [^111uaWs7] [^113DsMiA]. I need to ensure I consider psychosis risk properly: stimulants can cause new-onset psychotic or manic symptoms at therapeutic doses, and epidemiologic and experimental data associate THC exposure with psychosis risk in a dose–potency–frequency dependent manner; co-use likely lowers the threshold for psychosis in vulnerable individuals, such as those with a family history, first-episode psychosis, or prodromal states, so clinicians should screen and counsel accordingly [^113mxA7j] [^114HGnQ6] [^112sKBfJ] [^113ekfr8] [^112whib1] [^112b9ARD].

> I will now examine pharmacokinetic interactions because these can silently amplify risk. Amphetamines are partly metabolized by CYP2D6; FDA labeling warns that coadministration with CYP2D6 inhibitors increases exposure, which could intensify cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse effects, and both THC and CBD have been reported to inhibit CYP enzymes including CYP2D6, raising a plausible mechanism for elevated Adderall levels when cannabis products are used, particularly CBD-rich preparations; the evidence base is mixed and often in vitro or observational, so I should double-check and communicate uncertainty while still advising caution and monitoring [^113DcmAm] [^1125MyMh] [^111s8qjT] [^115wQEHG] [^112yXE2V]. But wait, what if the interaction is bidirectional? Data on stimulants altering cannabinoid metabolism are limited, so I should note this is not well characterized and avoid overstatement [^112yXE2V].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I also need to consider seizure threshold and autonomic instability. Stimulants can lower the convulsive threshold, and dronabinol labeling notes seizures and hemodynamic swings such as tachycardia or blood pressure lability; while cannabis constituents have heterogeneous effects on seizure risk depending on composition and patient phenotype, concurrent use with stimulants could complicate recognition and management of seizure-like events or syncope, so counseling about warning symptoms and prompt evaluation is prudent [^114HGnQ6] [^116WTozp].

> I should now assess abuse and dependence liability because co-use patterns matter clinically. Adderall has a boxed warning for abuse, misuse, diversion, and overdose risk, requiring pre-prescribing assessment and ongoing monitoring, and cannabis use disorder lacks approved pharmacotherapies with meaningful withdrawal and dependence symptoms documented in youth and adults; co-use often occurs in polydrug contexts, which increases adverse outcomes and complicates adherence and safety, and adolescents or young adults with ADHD and ongoing cannabis use are at increased risk of stimulant misuse or diversion, necessitating tighter controls, education, and in some cases reconsideration of regimen [^111fjY3r] [^111AyoaD] [^114s1MuR] [^113Hz6G7] [^114s1MuR] [^114f27Vx].

> Let me consider practical management and harm reduction next so recommendations are concrete. Before starting or continuing stimulants, screen for structural or serious cardiac disease and relevant family history, measure baseline blood pressure and heart rate, and counsel about additive cardiovascular stress with THC; avoid stimulants in patients with serious cardiac disease and advise reducing or abstaining from high-potency THC products to mitigate tachycardia and psychosis risk while monitoring vitals after dose changes or cannabis use pattern shifts [^113djw4w] [^113SkjeN] [^112sKBfJ]. Hold on, I should verify psychiatric safeguards: if psychotic or manic symptoms emerge, discontinue the stimulant and manage per standard care; after remission of stimulant-induced psychosis or mania, ASAM/AAAP guidance supports cautious reintroduction or tapering of antipsychotics depending on course, and clinicians should provide relapse prevention counseling around cannabis and stimulant exposure given recurrence risk with continued use [^113mxA7j] [^114HGnQ6] [^11129gNg]. I need to ensure ADHD care is optimized too: when cannabis use is ongoing, consider adherence supports, pill counts, prescription monitoring, or non-stimulant alternatives if diversion or misuse risk is high, as better-controlled ADHD may reduce broader substance use risk but safety must remain paramount [^114s1MuR].

> Let me reconsider any remaining uncertainties so I don't overstate the evidence. Some cardiovascular and pharmacokinetic risks are biologically plausible and supported by labeling and mechanistic data, but high-quality prospective data specifically on Adderall–cannabis co-use are limited; therefore, recommendations should emphasize individualized risk assessment, informed consent about additive cardiovascular and psychiatric risks, careful dose titration, and close follow-up with readiness to adjust therapy if adverse effects emerge [^113SkjeN] [^111uaWs7] [^112yXE2V].

> Bottom line: Combining Adderall and cannabis can produce additive cardiovascular stimulation, unpredictable and potentially adverse neuropsychiatric effects including lowered thresholds for psychosis or mania, and possible pharmacokinetic increases in amphetamine exposure via cannabinoid-mediated CYP inhibition; in patients with cardiac risk, psychiatric vulnerability, or misuse risk, the combination is particularly hazardous and warrants strong harm-reduction counseling, close monitoring, or avoidance with consideration of alternative ADHD treatments and targeted substance use interventions where indicated [^113SkjeN] [^111AyoaD] [^111uaWs7] [^113DcmAm] [^115wQEHG] [^112sKBfJ] [^114s1MuR].

---

Concurrent use of Adderall and cannabis increases the risk of **cardiovascular events** (tachycardia, hypertension, arrhythmias) [^113SkjeN] and **psychiatric complications** (anxiety, paranoia, psychosis) [^111uaWs7] via additive sympathetic and dopaminergic effects [^116dWLbG]. Cannabis can inhibit CYP2D6 [^111s8qjT], potentially raising amphetamine levels and adverse effects [^112yXE2V]. Together, they also **impair cognition and motor function** [^113DsMiA], increasing accident risk [^116WTozp], and heighten the likelihood of dependence and misuse [^111AyoaD] [^114s1MuR]. Clinicians should monitor for cardiovascular and psychiatric symptoms, educate patients on risks [^116Kewcb], and consider alternative treatments [^114s1MuR] or dose adjustments [^113DcmAm].

---

## Pharmacological interactions

Pharmacological interactions involve both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic mechanisms [^112yXE2V]. Pharmacodynamically, Adderall increases dopamine and norepinephrine [^116dWLbG], while cannabis (THC) activates CB1 receptors [^113GiUHh]; together they can produce **additive or synergistic effects** that raise adverse event risk. Pharmacokinetically, cannabis inhibits **CYP2D6** [^111s8qjT], which metabolizes amphetamines, potentially increasing Adderall levels and adverse effects [^112yXE2V].

---

## Cardiovascular risks

Cardiovascular risks include **increased heart rate and blood pressure**, as Adderall elevates both [^113SkjeN] and cannabis can cause tachycardia and hypertension [^111uaWs7]; combined use may exacerbate these effects and raise cardiovascular event risk [^112pmw3h]. Risks also include **arrhythmias and cardiac events**, because both agents independently increase arrhythmia risk [^112pmw3h] and their concurrent use may further elevate it, especially in those with preexisting cardiac conditions [^113SkjeN].

---

## Psychiatric risks

- **Anxiety and paranoia**: Both drugs can cause anxiety and paranoia; combined use may intensify these symptoms, leading to significant distress or psychiatric episodes [^111uaWs7] [^114HGnQ6].

- **Psychosis**: Adderall can induce psychotic or manic symptoms [^113SkjeN]; cannabis is linked to psychosis, especially at high doses or in vulnerable individuals [^111uaWs7]. Combined use may increase psychosis risk [^112sKBfJ].

- **Mood disturbances**: Combined use may worsen mood instability, depression, and anxiety, particularly in those with preexisting psychiatric conditions [^111uWuWb].

---

## Cognitive and behavioral risks

Cognitive and behavioral risks include **cognitive impairment**, as cannabis impairs memory, attention, and executive function [^113DsMiA] and Adderall may cause deficits at high doses; together, they can worsen impairment and affect daily functioning and academic performance [^112sKBfJ]. They also include **risky behaviors**, with concurrent use associated with impaired driving, substance misuse, and poor decision-making [^116WTozp] [^114f27Vx].

---

## Dependence and misuse

Dependence and misuse concerns include an **increased risk of dependence**, as both drugs have abuse potential [^111AyoaD] and combined use may heighten the risk [^115Kqzpe], particularly in individuals with a history of substance use disorder [^113Hz6G7]. They also include **withdrawal symptoms**, because concurrent use may complicate withdrawal, intensify symptoms, and increase relapse risk [^115Kqzpe].

---

## Clinical considerations and recommendations

- **Patient education**: Clinicians should educate patients on the risks of combined use, including cardiovascular, psychiatric, and cognitive effects [^116Kewcb].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor for adverse effects, including cardiovascular symptoms, psychiatric symptoms, and signs of misuse or dependence [^115RLEu8].

- **Alternative treatments**: Consider non-stimulant medications or behavioral interventions for patients using cannabis regularly [^114s1MuR] [^11129gNg].

- **Dose adjustments**: If combined use is unavoidable, consider lower Adderall doses and monitor closely for adverse effects [^113DcmAm].

---

Concurrent Adderall and cannabis use **increases cardiovascular** [^112pmw3h], **psychiatric** [^112sKBfJ], and **cognitive risks** [^113DsMiA] and may raise dependence and misuse potential [^111AyoaD] [^115Kqzpe]. Clinicians should educate patients [^116Kewcb], monitor for adverse effects [^115RLEu8], and consider alternative treatments [^114s1MuR] or dose adjustments [^113DcmAm].

### The acute effects of cannabis with and without cannabidiol in adults and adolescents: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover experiment [^111uaWs7]. Addiction (2023). High credibility.

Cannabis acutely produces an array of transient and dose-dependent effects, including intoxication, euphoria, memory impairment, psychotomimetic effects, anxiogenic effects, attention deficits, and tachycardia. Notably, there is wide interindividual variation. The major psychoactive effects of cannabis arise from delta‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is a partial cannabinoid‐1 receptor (CB1R) agonist. Cannabidiol (CBD), the second most abundant phytocannabinoid, has a complex pharmacology and includes inhibition of anandamide metabolism, agonism of the serotonin‐1A receptor, and negative allosteric modulation of CB1 receptors.

CBD may moderate some of the acute effects of THC; however, findings have been inconsistent. CBD has sometimes been shown to attenuate the short-term harmful effects of THC and sometimes not, which may be related to CBD dose, route of administration, and user characteristics. High-dose oral (600 mg) and intravenous (5 mg) CBD attenuated the psychotomimetic effects and episodic memory impairing effects of THC, but 8 mg of vaporized CBD did not. The moderating influence of CBD co-administration on the acute effects of cannabis in adolescents is unknown.

### Adderall xr [^113SkjeN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Abuse, misuse, and addiction**: Adderall XR has a high potential for abuse and misuse, exposing individuals to risks that can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. It can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including Adderall XR, can result in overdose and death, and this risk increases with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection [see Overdosage (10)]. Before prescribing Adderall XR, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and the proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store Adderall XR in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct them not to give Adderall XR to anyone else. Throughout treatment, reassess each patient's risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction, and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms.

- **Risks to patients with serious cardiac disease**: Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who were treated with CNS stimulants at the recommended ADHD dosage. Avoid using Adderall XR in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac conditions.

- **Increased blood pressure and heart rate**: CNS stimulants may cause an increase in blood pressure and heart rate.

### Clearing up the smoke: Physical and mental health considerations regarding cannabis use in adolescents with cystic fibrosis [^111s8qjT]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Low credibility.

Clinicians should assess for potential drug interactions when adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) anticipate or share the use of cannabis in any form (e.g. topical, oral). The pharmacokinetics of inhaled cannabinoids may be similar to intravenous administration. Thus, possible drug interactions and other systemic effects from inhalation should not be minimized, as this route also bypasses first-pass metabolism. Oral formulations have variable absorption since THC and CBD are highly lipophilic and have lower oral bioavailability. Consequently, some adolescents may report a need to use more oral cannabis to achieve the same intended effects as compared to inhalation.

Although the inhaled route has clear deleterious effects on pulmonary diseases like CF, oral use is not without its risks. THC and CBD are primarily hepatically metabolized via cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Clinicians should consider CYP P450 isoenzymes associated with a given medication and those affected by THC and CBD. THC is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9, as well as CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, which are common with medications such as proton pump inhibitors and CFTR modulators. THC also inhibits CYP2D6, which metabolizes various antidepressants, and induces CYP1A2, responsible for metabolism of medications such as fluvoxamine, olanzapine, haloperidol, and theophylline. CBD is primarily metabolized by CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2.

### Cannabis use: Signal of increasing risk of serious cardiovascular disorders [^112pmw3h]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Cannabis is the world's most widely used illicit substance. It benefits from an image of safety for health, and its use has become trivialized. Communication about the potential therapeutic properties of cannabinoids and the marketing of cannabis derivatives in the treatment of pain, nausea, or anorexia in several countries must have contributed to reinforcing the belief that cannabis use could be safe or even healthy. However, it is now acknowledged that cannabis use is harmful to health.

- **Complicating factors**: Although factors such as variety of plant, administration route, concomitant tobacco use, or possible adulterated products may complicate the identification of potential cannabis-related disorders, evidence suggests that cannabis and tobacco together precipitated the occurrence of coronary syndromes in patients with a coronary history compared with tobacco taken alone.

Another study conducted in a population of nearly 4000 patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction suggested that cannabis use acutely increased the risk of myocardial infarction. More recently, similar serious cardiovascular complications have been identified as the reason for hospitalization of young cannabis users. These complications emerged among all other subgroups due to the seriousness of cases and the particular profile of patients, principally young and apparently healthy males (appearing healthy because they had no history). Among the events collected, myocardial infarctions, thromboses, and cerebral strokes were observed.

### Drug-drug interactions involving classic psychedelics: A systematic review [^112QAfX4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

An example of a pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction (DDI) is the inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzymes, such as cytochrome P450, which are responsible for metabolizing a broad range of drugs. Inhibition of these enzymes by concomitant drugs or circulating metabolites can lead to altered drug metabolism and impact the drug's effects and influence treatment outcomes. Additionally, there is the potential for interaction with P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a membrane transporter that facilitates the efflux of various drugs and is present in the kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and blood–brain barrier. Similar to CYP enzymes, reducing the activity of P-gp can increase the concentration of its substrates in the blood, whereas increasing its activity can decrease the concentration, leading to inadequate therapeutic effects.

For instance, CYP enzymes have a known role in LSD metabolism and therefore can affect LSD's effects. Drug-drug interactions can occur even when drugs are not taken concurrently, allowing for days or even weeks between their administration. Some drugs, like fluoxetine, have prolonged inhibitory effects on CYP activity that may persist for several weeks following its discontinuation due to the extended half-life of fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine.

Currently, there is limited literature available on the DDIs between classic psychedelics and other drugs. While two review articles have been published on this subject, the first one was limited in scope, and the second one focused solely on 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and psilocybin interactions with psychiatric medications.

### Cannabis use: signal of increasing risk of serious cardiovascular disorders [^1154DN8b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Under pathological conditions, such as an imbalance of the endocannabinoid system, cannabinoids have been associated with cardiovascular dysfunctions. Thus, the long-term use of cannabis is responsible for long-lasting decreased blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac contractility, increased blood volume, and diminished circulatory responses to exercise. More generally, it is associated with decreased myocardial function.

Moreover, due to these long- and short-term complications, heart function is carefully monitored in subjects participating in experimental studies involving cannabis administration. These complications are consistent with centrally mediated, reduced sympathetic, and enhanced parasympathetic activity. The opposite can be observed in pathological cardiovascular conditions; in animals, THC was shown to cause vasoconstriction. Vasospasm could, therefore, be a possible common origin for many cases described in the present study. Additionally, the direct impact of cannabinoids on factors such as nitric oxide or endothelial factors could explain the disparity of complications observed between cannabis and tobacco. Tobacco is associated with deregulations observed after continuous exposure, contrasting with the apparent immediacy of cannabis-related cardiovascular disorders.

Such complications can be seen among young adults who use stimulant drugs (e.g. cocaine and methamphetamine) known to cause cardiovascular complications. These stimulant drug users are likely to also be regular cannabis users. Stimulant drug use may be less likely acknowledged.

### Different psychological effects of cannabis use in adolescents at genetic high risk for schizophrenia and with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^112whib1]. Schizophrenia Research (2008). Low credibility.

Controversy exists regarding whether young people at risk for schizophrenia are at increased risk of adverse mental effects of cannabis use.

- **Methods**: We examined cannabis use and mental health functioning in three groups of young people aged 14–21: 36 non-psychotic siblings of adolescents with schizophrenia (genetic high-risk group), 25 adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and 72 healthy controls. The groups were sub-divided into 'users' and 'non-users' of cannabis based on how often they had used cannabis previously. Mental health functioning was quantified by creating a composite index derived from scores on the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and Global Assessment of Function (GAF).

- **Results**: A significant positive association between cannabis use and mental health disturbance was confined to young people at genetic high risk for schizophrenia. To determine whether the relationship was specific to particular dimensions of mental health function, a second composite index was created based on scores from the SPQ Disorganisation and SDQ hyperactivity-inattention sub-scales. Again, there was a significant positive association between cannabis use and factor scores that was specific to the genetic high-risk group. There was a trend for this association to be negative in the ADHD group (p = 0.07).

- **Conclusions**: The findings support the view that young people at genetic high risk for schizophrenia are particularly vulnerable to mental health problems associated with cannabis use.

### Cannabinoid abuse and addiction: Clinical and preclinical findings [^115EsghC]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Cannabinoid abuse disorders represent a widespread public health issue, but there are no approved medications for their treatment. This review describes efforts to understand the mechanisms of cannabinoid abuse and its adverse effects, to identify molecular targets for pharmacotherapy, and to evaluate potential treatments in human volunteers and animal models of cannabinoid reward, withdrawal, and relapse.

### Pharmacotherapies for cannabis dependence [^115Kqzpe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Globally, cannabis use is prevalent and widespread, yet there are currently no pharmacotherapies approved for the treatment of cannabis use disorders. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in Issue 12, 2014. The objectives were to assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies as compared with each other, placebo, or no pharmacotherapy (supportive care) for reducing symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and promoting cessation or reduction of cannabis use.

- **Search methods**: We updated our searches of the following databases to March 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs involving the use of medications to treat cannabis withdrawal or to promote cessation or reduction of cannabis use, or both, were considered. Comparisons included other medications, placebo, or no medication (supportive care) in individuals diagnosed as cannabis dependent or who were likely to be dependent.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included 21 RCTs involving 1,755 participants: 18 studies recruited adults (mean age 22 to 41 years), and three studies targeted young people (mean age 20 years). Most (75%) participants were male. The studies were at low risk of performance, detection, and selective outcome reporting bias. However, one study was at risk of selection bias, and three studies were at risk of attrition bias. All studies involved comparison of active medication and placebo.

### Dronabinol [^116WTozp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

- **Neuropsychiatric adverse reactions**: Advise patients that psychiatric adverse reactions may occur, especially in patients with a past psychiatric history or those receiving other drugs also associated with psychiatric effects, and to report any new or worsening psychiatric symptoms to their healthcare provider. Recommend that patients, particularly elderly ones, be aware of the possibility of cognitive impairment or altered mental state during treatment with dronabinol capsules. Patients should inform their healthcare provider if they develop signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment. Advise patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that dronabinol capsules do not affect them adversely. Alert patients to the potential for additive central nervous system depression if dronabinol capsules are used concomitantly with alcohol or other CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates.

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Advise patients, especially those with cardiac disorders, to report any signs or symptoms of hemodynamic instability to their healthcare provider. These may include hypotension, hypertension, syncope, or tachycardia, particularly after initiating or increasing the dosage of dronabinol capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Seizures**: Advise patients to discontinue dronabinol capsules and contact a healthcare provider immediately if they experience a seizure.

### A reciprocal effects analysis of cannabis use and perceptions of risk [^115Rek3L]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Adolescents and young adults increasingly view cannabis as a relatively safe drug. The perception of risk associated with cannabis use is negatively correlated with the prevalence of use; however, the causal nature of this association is debated. The aim of this study is to quantify the reciprocal associations between cannabis use and risk perception in a longitudinal panel of emerging adults.

- **Design**: Observational study of longitudinal data from the Monitoring the Future study using autoregressive cross-lagged panel analyses to investigate reciprocal associations between cannabis risk perception and the frequency of past-year cannabis use.

- **Setting**: Surveys administered to 12th-grade students from the United States general population.

- **Participants**: A total of 9,929 12th-grade students (mean age 18.0 years) were surveyed initially during 2000–2005, with follow-up data collected until approximately 23–24 years old (three waves; n = 9,929).

- **Measurements**: Perception of risk associated with cannabis use and frequency of past-year cannabis use.

Results at baseline indicated that 33% of 12th-graders used cannabis in the past year versus 28% by the third follow-up; 83% believed that smoking cannabis regularly carried moderate or great risk versus 78% by the third follow-up. All cross-lagged paths in both directions were statistically significant (all P < 0.001), consistent with reciprocal influences between cannabis use and risk perception. The negative association between past-year cannabis use and subsequent risk perception was noteworthy, with a standardized coefficient range of -0.21 to -0.27.

### Does using marijuana increase the risk for developing schizophrenia [^115MH2cf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

As more US states and other countries consider legalizing marijuana, clinicians need to know the possible effects of this drug. Research has shown a connection between marijuana use and an increased risk for schizophrenia in young people who are vulnerable to developing psychosis. An international panel of experts addresses topics such as risk factors for schizophrenia, the potency and effects of cannabis use on adolescents, the effects of concurrent drug use with cannabis on schizophrenia risk, and attitudes toward marijuana.

### Cannabis-based medicines and cannabis dependence: A critical review of issues and evidence [^116rLNor]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Cannabis has been legalized for medical use in an ever-increasing number of countries. A growing body of scientific evidence supports the use of medical cannabis for a range of therapeutic indications. In parallel with these developments, concerns have been expressed by many prescribers that increased use will lead to patients developing cannabis use disorder. Cannabis use disorder has been widely studied in recreational users, and these findings have often been projected onto patients using medical cannabis. However, studies exploring medical cannabis dependence are scarce and the appropriate methodology to measure this construct is uncertain.

This article provides a narrative review of the research to discern if, how, and to what extent concerns about problems of dependence in recreational cannabis users apply to prescribed medical users. We focus on the main issues related to medical cannabis and dependence, including the importance of dose, potency, cannabinoid content, pharmacokinetics, and route of administration, frequency of use, as well as set and setting. Medical and recreational cannabis use differs in significant ways, highlighting the challenges of extrapolating findings from the recreational cannabis literature. There are many questions about the potential for medical cannabis use to lead to dependence. It is, therefore, imperative to address these questions in order to be able to minimize harms of medical cannabis use. We draw out seven recommendations for increasing the safety of medical cannabis prescribing.

We hope that the present review contributes to the understanding of cannabis dependence issues related to medical use.

### Reduced drug use as an alternative valid outcome in individuals with stimulant use disorders: Findings from 13 multisite randomized clinical trials [^111Cntb1]. Addiction (2024). High credibility.

Total abstinence has historically been the goal of treatment for substance use disorders; however, there is a growing recognition of the health benefits associated with reduced use as a harm reduction measure in stimulant use disorders treatment. We aimed to assess the validity of reduced stimulant use as an outcome measure in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological interventions for stimulant use disorder.

- **Design**: We conducted a secondary analysis of a pooled dataset of 13 RCTs.

- **Setting and participants**: Participants were individuals seeking treatment for cocaine or methamphetamine use disorders (N = 2062) in a wide range of treatment facilities in the United States.

- **Measurements**: We validated reduced stimulant use against a set of clinical indicators drawn from harmonized measurements, including severity of problems caused by drug use, comorbid depression, global severity of substance use and improvement, severity of drug-seeking behavior, craving and high-risk behaviors, all assessed at the end of the trial, as well as follow-up urine toxicology. A series of mixed effect regression models was conducted to validate reduction in frequency of use against no reduction in use and abstinence.

- **Findings**: More participants reduced frequency of primary drug use than achieved abstinence (18.0% vs. 14.2%, respectively). Reduced use was significantly associated with decreases in craving for the primary drug [60.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 54.3%-64.7%], drug-seeking behaviors (41.0%, 95% CI = 36.6%-45.7%), and depression severity (39.9%, 95% CI).

### Can cannabis kill? Characteristics of deaths following cannabis use in England (1998–2020) [^114f27Vx]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Low credibility.

While few cannabis users (less than 10%) report using other drugs simultaneously, cannabis is the most commonly co-administered drug in polydrug use scenarios. This trend is reflected in this study, as most deaths had at least one other psychoactive drug co-detected. The rise in polydrug use demonstrated in this study is a recognized growing problem both in the United Kingdom and abroad. It may reflect the increased availability of drugs or users' attempts to manage the undesirable effects of other drugs taken. Fatal drug toxicity is a clear risk of polydrug use and is associated with other risky behaviors, such as intravenous drug use, which have clear links with an increased mortality rate.

Opioids were co-detected in the largest proportion of cases in this study. Single substance non-fatal overdoses most frequently include opioids (both heroin and non-heroin opioids), and among polydrug non-fatal overdoses, alcohol, opioids, cannabis, and cocaine feature in a large proportion of cases. In this study, cocaine co-detections had the largest increase of any co-detected substance, with 34% more cases reported in 2020 than in 2013. The purity of both powder and crack cocaine has concurrently risen in the United Kingdom, and a positive correlation between cocaine purity and emergency department visits has been observed, which may explain in part the rise in fatalities with cocaine co-detections.

Although the prevalence of alcohol and cannabis co-detections remained relatively constant over time, the concomitant use of both alcohol and cannabis.

### The potential for medicinal cannabis to help manage challenging behaviour in people with intellectual disability: A perspective review [^115X7FWy]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

Practical challenges in researching the utility of medicinal cannabis in PwID and challenging behaviour highlight several critical concerns.

- **Concerns about adverse effects**: As with all prescribed medicines, medical cannabis carries the possibility of adverse effects. A systematic review found that the most common adverse event was dizziness in short-term use and noted a scarcity of high-quality trials on long-term medical cannabis use. It was reported that cannabis is not associated with fatal overdose, with THC having a wide safety margin 750 times greater than the typical intoxicating dose. However, it is important to recognize that higher doses of THC may lead to anxiety, panic, tachycardia, and in some cases, subtle cognitive deficits such as short-term, reversible memory impairment. Although there is a known risk of inducing a psychotic episode with THC use, this rarely occurs when cannabis is the only drug used. Comparatively, CBD was found to be well-tolerated even at extremely high doses, with diarrhoea as the main side effect. The main concern with CBD is related to potential drug interactions, as it inhibits the activity of CYP450 enzymes, which can affect the metabolism of certain medications.

- **Concerns regarding dependence and withdrawal syndromes**: Another significant concern is the potential for dependence and withdrawal syndromes. A review paper found that the risk of recreational cannabis dependence occurs more commonly in those using high THC strains with daily heavy use from an early age. There remains a lack of research into the risk of dependence for prescribed medical cannabis.

CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.

- **Exacerbation of preexisting psychosis**: CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.

- **Induction of a manic episode in patients with bipolar disorder**: CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed episode in patients. Prior to initiating treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g. comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, or depression).

- **New psychotic or manic symptoms**: CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g. hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients, compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing Adderall®.

- **Long-term suppression of growth in pediatric patients**: CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in Adderall®-treated pediatric patients. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted [see PRECAUTIONS, PEDIATRIC USE].

- **Seizures**: There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients.

### Prevention of psychosis: Moving on from the at-risk mental state to universal primary prevention [^115Y6q5D]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The example of cannabis use

Use of cannabis is associated with an increased risk of psychosis. As with the initial reports 60 years ago of a causal association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer, there was initial skepticism about the idea that cannabis use increases the risk of psychosis. Critics suggested that the association is not causal, but rather due to concomitant use of other drugs, pre-existing deviant personality, or self-medication for preceding psychiatric or prodromal symptoms. One by one, these assertions have been rebutted. The risk increases with the frequency and length of use, and the potency of the cannabis used [Di Forti et al; Marconi, Di Forti, Lewis, Murray, & Vassos].

The long-term adverse effects of tobacco and alcohol track the extent of their use. Lung cancer reached epidemic proportions after cigarette smoking spread, and the frequency of alcoholic liver disease waxes and wanes in proportion to changes in population alcohol consumption. Growing evidence suggests that this is also the case for cannabis and psychosis. Boydell et al. showed that the incidence of schizophrenia doubled in London, UK, between 1965 and 1999, and attributed this in large part to the increased use of cannabis. Hjorthøj, Larsen, Starzer, and Nordentoft demonstrated that the incidence of cannabis-induced psychosis more than doubled in Denmark between 2006 and 2016. Gonçalves-Pinho, Bragança, and Freitas studied hospitalizations in Portugal with a primary diagnosis of psychotic disorder or schizophrenia in the 15 years following the decriminalization of cannabis.

### Drug-drug interactions involving classic psychedelics: A systematic review [^1111oDdU]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

In this systematic review, we observed drug-drug interactions (DDIs) at both pharmacodynamic and likely pharmacokinetic levels that may block or decrease the response to psychedelics, or alternatively, potentiate and lengthen the duration of psychological and/or physical effects. While there is strong evidence of 5-HT 2A receptor involvement in the effects of psychedelics, some research included in this review suggests that other serotonin receptors, such as 5-HT 1A/B and dopamine receptors, along with altered serotonin levels, may also modulate psychological and/or physical effects. Additionally, a small number of studies reviewed indicated a potential role of the 5-HT 1 receptor subtype in modulating the effects of DMT.

It appears that although different psychedelics may yield similar subjective effects, their pharmacological properties differ, resulting in potentially varying interaction effects when combined with other drugs. Overall, given the limited number of papers exploring DDIs associated with psychedelics and the resurgence of scientific and medical interest in these compounds, further research is needed to improve understanding of such interactions, and identify novel drug interactions and potentially serious adverse reactions not currently described in the literature.

### Traditional marijuana, high-potency cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids: Increasing risk for psychosis [^112sKBfJ]. World Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Epidemiological evidence demonstrates that cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of psychotic outcomes and confirms a dose-response relationship between the level of use and the risk of later psychosis. High-potency cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids carry the greatest risk. Experimental administration of tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient of cannabis, induces transient psychosis in normal subjects, but this effect can be ameliorated by co-administration of cannabidiol. This latter is a constituent of traditional hashish but is largely absent from modern high-potency forms of cannabis.

Argument continues over the extent to which genetic predisposition is correlated to, or interacts with, cannabis use, and what proportion of psychosis could be prevented by minimizing heavy use. As yet, there is not convincing evidence that cannabis use increases the risk of other psychiatric disorders, but there are no such doubts concerning its detrimental effect on cognitive function. All of the negative aspects are magnified if use starts in early adolescence. Irrespective of whether the use of cannabis is decriminalized or legalized, the evidence that it is a component cause of psychosis is now sufficient for public health messages outlining the risk, especially of regular use of high-potency cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids.

### Cannabis and neuropsychiatry, 2: The longitudinal risk of psychosis as an adverse outcome [^113ekfr8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Psychosis is one of the most serious adverse effects associated with cannabis use. The association between cannabis use and psychosis has been explored in a series of recent meta-analyses. The results of these meta-analyses show that individuals who develop psychosis experience its onset about 2–3 years earlier if they are cannabis users; this effect is not observed with alcohol or other substance use. Higher levels of cannabis use are associated with a greater risk of psychosis. Cannabis abuse or dependence, but not past use or lower levels of use, increases the risk of transition into psychosis in persons at ultra-high risk. About a third of patients with first-episode psychosis are cannabis users; at follow-up, about half of these users continue their cannabis use. Continued cannabis use in those treated after developing psychosis is associated with a higher risk of relapse, while discontinuation reduces the risk of relapse to that of nonusers.

Finally, persons with psychosis who continue to use cannabis exhibit more severe positive symptoms and poorer levels of functioning. Experimental studies in humans show that cannabinoids and cannabis can induce psychotic symptoms, suggesting that epidemiologic data indicate a causal effect of cannabis in anticipating, triggering, or exacerbating psychosis in vulnerable individuals and in worsening the course and outcome of the illness in those who continue to use the substance.

### Prescribing stimulants for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and co-occurring cannabis use: Considerations for managing a clinical dilemma [^114s1MuR]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent in the pediatric population, with 11% of children and adolescents having ever been diagnosed with the disorder. The management of ADHD in the setting of co-occurring cannabis use, which is more prevalent in adolescents with ADHD than in the general population, is an increasingly common dilemma facing clinicians. This is in part due to recent changes in social acceptability, access, usage, and state-level legal status of cannabis.

Clinicians face several considerations, including:

- **Confounding effects**: The confounding effects of cannabis use on assessment and management of ADHD symptoms need to be carefully evaluated.

- **Potential reduction of risk**: When ADHD symptoms are well managed, there may be a potential reduction in the risk of substance use.

- **Increased risk of misuse**: There is an increased risk of misuse and diversion of stimulants in patients with ongoing cannabis use.

### Adderall [^113DcmAm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening reaction that may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. Such drugs include monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort. The coadministration with cytochrome P450 (CYP2D6) inhibitors increases the risk, leading to heightened exposure to Adderall®. In such situations, consider using an alternative non-serotonergic drug or a drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6.

Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g. tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

Concomitant use of Adderall® with MAOI drugs is contraindicated. Discontinue treatment with Adderall® and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If the concomitant use of Adderall® with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors is clinically warranted, begin Adderall® at lower doses, monitor patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome symptoms, and adjust treatment accordingly.

### Continued cannabis use and risk of incidence and persistence of psychotic symptoms: 10 year follow-up cohort study [^112b9ARD]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Another issue is the mechanism by which cannabis might increase the risk of psychotic symptoms, particularly whether it might increase the risk by causing persistence of normally transitory developmental expression of psychotic experiences. For most individuals, subclinical expression of psychotic phenomena (that is, expression of psychosis below the level required for a clinical diagnosis) is transitory and never progresses to psychotic illness. Subthreshold psychotic experiences could, however, become abnormally persistent, depending on the degree of additional exposure to environmental risk factors, and progressively greater levels of persistence might be associated with a greater risk for transition to clinical psychotic disorder.

Spauwen and colleagues showed that the persistence rate of psychotic experiences was much higher for individuals growing up in an urban rather than a rural environment. Similarly, Cougnard and co-workers provided evidence that childhood trauma, urban environment, and cannabis act additively in increasing the risk of persistence of psychotic experiences. The fact that cannabis use increases risk of psychosis in a dose-response fashion and that patients with psychosis who continue to use cannabis show more severe and persistent symptoms suggests that cannabis use might increase the risk for psychotic illness by impacting on the persistence rate of psychotic experiences that under normal circumstances (that is, without exposure to cannabis) would have remained transitory phenomena for most people.

**Warning: Risks from concomitant use with opioids, abuse, misuse, and addiction, and dependence and withdrawal reactions**: The co-administration of Restoril with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. The medication's potential for abuse and misuse is significant, requiring vigilance in monitoring. Long-term use can lead to physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms if abruptly discontinued. It is crucial for healthcare providers to evaluate each patient's risk factors for these potential adverse effects before prescribing Restoril.

### Onfi [^117GNDxA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warning: Risks from concomitant use with opioids; abuse, misuse, and addiction; and dependence and withdrawal reactions**: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required, and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Use of benzodiazepines, including Onfi, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing Onfi and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

The continued use of benzodiazepines, including Onfi, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of Onfi after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue Onfi or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Dependence symptoms in young cannabis users? A prospective epidemiological study [^113Hz6G7]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to examine the profile of cannabis dependence and the risk of specific dependence criteria over a 4-year period in a community sample of adolescents.

- **Methods**: A representative community sample of 2,446 young adults aged 14–24 years at baseline was followed up over 4 years. Frequency of use measures and criteria for DSM-IV dependence were assessed using standardized diagnostic interview measures (CIDI). To explore the nature of this association, frequency of use and concomitant use of other psychoactive substances were considered.

- **Results**: Thirty percent of the sample were cannabis users. Among them, 35% met at least one dependence criterion. The most frequently reported dependence criteria were withdrawal (17%), tolerance (15%), loss of control (14%), and continued use despite a health problem (13%). Even without the concomitant use of other illicit drugs, 22% of low frequency users and 81% of high frequency users met at least one dependence criterion. Symptom patterns were similar in both high and low frequency users. The occurrence of a dependence syndrome or specific dependence criteria could not be attributed to the use of other illicit drugs or to comorbid nicotine and alcohol dependence.

- **Conclusions**: Regular cannabis use in adolescence is associated with the development of a dependence syndrome. This association cannot be explained by the concomitant use of other illicit substances or by comorbid nicotine and alcohol dependence.

### Adderall [^111AyoaD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adderall® has a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of Adderall® exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Adderall® can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution [see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Abuse]. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including Adderall®, can result in overdose and death [see OVERDOSAGE], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

Before prescribing Adderall®, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and the proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store amphetamine sulfate in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct them not to give Adderall® to anyone else. Throughout Adderall® treatment, reassess each patient's risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction, and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction.

- **Risks to patients with serious cardiac disease**: Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who were treated with CNS stimulant treatment at the recommended ADHD dosages. Avoid Adderall® use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease.

- **Increased blood pressure and heart rate**: CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure and heart rate.

### Efficacy of cannabidiol alone or in combination with Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol for the management of substance use disorders: An umbrella review of the evidence [^112TcZfQ]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

The misuse of psychoactive substances, including alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, can have a broad range of consequences that affect an individual's physical health, mental well-being, as well as societal functioning. The 2022 European Union Drugs Agency (EUDA) report estimated that nearly 83.4 million Europeans reported having used an illicit drug at least once in their lifetime, and 22.2 million reported having used cannabis in the last year. In 2018, the Global Burden Study (GBD) estimated that 1.5% of the overall global burden of disease was attributable to substance use disorders (SUDs). Furthermore, in 2019, the GBD highlighted a significant rise in deaths because of SUDs over the past decade. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 35 million people suffer from SUDs. Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) were the most prevalent of all SUDs in 2016, with an estimated 100.4 million cases. The most common SUDs were cannabis dependence (22.1 million cases) and opioid dependence (26.8 million cases). For illicit drugs, the estimated number of users increased by 23% from 2011 to 2021, partly because of population growth.

Affecting individuals' brain and behavior, SUDs are chronic and relapsing conditions characterized by an uncontrollable use of psychoactive substances classified into 10 distinct classes, among which alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and opioids are predominant. SUDs may co-occur with physical and mental health conditions, leading to negative health and social outcomes. Consequently, various pharmacotherapies have been developed.

### The acute effects of cannabis with and without cannabidiol in adults and adolescents: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover experiment [^113DsMiA]. Addiction (2023). High credibility.

Long-term harms of cannabis may be exacerbated in adolescence, but little is known about the acute effects of cannabis in adolescents. We aimed to (i) compare the acute effects of cannabis in adolescent and adult cannabis users and (ii) determine if cannabidiol (CBD) acutely modulates the effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

- **Design**: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover experiment. The experiment was registered as NCT04851392.

- **Setting**: Laboratory in London, United Kingdom.

- **Participants**: Twenty-four adolescents (12 women, aged 16 to 17) and 24 adults (12 women, aged 26 to 29) who used cannabis 0.5–3 days per week and were matched on cannabis use frequency (mean = 1.5 days/week).

- **Intervention**: We administered three weight-adjusted vaporised cannabis flower preparations: 'THC' (8 mg THC for a 75 kg person); 'THC + CBD' (8 mg THC and 24 mg CBD for a 75 kg person); and 'PLA' (matched placebo).

- **Measurements**: Primary outcomes were (i) subjective 'feel drug effect'; (ii) verbal episodic memory (delayed prose recall); and (iii) psychotomimetic effect (Psychotomimetic States Inventory).

- **Findings**: Compared with 'PLA', 'THC' and 'THC + CBD' significantly (P < 0.001) increased 'feel drug effect' (mean difference [MD] = 6.3, 95% CI = 5.3–7.2; MD = 6.8, 95% CI = 6.0–7.7), impaired verbal episodic memory (MD = –2.7, 95% CI = −4.1 to −1.4; MD = −2.9, 95% CI = −4.1 to −1.7), and increased psychotomimetic effects (MD = 7.8, 95% CI = 2.8–12.7; MD = 10.8, 95% CI = 6.2–15.4). There was no evidence that adolescents differed from adults.

Stimulant-related disorders (SRD) continue to be an important public health problem for which there are presently no approved pharmacotherapies. Although behavioral interventions provide some benefit, the response varies. The development of novel and effective pharmacotherapies continues to be a research priority. Understanding neural mechanisms critical to the action of stimulants has helped reveal several potential pharmacotherapies that have already shown promise in controlled clinical trials. Common to some of these medications is the ability to reverse neural deficits in individuals with SRD. Results from thoroughly conducted clinical trials continue to broaden our knowledge, increasing the possibility of soon developing effective pharmacotherapies for SRD.

### Amphetamine, past and present — a pharmacological and clinical perspective [^116dWLbG]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

The primary action of amphetamine is to increase synaptic concentrations of monoamine neurotransmitters, thereby indirectly enhancing noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in the CNS. Although amphetamine's isomers are also powerful 5-HT-releasing agents in vivo, this action does not appear to contribute to their efficacy in treating ADHD. This opinion is based on clinical experience with fenfluramine, which is a chemical analogue of amphetamine and a powerful releasing agent with a preferential action on 5-HT. Reports indicate that fenfluramine was not effective in treating the disruptive and overactive behaviors in ADHD, nor did it ameliorate the conduct disorder present in about half of the subjects. However, it is possible that amphetamine's action to increase serotonergic drive may have a beneficial effect on anxiety or depression that is often comorbid with ADHD.

Thus, enhanced catecholaminergic signaling is the primary mediator of amphetamine's efficacy in ADHD and narcolepsy. On the negative side, the same pharmacology is also responsible for amphetamine's major side effects and its liability for recreational abuse. Therefore, optimizing therapeutic efficacy while simultaneously maintaining side effects at an acceptable level requires a careful balance and dose titration in the patient.

Outcomes

Amphetamine use disorder, CAD, cocaine use disorder, and OUD included asymptomatic cases (i.e. in people with substance use disorders who experienced no disability due to their disorder) and mild and severe dependence disorders for each substance. In a comparative risk assessment, GBD 2019 also quantified the burden due to amphetamine use disorder, CAD, cocaine use disorder, and OUD as risk factors for other health outcomes. Literature reviews were used to estimate relative risks for drug use as a risk factor for different health effects (e.g. infectious diseases, suicide, or mental disorders). The appendix (p. 11) shows drug-dependence sequelae, health states, health-state lay descriptions, and global disability weightings.

To measure population-attributable fractions, we used estimates of relative risk with a Bayesian meta-regression model exposure prevalence. To calculate the attributable burden, these fractions were multiplied by related cause-specific DALYs. The US National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions data were used as the gold-standard data to calculate the percentage of asymptomatic cases for each substance use disorder. Using these ratios, a mean disability weighting was calculated for each condition across the severity range, with a disability weighting of 0 for asymptomatic patients.

GBD 2019 estimated each epidemiological quantity of interest — incidence, prevalence, mortality, YLD, YLL, and DALYs — for males, females, and for sexes combined. The GBD diseases and injuries analytical framework generated estimates for every year from 1990 to 201.

### Individual and combined effects of cannabidiol and Δ-tetrahydrocannabinol on striato-cortical connectivity in the human brain [^1165dzVW]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Low credibility.

Cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the two major constituents of cannabis with contrasting mechanisms of action. THC is the major psychoactive, addiction-promoting, and psychotomimetic compound, while CBD may have opposite effects. The brain effects of these drugs alone and in combination are poorly understood. In particular, the striatum is implicated in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders, but it is unclear how THC and CBD influence striato-cortical connectivity.

- **Aims**: To examine effects of THC, CBD, and THC+CBD on functional connectivity of striatal sub-divisions (associative, limbic, and sensorimotor).

- **Method**: Resting-state Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was used across two within-subjects, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, with a unified analysis approach.

- **Results**: Study 1 (N = 17; inhaled cannabis containing 8 mg THC, 8 mg THC+10 mg CBD or placebo) showed strong disruptive effects of both THC and THC+CBD on connectivity in the associative and sensorimotor networks, but a specific effect of THC in the limbic striatum network which was not present in the THC+CBD condition. In Study 2 (N = 23, oral 600 mg CBD, placebo), CBD increased connectivity in the associative network, but produced only relatively minor disruptions in the limbic and sensorimotor networks.

- **Outcomes**: THC strongly disrupts striato-cortical networks, but this effect is mitigated by co-administration of CBD in the limbic striatum network. Oral CBD administered has a more complex effect profile of relative increases and decreases.

### Who are the new amphetamine users? A 10-year prospective study of young Australians [^117Lk134]. Addiction (2007). Low credibility.

Despite good evidence of increased availability and use of amphetamines worldwide, relatively little is known about the epidemiology of young adult amphetamine use; relationships with social functioning, other drug use, and mental health at this age; nor of the adolescent predictors of such use. We examined these issues using a representative cohort of young people followed up in Victoria, Australia.

A stratified, random sample of 1,943 adolescents was recruited from secondary schools across Victoria at age 14–15 years. This cohort was interviewed on eight occasions until the age of 24–25 years, achieving a 78% follow-up rate at that age. Cross-sectional and predictive associations were assessed using logistic regression.

At age 24 years, 12% of the sample had used amphetamines in the past year, with 1–2% using them at least weekly. Young adult amphetamine use was strongly predicted by adolescent drug use and was robustly associated with other drug use and dependence in young adulthood. These associations were stronger for more frequent users. Among young adults who had not been using amphetamines at age 20 years, the strongest predictor of use at age 24 years was the use of other drugs, particularly cannabis, at age 20 years. Psychological distress did not independently predict an increased likelihood of amphetamine use in this cohort.

Young people in Australia using amphetamines at age 24 are highly likely to be significant polydrug users. The risks for both the initiation of young adult amphetamine use and the maintenance of such use pertain to the heavy use of other substances.

### Cannabis use in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): A scoping review [^111uWuWb]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2023). Low credibility.

Treatments for adult ADHD include stimulants, two non-stimulant medications, as well as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). These pharmacological agents are often associated with side effects, contributing to poor treatment adherence. Patients with ADHD have regularly stated that cannabis has helped improve their ADHD symptoms; however, scientific literature describing the effects of cannabis on symptoms of ADHD is scarce.

- **Methods**: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMCARE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov. The searches included all publications in English up to June 27, 2022. We included both experimental and observational studies that assessed the effect of cannabis on ADHD symptomatology and neuropsychiatric outcomes. To synthesize our understanding of the potential effects of cannabis use on ADHD symptoms and pathophysiology, and the effects of ADHD on cannabis use, data was extracted from each study regarding the characteristics of its population, methods used to assess both cannabis consumption and ADHD symptoms, and key findings.

- **Results**: Our scoping review included a total of 39 studies. Only one study employed a randomized and placebo-controlled design to directly measure the effect of cannabis on ADHD, and no significant effect was observed for the study's primary outcome, the QbTest (Est = -0.17, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.07, p = 0.16). Most of the literature consists of cross-sectional studies that evaluate the association between ADHD severity and cannabis use. Fifteen studies addressed the neuropsychiatric outcomes related to cannabis use in individuals with ADHD.

### Adverse effects of heavy cannabis use: Even plants can harm the brain [^114REff3]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

There is a noted potential for heavy cannabis use to negatively impact brain health.

- **Cannabis and brain health**: Extensive use of cannabis can lead to various adverse effects. The observed impacts are significant and warrant further study to understand the mechanisms involved and the long-term consequences on cognitive function and overall brain health.

- **Conflict of interest statement**: M. Di Forti reports personal fees from Janssen, outside the submitted work. The remaining authors have no conflict of interest to declare.

### Novel psychoactive substances: A novel clinical challenge [^111b9wuq]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

The recreational use of novel psychoactive substances in the UK has increased markedly within the last decade. The variety of new substances synthesized and sold as 'legal', often under the pretense of being 'plant food' or 'bath salts', is similarly increasing. This presents challenges to clinicians: they may be unaware of these substances or unable to identify them and their potential for complications and drug interactions. This case describes a patient who ingested a novel psychoactive substance and presented with severe agitation following a delay of several days. He experienced renal, hepatic, and neurological complications requiring critical care input. Our case adds to the repertoire of knowledge regarding the effects of ingestion of novel cathinones.

### Adderall XR [^113mxA7j]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Psychiatric adverse reactions**:

	- **Exacerbation of pre-existing psychosis**: Administration of stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with pre-existing psychotic disorders.

	- **Induction of a manic episode in patients with bipolar disease**: CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed episode in patients. Prior to initiating Adderall XR treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g. comorbid or history of depressive symptoms, or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, or depression).

	- **New psychotic or manic symptoms**: CNS stimulants, at the recommended dosage, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g. hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing Adderall XR.

- **Long-term suppression of growth in pediatric patients**: CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in Adderall XR-treated pediatric patients.

	- In a controlled trial of Adderall XR in adolescents, mean weight change from baseline within the initial 4 weeks of therapy was -1.1 lbs. and -2.8 lbs., respectively, for patients receiving 10 and 20 mg Adderall XR.

### The acute effects of cannabis with and without cannabidiol in adults and adolescents: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover experiment [^114ELk34]. Addiction (2023). High credibility.

Cannabis is the most commonly used internationally controlled drug in the world and is particularly popular among adolescents. Between 15% and 20% of English 15-year-olds and 28% of American 15- to 16-year-olds report using cannabis in the last year. Globally, roughly half of those who try cannabis do so at 18.5 years or younger. Adolescents are approximately three times more likely than adults to develop cannabis addiction in the years immediately after initiating cannabis use. Meanwhile, cannabis laws are rapidly evolving across the world, which is likely to have profound impacts on young people. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to understand the acute psychopharmacological effects of cannabis in teenagers.

Adolescence is a period during which important biological, neural, psychological, social, and personal changes occur. Crucially, the endocannabinoid (eCB) system continues to develop, with changing levels of cannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoids. It is also a time when mental health problems typically begin to emerge, with 14 years being the average age of onset of mental illness. In epidemiological studies, long-term cannabis use in adolescence has been associated with an increased likelihood of psychosis, mood disorders, and poorer cognitive function and educational achievement. Therefore, there is concern that the potential harms of cannabis use may be accentuated in adolescents who are at a critical neurodevelopmental stage. However, the acute effects of cannabis intoxication in adolescents have rarely been studied in controlled settings.

### Adderall [^115Y3mhB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of Adderall® and other serotonergic drugs, including SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, St. John's Wort, and with drugs that impair the metabolism of serotonin (in particular MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and others such as linezolid) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome.

- **Motor and verbal tics, and worsening of Tourette's syndrome**: Advise patients that motor and verbal tics, and worsening of Tourette's Syndrome, may occur during treatment with Adderall®. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette's syndrome occurs [see WARNINGS].

- **MAO inhibitors**: Concomitant use of MAOIs and CNS stimulants can cause a hypertensive crisis. Potential outcomes include death, stroke, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, ophthalmological complications, eclampsia, pulmonary edema, and renal failure. Do not administer Adderall® concomitantly or within 14 days after discontinuing MAOI [see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS].

- **Serotonergic drugs**: The concomitant use of Adderall® and serotonergic drugs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Initiate with lower doses and monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during Adderall® initiation or dosage increase.

### Are cannabis-using and non-using patients different groups? Towards understanding the neurobiology of cannabis use in psychotic disorders [^113GiUHh]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Most work on understanding the phytocannabinoid–psychosis interaction has focused on the CB1 receptor due to its widespread distribution in the brain and implication in psychotomimetic mechanisms and risk. The CB1 receptor is believed to be the most widely distributed G-protein coupled receptor in the brain, with CB1 receptors distributed throughout the neocortical (cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, secondary somatosensory), hippocampal, amygdalar, cerebellar, and basal ganglia areas. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychotomimetic constituent of cannabis, acts as a partial CB1 receptor agonist, with administration of THC leading to altered activation in a wide range of frontal (anterior cingulate, right inferior frontal gyri), parietal, and limbic areas (midbrain, mediotemporal, and ventro-striatal).

Increased potency of CB1 receptor agonism, either through increased THC potency or through full agonism of the CB1 receptor with synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists, has been noted to be associated with increased risk of developing psychosis and a more protracted course. In contrast, CBD has been demonstrated to oppose the actions of THC, is less well understood, and is believed to act through a wide variety of actions including the antagonism of THC effects on the cannabinoid type 1 receptor, CB1 receptor inverse agonism, FAAH inhibition, and 5HT1A activation. Particular interest has centered on cannabidiol as a potential treatment for psychosis, with one double-blind randomized controlled study showing non-inferiority to amisulpride.

### Cannabidiol interactions with medications, illicit substances, and alcohol: a comprehensive review [^115wQEHG]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Cannabidiol, a non-intoxicating phytocannabinoid, has potential therapeutic effects over a broad range of disorders. Recently, there has been increased interest in CBD, as several studies showed promising anticonvulsant efficacy with few side effects. In 2018, a CBD-based oral solution, Epidiolex®, was approved by the FDA to treat two severe forms of pediatric epilepsy, Dravet syndrome, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Although only these two syndromes are recognized indications for CBD, it has been consumed in an unregulated fashion for a variety of indications, including chronic pain, muscle stiffness, inflammation, anxiety, smoking cessation, and even cancer.

While CBD legislation in the United States is confusing due to differences in state and federal laws, CBD has proliferated in the US market in several forms, such as CBD oil or capsules, hemp oil/extract, and also as an ingredient in several dietary supplements, syrups, teas, and creams. With the ever-increasing use of CBD and its widespread availability to the general public, it is important to examine and report on possible drug-drug interactions between CBD and other therapeutic agents, as well as addictive substances such as alcohol and tobacco. A detailed literature search for CBD's possible interactions was conducted using online databases.

As expected, CBD has been reported to interact with anti-epileptic drugs, antidepressants, opioid analgesics, and THC, but surprisingly, it interacts with several other common medications, e.g. acetaminophen, and substances including alcohol. This review provides a comprehensive list of these interactions.

### Cannabis and psychosis: Are we any closer to understanding the relationship [^114UaHSd]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2016, demonstrating its status as the most popular drug globally after alcohol and tobacco. As with all drugs, there are risks associated with its use; some risk is due to the substance, and some will depend on the regulatory status of the drug in the local jurisdiction where the individual resides. One risk of using cannabis continues to attract significant attention, namely the risk of developing psychosis. Distinguishing between causation and correlation on this issue has proved to be a challenge. However, it is critical to understand how risks, such as developing psychosis and schizophrenia for those exposed to cannabis, unfold. This knowledge could be used to reduce harm and more effectively target scarce public health resources to high-risk groups.

Scholars and clinicians have been aware of a link between cannabis and schizophrenia for over a century. However, it wasn't until cannabis use became popular in western countries during the 1960s that researchers began to investigate the nature of the relationship. The seminal observational study by Andreasson and colleagues set the research agenda on this topic, reporting that cannabis was an independent risk factor for schizophrenia, with 6% of heavy cannabis users going on to develop schizophrenia.

### Methamphetamine hydrochloride [^1125MyMh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).

Amphetamines and amphetamine derivatives are known to be metabolized, to some degree, by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and display minor inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). The potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction exists with the co-administration of CYP2D6 inhibitors, which may increase the risk with increased exposure to methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets. In these situations, consider an alternative nonserotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).

- **Symptoms of serotonin syndrome**: Mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g. tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

Concomitant use of methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets with MAOI drugs is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Discontinue treatment with methamphetamine hydrochloride if serotonin syndrome occurs.

### Co-occurrence of substance-related and other mental health disorders among adolescent cannabis users [^113rXiLK]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance in the United States and is increasingly being legalized throughout the country. Many believe that cannabis is relatively harmless, and some believe that cannabis is not addictive. We wondered about the rates of cannabis abuse and dependence among adolescents referred for substance use evaluations and the incidence of co-occurring psychiatric illnesses and other substance use disorders among these individuals.

- **Methods**: Herein, we analyze intake data from 483 adolescents referred for evaluation at an adolescent substance abuse clinic, with information gleaned from both the adolescents and their parents or caregivers.

- **Results**: Forty-seven percent of our sample met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) criteria for cannabis dependence, and another 32% for cannabis abuse. Among adolescents with cannabis use disorders, the co-occurrence of alcohol and opioid abuse or dependence was high. These individuals also suffered from significant psychiatric comorbidities otherwise.

- **Conclusions**: Our results show that cannabis use carries the risk of dependence and significant risk of comorbidities, both with respect to other substance use disorders and other psychiatric illnesses. Given the growing body of research linking cannabis use with addiction and other psychiatric illnesses, public health efforts ought to center on the potential dangers of cannabis use.

### Risk factors for methamphetamine use in youth: A systematic review [^112SNZrg]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Methamphetamine (MA) is a potent stimulant that is readily available, with effects similar to cocaine but associated with increased acute and chronic toxicities. The objective of this systematic review was to identify and synthesize literature on risk factors associated with MA use among youth. More than 40 electronic databases, websites, and key journals/meeting abstracts were searched. Studies included in the review compared children and adolescents (≤ 18 years) who used MA to those who did not. One reviewer extracted the data, and a second checked for completeness and accuracy.

For discrete risk factors, odds ratios (OR) were calculated, and when appropriate, a pooled OR with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated. For continuous risk factors, mean difference and 95% CI were calculated, and when appropriate, a weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI were calculated. Results were presented separately by comparison group: low-risk (no previous drug abuse) and high-risk children (reported previous drug abuse or were recruited from a juvenile detention center).

- **Results**: Twelve studies were included. Among low-risk youth, factors associated with MA use were history of heroin/opiate use (OR = 29.3; 95% CI: 9.8–87.8), family history of drug use (OR = 4.7; 95% CI: 2.8–7.9), risky sexual behavior (OR = 2.79; 95% CI: 2.25–3.46), and some psychiatric disorders. History of alcohol use and smoking were also significantly associated with MA use. Among high-risk youth, factors associated with MA use included family history of crime.

### Adverse ocular impact and emerging therapeutic potential of cannabis and cannabinoids: A narrative review [^112CveG2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

The psychoactive cannabinoid, THC, produces many of the adverse effects of cannabis, while the non-psychoactive CBD is credited for its therapeutic effects. Non-medical cannabinoid products have differences in their relative concentrations of CBD and THC. Retailers who sell cannabinoids are not subject to the same strict regulations as medical prescriptions. CBD preparations of these products are often inaccurate, with CBD and THC concentrations often mislabeled. Individuals who use cannabis for self-medication report treating pain, anxiety, depression, headache/migraine, nausea, and muscle spasticity. The CBD concentrations from retail products are often lower than those used in clinical trials and may even contain THC levels that exceed legal limits. Meanwhile, medical-grade cannabinoids, both synthetic and plant-derived, have more accurate concentrations of THC and CBD. Plant-derived or synthetic CBD have no pharmacological differences when tested in vitro.

Information on cannabinoid drug interactions is scarce, which raises safety concerns. The mechanisms of these drug interactions include CBD's inhibition of drug transport, enzyme inhibition, and enzyme induction. Cannabis and cannabinoids can have adverse psychiatric effects, such as the increased risk of psychotic disorders, anxiety or panic attacks in naïve users, structural and functional alterations to the brain, mood disturbances and depression, and risks of lung cancer when smoked. Consequently, medical cannabis is contraindicated in patients with unstable cardiovascular or respiratory disease.

### Cannabis and cannabinoids: Kinetics and interactions [^112yXE2V]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Cannabis sativa and related products are widely used, but their potential to cause significant clinical interactions remains unclear, particularly for cannabinoid-enriched or otherwise concentrated products. The pharmacokinetics of most cannabis products is not well understood. Where information is available, there is considerable variation. Extrapolating limited clinical data is complicated by the complexity and variability of cannabis products, as well as their delivery through various routes of administration. In vitro evidence shows that the major cannabinoids are substrates for numerous metabolic enzymes, including the cytochrome P450 metabolizing enzymes.

While many consumers consider cannabis products to be safer than alternative prescription or narcotic drugs, clinical reports of cannabis-related drug interactions and adverse events are increasing in frequency. Patients using these products, whether for medical or nonmedical purposes, together with conventional therapeutic agents, may be at increased risk of adverse events, including therapeutic failure, and require enhanced monitoring.
