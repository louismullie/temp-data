## Question

Oral dose for keppra

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the oral dosing of Keppra (levetiracetam). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication and age group because dosing differs by seizure type and patient age. Then, I should verify the standard adult dosing, titration, and maximum. Next, I will review pediatric weight-based dosing by age band and formulation considerations. After that, I need to check renal impairment adjustments and whether liver disease changes dosing. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like switching from IV to oral, extended-release options, and what to do if a dose is missed, and I will close with a concise dosing summary that aligns with FDA labeling and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why dosing varies. Levetiracetam is used for partial-onset seizures, myoclonic seizures in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and dosing is both indication- and age-specific, with pediatric regimens weight-based and adult regimens typically fixed at 1000–3000 mg/day in divided doses, so I need to ensure I anchor the dose to the indication and age before proceeding [^fc926133] [^0b1d97ac].

> For adults 16 years and older with partial-onset seizures, I should confirm the standard start and titration. The recommended initial dose is 1000 mg/day given as 500 mg twice daily, with increases of 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to a typical target of 3000 mg/day; importantly, there is no evidence that doses above 3000 mg/day add benefit, so I should not exceed that in routine practice unless there is a compelling, individualized rationale and close monitoring [^fc926133] [^e86b6c26].

> Wait, let me verify the myoclonic and primary generalized tonic-clonic adult dosing because I initially thought they might differ. Hold on, I should verify the FDA language. For both juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults, the labeled dosing mirrors partial-onset seizures: start 1000 mg/day in two divided doses and titrate by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to 3000 mg/day, so my initial thought that JME might start lower was incorrect; the adult regimen is the same across these indications [^fc926133] [^0b1d97ac].

> Next, I should review pediatric dosing by age, and I need to be precise about weight-based targets. For infants 1 month to less than 6 months, start 14 mg/kg/day divided twice daily and titrate by 14 mg/kg every 2 weeks to 42 mg/kg/day; for children 6 months to less than 4 years, start 20 mg/kg/day divided twice daily and titrate to 50 mg/kg/day; for children 4 years to less than 16 years, start 20 mg/kg/day and titrate to 60 mg/kg/day, with a hard cap of 3000 mg/day regardless of weight; I should double-check that cap, and yes, it is explicitly stated in the label [^fc926133] [^7339b149].

> I need to ensure formulation guidance is clear. For pediatric patients weighing 20 kg or less, the oral solution is preferred for accurate weight-based dosing; for those above 20 kg, tablets or solution may be used, but I should still individualize based on swallowing and precision needs, and I should remember that the solution concentration is 100 mg/mL to facilitate calculations [^7339b149] [^fb559e4a].

> Now, renal impairment adjustments are critical because levetiracetam is renally cleared. I should confirm the adult adjustments: for creatinine clearance 50–80 mL/min, max 1000 mg twice daily; for CrCl 30–50 mL/min, max 750 mg twice daily; for CrCl < 30 mL/min, max 500 mg twice daily; for intermittent hemodialysis, 250–500 mg daily with a supplemental 250–500 mg dose after each session; for peritoneal dialysis, 250–500 mg daily; for continuous renal replacement therapy, 750–1000 mg twice daily; I should double-check that these align with both oral and IV labeling, and they do [^3309b0b8] [^3f2b9f71] [^fa5a1879] [^202188ad] [^d18a0f82] [^0271edc9] [^68c6d5e5] [^df55b880] [^4a20d798] [^777de135].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about hepatic impairment. I should confirm whether dose changes are needed. Levetiracetam is minimally hepatically metabolized, so no dose adjustment is required in chronic liver disease, which simplifies use in cirrhosis or hepatic dysfunction compared with enzyme-inducing AEDs [^9b02ced8] [^5c8aab03].

> I will now examine switching between oral and IV formulations. The total daily dose and frequency should be equivalent when converting in either direction, and bioequivalence between oral and IV formulations supports a 1:1 conversion; this is particularly useful in inpatient or ICU settings where enteral access may be intermittent [^0b1d97ac] [^2af7c9b6] [^54a2e557].

> Let me consider extended-release options. For adults who prefer once-daily dosing, levetiracetam ER 1000–3000 mg daily is effective, with 1000 mg daily as a common starting point; I should confirm that the efficacy claim is supported by a randomized trial, and yes, a placebo-controlled study showed a 46.1% median reduction in weekly partial-onset seizures versus 33.4% with placebo, with comparable exposure to immediate-release when normalized [^a843f1bc] [^22b365be].

> But wait, what if a dose is missed? I should review practical guidance. If a dose is remembered within about 2 hours, taking the full missed dose is reasonable; if more than 2 hours have passed, modeling suggests taking half the missed dose to avoid large fluctuations, though clinical judgment and seizure risk should guide the choice; I should emphasize that abrupt discontinuation increases seizure risk, so tapering is preferred when stopping therapy [^98a021db] [^823669f0].

> I should double-check special populations and safety signals. In older adults, reduced renal clearance increases exposure, so starting at the low end and titrating cautiously is prudent; behavioral adverse effects, including irritability and aggression, are more common in children and warrant screening and counseling, with dose reduction or discontinuation if significant; pregnancy can lower levetiracetam levels, so therapeutic drug monitoring may be considered in that context [^46c322f8] [^c8623459] [^46c322f8].

> Let me synthesize a concise, indication-aware summary to ensure nothing is missing. Adults 16 years and older: start 500 mg twice daily, titrate by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to 3000 mg/day for partial-onset, myoclonic, or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures; do not exceed 3000 mg/day routinely. Pediatrics: use weight-based dosing by age band with targets of 42 mg/kg/day for 1–6 months, 50 mg/kg/day for 6 months–4 years, and 60 mg/kg/day for 4–16 years, all capped at 3000 mg/day, and prefer solution for ≤ 20 kg. Adjust dose for renal function as above. No hepatic adjustment. Oral and IV are interchangeable 1:1. Consider ER for once-daily adherence. And manage missed doses thoughtfully to avoid abrupt changes [^fc926133] [^7339b149] [^3309b0b8] [^0b1d97ac] [^a843f1bc] [^98a021db].

2.3 Dosing for Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

Adults 16 Years of Age and Older

Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase dosage by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been adequately studied.

Pediatric Patients 6 to < 16 Years of Age

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg (10 mg/kg twice daily) to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). The effectiveness of doses lower than 60 mg/kg/day has not been adequately studied.

2.4 Switching from Oral Dosing

When switching from oral KEPPRA, the initial total daily intravenous dosage of KEPPRA should be equivalent to the total daily dosage and frequency of oral KEPPRA.

2.5 Switching to Oral Dosing

At the end of the intravenous treatment period, the patient may be switched to KEPPRA oral administration at the equivalent daily dosage and frequency of the intravenous administration.

Additional dosing increments may be given (1000 mg/day additional every 2 weeks) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. There is no evidence that doses greater than 3000 mg/day confer additional benefit.

Pediatric Patients

1 Month to < 6 Months

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 14 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (7 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 14 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 42 mg/kg (21 mg/kg twice daily). In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 35 mg/kg in this age group.

6 Months to < 4 Years

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose in 2 weeks by an increment of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 50 mg/kg (25 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 47 mg/kg in this age group.

4 Years to < 16 Years

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 60 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 44 mg/kg. The maximum daily dose was 3000 mg/day.

2.2 Dosing for Myoclonic Seizures in Patients with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase the dosage by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been studied.

Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 4 Years of Age

Study 5 was a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial seizures, uncontrolled by standard epileptic drugs (AEDs). Study 5 was conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe. Study 5 consisted of a 5-day evaluation period, which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Eligible patients who experienced, on a stable dose of 1–2 AEDs, at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either KEPPRA or placebo. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows: 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N = 4 treated with KEPPRA), 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N = 8 treated with KEPPRA), 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N = 20 treated with KEPPRA), and 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N = 28 treated with KEPPRA). KEPPRA dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of efficacy was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in average daily partial-onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central reader using a 48-hour video EEG performed during the last two days of the 4-day maintenance period. The enrolled population included 116 patients (KEPPRA N = 60, placebo N = 56) with refractory partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. A total of 109 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A statistically significant difference between KEPPRA and placebo was observed in Study 5 (see Figure 5). The treatment effect associated with KEPPRA was consistent across age groups.

Overview

Levetiracetam is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. Levetiracetam injection and tablets are bioequivalent. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are linear and time-invariant, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Levetiracetam is not significantly protein-bound (< 10% bound) and its volume of distribution is close to the volume of intracellular and extracellular water. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the dose is renally excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathway of levetiracetam (24% of dose) is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. It is not liver cytochrome P450 dependent. The metabolites have no known pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. Plasma half-life of levetiracetam across studies is approximately 6–8 hours. It is increased in the elderly (primarily due to impaired renal clearance) and in subjects with renal impairment.

The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures.

Distribution

The equivalence of levetiracetam injection and the oral formulation was demonstrated in a bioavailability study of 17 healthy volunteers. In this study, levetiracetam 1500 mg was diluted in 100 mL 0.9% sterile saline solution and was infused over 15 minutes. The selected infusion rate provided plasma concentrations of levetiracetam at the end of the infusion period similar to those achieved at Tmaxafter an equivalent oral dose. It is demonstrated that levetiracetam 1500 mg intravenous infusion is equivalent to levetiracetam 3 × 500 mg oral tablets. The time independent pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam was demonstrated following 1500 mg intravenous infusion for 4 days with BID dosing. The AUC(0–12)at steady-state was equivalent to AUCinffollowing an equivalent single dose.

Levetiracetam and its major metabolite are less than 10% bound to plasma proteins; clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are therefore unlikely.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

All clinical studies supporting the efficacy of KEPPRA utilized oral formulations. The finding of efficacy of KEPPRA injection is based on the results of studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA, and on the demonstration of comparable bioavailability of the oral and parenteral formulations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Adults

The effectiveness of KEPPRA for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. The tablet formulation was used in all these studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to placebo, 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day. Patients enrolled in Study 1 or Study 2 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more classical AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study 3 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least 1 year and had taken one classical AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.

Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 4 Years

In the 7-day controlled pediatric clinical study using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in children 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial-onset seizures, the most common adverse reactions in patients receiving KEPPRA in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were somnolence and irritability. Because of the shorter exposure period, incidences of adverse reactions are expected to be lower than in other pediatric studies in older patients. Therefore, other controlled pediatric data, presented above, should also be considered to apply to this age group.

Table 6 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of pediatric epilepsy patients (ages 1 month to < 4 years) treated with KEPPRA in the placebo-controlled study and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In this study, either KEPPRA or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

In the 7-day controlled pediatric clinical study in patients 1 month to < 4 years of age, 3% of patients receiving KEPPRA and 2% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction as a result of an adverse reaction. There was no adverse reaction that resulted in discontinuation for more than one patient.

5.2 Somnolence and Fatigue

KEPPRA may cause somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be monitored for somnolence and fatigue, and be advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on KEPPRA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.

Somnolence

In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, 15% of KEPPRA-treated patients reported somnolence, compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients. There was no clear dose response up to 3000 mg/day. In a study in which there was no titration, about 45% of patients receiving KEPPRA 4000 mg/day reported somnolence. The somnolence was considered serious in 0.3% of KEPPRA-treated patients, compared to 0% in the placebo group. About 3% of KEPPRA-treated patients discontinued treatment due to somnolence, compared to 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. In 1.4% of KEPPRA-treated patients and 0.9% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced, while 0.3% of the KEPPRA-treated patients were hospitalized due to somnolence.

Asthenia

In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, 15% of KEPPRA-treated patients reported asthenia, compared to 9% of placebo-treated patients. Treatment was discontinued due to asthenia in 0.8% of KEPPRA-treated patients as compared to 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.5% of KEPPRA-treated patients and in 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to asthenia.

Somnolence and asthenia occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks of treatment. In general, the incidences of somnolence and fatigue in the pediatric partial-onset seizure studies, and in pediatric and adult myoclonic and primary generalized tonic-clonic studies were comparable to those of the adult partial-onset seizure studies.

Data

Human Data

While available studies cannot definitively establish the absence of risk, data from the published literature and pregnancy registries have not established an association with levetiracetam use during pregnancy and major birth defects or miscarriage.

Animal Data

When levetiracetam (0, 400, 1200, or 3600 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, reduced fetal weights and increased incidence of fetal skeletal variations were observed at the highest dose tested. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal developmental in rats (1200 mg/kg/day) is approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3000 mg on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis.

Oral administration of levetiracetam (0, 200, 600, or 1800 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased embryofetal mortality and incidence of fetal skeletal variations at the mid and high dose and decreased fetal weights and increased incidence of fetal malformations at the high dose, which was associated with maternal toxicity. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rabbits (200 mg/kg/day) is approximately equivalent to the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis.

Oral administration of levetiracetam (0, 70, 350, or 1800 mg/kg/day) to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation led to an increased incidence of fetal skeletal variations, reduced fetal body weight, and decreased growth in offspring at the mid and high doses and increased pup mortality and neurobehavioral alterations in offspring at the highest dose tested. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on pre- and postnatal development in rats (70 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis.

Oral administration of levetiracetam to rats during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation produced no adverse developmental or maternal effects at doses of up to 1800 mg/kg/day (6 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenesis

Rats were dosed with levetiracetam in the diet for 104 weeks at doses of 50, 300, and 1800 mg/kg/day. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the highest dose was approximately 6 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3000 mg. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity. In mice, oral administration of levetiracetam for 80 weeks (doses up to 960 mg/kg/day) or 2 years (doses up to 4000 mg/kg/day, lowered to 3000 mg/kg/day after 45 weeks due to intolerability) was not associated with an increase in tumors. The highest dose tested in mice for 2 years (3000 mg/kg/day) is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis.

Mutagenesis

Levetiracetam was negative in in vitro (Ames, chromosomal aberration in mammalian cells) and in vivo (mouse micronucleus) assays. The major human metabolite of levetiracetam (ucb L057) was negative in in vitro (Ames, mouse lymphoma) assays.

Impairment of Fertility

5.1 Behavioral Abnormalities and Psychotic Symptoms

KEPPRA may cause behavioral abnormalities and psychotic symptoms. Patients treated with KEPPRA should be monitored for psychiatric signs and symptoms.

Behavioral abnormalities

In clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA, 13% of adult KEPPRA-treated patients and 38% of pediatric KEPPRA-treated patients (4 to 16 years of age), compared to 6% and 19% of adult and pediatric placebo-treated patients, experienced non-psychotic behavioral symptoms (reported as aggression, agitation, anger, anxiety, apathy, depersonalization, depression, emotional lability, hostility, hyperkinesias, irritability, nervousness, neurosis, and personality disorder).

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of an oral formulation of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age). The results from an exploratory analysis indicated a worsening in KEPPRA-treated patients on aggressive behavior (one of eight behavior dimensions), as measured in a standardized and systematic way using a validated instrument, the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6–18).

In clinical studies in pediatric patients 1 month to < 4 years of age, irritability was reported in 12% of the KEPPRA-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients.

In clinical studies, 1.7% of adult KEPPRA-treated patients discontinued treatment due to behavioral adverse reactions, compared to 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. The treatment dose was reduced in 0.8% of adult KEPPRA-treated patients and in 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Overall, 11% of KEPPRA-treated pediatric patients experienced behavioral symptoms associated with discontinuation or dose reduction, compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients.

Phenytoin

KEPPRA (3000 mg daily) had no effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of phenytoin in patients with refractory epilepsy. Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were also not affected by phenytoin.

Valproate

KEPPRA (1500 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of valproate in healthy volunteers. Valproate 500 mg twice daily did not modify the rate or extent of levetiracetam absorption or its plasma clearance or urinary excretion. There also was no effect on exposure to and the excretion of the primary metabolite, ucb L057.

Other Antiepileptic Drugs

Potential drug interactions between KEPPRA and other AEDs (carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone and valproate) were also assessed by evaluating the serum concentrations of levetiracetam and these AEDs during placebo-controlled clinical studies. These data indicate that levetiracetam does not influence the plasma concentration of other AEDs and that these AEDs do not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

Effect of AEDs in Pediatric Patients

There was about a 22% increase of apparent total body clearance of levetiracetam when it was co-administered with enzyme-inducing AEDs. Dose adjustment is not recommended. Levetiracetam had no effect on plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate, or lamotrigine.

Oral Contraceptives

KEPPRA (500 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel, or of the luteinizing hormone and progesterone levels, indicating that impairment of contraceptive efficacy is unlikely. Coadministration of this oral contraceptive did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

Digoxin

KEPPRA (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (ECG) of digoxin given as a 0.25 mg dose every day. Coadministration of digoxin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

Warfarin

KEPPRA (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of R and S warfarin. Prothrombin time was not affected by levetiracetam. Coadministration of warfarin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

2.4 Dosing for Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

Adults 16 Years of Age and Older

Initiate treatment with a dose of 1,000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase dosage by 1,000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3,000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3,000 mg/day has not been adequately studied.

 Pediatric Patients 6 to < 16 Years of Age

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). The effectiveness of doses lower than 60 mg/kg/day has not been adequately studied. Patients with body weight ≤ 20 kg should be dosed with oral solution. Patients with body weight above 20 kg can be dosed with either tablets or oral solution [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

2.5 Dosage Adjustments in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

Levetiracetam oral solution dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults are shown in Table 1. In order to calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:

CLcr = [[(140 − age (years)) × weight (kg)]/[72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)]] (× 0.85 for female patients)

Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:

CLcr (mL/min/1.73 m²) = [CLcr (mL/min)/BSA subject (m²)] × 1.73

Table 1: Dosing Adjustment Regimen for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

*Following dialysis, a 250 to 500 mg supplemental dose is recommended.

### Generic substitution of levetiracetam resulting in increased incidence of breakthrough seizures [^1b425024]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We report on 4 patients having an increased incidence of seizures when treatment was switched from brand name levetiracetam (Keppra) to generic levetiracetam formulations.

Case Summary

Patients reported an increase in seizure activity to their neurologists after treatment was switched from Keppra to generic levetiracetam formulations. To confirm the timeline of increased seizure activity with use of the generic drug and report these adverse events to MedWatch, we made a telephone call to each patient's pharmacy to collect information on dispensing dates and the generic formulations' manufacturers. Subsequent to the increase in seizure frequency with generic levetiracetam, treatment in all 4 patients was switched back to Keppra. Seizure frequency in all patients returned to baseline when Keppra was reinstituted.

Discussion

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers generic medications to be therapeutically equivalent to their corresponding brand name formulation when the generic meets bioequivalence criteria. Considering the linear pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam, loss of seizure control or fluctuations of serum concentrations are unexpected if the patient remains on a consistent dose. However, there is growing evidence to support the concept that brand name antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are not clinically equivalent to their generic counterparts. Because the FDA relies on voluntary reporting of adverse events from health-care professionals and consumers to their MedWatch program, underreporting makes it difficult to quantify the significance of brand to generic switches, and, equally important, generic to generic switches.

Conclusions

Until the use of generic AEDs can be evaluated in a large randomized blinded controlled study, clinicians must be vigilant in their efforts to report to MedWatch adverse events resulting from the switch from an AED brand to generic formulation of an AED.

 4 Years to < 16 Years

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 60 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 44 mg/kg. The maximum daily dose was 3,000 mg/day.

 Levetiracetam Oral Solution Weight-Based Dosing Calculation For Pediatric Patients

The following calculation should be used to determine the appropriate daily dose of oral solution for pediatric patients:

Daily dose (mg/kg/day) × patient weight (kg)

Total daily dose (mL/day) = [Daily dose (mg/kg/day) × patient weight (kg)/100 mg/mL]

2.3 Dosing for Myoclonic Seizures in Patients 12 Years of Age and Older with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

Initiate treatment with a dose of 1,000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase the dosage by 1,000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3,000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3,000 mg/day has not been studied.

2.2 Dosing for Partial-Onset Seizures

The recommended dosing for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy is the same; as outlined below.

Adults 16 Years of Age and Older

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Additional dosing increments may be given (1000 mg/day additional every 2 weeks) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. There is no evidence that doses greater than 3000 mg/day confer additional benefit.

Pediatric Patients

1 Month to < 6 Months

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 14 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (7 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 14 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 42 mg/kg (21 mg/kg twice daily). In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 35 mg/kg in this age group.

6 Months to < 4 Years

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose in 2 weeks by an increment of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 50 mg/kg (25 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 47 mg/kg in this age group.

4 Years to < 16 Years

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 60 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 44 mg/kg. The maximum daily dose was 3000 mg/day.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

All clinical studies supporting the efficacy of levetiracetam utilized oral formulations. The finding of efficacy of levetiracetam injection is based on the results of studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam, and on the demonstration of comparable bioavailability of the oral and parenteral formulations [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].

14.1 Partial-Onset Seizures

The effectiveness of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy (added to other antiepileptic drugs) in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. The tablet formulation was used in all these studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to placebo, 1,000 mg, 2,000 mg, or 3,000 mg/day. Patients enrolled in Study 1 or Study 2 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more classical AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study 3 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least 1 year and had taken one classical AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.

Study 1

Study 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 41 sites in the United States comparing levetiracetam 1,000 mg/day (N = 97), levetiracetam 3,000 mg/day (N = 101), and placebo (N = 95) given in equally divided doses twice daily. After a prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients were randomized to one of the three treatment groups described above. The 18-week treatment period consisted of a 6-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED regimens were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate (incidence of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency). The results of the analysis of Study 1 are displayed in Table 7.

### Subcutaneous levetiracetam for the management of seizures at the end of life [^9952d0e6]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To report the results of a combined case series analysis of subcutaneous levetiracetam (Keppra) for the management of seizures in palliative care patients.

Methods

A comprehensive literature review on the use of subcutaneous levetiracetam was performed, and these data were combined with a prospective observational audit of its use in terminal care undertaken in a regional palliative care network.

Results

7 papers were identified from the literature review-four case reports and three observational case series-reporting on a total of 53 cases where subcutaneous levetiracetam was administered. We report 20 further cases of subcutaneous levetiracetam administration from a prospective observational audit. Doses ranged from 250mg to 4000 mg daily. Oral to subcutaneous conversion ratios where stated were 1:1. Levetiracetam was reported as the sole administered antiepileptic drug (AED) in eight cases, and no seizures were reported until death in five cases. Five were switched back to enteral levetiracetam. In seven cases, levetiracetam was combined with AEDs to provide seizure control at the end of life. There was one report of a sterile abscess after 25 days of continuous subcutaneous administration.

Conclusions

Combined analysis of 73 reported cases of subcutaneous levetiracetam suggests this treatment may have a role in the management of seizures at the end of life. However, randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to establish the efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous levetiracetam administration. If proven to be safe and effective, subcutaneous levetiracetam offers the potential to prevent and treat seizures without causing unnecessary sedation at the end of life.

 Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 4 Years of Age

The effectiveness of levetiracetam for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients was established in one multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 5), conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial seizures, uncontrolled by standard epileptic drugs (AEDs). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 to 2 AEDs, who experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either levetiracetam or placebo. The enrolled population included 116 patients (levetiracetam N = 60, placebo N = 56) with refractory partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows: 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N = 4 treated with levetiracetam), 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N = 8 treated with levetiracetam), 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N = 20 treated with levetiracetam), and 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N = 28 treated with levetiracetam). The study consisted of a 5-day evaluation period which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Levetiracetam dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in average daily partial-onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central reader using a 48-hour video EEG performed during the last two days of the 4-day maintenance period. A total of 109 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A statistically significant difference between levetiracetam and placebo was observed (see Figure 5). The treatment effect associated with levetiracetam was consistent across age groups.

14.3 Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

The effectiveness of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy in patients 6 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 7), conducted at 50 sites in 8 countries. Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 or 2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) experiencing at least 3 PGTC seizures during the 8-week combined baseline period (at least one PGTC seizure during the 4 weeks prior to the prospective baseline period and at least one PGTC seizure during the 4-week prospective baseline period) were randomized to either levetiracetam or placebo. The 8-week combined baseline period is referred to as "baseline" in the remainder of this section. Patients were titrated over 4 weeks to a target dose of 3,000 mg/day for adults or a pediatric target dose of 60 mg/kg/day and treated at a stable dose of 3,000 mg/day (or 60 mg/kg/day for children) over 20 weeks (evaluation period). Study drug was given in 2 equally divided doses per day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the percent reduction from baseline in weekly PGTC seizure frequency for levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups over the treatment period (titration + evaluation periods). The population included 164 patients (levetiracetam N = 80, placebo N = 84) with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (predominately juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, or epilepsy with Grand Mal seizures on awakening) experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Each of these syndromes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy was well represented in this patient population.

There was a statistically significant decrease from baseline in PGTC frequency in the levetiracetam-treated patients compared to the placebo-treated patients.

### Assessment of a dose-response relationship of levetiracetam [^a79638c2]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between levetiracetam dose and both efficacy and safety in adult patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Dose-response relationships for levetiracetam efficacy were evaluated using pooled data from three trials including adults with refractory partial epilepsy. Two were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials in which doses of 1000–3000 mg/day of levetiracetam were administered as adjunctive therapy. The third consisted of the two parts of a crossover randomized, double-blind study in which levetiracetam (1000 or 2000 mg/day) or placebo was added to ongoing therapy. Data from each part of the crossover trial were included as if it was an independent parallel-group study. A fourth randomized double-blind trial was added for the safety evaluation. It included data from adults receiving placebo or 2000 mg/day of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy for refractory partial seizures. The combined analysis showed an increasing effect with increasing dose. The responder rates (≥ 50% reduction in seizures) for placebo and levetiracetam 1000, 2000, and 3000 mg/day were 13.1%, 28.5%, 34.3%, and 41.3%, respectively. The respective values for seizure freedom were 0.8%, 4.7%, 6.3%, and 8.6%. There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship with regard to adverse events, including those (asthenia, dizziness, somnolence) most commonly associated with this antiepileptic drug. Patients who do not become seizure-free at the lowest recommended levetiracetam dose (1000 mg/day) should be titrated to 2000 or 3000 mg/day to provide the greatest opportunity for efficacy with little or no increased risk for adverse events.

2.2 Initial Exposure to Levetiracetam

Levetiracetam can be initiated with either intravenous or oral administration.

Partial-Onset Seizures

In clinical trials of oral levetiracetam, daily doses of 1000 mg, 2000 mg, and 3000 mg, given as twice-daily dosing, were shown to be effective. Although in some studies there was a tendency toward greater response with higher dose [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], a consistent increase in response with increased dose has not been shown.

Treatment should be initiated with a daily dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Additional dosing increments may be given (1000 mg/day additional every 2 weeks) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. Doses greater than 3000 mg/day have been used in open-label studies with levetiracetam tablets for periods of 6 months and longer. There is no evidence that doses greater than 3000 mg/day confer additional benefit.

Myoclonic Seizures in Patients with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

Treatment should be initiated with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Dosage should be increased by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been studied.

Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

Treatment should be initiated with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Dosage should be increased by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been adequately studied.

2.3 Switching to Intravenous Dosing

When switching from oral levetiracetam, the initial total daily intravenous dosage of levetiracetam should be equivalent to the total daily dosage and frequency of oral levetiracetam.

2.4 Switching to Oral Dosing

Pediatric Patients 6 to < 16 Years of Age

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). The effectiveness of doses lower than 60 mg/kg/day has not been adequately studied. Patients with body weight ≤ 20 kg should be dosed with oral solution. Patients with body weight above 20 kg can be dosed with either tablets or oral solution [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

2.5 Dosage Adjustments in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

Levetiracetam dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults are shown in Table 1. In order to calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:

Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:

1Following dialysis, a 250 to 500 mg supplemental dose is recommended.

2.6 Discontinuation of Levetiracetam

Avoid abrupt withdrawal from levetiracetam in order to reduce the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

14.1 Partial-Onset Seizures

Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Adults

The effectiveness of levetiracetam for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. The tablet formulation was used in all these studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to placebo, 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day. Patients enrolled in Study 1 or Study 2 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more classical AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study 3 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least 1 year and had taken one classical AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.

Study 1

Study 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 41 sites in the United States comparing levetiracetam 1000 mg/day (N = 97), levetiracetam 3000 mg/day (N = 101), and placebo (N = 95) given in equally divided doses twice daily. After a prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients were randomized to one of the three treatment groups described above. The 18-week treatment period consisted of a 6-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED regimens were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate (incidence of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency). The results of the analysis of Study 1 are displayed in Table 10.

### Levetiracetam (Elepsia xr 1, 000 mg) [^46c322f8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Elimination

Levetiracetam plasma half-life in adults is 7 ± 1 hour and is unaffected by either dose or repeated administration. Levetiracetam is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug which represents 66% of administered dose. The total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg and the renal clearance is 0.6 mL/min/kg. The mechanism of excretion is glomerular filtration with subsequent partial tubular reabsorption. The metabolite ucb L057 is excreted by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance of 4 mL/min/kg. Levetiracetam elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance. Levetiracetam clearance is reduced in patients with impaired renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Elderly

There are insufficient pharmacokinetic data to specifically address the use of extended-release levetiracetam in the elderly population.

Pharmacokinetics of immediate-release levetiracetam were evaluated in 16 elderly subjects (age 61 to 88 years) with creatinine clearance ranging from 30 to 74 mL/min. Following oral administration of twice-daily dosing for 10 days, total body clearance decreased by 38% and the half-life was 2.5 hours longer in the elderly compared to healthy adults. This is most likely due to the decrease in renal function in these subjects.

Pediatric Patients

An open label, multicenter, parallel-group, two-arm study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of extended-release levetiracetam in pediatric patients (13 to 16 years old) and in adults (18 to 55 years old) with epilepsy.

Levetiracetam extended-release tablets (1000 mg to 3000 mg) were administered once daily with a minimum of 4 days and a maximum of 7 days of treatment to 12 pediatric patients and 13 adults in the study. Dose-normalized steady-state exposure parameters, Cmaxand AUC, were comparable between pediatric and adult patients.

Pregnancy

Levetiracetam levels may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Tolerability and efficacy of oral loading of levetiracetam [^7dc25f33]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Nonsedating antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that can be initiated rapidly are desirable in a variety of clinical situations. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a newer AED, with a recently approved parenteral formulation, that can be initiated at doses effective in controlling seizures. We investigated whether oral loading of levetiracetam is well tolerated and facilitates stabilization and discharge of patients in epilepsy monitoring units (EMU).

Methods

Adult patients in the EMU at two centers were identified who received 1,500 mg of LEV in a single dose. This was an observational study of these patients where LEV was thought to be an appropriate component of the therapeutic regimen. Patients were either LEV naive or had been off all LEV for at least 3 days. LEV maintenance was begun 12 hours later at doses of 500 to 1,000 mg twice a day.

Results

A total of 37 adult patients (20 female) were identified. There were no spontaneous complaints of side effects. Upon questioning, 33 patients (89%) denied side effects. The remaining 4 patients (11%) reported transient irritability, imbalance, tiredness, or lightheadedness. Eleven patients (mean weight = 85.0 Kg) had mean LEV serum concentration of 31.5 microg/mL after 1 hour, 23 (mean weight 85.7 Kg) had mean concentration of 30.77 microg/mL after 2 hours, five (mean weight 84.3 Kg) had mean concentration of 12.1 microg/mL after 12 hours, and two (mean weight 94 Kg) had mean concentration of 7.4 microg/mL after 14 hours. No seizures occurred within 24 hours of loading. All patients were able to be discharged 3 to 30 hours after loading.

Conclusions

In the population surveyed, oral loading with levetiracetam was well-tolerated and rapidly yielded serum concentrations thought to decrease seizure frequency. This regimen facilitated discharge from the epilepsy monitoring units.

### Making up missed anti-seizure medication doses: double or nothing? [^98a021db]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

The other question is whether to take the full missed dose immediately if remembered soon enough. They found that for most ASMs, taking the full missed dose immediately did minimize time outside the desired therapeutic range if taken within a few hours of the missed dose. This makes sense and is in line with the above usual advice. There were just a couple exceptions — for example, clobazam (with its long half-life) was better served by any of the "0.5" or "1.5" dose strategies if a dose is anything more than 1 hour delayed.

Take a typical example — twice daily levetiracetam, assume a 40-year-old adult with normal renal function. Their results endorse some of our typical advice — take the full missed dose immediately if remembered within 2 hours of the scheduled time (our typical advice, strategy B). But if remembered more than 2 hours after the originally scheduled time, their results favored different variations of making up only half of the missed dose (strategies C-F), rather than skipping an entire dose.

They have posted their results in a convenient online format. This allows the user to take matters into their own hands by entering a patient's specific data into this app to view how concentrations may fluctuate under strategies A-F. For more advanced users, they posted another app in which one can even modify assumptions about absorption, clearance, volume of distribution, and more.

Even with their large array of analyses, the investigators could look at only a subset of all possible ASMs or ages (they did not include a scenario for older patients, for whom changes in renal function and susceptibility to adverse effects may be greatest), and these data pertain only to immediate rather than extended-release formulations. There are also 2 elephants in the room: (1) Translating a precise sinusoidal concentration curve into the chance that a patient might have seizures or side effects is not simple, nor does this inform how the patient perceives the tradeoff between transient seizure versus side effect risk, and (2) None of this modeling addresses the underlying cause of skipping doses.

That said, this is a nicely done, useful study, involving incredible technical demands. But what I most appreciate about this study is its spirit. The investigators identified an extremely common clinical scenario with agreed upon yet arbitrary guidance and sought to provide clinicians with freely available evidence-based guideposts.

14.1 Levetiracetam Extended-Release Tablets in Adults

The effectiveness of levetiracetam extended-release tablets as adjunctive therapy (added to other antiepileptic drugs) was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study across 7 countries in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization (Study 1).

Study 1

Patients enrolled in Study 1 had at least eight partial seizures with or without secondary generalization during the 8-week baseline period and at least two partial seizures in each 4-week interval of the baseline period. Patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one AED, and could take a maximum of three AEDs. After a prospective baseline period of 8 weeks, 158 patients were randomized to placebo (N = 79) or 1000 mg (two 500 mg tablets) of levetiracetam extended- release tablets (N = 79), given once daily over a 12-week treatment period.

The primary efficacy endpoint in Study 1 was the percent reduction over placebo in mean weekly frequency of partial- onset seizures. The median percent reduction in weekly partial-onset seizure frequency from baseline over the treatment period was 46.1% in the levetiracetam extended-release tablets 1000 mg treatment group (N = 74) and 33.4% in the placebo group (N = 78). The estimated percent reduction over placebo in weekly partial-onset seizure frequency over the treatment period was 14.4% (statistically significant).

The relationship between the effectiveness of the same daily dose of levetiracetam extended-release tablets and immediate-release levetiracetam tablets has not been studied and is unknown.

Absorption and Distribution

Extended-release levetiracetam peak plasma concentrations occur in about 4 hours. The time to peak plasma concentrations is about 3 hours longer with extended-release levetiracetam than with immediate-release tablets. After multiple dose levetiracetam extended-release tablets intake, extent of exposure (AUC0-24) was similar to extent of exposure after multiple dose immediate-release tablets intake. Cmaxand Cminwere lower by 17% and 26% after multiple dose levetiracetam extended-release tablets intake in comparison to multiple dose immediate-release tablets intake. Intake of a high fat, high calorie breakfast before the administration of levetiracetam extended-release tablets resulted in a longer median time to peak. The median time to peak (Tmax) was 3 to 4.5 hours longer in the fed state. There was no effect on peak plasma concentration however; the extent of exposure (AUC) was 21 to 25% higher.

Metabolism

Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, which produces the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057 (24% of dose) and is not dependent on any liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The major metabolite is inactive in animal seizure models. Two minor metabolites were identified as the product of hydroxylation of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring (2% of dose) and opening of the 2-oxo- pyrrolidine ring in position 5 (1% of dose). There is no enantiomeric interconversion of levetiracetam or its major metabolite.

### Single-dose bioavailability of levetiracetam intravenous infusion relative to oral tablets and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and tolerability of levetiracetam intravenous infusion compared with placebo in healthy subjects [^54a2e557]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Antiepileptic drugs are usually administere dorally, but alternative routes of drug delivery may be required when oral administration is not feasible.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the single-dose bioavailability of an IV formulation of levetiracetam relative to oral tablets and the multiple-dose tolerability and pharmacokinetics of this formulation compared with placebo in healthy subjects.

Methods

This study consisted of 2 phases. Subjects entered the first phase, which was a single-dose, randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover bioavailability comparison of a 15-minute IV infusion of levetiracetam 1,500 mg and three 500-mg oral tablets. Subjects then entered the second phase, a multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (2:1), parallel-group tolerability and pharmacokinetic study, in which they received 9 successive doses of levetiracetam 1,500 mg IV or placebo at 12-hour intervals. Plasma levetiracetam concentrations were determined by gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection. The comparison of bioavailability was based on the 90% CIs around the geometric mean ratios for AUC and C(max) (IV/oral).

Results

Eighteen subjects (9 men, 9 women) participated in the study. All subjects were white. Their mean (SD) age was 35.0 (9.3) years, mean weight 73.3 (14.2) kg, and mean body mass index 23.9 (2.5) kg/m(2). After a single dose, the IV infusion and oral tablet were similar in terms of C(max) (50.5 and 47.7 microg/mL, respectively) and AUC (392.4 and 427.9 pg x h/mL). The geometric mean IV/oral ratios were 92.2 (90% CI, 89.0–95.6) for AUC and 103.7 (90% CI, 91.6–117.4) for C(max) indicating that the IV and oral formulations were bioequivalent. After multiple twice-daily infusions, steady state was reached within 48 hours. Seventeen (94%) of 18 subjects had ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse event after single-dose administration. During the single-dose phase, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 89% (16/18) for the IV formulation and 72% (13/18) for the oral tablets; during the multiple-dose phase, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 67% (8/12) in the IV levetiracetam group and 33% (2/6) in the placebo group. The most common adverse events in the single-dose phase were somnolence (61% IV vs 28% oral) and postural dizziness (17% vs 39%, respectively). The most common adverse events with IV levetiracetam in the multiple-dose phase were also somnolence (33% vs 17% placebo) and postural dizziness (25% vs 0% placebo).

Conclusions

In these healthy subjects, single doses of levetiracetam 1,500 mg administered as a 15-minute IV infusion and as oral tablets were bioequivalent. General and local tolerability during multiple dosing were good. Steady state was reached within 48 hours. Despite the limitations of a study of short duration and small size conducted in healthy subjects, the findings suggest that use of a 15-minute IV infusion of levetiracetam should be further investigated.

### The case for levetiracetam to be included in essential medicine lists [^aac1d750]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Levetiracetam is one ASM that fulfils the "easy to use" criterion. It is rapidly absorbed, unaffected by food, and peak concentrations are quickly achieved. It has linear kinetics, with minimal protein binding, negligible hepatic metabolism, and is renally excreted. Therefore, neither does it have the propensity to clinically relevant drug interactions, nor is its plasma concentration influenced by protein levels. Schedules for commencing treatment are straightforward in comparison to lamotrigine. One issue is that tablets are large and taste bitter in crushed form.

Levetiracetam is available in tablet, oral solution and injectable forms and, therefore, suitable for various circumstances. Recent evidence from the SANAD II trials suggests that it is neither clinically nor cost-effective compared to valproate in generalised epilepsies and lamotrigine in focal epilepsies. Nevertheless, it is widely prescribed for various seizure types and epilepsies, except for absence seizures. There is persuasive evidence for its use as a second-line drug for convulsive status epilepticus. Its efficacy in terms of seizure termination is similar to phenytoin but with a quicker onset, probably related to the speed of its intravenous administration compared to phenytoin.

When used in monotherapy, levetiracetam is less teratogenic than other ASMs, making its use appealing in women in the reproductive age group. Therapeutic drug monitoring, although available, is not routinely required, apart from some situations, e.g. pregnancy, adherence check, intercurrent critical illnesses and extremes of age. Levetiracetam's adverse effect profile is limited, making it further appealing for use in primary care. Behavioural side effects, including irritability, anger and aggression, are the most common. It is prudent to screen for suicidality and psychiatric disorders at treatment initiation bearing in mind, however, that both are raised in epilepsy.

Traditional ASMs are low-priced and often the only drugs available in LMICs. These remain indispensable to practice, especially in primary care settings in LMICs. Their use poses challenges on account of their complexity and long-term consequences. Levetiracetam's cost remains an issue but has lessened with the availability of generics and will likely further reduce if labelled as an essential medicine. The addition of levetiracetam to the Indian list is a commendable step. Other countries should follow suit.

### Seizure risk in brain tumor patients with conversion to generic levetiracetam [^ed5fba0f]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Breakthrough seizure activity has been reported with conversion from brand name to generic anticonvulsants. This has prompted several organizations to support physician notification of generic substitution and patient consent. Recently, a generic formulation of levetiracetam has become available. Risk of seizures with generic levetiracetam has yet to be reported. Literature was reviewed regarding risk of generic substitution. Four cases of seizure activity in primary brain tumor patients after conversion from Keppra to generic levetiracetam are reported. In all cases, there was no evidence of tumor growth or concurrent illness that would increase the risk of seizures. In three cases, the patients have remained seizure free with conversion back to Keppra. The final patient required an increased dose of levetiracetam. As has been described with generic substitution of other anticonvulsants, patients switched to generic levetiracetam may be at risk for breakthrough seizure activity.

Procedures

Trial treatments were prescribed as per routine NHS practice and dispensed by hospital and community pharmacies, and clinicians prescribed the formulation they considered most appropriate. The trial protocol provided guidance on initial drug titration and maintenance doses based on routine practice, although clinicians were able to tailor these as appropriate. All medications were taken orally. For participants aged 12 years or older, the initial advised maintenance doses were 500 mg twice per day for both levetiracetam and valproate. For children aged 5–12 years, the initial daily maintenance doses advised were 25 mg/kg for valproate and 40 mg/kg for levetiracetam. Subsequent dose and treatment changes at follow-up visits were made on the basis of treatment response and in accordance with routine clinical practice.

We aimed to complete recruitment over a 4.5 year period and to then follow up the trial cohort for a further 2 years, allowing a minimum follow-up of 2 years and maximum of 6.5 years. Patients were followed up according to clinical need, and minimum trial visits were expected at 3, 6, and 12 months, and annually thereafter. At visits, data were collected for seizures, anti-seizure medication, and adverse reactions. Participants continued in follow-up whether they were still taking their allocated treatment or not. When participants fell out of hospital follow-up, outcome data were sought from their general practitioner.

### Levetiracetam: a different approach to the pharmacotherapy of epilepsy [^a9af5730]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and adverse effects of levetiracetam in the treatment of epilepsy.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search restricted to English-language publications was conducted (January 1993-October 2000). Unpublished data provided by the manufacturer and information found in proceedings of professional meetings were also included. DATA EXTRACTION/STUDY SELECTION: Information regarding basic pharmacology was collected from studies in animals. Pharmacokinetic data were collected from human trials. Only randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials were included to describe the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam.

Data Synthesis

Levetiracetam is a new antiepileptic drug (AED) that appears to work by a unique mechanism. Animal studies have shown that levetiracetam may prevent epileptogenesis. Levetiracetam is rapidly and completely absorbed, minimally bound to plasma proteins, eliminated through the kidneys, and has a half-life of 6–8 hours. Doses must be adjusted for varying degrees of renal function. In clinical trials, levetiracetam significantly decreased seizure frequency compared with placebo when added to existing AED regimens. One clinical trial indicated that levetiracetam may be effective as monotherapy. Few major adverse effects were reported in the clinical trials; however, several patients reported psychological and psychotic reactions.

Conclusions

Levetiracetam is a safe and effective new AED. Its apparent unique mechanism of action makes levetiracetam an important addition to therapy with older medications. Caution should be exercised when administering levetiracetam to individuals who may be prone to psychotic or psychiatric reactions.

### The SANAD II study of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam, zonisamide, or lamotrigine for newly diagnosed focal epilepsy: an open-label, non-inferiority, multicentre, phase 4, randomised controlled trial [^72b23e03]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Levetiracetam and zonisamide are licensed as monotherapy for patients with focal epilepsy, but there is uncertainty as to whether they should be recommended as first-line treatments because of insufficient evidence of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. We aimed to assess the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam and zonisamide compared with lamotrigine in people with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy.

Methods

This randomised, open-label, controlled trial compared levetiracetam and zonisamide with lamotrigine as first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. Adult and paediatric neurology services across the UK recruited participants aged 5 years or older (with no upper age limit) with two or more unprovoked focal seizures. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1:1) using a minimisation programme with a random element utilising factor to receive lamotrigine, levetiracetam, or zonisamide. Participants and investigators were not masked and were aware of treatment allocation. SANAD II was designed to assess non-inferiority of both levetiracetam and zonisamide to lamotrigine for the primary outcome of time to 12-month remission. Anti-seizure medications were taken orally and for participants aged 12 years or older the initial advised maintenance doses were lamotrigine 50 mg (morning) and 100 mg (evening), levetiracetam 500 mg twice per day, and zonisamide 100 mg twice per day. For children aged between 5 and 12 years the initial daily maintenance doses advised were lamotrigine 1.5 mg/kg twice per day, levetiracetam 20 mg/kg twice per day, and zonisamide 2.5 mg/kg twice per day. All participants were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The per-protocol (PP) analysis excluded participants with major protocol deviations and those who were subsequently diagnosed as not having epilepsy. Safety analysis included all participants who received one dose of any study drug. The non-inferiority limit was a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.329, which equates to an absolute difference of 10%. A HR greater than 1 indicated that an event was more likely on lamotrigine. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 30294119 (EudraCt number: 2012-001884-64).

Findings

990 participants were recruited between May 2, 2013, and June 20, 2017, and followed up for a further 2 years. Patients were randomly assigned to receive lamotrigine (n = 330), levetiracetam (n = 332), or zonisamide (n = 328). The ITT analysis included all participants and the PP analysis included 324 participants randomly assigned to lamotrigine, 320 participants randomly assigned to levetiracetam, and 315 participants randomly assigned to zonisamide. Levetiracetam did not meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the ITT analysis of time to 12-month remission versus lamotrigine (HR 1.18; 97.5% CI 0.95–1.47) but zonisamide did meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the ITT analysis versus lamotrigine (1.03; 0.83–1.28). The PP analysis showed that 12-month remission was superior with lamotrigine than both levetiracetam (HR 1.32 [97.5% CI 1.05 to 1.66]) and zonisamide (HR 1.37 [1.08–1.73]). There were 37 deaths during the trial. Adverse reactions were reported by 108 (33%) participants who started lamotrigine, 144 (44%) participants who started levetiracetam, and 146 (45%) participants who started zonisamide. Lamotrigine was superior in the cost-utility analysis, with a higher net health benefit of 1.403 QALYs (97.5% central range 1.319–1.458) compared with 1.222 (1.110–1.283) for levetiracetam and 1.232 (1.112, 1.307) for zonisamide at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20000 per QALY. Cost-effectiveness was based on differences between treatment groups in costs and QALYs.

Interpretation

These findings do not support the use of levetiracetam or zonisamide as first-line treatments for patients with focal epilepsy. Lamotrigine should remain a first-line treatment for patients with focal epilepsy and should be the standard treatment in future trials.

### Levetiracetam in pediatrics [^2d5de5e1]. Journal of Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam is a new antiepileptic drug whose efficacy and tolerability are already well known in adults. Few studies are available in children. This review, based on the international literature, aims to identify and make known the possible indications for levetiracetam in childhood. Most studies suggest that levetiracetam is effective against partial and generalized epilepsy. In resistant partial epilepsy, the percentage of responders reaches 64%, with 8 to 23% seizure free. Levetiracetam is used to treat symptomatic and idiopathic epilepsies. The drug has also proven effective against photosensitivity and epileptic and nonepileptic myoclonus. The most frequent side effects involve the behavioral sphere and manifest mostly in patients with a history of behavioral problems. In some patients, levetiracetam increases the number of seizures, but this adverse reaction can be partially avoided with slow titration. Doses for children should be 130 to 140% of those advised for adults. Levetiracetam seems to have a broad spectrum of action and is, on the whole, well tolerated. Its efficacy against generalized epilepsy is particularly promising in childhood.

14.3 Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

The effectiveness of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy in patients 6 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 7), conducted at 50 sites in 8 countries. Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 or 2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) experiencing at least 3 PGTC seizures during the 8-week combined baseline period (at least one PGTC seizure during the 4 weeks prior to the prospective baseline period and at least one PGTC seizure during the 4-week prospective baseline period) were randomized to either levetiracetam or placebo. The 8-week combined baseline period is referred to as "baseline" in the remainder of this section. Patients were titrated over 4 weeks to a target dose of 3000 mg/day for adults or a pediatric target dose of 60 mg/kg/day and treated at a stable dose of 3000 mg/day (or 60 mg/kg/day for children) over 20 weeks (evaluation period). Study drug was given in 2 equally divided doses per day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the percent reduction from baseline in weekly PGTC seizure frequency for levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups over the treatment period (titration + evaluation periods). The population included 164 patients (levetiracetam N = 80, placebo N = 84) with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (predominately juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, or epilepsy with Grand Mal seizures on awakening) experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Each of these syndromes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy was well represented in this patient population.

There was a statistically significant decrease from baseline in PGTC frequency in the levetiracetam-treated patients compared to the placebo-treated patients.

### The SANAD II study of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of valproate versus levetiracetam for newly diagnosed generalised and unclassifiable epilepsy: an open-label, non-inferiority, multicentre, phase 4, randomised controlled trial [^7860d247]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Valproate is a first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic generalised or difficult to classify epilepsy, but not for women of child-bearing potential because of teratogenicity. Levetiracetam is increasingly prescribed for these patient populations despite scarcity of evidence of clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness. We aimed to compare the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam compared with valproate in participants with newly diagnosed generalised or unclassifiable epilepsy.

Methods

We did an open-label, randomised controlled trial to compare levetiracetam with valproate as first-line treatment for patients with generalised or unclassified epilepsy. Adult and paediatric neurology services (69 centres overall) across the UK recruited participants aged 5 years or older (with no upper age limit) with two or more unprovoked generalised or unclassifiable seizures. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either levetiracetam or valproate, using a minimisation programme with a random element utilising factors. Participants and investigators were aware of treatment allocation. For participants aged 12 years or older, the initial advised maintenance doses were 500 mg twice per day for levetiracetam and valproate, and for children aged 5–12 years, the initial daily maintenance doses advised were 25 mg/kg for valproate and 40 mg/kg for levetiracetam. All drugs were administered orally. SANAD II was designed to assess the non-inferiority of levetiracetam compared with valproate for the primary outcome time to 12-month remission. The non-inferiority limit was a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.314, which equates to an absolute difference of 10%. A HR greater than 1 indicated that an event was more likely on valproate. All participants were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Per-protocol (PP) analyses excluded participants with major protocol deviations and those who were subsequently diagnosed as not having epilepsy. Safety analyses included all participants who received one dose of any study drug. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 30294119 (EudraCt number: 2012-001884-64).

Findings

520 participants were recruited between April 30, 2013, and Aug 2, 2016, and followed up for a further 2 years. 260 participants were randomly allocated to receive levetiracetam and 260 participants to receive valproate. The ITT analysis included all participants and the PP analysis included 255 participants randomly allocated to valproate and 254 randomly allocated to levetiracetam. Median age of participants was 13.9 years (range 5.0–94.4), 65% were male and 35% were female, 397 participants had generalised epilepsy, and 123 unclassified epilepsy. Levetiracetam did not meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the ITT analysis of time to 12-month remission (HR 1.19 [95% CI 0.96–1.47]); non-inferiority margin 1.314. The PP analysis showed that the 12-month remission was superior with valproate than with levetiracetam. There were two deaths, one in each group, that were unrelated to trial treatments. Adverse reactions were reported by 96 (37%) participants randomly assigned to valproate and 107 (42%) participants randomly assigned to levetiracetam. Levetiracetam was dominated by valproate in the cost-utility analysis, with a negative incremental net health benefit of −0.040 (95% central range −0.175 to 0.037) and a probability of 0.17 of being cost-effectiveness at a threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Cost-effectiveness was based on differences between treatment groups in costs and quality-adjusted life-years.

Interpretation

Compared with valproate, levetiracetam was found to be neither clinically effective nor cost-effective. For girls and women of child-bearing potential, these results inform discussions about benefit and harm of avoiding valproate.

Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 4 Years of Age

The effectiveness of levetiracetam for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients was established in one multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 5), conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial seizures, uncontrolled by standard epileptic drugs (AEDs). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1–2 AEDs, who experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either levetiracetam or placebo. The enrolled population included 116 patients (levetiracetam N = 60, placebo N = 56) with refractory partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows: 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N = 4 treated with levetiracetam), 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N = 8 treated with levetiracetam), 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N = 20 treated with levetiracetam), and 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N = 28 treated with levetiracetam). The study consisted of a 5-day evaluation period which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Levetiracetam dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in average daily partial-onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central reader using a 48-hour video EEG performed during the last two days of the 4-day maintenance period. A total of 109 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A statistically significant difference between levetiracetam and placebo was observed (see Figure 5). The treatment effect associated with levetiracetam was consistent across age groups.

### Levetiracetam add-on for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^b188bb6e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Drug resistance is common in focal epilepsy. In this update, we summarised the current evidence regarding add-on levetiracetam in treating drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The original review was published in 2001 and last updated in 2012.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of levetiracetam when used as an add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web, which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to November 2018. We contacted the manufacturers of levetiracetam and researchers in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials of add-on levetiracetam treatment in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for bias, extracted data, and evaluated the overall certainty of the evidence. Outcomes investigated included 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency (response), treatment withdrawal, adverse effects (including a specific analysis of changes in behaviour), cognitive effects, and quality of life (QoL). Primary analysis was intention-to-treat. We performed meta-analysis for all outcomes using a Mantel-Haenszel approach and calculated risk ratios (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all estimates apart from adverse effects (99% CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using a Chi² test and the I² statistic.

Main Results

This update included 14 trials (2455 participants), predominantly possessing low risks of bias. Participants were adults in 12 trials (2159 participants) and children in the remaining two (296 participants). The doses of levetiracetam tested were 500 mg/day to 4000 mg/day in adults, and 60 mg/kg/day in children. Treatment ranged from 12 to 24 weeks. When individual doses were examined, levetiracetam at either 500 mg/day or 4000 mg/day did not perform better than placebo for the 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency outcome (500 mg: RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.62; P = 0.26; 4000 mg: RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.59 to 4.57; P = 0.34). Levetiracetam was significantly better than placebo at all other individual doses (1000 mg to 3000 mg). RR was significantly in favour of levetiracetam compared to placebo when results were pooled across all doses (RR 2.37, 95% CI 2.02 to 2.78; 14 studies, 2455 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Dose-response analysis demonstrated that the odds of achieving response (50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency) were increased by nearly 40% (odds ratio (OR) 1.39, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.58) for each 1000 mg increase in dose of levetiracetam. There were important levels of heterogeneity across multiple comparisons. Participants were not significantly more likely to experience treatment withdrawal with levetiracetam than with placebo (pooled RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 13 studies, 2428 participants; high-certainty evidence). Somnolence was the most common adverse effect, affecting 13% of participants, and it was significantly associated with levetiracetam compared to placebo (pooled RR 1.62, 99% CI 1.19 to 2.20; 13 studies, 2423 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Changes in behaviour were negligible in adults (1% affected; RR 1.79, 99% CI 0.59 to 5.41), but significant in children (23% affected; RR 1.90, 99% CI 1.16 to 3.11). Levetiracetam had a positive effect on some aspects of cognition and QoL in adults and worsened certain aspects of child behaviour.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, this review update finds that in both adults and children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, levetiracetam added on to usual care is more effective than placebo at reducing seizure frequency, it is unlikely to be stopped by patients, and it has minimal adverse effects outside of potential worsening behaviour in children. These findings are unchanged from the previous review update in 2012. This review update contributes two key additional findings: 1. a 500 mg daily dose of levetiracetam is no more effective than placebo at reducing seizures; and 2. the odds of response (50% reduction in seizure frequency) are increased by nearly 40% for each 1000 mg increase in dose of levetiracetam. It seems reasonable to continue the use of levetiracetam in both adults and children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

### The SANAD II study of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam, zonisamide, or lamotrigine for newly diagnosed focal epilepsy: an open-label, non-inferiority, multicentre, phase 4, randomised controlled trial [^db526dda]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Procedures

SANAD II was an open-label trial. Trial treatments were prescribed as per routine NHS practice and dispensed by hospital and community pharmacies, and clinicians prescribed the formulation they considered most appropriate. The trial protocol provided guidance on initial drug titration and maintenance doses based on routine practice, although clinicians were able to tailor these as appropriate. All anti-seizure medications were taken orally. For participants aged 12 years or more, the initial advised maintenance doses were lamotrigine (50 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening), levetiracetam (500 mg twice per day), and zonisamide (100 mg twice per day). For children aged 5–12 years, the initial daily maintenance doses advised were lamotrigine (1.5 mg/kg twice per day), levetiracetam (20 mg/kg twice per day), and zonisamide (2.5 mg/kg twice per day). Subsequent dose and treatment changes at follow-up visits were done following routine clinical practice according to treatment response and adverse effects.

We aimed to complete recruitment over a 4.5 year period but a 12-month extension was required to meet the sample size target, after which the trial cohort was followed up for a further 2 years, allowing a minimum follow up of 2 years and maximum of 7.5 years. Patients were followed up according to clinical need, and minimum trial visits were expected at 3, 6, and 12 months, and annually thereafter. At visits, data were collected for seizure type and frequency, anti-seizure medication, and adverse reactions. Participants continued in follow-up whether they were still taking their allocated treatment or not. For participants lost to hospital follow-up, outcome data were sought from their general practitioner.

For adults, QOL outcomes were assessed using subscales of the quality of life in newly diagnosed epilepsy battery (NEWQOL) and the Impact of Epilepsy Scale. For children and adolescents aged < 16 years, QOL assessment involved both patient and parent-based measures: children aged 8–15 years completed a generic health status measure validated for use in epilepsy, the KINDL; and the epilepsy impact and attitude to epilepsy subscales of the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory for Adolescents (QOLIE-AD). Parents of all children completed proxy QOL questionnaires. QOL questionnaires were completed at baseline and annually thereafter. Adults and parents also completed a subset of QOL measures at 3 months and 6 months.

### Comparison of levetiracetam and controlled-release carbamazepine in newly diagnosed epilepsy [^d599a743]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

We report the results of a prospective study of the efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam, a new antiepileptic drug with a unique mechanism of action, in comparison with controlled-release carbamazepine as first treatment in newly diagnosed epilepsy.

Methods

Adults with ≥ 2 partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the previous year were randomly assigned to levetiracetam (500 mg twice daily, n = 288) or controlled-release carbamazepine (200 mg twice daily, n = 291) in a multicenter, double-blind, noninferiority, parallel-group trial. If a seizure occurred within 26 weeks of stabilization, dosage was increased incrementally to a maximum of levetiracetam 1,500 mg twice daily or carbamazepine 600 mg twice daily. Patients achieving the primary endpoint (6-month seizure freedom) continued on treatment for a further 6-month maintenance period.

Results

At per-protocol analysis, 73.0% (56.6%) of patients randomized to levetiracetam and 72.8% (58.5%) receiving controlled-release carbamazepine were seizure free at the last evaluated dose (adjusted absolute difference 0.2%, 95% CI -7.8% to 8.2%) for ≥ 6 months (1 year). Of all patients achieving 6-month (1-year) remission, 80.1% (86.0%) in the levetiracetam group and 85.4% (89.3%) in the carbamazepine group did so at the lowest dose level. Withdrawal rates for adverse events were 14.4% with levetiracetam and 19.2% with carbamazepine.

Conclusions

Levetiracetam and controlled-release carbamazepine produced equivalent seizure freedom rates in newly diagnosed epilepsy at optimal dosing in a setting mimicking clinical practice. This trial has confirmed in a randomized, double-blind setting previously uncontrolled observations that most people with epilepsy will respond to their first-ever antiepileptic drug at low dosage.

### An 11-year review of levetiracetam ingestions in children less than 6 years of age [^a8326a4b]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Levetiracetam is a new anticonvulsant, which works to block high-voltage-activated Ca(++) channels in children, for partial-onset seizures. Reports of clinical experience with pediatric ingestions are minimal. The purpose of this study was to characterize the toxicity of accidental levetiracetam exposures in children less than 6 years of age.

Methods

This was an 11-year retrospective observational case series of pediatric (< 6 years old) levetiracetam ingestions reported to a Poison Control System from 2002 to 2013. Case narratives were individually reviewed to collect desired information on exposure and clinical course. Inclusion criteria were levetiracetam as a single ingested medication, age less than 6 years, treatment in a health care facility, and followed to a known outcome.

Results

Eighty-two cases met inclusion criteria with 55% female patients and overall median age of 2.0 years (range: 1–60 months). The levetiracetam dose ingested was reported in 69 (84.1%) cases, with exact dose (median dose, 45.0 mg/kg; range, 10.5–1429 mg/kg) reported in 33 cases (40.2%). Of these, twenty-nine cases (88%) involved the oral solution formulation and 28 cases (85%) had unintentional therapeutic error as the cause of the exposure. No dose-response relationship was demonstrated; however, the odds of a levetiracetam-naive patient, (median dose, 26.9 mg/kg; N = 15) with an unintentional exposure, developing drowsiness or ataxia was 6 times that of a patient who was not naïve to levetiracetam (median dose, 70.1 mg/kg; N = 20) (Odds ratio [OR], 6.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–35.91). Of the 82 cases, 17 (20.7%) developed untoward clinical effects of drowsiness and/or ataxia. Eighty patients (97.6%) were treated and discharged from the emergency department, and two patients (2.4%) were admitted. The two patients admitted included a two-month old who was accidentally given a dose 10 times that of her usual dose and a 3-year old who was lethargic on arrival to the hospital after ingestion of an unknown dose. Of all patients, 66 patients (80.5%) had no effect from the drug exposure. The medical outcome was considered to be minor in 15 cases (18.3%), and moderate in 1 case (1.2%). There were no cases with major outcomes and no deaths.

Conclusions

Pediatric levetiracetam exposures were associated with few transient clinical effects. Poison Control Centers may wish to consider acuity of ingestion when developing send-in protocols.

### Levetiracetam add-on for drug-resistant focal epilepsy: an updated cochrane review [^aeb0714f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is an important neurological condition and drug resistance in epilepsy is particularly common in individuals with focal seizures. In this review, we summarise the current evidence regarding a new antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, when used as add-on treatment for controlling drug-resistant focal epilepsy. This is an update to a Cochrane Review that was originally published in 2001.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of levetiracetam, added on to usual care, in treating drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 7, 2012), and MEDLINE (1946 to August week 1, 2012). We also contacted the manufacturers of levetiracetam and researchers in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials of add-on levetiracetam treatment in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for bias, extracted data, and evaluated the overall quality of evidence. Outcomes investigated included 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency (response); less than 50% reduction in focal seizure frequency (non-response); treatment withdrawal; adverse effects (including a specific analysis of changes in behaviour); cognitive effects and quality of life (QoL). Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as measures of effect (99% CIs for adverse effects). Primary analyses were Intention-to-Treat (ITT). Dose response and inter-trial heterogeneity were evaluated in regression models.

Main Results

Eleven trials (1861 participants) were included. They predominantly possessed low risks of bias. Participants were adults in nine trials (1565 participants) and children in the remaining two trials (296 participants). The dose of levetiracetam tested was 1000 to 4000 mg/day in adults, and 60 mg/kg/day in children. Treatment ranged from 12 to 24 weeks. For the 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency outcome, the RR was significantly in favour of levetiracetam at all doses. The naive estimates, ignoring dose, showed children (52% responded) as better responders than adults (39% responded) on levetiracetam. 25% of children and 16% of adults responded to placebo. The Number Needed to Treat for an additional beneficial outcome for children and adults was four (95% CI three to seven) and five (95% CI four to six), respectively. The significant levels of statistical heterogeneity between trials on adults precluded valid provision of an overall RR (ignoring dose). Results for the two trials that tested levetiracetam 2000 mg on adults were sufficiently similar to be combined to give an RR for 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency of 4.91 (95% CI 2.75 to 8.77), with an RR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.77) for non-response. At this dose, 37% and 8% of adults were responders in the levetiracetam and placebo groups, respectively. Regression analysis demonstrated that much of the heterogeneity between adult trials was likely to be explained by different doses of levetiracetam tested and different years of trial publication. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials on children. For these trials, the RR for 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency was 1.91 (95% CI 1.38 to 2.63), with an RR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.81) for non-response. 27% of children responded. Participants were not significantly more likely to have levetiracetam withdrawn (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.32 and RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.46 for adults and children, respectively). For adults, somnolence (RR 1.51; 99% CI 1.06 to 2.17) and infection (RR 1.76; 99% CI 1.03 to 3.02) were significantly associated with levetiracetam. Accidental injury was significantly associated with placebo (RR 0.60; 99% CI 0.39 to 0.92). No individual adverse effect was significantly associated with levetiracetam in children. Changes in behaviour were negligible in adults (1% affected; RR 1.79; 99% CI 0.59 to 5.41) but significant in children (23% affected; RR 1.90; 99% CI 1.16 to 3.11). Cognitive effect and QoL outcomes suggested that levetiracetam had a positive effect on cognition and some aspects of QoL in adults. In children, levetiracetam did not appear to alter cognitive function but there was evidence of worsening in certain aspects of child behaviour. The overall quality of evidence used was high.

Authors' Conclusions

This update adds seven more trials to the original review, which contained four trials. At every dose analysed, levetiracetam significantly reduced focal seizure frequency relative to placebo. This indicates that levetiracetam can significantly reduce focal seizure frequency when it is used as an add-on treatment for both adults and children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. As there was evidence of significant levels of statistical heterogeneity within this positive effect it is difficult to be precise about the relative magnitude of the effect. At a dose of 2000 mg, levetiracetam may be expected to be 3.9 times more effective than placebo; with 30% of adults being responders at this dose. At a dose of 60 mg/kg/day, levetiracetam may be expected to be 0.9 times more effective than placebo; with 25% of children being responders at this dose. When dose was ignored, children were better responders than adults by around 4% to 13%. The results grossly suggest that one child or adult may respond to levetiracetam for every four or five children or adults, respectively, that have received levetiracetam rather than placebo. The drug seems to be well tolerated in both adults and children although non-specific changes in behaviour may be experienced in as high as 20% of children. This aspect of the adverse-effect profile of levetiracetam was analysed crudely and requires further investigation and validation. It seems reasonable to continue the use of levetiracetam in both adults and children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The results cannot be used to confirm longer-term or monotherapy effects of levetiracetam or its effects on generalised seizures. The conclusions are largely unchanged from those in the original review. The most significant contribution of this update is the addition of paediatric data into the analysis.

14.3 Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

The effectiveness of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, conducted at 50 sites in 8 countries. Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 or 2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) experiencing at least 3 PGTC seizures during the 8-week combined baseline period (at least one PGTC seizure during the 4 weeks prior to the prospective baseline period and at least one PGTC seizure during the 4-week prospective baseline period) were randomized to either levetiracetam or placebo. The 8-week combined baseline period is referred to as "baseline" in the remainder of this section. The population included 164 patients (levetiracetam N = 80, placebo N = 84) with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (predominately juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, or epilepsy with Grand Mal seizures on awakening) experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Each of these syndromes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy was well represented in this patient population. Patients were titrated over 4 weeks to a target dose of 3,000 mg/day for adults or a pediatric target dose of 60 mg/kg/day and treated at a stable dose of 3,000 mg/day (or 60 mg/kg/day for children) over 20 weeks (evaluation period). Study drug was given in 2 equally divided doses per day.

The primary measure of effectiveness was the percent reduction from baseline in weekly PGTC seizure frequency for levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups over the treatment period (titration + evaluation periods). There was a statistically significant decrease from baseline in PGTC frequency in the levetiracetam-treated patients compared to the placebo-treated patients.

### The long term retention of levetiracetam in a large cohort of patients with epilepsy [^d3209ffa]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam (Lev) is a new antiepileptic drug with a distinct mechanism of action, shown in regulatory trials to be effective. These controlled trials do not always predict how useful a drug will be in day to day clinical practice. Retention rates can provide a better indication of efficacy and tolerability in everyday use. Patients attending a tertiary referral centre for epilepsy and who received Lev in the first 2 years of its marketing were assessed (n = 811) to determine continuation rates of treatment with this drug. At the last follow up, 65% of patients were still taking Lev, and the estimated 3 year retention rate was 58%. In total, 11% attained seizure freedom of at least 6 months. Patients taking greater numbers of concurrent antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were more likely to discontinue Lev, and those reaching higher maximum daily dosages were less likely to discontinue Lev. The retention rate for Lev compares favourably with that of other new AEDs.

### Status epilepticus prognosis following levetiracetam administration: analysis of loading doses [^fc531691]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Recommended loading doses of levetiracetam (LEV) for status epilepticus (SE) treatment have increased over time. However, this was not evidence-based, and the benefit of the increase remains unclear. The effect of different LEV loading doses on SE prognosis was explored.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of an SE adult registry (January 2016-December 2021), including patients receiving LEV as a second-line SE treatment. Patients were stratified according to LEV loading doses (threshold 35mg/kg). Main outcomes were global mortality, LEV use as last SE treatment, and return to baseline conditions at discharge, exploring LEV as a dichotomized or continuous dose.

Results

Among 202 patients, 44 received LEV at ≥ 35mg/kg and 158 below it. Global mortality, adjusted for SE severity and potentially fatal aetiology, was more frequent in the high LEV dose group (27.2% vs. 17.1%, odds ratio 3.14, 95% confidence interval 1.23–8.06; p = 0.017), whilst LEV prescription as last treatment and return to baseline conditions were comparable. Considering continuous LEV dosages or mortality in ongoing SE, however, no outcome reached statistical significance.

Conclusions

Lower LEV loading doses do not seem to correlate with worse clinical outcome, challenging current guidelines. Further studies, ideally prospective, are needed on this topic.

### SANAD II: dear levetiracetam, the honeymoon is over… [^f39a7b06]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Since its approval and introduction to the market in 1999 as adjuvant therapy for the treatment of focal epilepsy and its following expanded indications for the treatment of generalized epilepsy, myoclonus, pediatric population and ultimately as monotherapy for the treatment of focal epilepsy, levetiracetam (LEV) resulted a very attractive therapeutic alternative for the treatment of different types of epilepsy in multiple clinical scenarios. It was love at first sight.

The draw towards LEV is easy to understand. It is approved for treatment in a broad spectrum of epilepsy types. It is easy to administer and to titrate in a short period of time. It is available in multiple presentations including tablets, oral solution and IV preparations. It is conveniently dosed, well tolerated and has a good safety profile with few medication interactions. It quickly became a medication of choice in the emergency room, the outpatient clinic and the intensive care unit alike. Additionally, it has proven to be a safe alternative for women in childbearing age as it is safe during pregnancy in regards to rate of major fetal malformations and long term neuro-cognitive outcomes. Our relation with LEV seemed to be a long and stable one.

Now, all good relationships have their up and downs. Just as we collectively became more aware of the high prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidities among patients with epilepsyand their association with lower quality of life, it also became apparent that, while generally well tolerated, LEV is associated with an increased risk of behavioral side effects and neuropsychiatric symptoms in up to 13% of adults. These side effects include mood disorders, irritability, agitation, hostility, suicidal ideations and psychosis. These symptoms are more frequently seen in patients with baseline psychiatric symptoms and are reversible with the discontinuation of medication. In my practice, a history of personal or familiar psychiatric illness is the most frequent reason to avoid or closely monitor the use of LEV.

The recent publication of the results of the SANAD II, (Study of Standard and New Antiepileptic Drugs II) trial, seems to rock our relationship with LEV to its core, but, is this a breakup? Is the honeymoon over?

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of ELEPSIA XR is based upon bioavailability studies comparing levetiracetam extended-release tablets to ELEPSIA XR extended-release tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] and the clinical studies described below using immediate-release and extended-release levetiracetam tablets.

The effectiveness of levetiracetam extended-release tablets as adjunctive therapy in partial-onset seizures in adults was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. This was supported by the demonstration of efficacy of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets (see below) in partial seizures in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in adults, as well as a demonstration of comparable bioavailability between the extended-release and immediate-release formulations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] in adults. The effectiveness for levetiracetam extended-release tablets as adjunctive therapy in partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients, 12 years of age and older, was based upon a single pharmacokinetic study showing comparable pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam extended-release tablets in adults and adolescents [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. All studies are described below.

### Levetiracetam add-on for drug-resistant localization related (partial) epilepsy [^dddb2b72]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of patients with epilepsy have a good prognosis and their seizures are well controlled by a single antiepileptic drug. However, up to 30% develop refractory seizures, particularly those with partial seizures. In this review, we summarise the current evidence regarding a new antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant localization related (partial) epilepsy.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of levetiracetam on seizures, side effects, quality of life and cognition, when used as an add-on treatment for patients with a drug-resistant localization related (partial) epilepsy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2000). In addition, we contacted UCB SA (makers of levetiracetam) and experts in the field to seek any ongoing studies or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized placebo controlled add-on trials of levetiracetam in patients with a drug-resistant localization related (partial) epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted relevant data. The following outcomes were assessed: (a) 50% or greater reduction in total seizure frequency; (b) treatment withdrawal (any reason); (c) side effects; (d) cognitive effects; (e) quality of life. Primary analyses were intention to treat. Sensitivity best and worst case analyses were also undertaken. Summary odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for each outcome. Dose response was evaluated in regression models.

Main Results

Four trials (1023 patients) were included. All four trials had data for treatment withdrawal and side effect outcomes. Three trials (904 patients) had data for 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. Three trials (595 patients) had data for quality of life and cognitive outcomes. The overall Odds Ratio (OR) (95% Confidence Interval (CI)) for 50% or greater reduction in total seizure frequency outcome was 3.81 (2.78,5.22). Dose regression analysis shows clear evidence that levetiracetam reduces seizure frequency with an increase in efficacy with increasing dose of levetiracetam. Approximately 15% of patients taking 1000 mg and 20–30% of patients taking 3000 mg levetiracetam per day have a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. Patients were not significantly more likely to have levetiracetam withdrawn, OR (95% CI) 1.25 (0.87,1.80). The following side effects were significantly associated with levetiracetam: dizziness 2.36 (1.21, 4.61) and infection 1.82 (1.05, 3.14) whereas accidental injury was significantly associated with placebo 0.55 (0.32, 0.93). Quality of life and cognitive effect outcomes suggest that levetiracetam has a positive effect on cognition and some aspects of quality of life.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Levetiracetam reduces seizure frequency when used as an add-on treatment for patients with a drug-resistant localization related (partial) epilepsy, and seems well tolerated. Minimum effective and maximum tolerated doses have not been identified. The trials reviewed were of 16–24 weeks duration and results cannot be used to confirm longer term effects. Our results cannot be extrapolated to monotherapy or to patients with other seizure types or epilepsy syndromes. Great care should also be taken with any attempt to apply these results to children.

14.3 Immediate-Release Levetiracetam in Pediatric Patients 4 Years to 16 Years

The use of levetiracetam extended-release tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older is supported by Study 5, which was conducted using immediate-release levetiracetam. ELEPSIA XR is not indicated in pediatric patients below 12 years of age.

Study 5

The effectiveness of immediate-release levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients was established in a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, conducted at 60 sites in North America, in children 4 to 16 years of age with partial seizures uncontrolled by standard antiepileptic drugs (Study 5). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 to 2 AEDs, who still experienced at least 4 partial-onset seizures during the 4 weeks prior to screening, as well as at least 4 partial-onset seizures in each of the two 4-week baseline periods, were randomized to receive either immediate-release levetiracetam or placebo. The enrolled population included 198 patients (levetiracetam N = 101; placebo N = 97) with refractory partial-onset seizures, with or without secondarily generalization. Study 5 consisted of an 8-week baseline period and 4-week titration period followed by a 10-week evaluation period. Dosing was initiated at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. During the treatment period, the immediate-release levetiracetam doses were adjusted in 20 mg/kg/day increments, at 2-week intervals to the target dose of 60 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness in Study 5 was a between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire 14-week randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate (incidence of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency per week). Table 9 displays the results of this study.

The percentage of patients (y-axis) who achieved ≥ 50% reduction in weekly partial-onset seizure frequency over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period) within the two treatment groups (x-axis) in Study 5 is presented in Figure 4.

### Rapid infusion of a loading dose of intravenous levetiracetam with minimal dilution: a safety study [^59aa6f71]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Intravenous antiepileptic drugs are required in patients needing urgent treatment or unable to take oral medication. The safety of intravenous levetiracetam has been established in prospective studies of adult epilepsy and healthy participants. The authors performed a prospective, single-center study to evaluate the safety of a rapid loading dose of intravenous levetiracetam. Patients were divided into 3 equal dosing groups (N = 15 each): 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg (corresponding to maximum doses of 1, 2, and 3 g). Electrocardiogram and safety assessment were performed during the infusion. Ages were 4 to 32 years. Postinfusion serum levetiracetam concentrations were 14 to 189 microg/mL. There were no significant changes in blood pressure, no local infusion site reactions, and no electrocardiogram abnormalities. The authors concluded that high serum levels of parenteral levetiracetam can be achieved rapidly and safely, in a small infusion volume. This finding has important implications for the treatment of status epilepticus.

### Levetiracetam versus phenytoin for second-line treatment of paediatric convulsive status epilepticus (EcLiPSE): a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial [^f5808d05]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Other treatment-related factors might be relevant to the interpretation of our findings. These include the widespread use of levetiracetam as maintenance therapy for many childhood epilepsies because of its broad-spectrum activity and safety profile. In the EcLiPSE trial participants, levetiracetam was the most commonly used oral antiepilepsy drug at the time of presentation. Anecdotally, clinicians are reluctant to give a loading dose of phenytoin to children in convulsive status epilepticus who are on oral maintenance phenytoin because of potential cardiovascular toxicity. There seemed to be no similar concerns for levetiracetam, and no increase in adverse events was observed when giving 40 mg/kg to children already receiving maintenance levetiracetam. A substantial minority of children who present in convulsive status epilepticus for the first time are subsequently commenced on maintenance therapy. Levetiracetam is more likely than phenytoin to be used as maintenance therapy because of phenytoin's adverse event profile and complex pharmacokinetics. One observational study in adults showed that 8% of patients treated with intravenous fosphenytoin for convulsive status epilepticus were subsequently commenced on oral phenytoin, whereas 78% of those treated with intravenous levetiracetam were subsequently commenced on oral levetiracetam. Ease of drug preparation and administration is also a factor in the management of convulsive status epilepticus. Throughout the EcLiPSE trial, levetiracetam was reported by clinical teams in the participating centres to be easier to prepare and administer than phenytoin because of the calculations performed in reconstituting phenytoin, the number of vials required, and procedures needed for its administration; these observations are supported by the scientific literature.

### The LaLiMo trial: lamotrigine compared with levetiracetam in the initial 26 weeks of monotherapy for focal and generalised epilepsy – an open-label, prospective, randomised controlled multicenter study [^102403d6]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Of the newer antiepileptic drugs, lamotrigine (LTG) and levetiracetam (LEV) are popular first choice drugs for epilepsy. The authors compared these drugs with regard to their efficacy and tolerability in the initial monotherapy for epilepsy.

Methods

A randomised, open-label, controlled, parallel group, multicenter trial was conducted to test the superiority of the LEV arm over the LTG arm. The primary endpoint was the rate of seizure-free patients in the first 6 weeks (two-sided Fisher's exact test, α = 0.05, intent-to-treat set). Furthermore, efficacy, tolerability and quality of life were evaluated. The authors included 409 patients aged ≥ 12 years with newly diagnosed focal or generalised epilepsy defined by either two or more unprovoked seizures or one first seizure with high risk for recurrence. Patients were titrated to 2000 mg/day of LEV or 200 mg/day of LTG reached on day 22 or 71, respectively. Two dose adjustments by 500/50 mg were allowed.

Results

The proportions of seizure-free patients were 67.5% (LEV) versus 64.0% (LTG) 6 weeks after randomisation (p = 0.47), and 45.2% (LEV) versus 47.8% (LTG) during the whole treatment period of 26 weeks. The HR (LEV vs. LTG) for seizure-free time was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.22). Adverse events occurred in 74.5% (LEV) versus 70.6% (LTG) of the patients (p = 0.38). Adverse events associated with study discontinuation occurred in 17/204 (LEV) versus 8/201 (LTG) patients (p = 0.07).

Conclusions

There were no significant differences with regard to efficacy and tolerability of LEV and LTG in newly diagnosed focal and generalised epilepsy despite more rapid titration in the LEV arm.

### Continuous subcutaneous levetiracetam in end-of-life care [^b654651e]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Seizures constitute a determining aspect in quality of life and are frequently challenging in palliative care-a field where treatment has yet to be standardised. Levetiracetam-a new generation anticonvulsant-has proved efficacy both through oral, as well as intravenous administration in the general population. This case reports on the use of continuous subcutaneous levetiracetam to effectively control seizures in a terminally ill patient without patent oral route.
