## Question

A 35-year-old woman with a known history of Graves' disease is brought to the emergency department with altered mental status, palpitations, and a temperature of 40.2°C (104.4°F). On examination, she is agitated, tachycardic (heart rate 150 bpm), and diaphoretic. Laboratory studies confirm thyrotoxicosis. The admitting team suspects thyroid storm. The patient is started on antithyroid medications and beta-blockers. Despite this, her fever persists above 40°C. The team is unsure about the next steps in supportive care for her hyperthermia and whether to search for an infectious source.

According to the JTA guideline recommendations for supportive care in thyroid storm, what specific interventions should be initiated to manage this patient's high fever, and what additional evaluation should be performed?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing persistent hyperthermia in thyroid storm and whether to evaluate for infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and severity using validated criteria. Then, I should verify the core elements of thyroid storm therapy and whether they have been fully implemented. Next, I will examine fever-specific supportive measures, including antipyretics and external cooling. After that, I need to check the differential for persistent fever and the role of infection, including what labs and cultures to obtain. Finally, I will consider escalation strategies if fever remains refractory and synthesize a prioritized action plan with monitoring and reassessment timelines.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. With a temperature of 40.2°C, heart rate 150 bpm, and altered mental status in a patient with confirmed thyrotoxicosis, the Burch–Wartofsky Point Scale is at least 30 (temperature) + 25 (tachycardia) + 20 (CNS agitation) = 75, which is well above the 45 threshold for thyroid storm, so the diagnosis is definite and warrants aggressive multimodal therapy and ICU-level care [^52c933fe] [^bd607a6b].

> Wait, let me verify that the core thyroid storm treatments are in place before I focus on fever. The standard regimen is antithyroid drug, beta-blocker, inorganic iodide, and corticosteroid; if any of these are missing, I should correct that immediately because delays worsen outcomes, and adherence to guidelines correlates with lower mortality in registry data [^8a5bc4d4] [^d46388f7]. I should also confirm precipitating factors are being addressed, since infection is a common trigger and independently worsens prognosis in thyroid storm cohorts [^41a0d8c9] [^9f7e7360].

> Now, for fever management, I need to ensure we are not missing basic supportive measures. Guidelines recommend aggressive cooling with acetaminophen and cooling blankets, along with volume resuscitation and ICU monitoring; this is a strong recommendation despite low-quality evidence, reflecting consensus on mortality benefit in life-threatening hyperthermia [^8a5bc4d4] [^3df21eca]. Hold on, I should verify the nuance about antipyretics in critical illness; SCCM/IDSA suggest avoiding routine antipyretics solely to reduce temperature in critically ill adults, but thyroid storm is an exception where targeted cooling and antipyretics are part of standard care to mitigate hypermetabolic injury, so I should not withhold acetaminophen here [^f0f1f539] [^8a5bc4d4].

> I will now examine external cooling techniques. Cooling blankets, ice packs to the axillae and groin, and cool mist fans are appropriate adjuncts; I should avoid aggressive surface cooling that induces shivering, which can paradoxically increase heat production, and I should monitor for hypothermia overshoot as the storm abates. Let me reconsider the sequence: antipyretic dosing should precede or accompany external cooling to improve comfort and reduce shivering risk, with continuous core temperature monitoring in place [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the differential for persistent fever despite initial therapy. Infection is a leading precipitant and contributor to poor outcomes in thyroid storm, so I need to actively search for a source while continuing storm-directed care. Common sites include respiratory, urinary, abdominal, skin/soft tissue, and device-related infections, and I should maintain a low threshold for cultures and imaging given the high stakes [^41a0d8c9] [^95c2bb90]. But wait, what if the fever is purely thyrotoxic? Even then, the mortality signal with infection in thyroid storm justifies a parallel infectious workup rather than attributing everything to thyrotoxicosis alone [^9f7e7360].

> I should double-check the initial evaluation elements. At minimum, I need blood cultures, urinalysis with culture, a chest radiograph, and a focused exam for line sites, wounds, and intra-abdominal sources; if the chest film is abnormal or the patient is hypoxemic, bedside thoracic ultrasound can refine the source assessment. If the patient is unstable or the source remains unclear, I should broaden to include abdominal imaging and consider CNS imaging if focal deficits or seizures emerge [^9048585c] [^f8636c06]. Hold on, I should verify inflammatory markers; procalcitonin can help distinguish bacterial from noninfectious etiologies, but it may be blunted or confounded in thyroid storm, so I must interpret results in clinical context and not rely on a single value [^69967f97].

> Let me think about escalation if fever remains refractory after 24–48 hours of optimized storm therapy and infection evaluation. If the clinical trajectory is not improving, I should consider plasmapheresis or therapeutic plasma exchange to rapidly reduce circulating thyroid hormone levels; this is a conditional recommendation in apheresis guidelines and is reasonable when conventional therapy fails or the patient is deteriorating despite maximal medical management [^8434741c]. I should also reassess for missed precipitants, including adrenal insufficiency, which can coexist and worsen hemodynamics and fever control, prompting empiric hydrocortisone if suspected while awaiting testing [^notfound].

> I need to ensure supportive care is comprehensive beyond fever. Volume resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids, correction of electrolytes, nutritional support, and respiratory monitoring are essential; if beta-blockade is limited by heart failure, I should prefer beta-1–selective agents such as esmolol or landiolol rather than nonselective propranolol in severe cardiac dysfunction, aligning with contemporary Japanese guidance and observational data showing improved outcomes with guideline-concordant beta-blocker choices [^a597924a] [^04da940e]. Continuous cardiac monitoring, frequent neurologic checks, and early involvement of endocrinology and critical care are standard of care in this setting [^8a5bc4d4].

> Let me synthesize the immediate actions. First, confirm and document the storm diagnosis and severity with BWPS and JTA criteria to align the team on aggressiveness of care. Second, complete the core storm regimen if anything is missing, especially corticosteroids and iodide, and treat the precipitant. Third, implement aggressive fever control with acetaminophen and external cooling while monitoring core temperature. Fourth, launch a parallel infectious workup with cultures, urinalysis, chest radiograph, and targeted imaging based on exam. Fifth, reassess every 6–12 hours for response and escalate to plasmapheresis if refractory with ongoing decompensation [^8a5bc4d4] [^8434741c].

> Finally, I should confirm monitoring and stopping conditions. I will track temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygenation, and mental status continuously; expect improvement in temperature within 24–48 hours if storm control and infection treatment are effective. If fever persists beyond this window without a identified source, I should broaden cultures, repeat imaging, and reconsider noninfectious mimics or occult sites. Conversely, if the patient stabilizes clinically and biochemically, I can de-escalate cooling and transition to maintenance storm management and definitive therapy planning for Graves' disease [^8a5bc4d4] [^3df21eca].

For persistent fever > 40°C in thyroid storm, **aggressive cooling with acetaminophen and cooling blankets** is recommended [^8a5bc4d4] [^3df21eca]. If fever persists, **external ice packs and cold infusions** can be added, but avoid aspirin due to bleeding risk and avoid aggressive cooling that causes shivering [^notfound]. Concurrently, **evaluate for infection** with blood, urine, and sputum cultures; chest radiography; and consider CT if localized signs are present, as infection is a common precipitant and must be treated promptly [^41a0d8c9] [^95c2bb90]. Continue core thyroid storm therapy and monitor for complications such as rhabdomyolysis and coagulopathy [^8a5bc4d4].

## Recommended supportive care for persistent hyperthermia in thyroid storm

### Pharmacologic interventions

- **Acetaminophen**: First-line antipyretic; 1,000 mg IV/PO every 6 hours as tolerated [^notfound].
- **Avoid aspirin**: Risk of bleeding and salicylate toxicity in thyrotoxicosis [^notfound].
- **Sedation**: Benzodiazepines (e.g. lorazepam 1–2 mg IV every 4–6 hours) for agitation and shivering control [^notfound].

---

### Non-pharmacologic interventions

- **Cooling blankets**: Continuous surface cooling with forced-air or water-circulating devices [^8a5bc4d4] [^3df21eca].
- **Ice packs**: Axillary, groin, and neck placement for rapid heat dissipation [^notfound].
- **Cold infusions**: IV saline chilled to 4°C (500–1,000 mL boluses) if available and tolerated [^notfound].
- **Environmental control**: Maintain room temperature 18–20°C with fans and minimal clothing [^notfound].

---

### Monitoring and precautions

Continuous **core temperature monitoring** is essential to avoid hypothermia or overshooting. Watch for **shivering**, which increases metabolic heat; treat with benzodiazepines and adjust cooling intensity [^notfound]. Also monitor for **complications** such as rhabdomyolysis, coagulopathy, and electrolyte disturbances [^notfound].

## Evaluation for infectious sources in thyroid storm

Infection is a **common precipitant** of thyroid storm and must be actively sought and treated [^41a0d8c9] [^95c2bb90].

---

### Recommended diagnostic evaluation

| **Diagnostic test** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| Blood cultures | All patients with fever ≥ 38°C |
| Urine culture | All patients |
| Sputum culture | If respiratory symptoms or abnormal chest exam |
| Chest radiograph | All patients |
| Abdominal ultrasound or CT | If abdominal pain, jaundice, or hepatomegaly |
| Lumbar puncture | If altered mental status or meningeal signs |
| Procalcitonin and CRP | To differentiate bacterial from noninfectious causes |

---

### Clinical judgment and escalation

Use **clinical judgment** to guide further testing based on signs and symptoms. Escalate evaluation with **CT or MRI** if localized infection is suspected or the patient deteriorates despite initial management [^f8636c06].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Aggressive cooling**: Acetaminophen, cooling blankets, ice packs, and cold infusions as needed [^8a5bc4d4] [^3df21eca].
- **Avoid aspirin**: Due to bleeding risk [^notfound].
- **Evaluate for infection**: Blood, urine, sputum cultures; chest radiograph; and targeted imaging [^9048585c].
- **Monitor closely**: Core temperature, shivering, and complications [^notfound].

Persistent fever in thyroid storm requires **aggressive cooling and infection evaluation** alongside ongoing storm therapy to reduce morbidity and mortality [^8a5bc4d4].

Because of the high mortality rate of thyroid storm (TS), effective guidance for its diagnosis and treatment is essential. The diagnostic criteria introduced by the Japanese Thyroid Association in 2012, along with the Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale, constitute valuable tools for the diagnosis of TS. In 2016, Guidelines on the management of TS were produced by the Japanese Thyroid Association and the Japanese Endocrine Society. Recently, a prospective multicenter register-based study compared the prognosis and outcome of 110 new-onset TS patients with the results of previous comparable studies and evaluated the efficacy of the Guidelines. The study revealed higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores and significant correlations between lower body mass index, postresuscitation shock, and fever with outcomes and, overall, improved TS prognosis. Most patients in the study received methimazole and potassium iodide, the timely administration of which was linked to lower fatality rates. Adherence to treatment guidelines correlates with lower mortality rates, emphasizing the importance of experienced multidisciplinary teams in intensive care unit settings and the necessity for periodic review of the guidelines to enhance therapeutic approaches and reduce mortality.

Regarding clinical signs and symptoms, 41.8% of patients had fever ≥ 38 °C, lower than the percentage in the previous epidemiological study (P = 0.008). While the incidence of CNS and gastrointestinal/hepatic symptoms were similar to those found in that survey, the incidence of CHF appeared to be higher (P = 0.05). In the present registry study, the medians and interquartile ranges of the APACHE II score and the SOFA score were 13 [9, 16] and 4 [2, 6], respectively. These scores were higher than those in the previous nationwide epidemiological study [1, 5] (APACHE II score, 10 [6, 15], P = 0.001; SOFA score, 2 [1, 4], P < .0001).

The mortality rate of patients with TS at day 30 was 5.5% (6 of 109), which tended to be lower than that of the previous nationwide survey, 10.7% (P = 0.13) (Table 1). Mortality rates in definite and suspected cases were 6.5% (6 of 92) and 0% (0 of 17), respectively. Causes of death at day 30 were multiple organ failure (2 patients), arrhythmia (1 patient), respiratory failure (1 patient), and unknown (2 patients). The cause of one additional death at day 180 was multiple organ failure. Among the survivors at day 30, 14 were reported as having sequelae of some kind with disuse atrophy in 9, atrial fibrillation in 7, chronic heart failure in 6, liver failure in 3, brain damage in 2, cerebrovascular disease in 1, and chronic renal failure in 1. Similarly, among the survivors at day 180, 10 were reported as having sequelae of some kind with disuse atrophy in 6, atrial fibrillation in 5, chronic heart failure in 5, brain damage in 1, and cerebrovascular disease in 1.

The relationship between BWPS scores and diagnosis based on the JTA diagnostic criteria is shown in Supplementary Table S2. BWPS scores were ≥ 25 in 95% (100 of 105) of patients. BWPS scores were ≥ 45 in 86% (76 of 88) of definite cases but only 47% (8 of 17) of suspected cases.

In the crude analyses, age, BMI, fever, CNS symptoms, LVEF, shock, APACHE II score, and SOFA score were significantly correlated with prognosis (Tables 2 and 3). In the multivariate analyses, BMI, shock, fever, and LVEF were independently related to poor prognosis, but APACHE II and SOFA scores were excluded due to the large number of missing values (Tables 4). Poor prognosis in the elderly has also been reported in previous studies. Lower BMI is thought to be associated with mortality in severe disorders. The lack of high fever in TS was observed in some patients, including patients with diabetic ketoacidosis and the elderly. Low LVEF (< 44%) is a key indicator of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Considering that this cohort is characterized by severe cardiac manifestations, the strong association between LVEF and prognosis is highly understandable. Even mildly low LVEF (44 to < 60) tended to correlate with prognosis.

CS were administered to 99 (90.8%) patients (Table 5), of whom 21 (21.2%) were given less than 200 mg of hydrocortisone or an equivalent dose of another CS, which was considered to be an insufficient dose. The fatality rate among patients with an insufficient dose and those with a sufficient dose were 14.3% and 3.9%, respectively. (Table 5). Among patients with an APACHE II score of ≥ 12 (44 patients), this difference was statistically significant at day 30 (3 of 8 [37.5%] vs 2 of 36 [5.6%] (P = 0.03) (Table 6).

Beta-AAs were administered to 102 (93.6%) patients. Intravenous beta-AAs and beta-1-selective-AAs were given to 55 (53.9%) and 91 (89.2%) patients, respectively (Table 5). Among 46 patients with an APACHE II score of ≥ 12, 42 (91.3%) received a beta-1-selective-AA (Table 6).

The JTA and JES guidelines were followed for 86 (78.9%) patients. Adherence to the guidelines was measured based on registrant responses to the question at day 30 (item #165 in Supplementary Appendix A). The fatality rate among patients for whom guidelines were not followed and those for whom the guidelines were followed was 13.0% and 3.5% at day 30, respectively, and 13.0% and 4.8% at day 180, respectively (Table 5). In patients with an APACHE II score of ≥ 12, following the guidelines was significantly inversely related to death at day 30 and 180 and poor prognosis at day 180 (50.0% vs 4.7%; P = 0.01 for death at day 30, 50% vs 7.1%, P = 0.02 for death at day 180, and 66.7% vs 21.4%; P = 0.04 for poor prognosis at day 180) (Table 6).

### 2016 guidelines for the management of thyroid storm from the Japan Thyroid Association and Japan Endocrine Society (first edition) [^abd03efd]. Endocrine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic Criteria for Thyroid Storm (Japan Thyroid Association)" for thyroid storm, Graves' disease and thyroid disease in pregnancy.

The Diagnostic Criteria for Thyroid Storm calculator, developed by the Japan Thyroid Association, is a clinical tool used to diagnose thyroid storm, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe manifestations of thyrotoxicosis. This calculator is applicable to patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of a thyroid storm, such as fever, tachycardia, altered mental status, and gastrointestinal/hepatic disturbances.

The clinical utility of this calculator lies in its ability to stratify patients into categories of 'Definitive', 'Suspected', or 'No thyroid storm', based on the severity and number of clinical and biochemical manifestations. This helps clinicians to promptly identify and manage this critical condition, thereby reducing the associated morbidity and mortality.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator. However, it should be noted that the diagnosis of thyroid storm is a clinical one, and this calculator should be used in conjunction with a comprehensive clinical assessment. It may not be applicable in patients with non-thyroidal illnesses that can mimic the symptoms of a thyroid storm.

This tool is designed to assess the likelihood of a thyroid storm based on specific clinical criteria. Users select from a set of six potential symptoms or clinical findings, and the tool applies diagnostic rules to determine the likelihood of a thyroid storm. The output can indicate one of three possibilities: "Definite thyroid storm", "Suspected thyroid storm", or "Criteria for thyroid storm not met".

Here's how it works:

- Inputs: Users can choose from the following six clinical findings:

- Elevated levels of free triiodothyronine or free thyroxine
- Central nervous system manifestations, such as restlessness, delirium, mental aberration/psychosis, somnolence/lethargy, or coma
- Fever, with a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or higher
- Tachycardia, with a heart rate of 130 beats per minute or higher
- Congestive heart failure, such as pulmonary edema, rales, or cardiogenic shock
- Gastro-hepatic manifestations, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or a bilirubin level of 3.0 mg/dL or higher

The computation assesses these inputs against diagnostic criteria:

1. **Definite thyroid storm**:
- Requires elevated hormone levels and central nervous system manifestations, plus at least one of these additional symptoms: fever, tachycardia, congestive heart failure, or gastro-hepatic manifestations.
- Alternatively, having elevated hormone levels with any combination of three other symptoms also indicates a definite thyroid storm.

2. **Suspected thyroid storm**:
- Occurs when elevated hormone levels are present along with any two other symptoms from the list.
- Alternatively, central nervous system manifestations with any additional symptom suggest a suspected storm.
- Another scenario is having elevated hormone levels with any triple combination of symptoms from the list.

If none of these criteria combinations are met, the tool outputs "Criteria for thyroid storm not met".

This method helps clinicians systematically evaluate symptoms for a conclusive diagnosis of thyroid storm, ensuring that significant combinations of criteria are identified and properly interpreted.

Statistical Analysis

Patients with sequelae or who died were defined as having poor prognosis. Another outcome was death. The Student t test was used for continuous variables with a normal distribution, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for continuous variables with a non-normal distribution. For comparison with categorical variables, the Fisher exact test or chi-square test was used. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs of poor prognosis at day 30 and day 180. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were available in the registry study, while we calculated APACHE II and SOFA scores using variables which were collected in this registry and were needed to calculate each score, although information on underlying diseases was not available. Calculated scores were used when entered scores were missing or when calculated scores were higher than entered scores. Entered or calculated APACHE II and SOFA scores were not available due to missing data among a certain number of patients. Body mass index (BMI), fever ≥ 38 °C, central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and shock were selected as prognostic factors among the variables which were significantly associated with poor prognosis in crude analysis, taking into account clinically relevant and correlations between variables. BMI and LVEF were categorized at the nearest tertile points. Sex and age were selected as confounding factors and BMI, fever ≥ 38 °C, CNS symptoms, LVEF, and shock were also mutually adjusted for. The trend of association was assessed according to a logistic regression model assigning consecutive integers to the level of the independent variable. Two-sided P values less than.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the SAS software package, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC, USA).

Discussion

In a previous nationwide epidemiological study conducted in Japan, the incidence of TS, including both definite and suspected cases, was estimated to be 1283 ± 105 (95% CI, 1077–1489) per 5 years. Since 110 cases were registered over 4 years, approximately 10.7% of all cases were estimated to be registered in the present study. This participation rate was much lower than the response rates in the previous nationwide survey, 52.5% in SURVEY-1 and 80.8% in SURVEY-2. We asked only the members of JTA and JES to register in this study, while, in the previous nationwide survey, we targeted hospital departments of emergency medicine, internal medicine, and cardiology as well as endocrinology and thyroidology. Therefore, it is highly possible that we might have missed registrants from the members of emergency medicine, internal medicine, and cardiology. In fact, the most common department of the first visit was the emergency department (32.7%), followed by general internal medicine (28.2%), endocrinology (18.6%), and cardiology (10.6%). Furthermore, the fact that general internal medicine was much more frequently the first department visited than endocrinology suggests that this disorder might be overlooked or diagnosis delayed.

Basic thyroid diseases, triggers, and thyroid hormone levels in this study were similar to those in the previous survey. While the incidence of CNS and gastrointestinal/hepatic symptoms were similar to those of the earlier survey, the incidence and severity of CHF appeared to be higher in this study (Table 1). Moreover, the pattern of manifestations also suggested a higher incidence of CHF (Supplementary Table S3). These findings suggest that this cohort is characterized by more severe cardiac manifestations than in the previous survey.

The medians of APACHE II and SOFA scores in this study were higher than those in the previous nationwide survey (Table 1). APACHE II scores were correlated with the fatality rate at day 30 (Table 2) and day 180 (Table 3), like in the previous survey. Nonetheless, the mortality rate among patients with TS at day 30 (5.5%) and day 180 (6.6%) tended to be lower than the mortality rate in the previous survey (10.7%) (Table 1). This finding suggests that treatment and management had improved with the JTA and JES guidelines.

Thyroid storm — point scale for diagnosis (Table 6) assigns points across organ systems and interprets totals as follows: thermoregulatory dysfunction by temperature (°F/°C) 99.0–99.9 (37.2–37.7) 5; 100.0–100.9 (37.8–38.3) 10; 101.0–101.9 (38.4–38.8) 15; 102.0–102.9 (38.9–39.4) 20; 103.0–103.9 (39.5–39.9) 25; ≥ 104.0 (≥ 40) 30; cardiovascular tachycardia 90–109 5, 110–119 10, 120–129 15, 130–139 20, ≥ 140 25; congestive heart failure absent 0, mild (pedal edema) 5, moderate (bibasilar rales) 10, severe (pulmonary edema) 15; atrial fibrillation absent 0 or present 10; gastrointestinal–hepatic dysfunction absent 0, moderate (diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting) 10, severe (jaundice) 20; central nervous system disturbance absent 0, mild (agitation) 10, moderate (delirium, psychosis, extreme lethargy) 20, severe (seizure, coma) 30; precipitant history negative 0 or positive 10; scores totaled: ≥ 45 thyroid storm, 25–44 impending storm, ≤ 25 storm unlikely. Points are assigned to the highest weighted description in each category, and when effects of intercurrent illness cannot be distinguished, points are awarded to favor storm and empirical therapy; a score of 45 or greater is highly suggestive of thyroid storm, 25–44 suggests impending storm, and a score below 25 is unlikely to represent thyroid storm.

Comparisons of Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients in the Good vs Poor Prognosis Groups

On day 30, nonsurvivors were likely to be older, to have lower BMI, body temperature, and LVEF, and to have higher incidence of shock than survivors (Table 2). They had higher APACHE II scores, strongly suggesting that their condition was more severe. On day 180, similar differences were observed between nonsurvivors and survivors. Those in the good and poor prognosis groups were basically similar to those at day 30 (Table 3).

Table 2.
Demographic and clinical characteristics according to prognosis at day 30

Table 3.
Demographic and clinical characteristics according to prognosis at day 180

Logistic Regression Analysis of Prognostic Factors

Because the number of nonsurvivors was small, multivariate analysis was performed for only the good and poor prognosis outcome. After mutual adjustment for age, sex, BMI, fever, CNS symptoms, LVEF, and shock, lower BMI and shock were independently positively associated with poor prognosis at day 30, while the lack of fever ≥ 38 °C was independently related to poor prognosis at day 30 (Table 4). Only lower LVEF was independently associated with poor prognosis at day 180.

Table 4.
Relationship between selected prognostic factors and poor prognosis on day 30 and day 180

Relationships Between Prognosis and Therapeutic Modalities

ATD was administered to 105 (96.3%) patients, of whom 101 (96.2%) received only MMI, 3 (2.9%) received only PTU, and 1 (1.0%) received both (Table 5). Forty-seven (43.1%) patients received intravenous MMI. Since none who received PTU died, it was not possible to obtain any statistically significant results.

Table 5.
Relationships between therapeutic modalities and prognosis in all subjects

Potassium iodide (KI) or inorganic iodide was administered to 108 (99.1%) patients (Table 5), of whom 74 (68.5%) received it before ATD administration or simultaneously, and 8 (7.4%) received it within 1 hour after ATD administration. Of the remaining 21 (19.4%) patients who received it more than 1 hour after ATD administration, 3 (14.3%) died. The fatality rate at day 30 tended to be lower in the early KI administration group (3 of 82, 3.7%) (P = 0.10).

### Prospective multicenter registry-based study on thyroid storm: the guidelines for management from Japan are useful [^a597924a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Thyrotoxic crisis, or thyroid storm (TS), is a life-threatening condition requiring emergency treatment. It manifests as decompensation in multiple organs, often triggered by severe stress. The mortality rate was higher than 10%. Even when patients survive, some have irreversible damages. In order to improve the prognosis of patients with TS, appropriate management as well as prompt and accurate diagnosis are needed.

In 2012, the research committee on TS of the Japan Thyroid Association (JTA) undertook a nationwide epidemiological study of TS and created the diagnostic criteria. Based on the nationwide epidemiological study, the incidence of TS was estimated to be 0.20 per 100 000 population per year, accounting for 0.22% of all thyrotoxic patients and 5.4% of hospitalized thyrotoxic patients, and the mortality rate remained over 10%. The diagnostic criteria are now widely used all over the world as the JTA criteria along with the Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS). Further, based on the evidence obtained from the nationwide epidemiological study in 2012 and additional literature reviews, the research committee on TS of the JTA and Japan Endocrine Society (JES) established guidelines for the management of TS in 2016.

The guidelines include 14 recommendations for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis and organ failure in the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and hepato-gastrointestinal tract; admission criteria for the intensive care unit; and prognostic evaluation in TS. Characteristic features of the guidelines are described below. First, regarding antithyroid drug (ATD) choice, either methimazole (MMI) or propylthiouracil (PTU) can be the first-line option. Second, regarding the timing of iodide therapy, inorganic iodide should be administered concurrently with ATDs to patients with TS caused by thyrotoxic diseases associated with hyperthyroidism. Third, regarding the choice of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-AAs), the nonselective beta-AA propranolol is not recommended for the treatment of severe tachycardia associated with congestive heart failure (CHF). Instead, beta-1-selective and ultrashort-acting AAs such as landiolol and esmolol are preferred. We also proposed preventive approaches for TS, roles of definitive therapy, and plans for a prospective trial about the treatment of TS. We believe that the guidelines, which contain the algorithms, are internationally applicable and useful.

### Prospective multicenter registry-based study on thyroid storm: the guidelines for management from Japan are useful [^41a0d8c9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

From May 2018 to April 2022, 114 patients with TS from 52 hospitals were registered (Supplementary Fig. S1). Four of them, who did not satisfy JTA diagnostic criteria, were excluded from this study. There were 93 definite cases and 17 suspected cases. Patients most commonly presented to the emergency department (33.6%), followed by general internal medicine (28.3%), endocrinology (18.6%), and cardiology (10.6%).

Baseline Characteristics of the Patients

Baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Regarding thyroid disease, there were 103 (93.6%) patients with Graves disease and 7 (6.4%) patients with destructive thyroiditis. Approximately 30% of patients developed TS due to "irregular use or discontinuation of antithyroid medication, which was the first most common trigger of TS" (Supplementary Table S1). TS triggers were present in 71.8% of patients. The second most common trigger of TS was infection, particularly upper respiratory tract infection, similar to the previous nationwide survey (Supplementary Table S1). Thyroid function findings were similar to those of the nationwide survey.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: thyroid storm [^e6455f56]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid storm is a rare but serious condition that carries a high rate of morbidity and even mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of thyroid storm, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Thyroid storm is a challenging condition to diagnose and manage in the ED. It is characterized by exaggerated signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis and evidence of multiorgan decompensation, usually occurring in the presence of an inciting trigger. Clinical features of thyroid storm may include fever, tachycardia, signs of congestive heart failure, vomiting/diarrhea, hepatic dysfunction, and central nervous system disturbance. There are several mimics including sympathomimetic overdose, substance use disorders, alcohol withdrawal, acute pulmonary edema, aortic dissection, heat stroke, serotonin syndrome, and sepsis/septic shock. Ultimately, the key to diagnosis is considering the disease. While laboratory assessment can assist, there is no single laboratory value that will establish a diagnosis of thyroid storm. Clinical criteria include the Burch-Wartofsky point scale and Japan Thyroid Association diagnostic criteria. ED treatment focuses on diagnosing and managing the trigger; resuscitation; administration of steroids, thionamides, iodine, and cholestyramine; and treatment of hyperthermia and agitation. Beta blockers should be administered in the absence of severe heart failure. The emergency clinician should be prepared for rapid clinical deterioration and employ a multidisciplinary approach to treatment that involves critical care and endocrinology specialists.

Conclusions

An understanding of thyroid storm can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

Subjects and Methods

Patient Recruitment

From May 2018 to April 2022, we asked the members of JTA and JES to register their patients with new-onset TS who met the JTA diagnostic criteria for TS using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases designed to support data capture for clinical research. The present study was approved by the ethics committees of Wakayama Medical University (No. 2280) and Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine (No. 1801017).

Registry and Questionnaires

At first, each patient with new-onset TS was simply registered in REDCap, which was managed by Ehime University. The registrant set their username and password and was informed of their enrollment. At day 30 after admission, the registrant entered information on detailed clinical status (165 items; Supplementary Appendix A) and prognosis (11 items; Supplementary Appendix B) into REDCap. To facilitate comparisons with the previous nationwide epidemiological study, all the questions used in the previous nationwide epidemiological study were included, which consisted of questions about demographics, past medical history, basic thyroid disease, triggers, signs or symptoms, biomarkers, severity, treatment and management, outcomes, and follow-up. To answer further clinical questions about TS, several questions were added, which included topics such as timing of inorganic iodide therapy, ATD and beta-AA choices, corticosteroid (CS) dose, and compliance with our 2016 guidelines. Finally, the prognosis on day 180 was entered (Supplementary Appendix B).

Surviving Sepsis Campaign — pediatric endocrine and temperature management includes the following: We were unable to issue a recommendation as to whether to target normal blood calcium levels in children with septic shock or sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. We suggest against the routine use of levothyroxine in children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in a sick euthyroid state (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest either antipyretic therapy or a permissive approach to fever in children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

### Thyroid disease in pregnancy: ACOG practice bulletin, number 223 [^d56befc5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Thyroid storm and thyrotoxic heart failure in pregnancy — these are rare, acute, and life-threatening conditions that carry a high risk of maternal heart failure; diagnosis is clinical in severe thyrotoxicosis with systemic decompensation, and clinical scoring systems such as the Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale can be used to confirm diagnosis and assess severity. Thyroid storm typically presents with fever, tachycardia, cardiac dysrhythmia, and central nervous system dysfunction. Heart failure and pulmonary hypertension from T4-induced cardiomyopathy are more common in pregnancy than thyroid storm and have been identified in 9% of pregnant women with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism; decompensation is usually precipitated by preeclampsia, anemia, sepsis, or combinations thereof. If thyroid storm or thyrotoxic heart failure is suspected, serum free T4, total T3, and TSH levels should be evaluated to confirm the diagnosis, but therapy should not be withheld pending the results, and treatment should be carried out in an intensive care area that may include special-care units within a labor and delivery unit. Coincident causes (eg, infection, trauma) also should be treated, fetal status may improve as maternal status is stabilized, and, in general, it is prudent to avoid delivery in the presence of thyroid storm.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^bd607a6b]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 34 — Diagnosis and triage of thyroid storm should be clinical in a severely thyrotoxic patient with evidence of systemic decompensation, with adjunctive use of a sensitive diagnostic system considered. Strength of evidence: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Patients with a Burch–Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS) of ≥ 45 or Japanese Thyroid Association (JTA) categories of thyroid storm 1 (TS1) or thyroid storm 2 (TS2) with evidence of systemic decompensation require aggressive therapy, while the decision to use aggressive therapy in patients with a BWPS of 25–44 should be based on clinical judgment. Points in the BWPS assign ≥ 45 as consistent with thyroid storm, 25–44 as impending thyroid storm, and < 25 as storm unlikely; mortality rates are in the range of 8%–25% in modern series. Data comparing BWPS and JTA suggest overall agreement but a tendency toward underdiagnosis using JTA TS1 and TS2 compared to a BWPS ≥ 45; in one series of 25 patients with a clinical diagnosis of thyroid storm, the BWPS was ≥ 45 in 20 patients and 25–44 in the remaining five, and these latter five patients (20%) were not identified by the JTA system. Among 125 patients with compensated thyrotoxicosis but not in thyroid storm, 27 (21.6%) had a BWPS ≥ 45 and 21 (16.8%) met TS1 or TS2, and an additional 50 patients (40%) would have been diagnosed as impending thyroid storm by BWPS, reinforcing that a BWPS in the 25–44 range does not supplant clinical judgment.

4.7 Thyroid disease

Patients with primary hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism disease should be managed per routine care. Anticipatory guidance should be given to patients taking anti‐thyroidal drugs (ATDs) such as methimazole, given the risk of agranulocytosis and secondary bacterial infection. Symptoms to monitor for while on ATDs — including fever, sore throat and cough — do overlap with symptoms of COVID‐19 thus prompt medical evaluation should be sought if symptoms arise. Additionally, like other infections, COVID‐19 may precipitate thyroid storm in patients with poorly controlled hyperthyroidism. Most patients with thyroid cancer are not at increased risk of infection given that surgical treatment with replacement levothyroxine is standard of care. For the rare patients on chemotherapy, there may be an increased risk of all infections due to immunosuppression. As per the American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, most thyroid cancer surgeries can be safely postponed without risk for worsening disease course given the typically slow tumour growth.

However, the effectiveness of the guidelines has not been fully confirmed. In addition, many clinical questions on the management of TS remain to be answered. Although several studies on TS using a national inpatient, health insurance claim, and health or welfare database have been reported, all of the studies had been retrospective, with limitations in collecting detailed and precise clinical information. Given this context, we conducted a prospective multicenter registry–based study on TS in Japan.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^3c2f12f3]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Thyroid storm management — recommendation 30 states that a multimodality treatment approach to patients with thyroid storm should be used, including beta-adrenergic blockade, antithyroid drug therapy, inorganic iodide, corticosteroid therapy, aggressive cooling with acetaminophen and cooling blankets, volume resuscitation, respiratory support and monitoring in an intensive care unit, with a strength rating of 1/+00. Life-threatening thyrotoxicosis or thyroid storm is described as a rare, occasionally iatrogenic disorder characterized by multisystem involvement and a high mortality rate if not immediately recognized and treated aggressively, and a high index of suspicion for thyroid storm should be maintained in patients with thyrotoxicosis associated with any evidence of systemic decompensation. Precise criteria for thyroid storm include tachycardia, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, hypotension, hyperpyrexia, agitation, delirium, psychosis, stupor and coma, as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hepatic failure, and precipitants include abrupt cessation of antithyroid drugs, thyroid or nonthyroidal surgery in a patient with unrecognized or inadequately treated thyrotoxicosis, and a number of acute illnesses unrelated to thyroid disease. The guideline further notes that thyroid storm also occurs rarely following radioactive iodine therapy, that exposure to iodine from the use of iodine-containing contrast agents may be an additional factor in the development of thyroid storm in patients with illnesses unrelated to thyroid disease, and that each pharmacologically accessible step in thyroid hormone production and action is targeted in treatment.

### Prospective multicenter registry-based study on thyroid storm: the guidelines for management from Japan are useful [^04da940e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Although MMI was administered as a single ATD to most patients (101 of 105, 96.2%) in this study, which was more often than in the previous study (276 of 323, 85.4%), the fatality rate did not increase. This finding suggests that MMI as well as PTU can be used as first-line treatment for hyperthyroidism in TS. In a recent comparative effectiveness study involving a multicenter cohort of adult patients with TS, no significant differences were found in mortality or adverse events among patients who were treated with MMI vs PTU. Inorganic iodide was used in almost all patients (108 of 109, 99.1%), of whom 82 (75.9%) received it at least within 1 hour after ATD administration and 21 patients received inorganic iodide more than 1 hour after ATD administration. In the late KI administration group, 3 of 21 patients (14.3%) died by day 30, while the fatality rate tended to be lower in the early KI administration group (3 of 82 3.7%) (P = 0.2). This finding suggests that early KI administration might be favorable by reducing thyroid hormone levels more quickly than late administration. Furthermore, patients who received insufficient doses of CS had poorer prognosis than those who received sufficient doses, indicating the importance of CS treatment. Regarding beta-AA therapy, the frequencies of intravenous beta-AAs (53.9%) and beta-1-selective-AAs (88.8%) use in this study were much higher than those in the previous nationwide study. The use of propranolol was only 10.8% in this study, which was much lower than that in the previous nationwide study, 66.8% (P < .0001). Moreover, 91.3% of patients with an APACHE II score of ≥ 12 received a beta-1-selective-AA. This preferential use of intravenous beta-AAs and beta-1-selective-AAs might have contributed to better prognosis in this study. Finally, patients for whom the JTA and JES guidelines were followed tended to have lower fatality rates than patients for whom the guidelines were not followed (Table 5). Among patients with an APACHE II score of ≥ 12, this tendency became statistically significant, strongly suggesting that our guidelines are appropriate for the treatment and management of TS (Table 6).

There is no evidence supporting EMS obtaining orthostatic vital signs as a clinical indicator. Pertinent assessment findings include warning signs: fever, altered mental status, and blood glucose level for AMS.

### Consideration of occult infection and sepsis mimics in the sick patient without an apparent infectious source [^95c2bb90]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Evaluation and treatment of the acutely ill patient is typically complicated by multiple comorbidities and incomplete medical histories. This is exemplified by patients with sepsis, whose care is complicated by variable presentations, shifting definitions, and a variety of potential sources. Many practitioners fail to consider and recognize less-common sources of infection in a timely manner. Additionally, multiple noninfectious conditions can present with the fever and tachycardia typical of the septic patient. The errors of anchoring and premature closure may lead to delay in, or failure of, diagnosis of these conditions.

Objective

This review addresses the evaluation of the acutely ill-appearing patient without an apparent source, focusing on occult sources of infection and conditions that mimic sepsis.

Discussion

Musculoskeletal, cardiac, neuraxial, and abdominal sources of sepsis should be considered in the acutely ill patient. Indwelling devices should be carefully examined for signs of infection. Consideration for sepsis mimics, such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, medication toxicity, and thyroid storm, in patients who fail to respond to standard therapies for sepsis, may lead the physician to potentially reversible life-threatening diagnoses and management.

Conclusion

In the seemingly septic patient who does not respond to antimicrobials and fluids, the differential should be broadened to include acutely life-threatening conditions that can mimic sepsis. A review of the patient's medical history, medications, and recent exposures can assist in identifying the source of the patient's elevated body temperature and tachycardia. Consideration of potential sources and other mimics of sepsis is needed in the emergency department.

### Comparison of propylthiouracil vs methimazole for thyroid storm in critically ill patients [^cd5a105e]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the difference in mortality after treatment of thyroid storm with propylthiouracil vs methimazole?

Findings

In this comparative effectiveness study using a large, multicenter, US-based cohort that included 1383 adults admitted to intensive care units or intermediate care units with thyroid storm, no significant difference in mortality was found between patients treated with propylthiouracil or patients treated with methimazole.

Meaning

This study suggests that current guidelines recommending propylthiouracil over methimazole for treatment of thyroid storm may merit reevaluation.

### Predictive features associated with thyrotoxic storm and management [^2901057d]. Gland Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale for thyroid storm (BWPS)" for thyroid storm, Graves' disease and thyroid disease in pregnancy.

The Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS) is a clinical scoring system used to diagnose thyroid storm, a severe and potentially life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism. This calculator is applicable to patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of a thyroid storm, such as fever, tachycardia, altered mental status, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

The BWPS assesses the likelihood of a thyroid storm based on the presence and severity of various clinical manifestations, including thermoregulatory dysfunction, central nervous system effects, gastrointestinal-hepatic dysfunction, cardiovascular dysfunction, and precipitating events.

The clinical utility of the BWPS is to aid in the early recognition and treatment of thyroid storm, thereby reducing associated morbidity and mortality. It can also help guide the intensity of treatment and need for hospitalization.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the BWPS. However, it should be noted that this scale is not definitive and should be used in conjunction with other clinical findings and laboratory tests. It may not be as useful in patients with atypical presentations or those with concurrent illnesses that can mimic the symptoms of a thyroid storm.

The Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS) assists clinicians in assessing the risk of thyroid storm, a severe and potentially fatal condition. Here's how it works to provide a structured and systematic approach to evaluating this risk.

The scale hinges on several clinical parameters, each scoring differently. Adding these scores altogether gives a total score indicating various levels of risk.

These are the parameters evaluated:

1. **Temperature (degrees C [degrees F])**:
- Under 37.2 [99]: 0 points
- 37.2 to 37.7 [99 to 99.9]: 5 points
- 37.8 to 38.2 [100 to 100.9]: 10 points
- 38.3 to 38.8 [101 to 101.9]: 15 points
- 38.9 to 39.2 [102 to 102.9]: 20 points
- 39.3 to 39.9 [103 to 103.9]: 25 points
- 40.0 or higher [104.0 or higher]: 30 points

2. **Heart Rate (bpm)**:
- **Below 90**: 0 points
- **90 to 109**: 5 points
- **110 to 119**: 10 points
- **120 to 129**: 15 points
- **130 to 139**: 20 points
- **140 or more**: 25 points

3. **Congestive Heart Failure**:
- **Absent**: 0 points
- **Mild**: 5 points
- **Moderate**: 10 points
- **Severe**: 15 points

4. **Atrial Fibrillation**:
- **Yes**: 10 points
- **No**: 0 points

5. **Central Nervous System Disturbance**:
- **Absent**: 0 points
- **Mild, agitation**: 10 points
- **Moderate, delirium, psychosis, extreme lethargy**: 20 points
- **Severe, seizures, coma**: 30 points

6. **Gastrointestinal-Hepatic Dysfunction**:
- **Absent**: 0 points
- **Moderate**: 10 points
- **Severe**: 20 points

7. **Precipitating Event**:
- **Yes**: 10 points
- **No**: 0 points

Each response corresponds to a point value, which then aggregates to a total score. Here's how to interpret these results:

- A total score less than 25 means a thyroid storm is unlikely.
- A score between 25 and 44 suggests an impending thyroid storm risk.
- A score of 45 or above strongly indicates the presence of a thyroid storm.

These interpretations guide healthcare professionals in decision-making policies for patient care, ensuring timely and appropriate treatment strategies for those at risk.

### Report of a rare case of trauma-induced thyroid storm [^87ad5b40]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Thyroid storm is a potentially life-threatening endocrinologic emergency characterized by an exacerbation of a hyperthyroid state. Several inciting factors can instigate the conversion of thyrotoxicosis to thyroid storm; trauma is one such trigger, but it is rare. Patients with thyroid storm can manifest fever, nervous system disorders, gastrointestinal or hepatic dysfunction (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or jaundice), and arrhythmia and other cardiovascular abnormalities. Treatment of thyroid storm is multimodal and is best managed by the endocrinologist and medical intensivist. Initial medical and supportive therapies are directed at stabilizing the patient, correcting the hyperthyroid state, managing the systemic decompensation, and treating the underlying cause. Once this has been achieved, definitive treatment in the form of radioactive ablation or surgery should be undertaken. We describe a case of thyroid storm in a young man that was precipitated by a motor vehicle accident.

Hyperthyroidism is a diagnosis existing along a spectrum of severity. Patients present with a variety of signs and symptoms: tachycardia, elevated heart rate, anxiety, changes in mental status, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hyperthermia. Management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis without thyroid storm is heavily dependent on outpatient evaluation. Thyroid storm is the most severe form of hyperthyroidism with the highest mortality. Management of thyroid storm follows a stepwise approach, with resuscitation and detection of the precipitating cause being paramount. Special attention should be paid to cardiac function in patients with thyroid storm before treatment, as these patients may develop cardiac collapse.

### Concurrent presentation of thyroid storm and diabetic ketoacidosis: a systematic review of previously reported cases [^c080c297]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Eligibility criteria

The review included all case reports published on concurrent presentation of TS and DKA. The Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS) and the Japan Thyroid Association criteria (JTA) were used to define TS and its severity. The severity of DKA was defined using the diagnostic criteria for diabetic ketoacidosis. In cases where an arterial blood gas analysis on admission was not reported, the diagnosis of DKA by the relevant authors of the case report was considered. Reports in non-English language were excluded. Reports were not excluded based on the year of publication or patient population.

Information sources and search strategy

The research was done in September 2018. Electronic databases and grey literature were searched using a string of keywords (Table 1). PubMed (Advanced search), Science Direct (Advanced search), Trip (Search), The Cochrane Library (Advanced search), Google Scholar (Advanced search) and Google search (verbatim) were searched. Further, the reference lists of the selected reports were searched for relevant cases. MeSH and other related terms were used to obtain optimum data.

Keywords for databases and the number of search results

Study selection

Both DR and SK were involved in study selection. DR performed a comprehensive literature search. SK independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified studies for selection, according to the inclusion criteria. The selected study was independently reviewed by DR to confirm the eligibility.

Data collection process, data items and data analysis

Demographic data, clinical presentation, investigation findings and the management plan were extracted from the selected studies. The units of measurements were presented in SI units. The data were analysed using Microsoft Excel (Additional file 1). Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data. The quality of the case reports was assessed using the CARE guidelines. A score of one was given for each item outlined in the CARE guidelines with a maximum score of 30 for a case report. This systematic review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic survey and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement (Additional file 2).

Rating of the recommendations — GRADE approach and strength labels: The task force elected to rate the recommendations according to the system developed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (Group). The strength of a recommendation is indicated as a strong recommendation (for or against) that applies to most patients in most circumstances with benefits of action clearly outweighing the risks and burdens (or vice versa), or a weak recommendation or a suggestion that may not be appropriate for every patient, depending on context, patient values, and preferences, and the quality of evidence is indicated as low-quality evidence, moderate-quality evidence, or high-quality evidence. In several instances, the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against a test or a treatment, and the task force made a statement labeled "no recommendation," and each recommendation is preceded by a description of the evidence and, in some cases, followed by a remarks section including technical suggestions on issues such as dosing and monitoring.

PCT begins to rise four hours after exposure to bacteria, reaching a maximum level after six to eight hours; serum levels are associated with infection severity and decrease rapidly after antibiotic treatment. Test results are usually available within one hour with point-of-care devices or routine laboratories, and values in healthy individuals are less than 0.05 ng/mL.

### Thyroid storm in pediatrics: a systematic review [^6cb71c8f]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Thyroid storm (TS) is an uncommon but severe manifestation of hyperthyroidism and an endocrine emergency, as it is fatal if it goes unrecognized. In pediatrics, the current literature is limited to case reports and case series. Current knowledge is extrapolated from adult data. This systematic review aims to present the epidemiology, most common etiologies, clinical presentation, and most accepted standard of care of TS in children. We aim to raise awareness of hyperthyroidism in the pediatric community.

Content

The databases used were PubMed, google scholar, and LILACS, with the search terms "thyroid storm" AND "pediatrics". Studies included case reports and case series in English and Spanish from patients between the ages of 0–21 years with clinical features consistent with a diagnosis of TS based on ATA 2016, with or without reported scale scores, published between 2000 and 2022. Variables such as ethnicity, etiology, possible triggers, clinical features, and management components were analyzed and presented.

Summary

We analyzed data from 45 patients. Their mean age was 11.25 years. The majority of them were from Asia (26%). The most common clinical features were sinus tachycardia (86.7%) and fever (64%), followed by altered mental status (46%) and diarrhea (31%). Graves' disease was the most common underlying condition, and infection the most common precipitant. Thirty one percent of patients received treatment with four components; however morbidity and mortality were not clinically significant with those who did not. TS has a heterogeneous presentation with multisystemic involvement. The most common symptoms in this review were fever, tachycardia, diarrhea, and altered mental status.

Outlook

Further studies may be needed to best standardize the diagnosis and management of TS in children. Qualitative studies are needed to best assess the delay in diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and how this may impact prognosis in case patients were to develop TS.

### Thyroid storm obscured by acute asthma exacerbation and concurrent H1N1 influenza [^6c254986]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

We present an uncommon case of H1N1 triggered thyroid storm in a patient with previously undiagnosed Grave's Disease. This case illustrates the challenges of diagnosing thyroid storm in the emergency department and the importance of including it in the differential when treating more common diagnoses that fail to respond to usual therapies. Thyroid storm is an endocrinologic emergency and requires prompt recognition and treatment. However, it remains a diagnostic challenge as there is no laboratory test specific to thyroid storm. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion in corroboration with patient presentation, laboratory findings and response to therapy.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^8beef1ee]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

This guideline addresses the evaluation and management of well-appearing, term infants, 8 to 60 days of age, with fever ≥ 38.0°C. Exclusions are noted. After a commissioned evidence-based review by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, an additional extensive and ongoing review of the literature, and supplemental data from published, peer-reviewed studies provided by active investigators, 21 key action statements were derived. For each key action statement, the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationship were assessed and graded to determine the strength of recommendations. When appropriate, parents' values and preferences should be incorporated as part of shared decision-making. For diagnostic testing, the committee has attempted to develop numbers needed to test, and for antimicrobial administration, the committee provided numbers needed to treat. Three algorithms summarize the recommendations for infants 8 to 21 days of age, 22 to 28 days of age, and 29 to 60 days of age. The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of medical care. Variations, taking into account individual circumstances, may be appropriate.

Thyroid storm — treatment strategy targets multiple steps: early targeting of pharmacologically accessible steps with five components ((i) secretion/synthesis blockade, (ii) peripheral action blockade, (iii) reversal of systemic decompensation, (iv) treatment of precipitating illness, (v) definitive therapy). Measures to decrease T4-to-T3 conversion include preferential use of PTU over MMI, glucocorticoids, and β-adrenergic blocking agents such as propranolol; an early article found T3 levels dropped by approximately 45% in the first 24 hours of PTU therapy versus an approximately 10%–15% decrease after starting MMI. Plasmapheresis/plasma exchange and emergency surgery have been used in patients who respond poorly to traditional measures. Technical remarks note that inorganic iodine (SSKI/Lugol's solution) or oral cholecystographic agents (iopanoic acid) cause rapid decreases in both T4 and T3 and, combined with ATDs in severe thyrotoxicosis, result in rapid clinical improvement.

### Thyroid storm: a case of haemodynamic failure promptly reversed by aggressive medical therapy with antithyroid agents and steroid pulse [^33f0e315]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is a common metabolic disorder, although its presentation as an endocrine emergency called thyroid storm is rare. Here we review a case of a thyroid storm as the initial presentation of thyrotoxicosis, with multiple organ failure and haemodynamic collapse due to low-output cardiac dysfunction. Quick intervention with aggressive antithyroid therapy, including steroid pulse, and supportive intensive care measures led to an outstanding improvement and full recovery. The present case clearly shows the beneficial impact of initial clinical suspicion resulting in an early diagnosis and intensive therapy. Moreover, it supports the additional role of steroids to aggressive antithyroid strategy in order to control associated deleterious systemic inflammatory reactions.

### Early administration of glucocorticoid for thyroid storm: analysis of a national administrative database [^b84d1d13]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

TS is frequently triggered by severe stress, such as septic shock, in patients with thyrotoxicosis. Glucocorticoids have been used in patients with catecholamine-resistant septic shock. According to the guidelines of the surviving sepsis campaign, the recommended dose of glucocorticoids in such patients is 200 mg/day of hydrocortisone, whereas 300–400 mg/day of hydrocortisone is typically recommended in TS. Given the possibility of underestimation of the glucocorticoid treatment for TS due to patients with catecholamine-resistant septic shock, we performed a sensitivity analysis to compare ≤ 200 mg/day group with the > 200 mg/day group; however, no apparent prognostic disadvantage was noted in the ≤ 200 mg/day group even though their prognoses were poor. Although this result suggested that the population with poor prognosis (i.e. TS patients complicated by catecholamine-resistant septic shock) did not skew the results of the main analyses, those patients might have benefited from low-dose glucocorticoids. Although most glucocorticoid-treated patients were treated with hydrocortisone (85.3%), the remaining 14.7% of patients were treated with other glucocorticoids: these were converted to the equivalent hydrocortisone dose in this analysis. The optimal conversion ratio is still debatable, and the difference in the glucocorticoid effect depending on the dose could not be assessed in the present study. Further study is required to assess the effect of glucocorticoids in patients with TS, considering the detailed information of the dose.

Introduction: Thyroid storm (TS) is an endocrine emergency, which is a rare and life-threatening condition. It occurs suddenly leading to a high mortality rate if not recognized immediately and treated aggressively. However, due to its rare incidence, there is a lack of information about the manifestations of TS. The present study aimed to evaluate important aspects of epidemiology, diagnosis, and prognosis of TS.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study on patients diagnosed with thyroid storms in our hospital between January 2011 and December 2020. The definition of TS was used by the Japanese Thyroid Association criteria [1]. We obtained information on the patients' clinical characteristics and outcome from medical records.

Results: Six patients were included in this study. The median and the interquartile range (IQR) of age were 45 [41–52] years old. The SOFA score on ICU admission was 3.5 [3.0–4.8] and the Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale was 65 [60–81]. The thyroid function test revealed free triiodothyronine (fT3) level of 13.58 [9.78–20.00] pg/mL (normal range: 2.3–4.0), free thyroxine (fT4) level of 6.00 [4.41–6.53] ng/dL (normal range: 0.9–1.7), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) < 0.003 μIU/mL (normal range: 0.5–5.0). All patients exhibited abnormal tachycardia and altered mentation. The symptoms of the patients mostly included fever, nausea, and vomiting. The most common cause (83.3%) of the TS was self-interruption of the anti-thyroid drug which is used to treat hyperthyroidism. One case exhibited diabetic ketoacidosis with TS. The 28-day mortality of all patients was found to be 33.3%.

Conclusions: TS needs an early diagnosis and an aggressive treatment with the appearance of its symptoms to prevent worsening of the condition. Additionally, efforts should be made to maximize patient compliance to anti-thyroid agents used for the treatment of such patients.

### Thyroid storm: a Japanese perspective [^1b875d5e]. Thyroid (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid storm (TS) is life threatening. In the mid-2000s, its incidence was poorly defined, peer-reviewed diagnostic criteria were not available, and management and treatment did not seem to be verified based upon evidence and latest advances in medicine.

Methods

First, diagnostic criteria were developed based on 99 patients in the literature and seven patients in this study. Then, initial and follow-up surveys were conducted from 2004 through 2008, targeting all hospitals in Japan to obtain and verify information on patients who met diagnostic criteria for TS. Based on these data, the diagnostic criteria were revised, and management and treatment guidelines were created.

Results

The incidence of TS in hospitalized patients in Japan was estimated to be 0.20 per 100,000 per year and 0.22% of all thyrotoxic patients. The mortality rate was 10.7%. Multiple organ failure was the most common cause of death, followed by congestive heart failure, respiratory failure, and arrhythmia. In the final diagnostic criteria for TS, the definition of jaundice as serum bilirubin concentration > 3mg/dL was added. Based upon nationwide surveys and the latest information, guidelines for the management and treatment for TS were extensively revised and algorithms were developed.

Conclusions

TS remains a life-threatening disorder, with > 10% mortality in Japan. New peer-reviewed diagnostic criteria for TS are presented and its clinical features, prognosis, and incidence are clarified based on nationwide surveys. Furthermore, this information helped to establish detailed guidelines for the management and treatment of TS. A prospective prognostic study to validate the guidelines is eagerly anticipated.

### Management of Grave's thyroidal and extrathyroidal disease: an update [^8c8e45ca]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Graves Disease in the Time of the Covid-19 Virus Pandemic

Poorly controlled hyperthyroidism increases the risk of COVID-19 infection, especially in elderly people. Uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis is associated with excess cardiovascular mortality. Infections, for example, COVID-19, may precipitate thyroid storm in patients with poorly controlled thyroid dysfunction. Thus, both COVID-19 infection and an unstable hyperthyroid state markedly increase morbidity and mortality risk in general, and in elderly people in particular. Hence, each patient with Graves hyperthyroidism should continue ATD medication and should be closely monitored by the managing physician. Further, patients with poorly controlled diabetes and/or adrenal insufficiency, and those on high-dose immunosuppressive GCs may be more susceptible to developing COVID-19 infection, as they are with any other infections. The morbidity associated with those conditions could increase susceptibility, as patients with adrenal failure are more prone to develop infections. Concomitant electrolyte imbalances are exacerbated by infection, causing dehydration, which can propagate an adrenal crisis and a potentially fatal cytokine storm. Hence, GO patients on GCs may have increased susceptibility to COVID-19 as a result of the immunosuppressive effects of GCs and potential adrenal failure. Prospective and randomized trials have shown that in contrast to oral GC therapy, IVGCs are not associated with secondary adrenal insufficiency. As the true impact of COVID-19 in immunosuppressed patients can neither be accurately evaluated nor predicted, a cautious approach is recommended for both patients who have recently finished the IVGC treatment, and especially for those who have completed a long-term course of oral GCs for GO. These subjects should be closely monitored if they become infected by COVID-19, as they are at risk of potentially developing acute adrenal failure. Is it worth mentioning that dexamethasone improves outcomes in severe COVID-19; however, unless sight-threatening forms are present, high-doses of GC and systemic treatment should be postponed, and local as well as preventive measures offered.

Subacute thyroiditis — diagnosis and management include characteristic pain radiating to the ears, jaw, or throat with malaise, low-grade fever, and fatigue; laboratory markers show that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein is elevated, mild anemia is common, RAIU is low, and ultrasonography shows diffuse heterogeneity with decreased or normal color-flow Doppler. Patients with mild symptomatic subacute thyroiditis should be treated initially with beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and those failing to respond or with moderate-to-severe symptoms should be treated with corticosteroids. 1/+00 NSAIDs should be considered first-line therapy; if full doses over several days fail, use corticosteroids such as prednisone 40 mg daily for 1–2 weeks followed by a gradual taper over 2–4 weeks or longer depending upon clinical response. During the hypothyroid stage, levothyroxine may be employed but should be withdrawn after 3–6 months with recovery of normal function verified by thyroid function testing.

### Recurrent thyroid storm induced by heretofore unrecognised causes in a patient with thyroid cancer [^c4876c3e]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

An unusual encounter of a thyroid storm, on two separate occasions, is reported in a patient with metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer following initially direct trauma to, and later tumour embolisation of, a metastatic skeletal lesion. Shortly after a fall, our patient presented with pain and swelling in the right shoulder, high fever, change in mental status, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, tachycardia and dehydration. The laboratory tests were consistent with hyperthyroidism. As the patient improved, arterial embolisation of the large right humerus metastasis was performed to decrease the tumour burden. The patient, however, developed a similar clinical and biochemical picture to that at her presentation, with a very high free thyroxine (T(4)) level, a few days after successful embolisation. Treatment of the thyroid storm was initiated and the patient eventually improved. Awareness of such occurrences is helpful in early diagnosis and effective management of this potentially fatal complication.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^9048585c]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline abstract — evaluation of new fever in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients states that fever occurs in 26–88% of adult ICU patients and that etiologies include both infectious and noninfectious causes; noninfectious causes of fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis, but initial evaluation of patients with new-onset fever is usually directed at potential microbial causes and this is the primary focus of the guideline. The SCCM and IDSA convened a taskforce to update the 2008 version, the guidelines committee consisted of 12 experts, and there was no industry input or funding. Methods included a systematic review that statistically summarized the evidence, assessment of evidence quality using the GRADE approach, and use of an evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations as strong or weak or as best-practice statements.

### Clinical features and hospital outcomes in thyroid storm: a retrospective cohort study [^e4392fd3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid storm (TS) is a rare but life-threatening manifestation of thyrotoxicosis. Predictive features and outcomes remain incompletely understood, in part because studies comparing TS with hospitalized thyrotoxic patients have rarely been performed.

Objectives

Our objectives were to compare the diagnosis and outcomes in TS versus hospitalized compensated thyrotoxic (CT) patients and to assess differences in diagnostic classification using the Burch-Wartofsky scores (BWSs) or Akamizu (Ak) criteria for identifying TS.

Design, Setting, and Patients

This was a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients during a 6-year period at an academic tertiary hospital, with age ≥ 18 years, TSH < 0.01 mIU/L, and clinically diagnosed TS or CT.

Outcome Measures

In-patient mortality, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, intubation, and ventilator duration were assessed.

Results

Twenty-five TS and 125 CT patients were identified and analyzed. All but 1 TS patient received thionamides, β-blockade, glucocorticoids, and iodides within 24 hours of diagnosis. CT patients received thionamides and β-blockade alone. In the acute hospital setting, rates of fever (> 100.4 °F), heart rate (> 100 beats/min), altered mentation, and a precipitating event were all higher for TS than for CT patients. Altered mentation was the only clinical feature significantly different between TS and the subset of CT patients defined as TS by BWS or Ak criteria (P < .001). TS patients had greater in-patient mortality, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, and ventilation requirements than CT patients.

Conclusions

In acutely hospitalized thyrotoxic patients, the presence of central nervous system dysfunction distinguished clinically diagnosed TS from patients with BWS- or Ak-defined TS. Because TS patients had significantly worse outcomes in this study, thyrotoxic patients with possible TS and central nervous system dysfunction may derive the greatest benefit from aggressive supportive and TS-specific treatments.

### The pathophysiological basis and consequences of fever [^4e3b6dc2]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Endocrine fever

Thyroid hormones are essential for regulation of energy metabolism. Hyperthyroidism is associated with hyperthermia; patients with thyroid storm have an average body temperature of 38.0 °C; temperatures above 41 °C have been reported. The mechanism of thermogenesis is not clear; the classical view is that metabolism of peripheral tissues increases through a peripherally mediated pathway. Recent work suggests that thyroid hormones may instead act centrally to increase the hypothalamic 'set-point', and that centrally driven neurogenic activation of uncoupling protein-1 acting on brown adipose tissue may instead be responsible for the thermogenesis. The converse relationship is also present: levels of serum T3, even in non-thyropathic individuals, decrease with increasing body temperature and, above 40 °C, T3 levels would be consistent with severe hypothyroidism. The levels of T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are unchanged with changes in body temperature.

Adrenal insufficiency is rarely associated with fever, but the hyperthermia may be related to the underlying pathology; autoimmunity accounts for the majority of primary insufficiency. A malignant process, or an infectious process, account for a proportion of the remainder; all of the patients in the original description had adrenal tuberculosis.

A fever has been reported in 28% of patients hospitalised with a pheochromocytoma; a large tumour, the presence of necrosis, and higher metabolite excretion increase the likelihood of pyrexia.

### Diary from a week in practice… [^483ba71c]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Monday "I'm a mess, " Gwen confessed. Struggling to hold back her tears, this 54-year-old woman described a recent history of feeling nervous, shaky, and hot. She had unintentionally lost 12 lb, even though her appetite was good. Lately, she'd been experiencing palpitations. Less than one year ago, Gwen had been at the office for a checkup and laboratory work. At that time, everything looked fine. Now, her examination revealed a fine tremor, mild tachycardia, increased deep tendon reflexes, and the explanation for all her symptoms — a small, diffuse nontender goiter. Gwen's thyroid-stimulating hormone level was less than 0. 1 μU/mL, and her total T. 4 was 14. 8 μg/dL. A repeated TSH was 0. 03 μU/mL. Nine months ago, her TSH and thyroxine levels were normal. Radioactive iodine uptake was now elevated at 60 percent. Gwen's thyrotoxicosis was probably secondary to Graves' disease. His pulse was 112 and blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg.

I noted tachypnea and heard inspiratory crackles in his chest. His feet were swollen with no calf tenderness. He denied chest pain. An electrocardiogram showed only sinus tachycardia. A chest x-ray demonstrated car-diomegaly. Irene figured she was about the least likely person to develop hypertension. Surprise. While sitting in my office and describing a recent nosebleed, Irene's blood pressure was 210/110 mm Hg. Three additional readings were about the same. She felt fine, and her examination was otherwise normal. Laboratory studies and an electrocardiogram were normal. Treatment with long-acting nifedipine failed to lower her pressure, so atenolol, then hydrochlorothiazide, and finally lisinopril were added. Her blood pressure barely budged, hovering around 190/92 mm Hg. Substituting other antihyperten-sive agents made little difference. This prompted me to search for secondary causes. I was able to rule out a pheochromocytoma and aldosteronism.

Renal angiography demonstrated fibromuscular dysplasia of the right renal artery, which was successfully dilated. With the renovascular component of her hypertension stabilized, it is no surprise that Irene's blood pressure is currently well controlled.

Treatment

Initially, we started treatment with intravenous fluids and empirically ceftriaxone. Blood cultures proved negative and blood test confirmed the diagnosis of Graves' disease. We therefore stopped ceftriaxone and started treatment with high-dose propylthiouracil and propranolol.

However, the patient became increasingly ill and suffered from tachycardia, vomiting, hypotension and developed a fever (40.5°C). Blood test confirmed our suspicion of an Addisonian crisis, and treatment was started with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.

### Thyroid emergencies: a narrative review [^2b54aa59]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Myxedema coma and thyroid storm are rare thyroid emergencies associated with considerable mortality and morbidity. Myxedema coma is a state of decompensated hypothyroidism with widespread multi-organ dysfunction, most notably impaired consciousness, mixed respiratory failure, and hypothermia. Thyroid storm is the extreme state of thyrotoxicosis occurring when a patient's metabolic, thermoregulatory, and cardiovascular compensatory mechanisms are surpassed. Common clinical features of thyroid storm include hyperthermia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and tachyarrhythmias. Thyroid emergencies usually result from a precipitating event or trigger transforming a previously compensated hypothyroid or thyrotoxic state. The diagnosis of myxedema coma and thyroid storm is established from clinical features in the either already hypothyroid or thyrotoxic patient. In the case of thyroid storm, clinicians may augment their clinical reasoning with the Japanese Thyroid Association Diagnostic Criteria or the Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale. Supportive care for the cardiovascular, respiratory, and thermoregulatory manifestations, as well as possible intercurrent illness or adrenal insufficiency, play a lead role in the management. For myxedema coma, treatment typically includes high dose levothyroxine with the addition of liothyronine for critically ill patients. Management of thyroid storm is multi-pronged and stepwise, consisting of first-line thionamide and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist therapy as first-line, inorganic iodine, as well as cholestyramine, plasmapheresis, or emergent thyroidectomy in appropriate severely ill patients.

### Endocrine and metabolic emergencies: thyroid storm [^c07e40ed]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis is a common endocrine condition that may be secondary to a number of underlying processes. Thyroid storm (also known as thyroid or thyrotoxic crisis) represents the severe end of the spectrum of thyrotoxicosis and is characterized by compromised organ function. Whilst rare in the modern era, the mortality rate remains high, and prompt consideration of this endocrine emergency, with specific treatments, can improve outcomes.

A detailed description of the grading scheme has been published elsewhere. Recommendations were based on published findings and on expert opinion when appropriate. The best available research evidence was used to develop recommendations. Preference was given to articles written in English, identified by PubMed searches with MeSH terms.

For each point, recommendations and evidence are described, with a modification in the grading evidence as follows: 1 = strong recommendation (applies to most patients in most circumstances, benefits clearly outweigh the risk); and 2 = weak recommendation (consensus opinion of working group or should be considered; the best action may depend on circumstances or patient values, benefits, and risks closely balanced or uncertain).

Qualify of evidence is indicated as follows: ⊕⊕⊕, high quality (prospective cohort studies or randomized controlled trials at low risk of bias); ⊕⊕○, moderate quality (observational studies or trials with methodological flaws, inconsistent or indirect evidence); and ⊕○○, low quality (case series or nonsystematic clinical observations).

### Stress response in critical illness [^fbc9d727]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2013). Low credibility.

Sepsis brings about neuroendocrine dysfunction in children that differs significantly from that of adults and can thus be difficult to interpret and manage. Aggressive treatment of sepsis with appropriate and judicious use of antibiotics remains a top priority. Strict glycemic control in children has been associated with significant risk of hypoglycemia, which may independently contribute to morbidity and mortality. Timely initiation of hydrocortisone in persistently hypotensive children with fluid-refractory, catecholamine-resistant shock is controversial, but its use in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency is suggested. Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities must be corrected. Treatment of thyroid dysfunction has been shown to be beneficial in certain specific populations but cannot be extrapolated to all septic patients with the current available data.

### Guidelines for evaluation of new fever in critically ill adult patients: 2008 update from the American college of critical care medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^fbcd9b77]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the practice parameters for the evaluation of adult patients who develop a new fever in the intensive care unit, for the purpose of guiding clinical practice.

Participants

A task force of 11 experts in the disciplines related to critical care medicine and infectious diseases was convened from the membership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Specialties represented included critical care medicine, surgery, internal medicine, infectious diseases, neurology, and laboratory medicine/microbiology.

Evidence

The task force members provided personal experience and determined the published literature (MEDLINE articles, textbooks, etc.) from which consensus was obtained. Published literature was reviewed and classified into one of four categories, according to study design and scientific value.

Consensus Process

The task force met twice in person, several times by teleconference, and held multiple e-mail discussions during a 2-yr period to identify the pertinent literature and arrive at consensus recommendations. Consideration was given to the relationship between the weight of scientific evidence and the strength of the recommendation. Draft documents were composed and debated by the task force until consensus was reached by nominal group process.

Conclusions

The panel concluded that, because fever can have many infectious and noninfectious etiologies, a new fever in a patient in the intensive care unit should trigger a careful clinical assessment rather than automatic orders for laboratory and radiologic tests. A cost-conscious approach to obtaining cultures and imaging studies should be undertaken if indicated after a clinical evaluation. The goal of such an approach is to determine, in a directed manner, whether infection is present so that additional testing can be avoided and therapeutic decisions can be made.

Educational Objectives

There is growing evidence that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus can cause a broad spectrum of thyroid disease in children, including subacute thyroiditis.
Thyrotoxicosis symptoms can overlap with those of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and physicians must be discerning if MIS-C diagnostic criteria are not fully met.
