## Question

is craniotomy done for meningioma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether craniotomy is done for meningioma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard treatment options for meningioma and where craniotomy fits. Then, I should verify when surgery is indicated versus observation or stereotactic radiosurgery. Next, I will review real-world surgical approaches and operative outcomes. After that, I need to consider patient and tumor factors that modify the decision. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and ensure it aligns with contemporary evidence and practice patterns.

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic landscape. Meningioma management typically includes three accepted strategies: observation, surgical resection via craniotomy, and radiotherapy (including stereotactic radiosurgery), with surgery remaining the mainstay when intervention is warranted because it provides immediate decompression, histopathology, and the potential for cure with gross total resection; long-term control after complete resection is high in Grade I tumors, supporting craniotomy as a standard treatment modality in appropriate cases [^115BsT5m] [^112m6yfo] [^111DFjv3].

> Wait, let me verify when craniotomy is actually indicated and not jump to conclusions. Surgery is generally favored for symptomatic tumors producing mass effect, seizures, or focal deficits; for larger or growing lesions (often around or above 3 cm, especially with edema); for cases in which tissue diagnosis and molecular profiling will change management; and for higher-grade (WHO II/III) meningiomas given their propensity for recurrence, with craniotomy also serving as a salvage option when radiosurgery fails or is unsuitable [^115BsT5m] [^115DHpJs] [^112m6yfo] [^113dM9gw]. Hmm, wait a minute — initially I was thinking "size alone" dictates surgery, but I should correct that: it's the composite of size, growth kinetics, edema, symptoms, location, and patient factors that drives timing and the choice of craniotomy versus alternatives [^115BsT5m] [^111Eo91o].

> Hold on, I should also emphasize that craniotomy is not universal. Many incidental, asymptomatic, small-to-moderate meningiomas are monitored with serial MRI, and a substantial proportion never require intervention; radiosurgery offers high tumor control for properly selected Grade I lesions and is commonly used up front in older or medically frail patients or in surgically challenging skull base locations; in select anterior skull base tumors, endoscopic endonasal approaches can be considered as minimally invasive alternatives to open craniotomy depending on anatomy and goals of care [^115BsT5m] [^117APMjz] [^113dM9gw] [^117KEcf8] [^115zpzhf].

> Next, I should review whether craniotomy is truly performed in practice across meningioma locations. Let me check representative series and case reports: large cohorts detail hundreds of supratentorial meningioma resections with different dural closure strategies; skull base and convexity meningiomas are routinely addressed via pterional, orbitozygomatic, retrosigmoid, suboccipital, far-lateral, and other tailored craniotomies; operative videos and series further illustrate approach selection for olfactory groove, tuberculum sellae, intraorbital, posterior fossa, and intraventricular tumors, confirming that craniotomy is a routine and adaptable tool in contemporary meningioma surgery [^116J4Eoe] [^114zCgsP] [^116pUbcj] [^1166gGUT] [^113uDF28] [^1176bg59].

> I should double-check outcomes and risks to keep this clinically balanced. Gross total resection offers excellent long-term control for Grade I disease, but surgery carries measurable neurologic and medical risks; contemporary series report neurologic morbidity roughly in the 4–14% range and low perioperative mortality, with risk influenced by age, comorbidities, tumor size and location, and new postoperative neurological deficits; additional considerations include a nontrivial risk of de novo epilepsy after craniotomy and rare vascular complications such as delayed dural arteriovenous fistula after meningioma surgery, underscoring the need for careful selection and follow-up [^111DFjv3] [^112m6yfo] [^112m6yfo] [^113pkFfZ] [^115Jjivb] [^116B6u6J].

> But wait, what about special populations where I might avoid or modify craniotomy. In the very elderly, selected patients can benefit from surgery yet face higher rates of complications and mortality, so many centers lean toward radiosurgery or observation when feasible; obesity is more prevalent among meningioma patients and correlates with higher postoperative complications in some cohorts; serious cardiac events around the time of craniotomy, although uncommon, can constrain standard cardiologic therapies because of neurosurgical bleeding risks, further emphasizing individualized risk–benefit discussions [^11472AFK] [^115Lbwwd] [^113puB2Q] [^1134m3ow] [^114ewrnb].

> I will now examine technical evolution and planning considerations that refine craniotomy use. Endoscope-assisted microsurgery helps visualize blind angles through smaller openings, complementing keyhole and skull base techniques; approach selection is tailored to tumor location and extension, with a trend toward less morbid standard approaches when feasible; preoperative imaging can help predict a safe surgical cleavage plane and guide whether a gross total resection is realistic, which I need to confirm before recommending an open operation [^116pPDw6] [^1129saDi] [^116AYjpT] [^116p5cpn] [^114WN1RF].

> Synthesizing all this, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise. Yes, craniotomy is definitively done for meningioma and remains the reference treatment for symptomatic, large, growing, or higher-grade lesions because it achieves immediate decompression, provides histology, and can be curative when gross total resection is achieved; however, it is used selectively within a broader multimodal algorithm that also includes observation and stereotactic radiosurgery, and hybrid strategies such as subtotal resection with adjuvant radiosurgery are common when complete resection is unsafe, so the final decision hinges on patient condition, tumor biology and location, and center expertise [^112m6yfo] [^115BsT5m] [^113dM9gw] [^111G3xbw].

Craniotomy is the **standard surgical approach** [^112m6yfo] for meningioma resection when the tumor is symptomatic, growing, or causing mass effect [^115BsT5m]. The goal is **maximal safe resection** to relieve symptoms, reduce recurrence [^112m6yfo], and obtain tissue for diagnosis and molecular profiling [^112m6yfo]. Craniotomy is tailored to tumor location and size [^112m6yfo], with alternatives such as stereotactic radiosurgery [^113dM9gw] or observation [^111Eo91o] for small, asymptomatic, or high-risk patients. Because risks include neurological deficits, infection, hemorrhage [^115Lbwwd], and recurrence [^112m6yfo], careful patient selection and multidisciplinary planning are essential.

## Indications for craniotomy in meningioma

Craniotomy is **indicated** based on clinical and radiological factors:

- **Symptomatic tumors**: Causing neurological deficits, seizures [^115BsT5m], headaches, or visual disturbances.
- **Tumor growth**: Documented enlargement on serial imaging [^111Eo91o].
- **Mass effect**: Significant edema or brain compression [^112m6yfo].
- **High-grade tumors**: WHO grade II or III [^112m6yfo], due to higher recurrence and aggressive behavior [^111DFjv3].
- **Patient preference**: Desire for definitive treatment after counseling.

---

## Surgical techniques and approaches

The choice of **surgical approach** depends on tumor location, size, and relationship to critical structures:

| **Tumor location** | **Common surgical approaches** |
|-|-|
| Convexity | Standard craniotomy and Simpson grade I or II resection [^113hdJCY] |
| Parasagittal | Craniotomy with sinus preservation or reconstruction [^1113Q95D] |
| Skull base | - Pterional <br/> - Orbitozygomatic [^113uDF28] <br/> - Endoscopic-assisted approaches [^111HS7zb] [^116pPDw6] |
| Posterior fossa | Suboccipital craniotomy and the retrosigmoid approach [^111wEob6] |
| Intraventricular | Parieto-occipital transcortical and transcallosal approaches [^1176bg59] |

---

## Risks and complications

Craniotomy for meningioma carries potential **risks and complications**, including:

- **Neurological deficits**: Temporary or permanent, depending on tumor location and extent of resection [^115WE5uq] [^112m6yfo].
- **Infection**: Meningitis or wound infection.
- **Hemorrhage**: Intraoperative or postoperative bleeding [^115Lbwwd].
- **Seizures**: Postoperative epilepsy [^113pkFfZ].
- **Recurrence**: Particularly in higher-grade tumors or incomplete resections [^111DFjv3] [^112m6yfo].

---

## Outcomes and prognosis

Outcomes after craniotomy for meningioma are **generally favorable**, particularly for benign (WHO grade I) tumors, with gross total resection achieving approximately 90%, 80%, and 70% recurrence-free survival at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively [^111DFjv3]. WHO grade II and III tumors have higher recurrence rates and may require adjuvant radiotherapy [^111DFjv3] [^112m6yfo]. Most patients experience improvement or stabilization of neurological function postoperatively [^115WE5uq] [^112m6yfo].

---

## Alternative treatments

Alternative treatments to craniotomy include **stereotactic radiosurgery** [^117KEcf8], effective for small, asymptomatic, or surgically inaccessible tumors [^113dM9gw]. Observation [^112m6yfo] is appropriate for incidental, asymptomatic, slow-growing tumors [^111Eo91o]. Fractionated radiotherapy serves as adjunctive therapy for residual or recurrent tumors [^111DFjv3].

---

## Factors influencing surgical decision-making

Several factors **influence the decision** to perform craniotomy:

- **Patient age and comorbidities**: Elderly or medically fragile patients may have higher surgical risks [^11472AFK] [^112m6yfo].
- **Tumor size and location**: Larger or critically located tumors may require more complex surgical approaches [^113hdJCY] [^112m6yfo].
- **Tumor grade**: Higher-grade tumors may necessitate more aggressive surgical and adjunctive treatments [^111DFjv3] [^112m6yfo].
- **Patient preferences**: Informed patient choice plays a significant role in treatment selection.

---

Craniotomy is the standard surgical approach for meningioma, aiming for **maximal safe resection** to relieve symptoms, reduce recurrence, and provide tissue for diagnosis. The decision to perform craniotomy depends on tumor characteristics, patient factors, and available alternatives, with careful weighing of risks and benefits.

### Radiosurgery as definitive management of intracranial meningiomas [^113dM9gw]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Stereotactic radiosurgery has become an important primary or adjuvant minimally invasive management strategy for patients with intracranial meningiomas, aiming for long-term tumor growth prevention and maintenance of patient neurological function. We evaluated clinical and imaging outcomes of meningiomas, stratified by histological tumor grade.

The patient cohort consisted of 972 patients with 1,045 intracranial meningiomas managed over an 18-year period. The series included 70% women, 49% of whom had undergone a previous resection, and 5% had received previous fractionated radiation therapy. Tumor locations included the middle fossa (n = 351), posterior fossa (n = 307), convexity (n = 126), anterior fossa (n = 88), parasagittal region (n = 113), or other (n = 115).

The overall control rate for patients with benign meningiomas (World Health Organization Grade I) was 93%. In those without previous histological confirmation (n = 482), tumor control was 97%. However, for patients with World Health Organization Grade II and III tumors, tumor control was 50% and 17%, respectively. Delayed resection after radiosurgery was necessary in 51 patients (5%) at a mean of 35 months. After 10 years, Grade I tumors were controlled in 91% (n = 53); in those without histology, 95% (n = 22) were controlled. None of the patients developed a radiation-induced tumor. The overall morbidity rate was 7.7%, and symptomatic peritumoral imaging changes developed in 4% of the patients at a mean of 8 months.

Stereotactic radiosurgery provided high rates of tumor control and low morbidity for patients with Grade I intracranial meningiomas.

### Comparison of supratentorial meningioma resection outcomes by dural reconstruction technique [^116J4Eoe]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2023). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Excision of intracranial meningiomas often requires resection or coagulation of the dura mater. The choice of dural closure technique is individualized and based on surgeon preference. The objective of this study was to determine outcomes following various dural closure techniques for supratentorial meningiomas.
- **Methods**: A retrospective, single-center cohort study was performed for patients who underwent excision of supratentorial meningiomas from 2000 to 2019. Outcomes including operative time, postoperative in-hospital complications, readmission, causes of readmission including surgical site infection, pseudomeningocele, need for shunt surgery, and imaging appearance of pseudomeningocele on long-term follow-up imaging were compared. Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted.
- **Results**: A total of 353 patients who had complete clinical and operative data available for review were included. Of these patients, 227 (64.3%) had nonsutured dural graft reconstruction and 126 (35.7%) had sutured dural repair, including primary closure, artificial dura, or pericranial graft. There was significant variability in using nonsutured dural reconstruction compared with sutured dural repair technique among surgeons (p < 0.001). Tumors with sagittal sinus involvement were more likely to undergo nonsutured closure (n = 79, 34.8%) than dural repair (n = 26, 20.6%) (p = 0.003). There were no other differences in preoperative imaging findings or WHO grade. Frequency of surgical site infection and pseudomeningocele, need for shunt surgery, and recurrence were similar between groups.

### Surgical strategies for intracranial meningioma in the molecular era [^115BsT5m]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Initial treatment strategies for meningiomas include observation, surgical resection, and/or radiotherapy. Among these, radiation is widely accepted as a stand-alone treatment for a presumed meningioma or as an adjunct after surgery, but it is not within the scope of this review. Certainly, surgery is not indicated for all meningiomas. A range of factors impacts the decision for surgical management and timing of intervention, including presenting symptoms, patient age, medical comorbidities, and tumor characteristics such as size, and the presence of edema and/or mass effect in the surrounding brain.

Intracranial meningiomas are often found incidentally, with an increasing incidence more recently. This is most likely due to an aging population and more frequent utilization of more sensitive brain imaging. Studies report the presence of one or more meningiomas on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in nearly 1% of the general population. While there is no class I or II evidence to support a standard protocol, incidental, asymptomatic, small to moderately sized meningiomas without concerning radiographic features (discussed below) are generally monitored with serial imaging.

The reported growth rates of untreated, incidental meningiomas, however, vary greatly. Growth has been reported in 11% to 74% of patients, of which 0% to 56% become symptomatic. The majority of tumors grow less than 1 cm³/year, but growth can range anywhere from 0.03 to 2.62 cm³/year. These wide ranges underscore the relative biological heterogeneity of meningiomas.

### Surgical strategies for intracranial meningioma in the molecular era [^112m6yfo]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumors, accounting for nearly 40% of intracranial tumors. When intervention becomes necessary due to size and/or symptomatology, the mainstay of treatment is maximal safe resection. Surgical intervention alleviates mass effect, relieves associated neurological symptoms, decreases the risk of recurrence, and provides for diagnosis and molecular characterization. Gross total resection (GTR) is often considered curative in many cases. Radiotherapy can be used as a stand-alone approach, and more commonly, as an adjunct for more aggressive lesions. There are currently no effective standard pharmacological therapies.

Meningiomas are divided into three World Health Organization (WHO) grades (Grades 1–3) based on histology. Grade 1 tumors are often considered benign tumors and are the most common, accounting for 80% of all meningiomas, and demonstrate a relatively low risk of recurrence. WHO grade 1 meningiomas have historically and generally been considered a "benign" tumor type, one that was readily cured through surgical resection. Grade 2 and 3 meningiomas are higher-grade tumors that can exhibit increased growth and recurrence rates greater than 70% following GTR, as well as increased mortality despite multimodal therapy.

As our understanding of meningioma natural history has progressed, these tumors are increasingly recognized as a significantly more complex and heterogeneous group. Indeed, meningiomas do not always behave in accordance with their WHO grade, such that histologically-confirmed grade 1 tumors can demonstrate unexpected recurrence and behavior.

### Acquired progressive torcular dural arteriovenous fistula after subtotal resection of peritorcular meningioma [^116B6u6J]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A woman in her mid-50s who had undergone a subtotal resection of a peritorcular meningioma 3 years earlier presented with symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. A delayed diagnosis of a torcular dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) was made on MRI. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed a torcular dAVF (Borden type II).

Staged three rounds of transarterial (TA) embolization were performed using n-butyl cyanoacrylate, ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer, and coils of the complex torcular dAVF, which significantly reduced the flow and corresponded with improved symptoms of pulsatile tinnitus, vision, and headache.

We reviewed previously reported cases of dAVFs that developed after craniotomy for meningioma resection. Despite its rarity, a torcular dAVF can develop after craniotomy and progress from low to high grade due to its location. Diagnosis requires a thorough understanding of subtle imaging findings, which may be present in follow-up studies obtained for tumor surveillance.

### Goal-directed fluid therapy and major postoperative complications in elective craniotomy. A retrospective analysis of a before-after multicentric study [^115Y6Lgk]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Before implementing the protocol, the monitoring of cardiac output and goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) were not standardized and were performed at the attending anesthetist's discretion. GDFT was administered to patients at the highest risk of postoperative complications: those with an ASA score of III and IV, and/or a preoperative Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) < 15, and/or a history of brain tumor intracranial surgery, and/or tumor size ≥ 35 mm, and/or mid-line shift ≥ 3 mm, and/or a significant hemorrhagic risk (e.g. meningioma, tumor location).

Cardiac output monitoring could be conducted using either invasive or non-invasive devices. In the three centers, the available devices included the EV1000 Edwards® with either a FloTrac® or a Clearsight®, and the MostCare Vygon®. In the GDFT protocol, once the device was set, we first administered 250 mL of fluid to define the stroke volume (SV) of reference. If fluid responsiveness was not achieved, defined as a 10% SV increase, another 250 mL of fluid was administered to establish the SV of reference. Vascular expansion (250 mL) was triggered in the case of decreased indexed stroke volume (≥ 10%) or mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg. A stroke volume variation increase ≥ 10% was used to assess the efficacy of vascular expansion.
- **Vascular expansion parameters**: The use of static parameters and heart rate to perform vascular expansion remained at the attending physician's discretion. End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) was not considered in our centers for performing vascular expansion. When fluid responsiveness was not observed, continuous norepinephrine was administered to ensure a mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg.

### Acquired progressive torcular dural arteriovenous fistula after subtotal resection of peritorcular meningioma [^115CWiG9]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A woman in her mid-50s who had undergone a subtotal resection of a peritorcular meningioma 3 years earlier presented with symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. A delayed diagnosis of a torcular dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) was made on MRI. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed a torcular dAVF (Borden type II).

We reviewed previously reported cases of dAVFs that developed after craniotomy for meningioma resection. Despite its rarity, a torcular dAVF can develop after craniotomy and progress from low to high grade due to its location. Diagnosis requires a thorough understanding of subtle imaging findings, which may be present in follow-up studies obtained for tumour surveillance.

### Olfactory groove meningioma with a 10-year history of smell loss and olfactory recovery after surgery [^114zCgsP]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

- **Treatment**: The patient presented with generalized seizures, and antiepileptic medication with lamotrigine was prescribed. Due to increasing headaches and radiologically confirmed substantial white matter changes suggesting edema, she was supplemented with oral steroids before surgery.
- **Surgical**: Based on the primarily right-sided basofrontal location, the absence of paranasal sinus infiltration, and the patient's intact but diminished olfactory function, a right-sided pterional craniotomy was performed to salvage the olfactory apparatus. Perioperatively, the right olfactory tract was found stretched around the basolateral side of the tumor and could not be preserved. The left olfactory tract was left intact. The tumor was completely resected, and the dural attachment coagulated, corresponding to a Simpson grade II resection.

### Piezosurgery: A safe technique to perform lateral suboccipital craniotomy [^1166gGUT]. Operative Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

Piezosurgery (PS) is a relatively new technique based on microvibrations generated by the piezoelectric effect. It selectively cuts bone tissue while preserving the surrounding soft tissue.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the use of PS for performing lateral suboccipital craniotomy.
- **Methods**: PS was used to perform a lateral suboccipital craniotomy in 22 patients who underwent surgery for different cerebellopontine angle (CPA) pathologies in the neurosurgical department. The applicability of PS for lateral suboccipital craniotomy was evaluated with respect to safety, precision of bone cutting, and particularly the preservation of the adjacent dura and sigmoid and transverse sinuses.
- **Results**: Lateral suboccipital craniotomy in 22 patients who underwent surgery for different CPA pathologies (13 vestibular schwannoma, 5 petrous bone meningioma, 1 petroclival meningioma, 2 epidermoid cysts, and 1 petrous bone cholesterol granuloma) was performed with PS without any complications. A burr hole was set before piezosurgical craniotomy in 6 patients, with no prior burr hole in 16 patients. Incidental durotomy during piezosurgical craniotomy occurred in 6 patients, and small lacerations of the sigmoid sinus caused by the piezosurgical device were observed in 3 patients.
- **Conclusion**: Although PS is a safe and selective bone cutting technique that preserves the surrounding soft tissue, it can still lead to unintended dural tears during lateral suboccipital craniotomy. This must be kept in mind when using PS for craniotomies and relying on the selective bone cutting properties of PS.

Oculomotor nerve palsy can be caused by several conditions. Among these, meningioma, glioblastoma multiforme, traumatic brain injury, intracranial hypertension, and intracranial aneurysm are notable causes. Other potential causes include quaternary syphilis, orbital fracture, pituitary apoplexy, basilar artery migraine, nasopharyngeal cancer, cavernous sinus thrombosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, intracranial mass, and pituitary tumor.

### Ultiva [^1143uoVC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Ultiva was administered to 61 patients undergoing craniotomy for removal of a supratentorial mass lesion. In these studies, ventilation was controlled to maintain a predicted PaCO2 of approximately 28 mmHg. In one study (n = 30) with Ultiva and 66% nitrous oxide, the median time to extubation and patient response to verbal commands was 5 minutes, with a range of -1 to 19 minutes. Intracranial pressure and cerebrovascular responsiveness to carbon dioxide were normal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

A randomized, controlled study compared Ultiva (n = 31) to fentanyl (n = 32). Ultiva (1 mcg/kg/min) and fentanyl (2 mcg/kg/min) were administered after induction with thiopental and pancuronium. A similar number of patients (6%) receiving Ultiva and fentanyl experienced hypotension during induction. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide and Ultiva at a mean infusion rate of 0.23 mcg/kg/min (range 0.1 to 0.4) compared with a fentanyl mean infusion rate of 0.04 mcg/kg/min (range 0.02 to 0.07). Supplemental isoflurane was administered as needed. Patients receiving Ultiva required a lower mean isoflurane dose (0.07 MAC-hours) compared with 0.64 MAC-hours for the fentanyl patients (P = 0.04). Ultiva was discontinued at the end of anesthesia, whereas fentanyl was discontinued at the time of bone flap replacement (a median time of 44 minutes before the end of surgery). Median time to extubation was similar, with 5 minutes for Ultiva and 3.5 minutes for fentanyl. None of the patients receiving Ultiva required naloxone compared to seven of the fentanyl patients.

### Interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy for radiorecurrent atypical meningioma: A brief report [^115eni8y]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

She underwent a left frontal craniotomy for gross total resection (GTR) of a left frontal atypical meningioma in September 2012 but declined adjuvant radiation therapy. Postoperative imaging described no convincing residual foci of enhancement in the resection cavity. In January 2013, she had a repeat craniotomy for fluid evacuation, titanium mesh cranioplasty, and debridement because of a Staphylococcus aureus infection. Pathology showed benign bone flap with focal necrosis and mitotic figures in multiple foci (2–4 per 10 high-power fields). Cautery artifact prevented the evaluation of tumor presence.

### Incidental intracranial meningiomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factors and outcomes [^111Eo91o]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

Incidental discovery accounts for 30% of newly diagnosed intracranial meningiomas. There is no consensus on their optimal management. This review aimed to evaluate the outcomes of different management strategies for these tumors.
- **Methods**: Using established systematic review methods, six databases were scanned up to September 2017. Pooled event proportions were estimated using a random effects model. Meta-regression of prognostic factors was performed using individual patient data.
- **Results**: Twenty studies (2130 patients) were included. Initial management strategies at diagnosis were surgery (27.3%), stereotactic radiosurgery (22.0%), and active monitoring (50.7%) with a weighted mean follow-up of 49.5 months (SD = 29.3). The definition of meningioma growth and monitoring regimens varied widely, impeding relevant meta-analysis. The pooled risk of symptom development in patients actively monitored was 8.1% (95% CI 2.7–16.1). Associated factors were peritumoral edema (OR 8.72 [95% CI 0.35–14.90]) and meningioma diameter ≥ 3 cm (OR 34.90 [95% CI 5.17–160.40]). The pooled proportion of intervention following a duration of active monitoring was 24.8% (95% CI 7.5–48.0). Weighted mean time-to-intervention was 24.8 months (SD = 18.2). The pooled risks of morbidity following surgery and radiosurgery, accounting for cross-over, were 11.8% (95% CI 3.7–23.5) and 32.0% (95% CI 10.6–70.5) respectively. The pooled proportion of operated meningioma being WHO grade I was 94.0% (95% CI 88.2–97.9).
- **Conclusion**: The management of incidental meningioma varies widely. Most patients who clinical

### Incidental intracranial meningiomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factors and outcomes [^115DHpJs]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

Active monitoring of incidental meningioma is becoming increasingly common. Recent guidelines advocate for its use in asymptomatic patients demonstrating no radiological mass effect. However, while the guidelines recommend annual monitoring following a 6-month scan, they do not provide advice on the length of follow-up. This stems from the marked heterogeneity of active monitoring regimens, compounded by poor reporting of time to meningioma progression.

Moreover, while the development of symptoms is a clear indication for treatment, no consensus exists on what constitutes significant meningioma growth and when it may necessitate intervention. To this end, we analyzed growth dynamics for meningiomas greater or less than 3 cm. No significant difference was found in the relative growth rate; however, meningiomas ≥ 3 cm demonstrated a higher absolute growth rate (AGR) and a greater risk of clinical progression. This may suggest the use of AGR as a more clinically relevant measure of incidental meningioma growth, which has been suggested to correlate with a higher WHO meningioma grade.

Only a quarter of patients undergoing active monitoring demonstrate radiological or clinical progression requiring intervention. Since most incidental meningiomas are histologically benign and the risk of treatment-related morbidity from surgery or radiosurgery is similar to those reported for symptomatic meningiomas, a policy of active monitoring seems justified.

### Gliadel [^112U3mrg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Recommended dose**: The recommended dose of Gliadel Wafer is eight 7.7 mg wafers, totaling 61.6 mg, implanted intracranially. The safety and effectiveness of repeat administration have not been studied.

- **Insertion instructions**: After maximal tumor resection, confirmation of tumor pathology, and establishment of hemostasis, place up to eight Gliadel Wafers to cover as much of the resection cavity as possible. If the size and shape of the resected cavity do not accommodate eight wafers, place the maximum number feasible. Slight overlapping of the wafers is acceptable. Wafers broken in half may be used, but discard wafers broken into more than two pieces. Oxidized regenerated cellulose (Surgicel®) may be placed over the wafers to secure them against the cavity surface. After placing the wafers, irrigate the resection cavity and close the dura in a watertight fashion.

### Risk of early failure of VP shunts implanted for hydrocephalus after craniotomies for brain tumors in adults [^114TyEbU]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Low credibility.

- **Primary/secondary surgery for brain tumor**: Primary craniotomies were performed in 64 patients (75.3%) and secondary in 21 patients (24.7%). Primary or secondary craniotomy for brain tumor was not significantly associated with shunt longevity in univariate nor multivariate proportional hazards analyses.
- **Pre-craniotomy and post-craniotomy treatment for hydrocephalus**: Out of the 373 patients with pre-craniotomy hydrocephalus, 23 underwent EVD insertion, 19 had ETV, and 41 had EVD and craniotomy concomitantly. From these, 334 patients (89.5%) did not need any further treatment for hydrocephalus. Of the remaining 39 patients with persisting post-craniotomy hydrocephalus, 11 had EVD insertion and one underwent ETV in an attempt to avoid shunting. Ultimately, all 39 patients with this condition required VP shunt insertion.

	- From the 39 patients with VP shunt dependency, two had pre-craniotomy EVD, two had ETV, and seven had EVD and tumor resection simultaneously. Except for one patient, there was no overlap of treatment modalities for hydrocephalus in the pre-craniotomy and post-craniotomy stage before VP shunt implantation.

	- From those without pre-craniotomy hydrocephalus, three out of 46 patients had EVD insertion after tumor surgery due to de novo hydrocephalus, but all 46 patients eventually required VP shunt insertion.

Of the total 85 patients with shunt dependency, none had craniotomies between initial shunt placement and the first shunt failure.

### Intraorbital meningioma: Resection through modified orbitozygomatic craniotomy [^116pUbcj]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2012). Low credibility.

Intraorbital meningiomas are challenging lesions to excise due to their location and the restricted surgical corridor, which is limited by the presence of important neighboring structures. Lesions located in the posterior one-third of the orbit require skull base approaches for their exposure and safe resection. Frontoorbital and modified orbitozygomatic (OZ) craniotomies may facilitate the exposure and resection of masses in the posterior intraorbital space. Specifically, the one-piece modified OZ craniotomy offers many advantages, similar to the "full" OZ craniotomy, which includes a more extensive zygomatic osteotomy. The modified OZ approach minimizes frontal lobe retraction while providing ample space for the surgeon to utilize all working angles to resect the tumor. The following video presentation discusses the nuances of technique for resection of an intraorbital meningioma through the modified OZ approach and optic nerve decompression. The nuances of the technique will be discussed. The video can be found here: http://youtu.be/fP5X2QNr5qk.

### Myocardial infarction after craniotomy for asymptomatic meningioma [^114ewrnb]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A man in his 40s with a history of coronary artery disease, previously treated with a drug-eluting stent, presented for elective craniotomy and resection of an asymptomatic but enlarging meningioma. During his craniotomy, he received desmopressin and tranexamic acid for surgical bleeding. Postoperatively, the patient developed chest pain and was found to have an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI). Because of the patient's recent neurosurgery, standard post-MI care was contraindicated, and he was instead managed symptomatically in the intensive care unit. An echocardiogram on postoperative day 1 demonstrated no regional wall motion abnormalities and an ejection fraction of 60%. His presentation was consistent with thrombosis of his diagonal stent. He was transferred out of the intensive care unit on postoperative day 1 and discharged home on postoperative day 3.

### An unusual lymphoid lesion mimicking meningioma [^113rCd8c]. Brain Pathology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Clinical history and neuroimaging**: A 57-year-old woman experienced two epileptic seizures accompanied by paresthesia on the left side of the body and dysarthria. Cranial MRI revealed a contrast medium-enhancing, en plaque tumor located post-centrally over the right parietal lobe (Figure 1). Based on the radiological features, an en plaque meningioma was suspected, and tumor resection was recommended.
- **Surgical procedure**: Microsurgical resection was conducted using a right-sided parietal approach. The craniotomy was customized with brain navigation, revealing the tumor in the subdural space, adherent to both the dura mater and arachnoid, without infiltration into the cerebral cortex. Complete tumor resection was achieved, and the overlying dura was also resected. The resection was classified as Simpson grade I. Postoperatively, the patient displayed no neurological deficits and was discharged on the seventh postoperative day. Subsequent systemic screening ruled out malignancies and autoimmune disorders.

MRI imaging performed twelve months post-surgery confirmed complete tumor resection with no signs of recurrence.

### Acquired progressive torcular dural arteriovenous fistula after subtotal resection of peritorcular meningioma [^113wcgPW]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Although several cases of dAVFs have been reported secondary to craniotomy due to sinus occlusion, we did not find the torcular dAVF after craniotomy in the literature. We conducted a literature review and found 11 cases of dAVF developing after craniotomy for meningioma resection, excluding our case. The mean patient age was 57 years (range 46–67) with a slight female predilection, shown by a female-to-male ratio of 7:4. The median interval for dAVF development after craniotomy was 37 months (range 6–90 months).

There were seven cases of developed postoperative sinus stenosis or occlusion. Ten out of 11 cases were directly related to the site of craniotomy, with only one case developing at a different site. The TS/SS junction was the most common location of dAVFs after craniotomy, accounting for 9 of the 11 cases. A total of nine cases presented with non-haemorrhagic symptoms, while only one case presented with haemorrhage. The main clinical presentations included tinnitus, bruit, visual obscuration, and headache in nine cases, with two cases being asymptomatic.

A total of six cases developed after suboccipital craniotomy. Four cases were classified as Borden II or III dAVFs, and three cases as Borden I; the classification for the remaining cases was not mentioned. Six dAVFs were treated with endovascular embolisation, and four of these began with TA embolisation as initial treatment. Two dAVF cases underwent surgical resection, and one case did not require any treatment due to the patient being asymptomatic. Four cases achieved good or complete resolution of the dAVFs after endovascular treatment, while one case showed partial resolution.

### Postoperative de novo epilepsy after craniotomy: A nationwide register-based cohort study [^113pkFfZ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

In this unselected, nationwide cohort study encompassing 8,948 patients, we found high cumulative risks of de novo epilepsy following craniotomy, compared with the previously reported risk among the background population. The overall 1-year cumulative risk of de novo epilepsy after craniotomy was 13.9% (95% CI 13.2 to 14.6) and after 5 years 20.4% (95% CI 19.5 to 21.3). The cumulative 6-month, 1-year, and 5-year risks for each of the neurosurgical diseases leading to craniotomy exhibited considerable variation owing to the indications for craniotomy. Notably, both short-term and long-term risks were surprisingly high for most of the indications for craniotomy.
- **Comparison with other studies**: There are few comparable studies, mainly concerning meningioma and glioblastoma. In line with our findings, a Swedish single-centre study, including 113 meningioma patients, reported a 2-year cumulative risk of postoperative epilepsy of 14% (95% CI not provided), whereas we found a 1-year risk of 12.1% (95% CI 10.4 to 14.0). Meningiomas are a very common type of intracranial tumour with an overall prevalence of 97.5/100,000. As the vast majority of meningiomas are benign and slow-growing tumours, most of them are treated conservatively, but this approach is highly variable and debated. The high risk of postcraniotomy epilepsy needs to be considered when balancing risks and benefits regarding surgical treatment in the individual meningioma patient, particularly if asymptomatic.

A prospective single-centre study in China reported a 1-year cumulative risk of epilepsy in craniotomy patients, but the data was incomplete in our sources.

### Is surgery justified for 80-year-old or older intracranial meningioma patients? A systematic review [^113zxBc7]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

The quality assessment of the studies included in this review highlights several domain-based evaluations. None of the studies met our criteria for being categorized as high quality. Major shortcomings and potential sources of bias were identified, including the retrospective design (observed in all seven studies), limited reporting of intracranial meningioma (IM) characteristics (noted in four studies), and inadequate outcome assessments (also noted in four studies). Each study was consequently assigned to the low-quality category, and they were evaluated based on the level of bias: a "+" indicates a low risk of bias, a "−" indicates a high risk of bias, and a "?" reflects an unknown risk of bias.

The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:

- **Seizures**: See warnings and precautions (5.1).
- **Intracranial hypertension**: See warnings and precautions (5.2).
- **Impaired neurosurgical wound healing**: See warnings and precautions (5.3).
- **Meningitis**: See warnings and precautions (5.4).

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

- **Newly-diagnosed high-grade glioma**: The safety of GLIADEL Wafers was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 240 adult patients with newly-diagnosed high-grade glioma who received up to eight GLIADEL Wafers or matched placebo implanted against the resection surfaces after maximal tumor resection (Study 1).

The population in Study 1 was 67% male and 97% White, with a median age of 53 years (range: 21–72). Eighty-seven percent had a Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70, and 71% had a Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 80%. Seventy-eight percent had a histologic subtype of glioblastoma as determined by central pathology review. Thirty-eight percent of patients received 8 wafers, and 78% received ≥ 6 wafers. Starting three weeks after surgery, 80% of patients received standard limited field radiation therapy (RT) described as 55–60 Gy delivered in 28 to 30 fractions over six weeks; an additional 11% received no RT.

### Role of risk factors, scoring systems, and prognostic models in predicting the functional outcome in meningioma surgery: Multicentric study of 552 skull base meningiomas [^111fgSfC]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

The predictive factors of clinical outcome associated with a new neurologic deficit (temporary or permanent, evaluated at 1 year from surgical resection) and a decrease in KPS (Karnofsky Performance Status) at patient discharge were examined:

- **Univariate analysis**: The factors identified in the univariate analysis are detailed in Table 4. This analysis used the chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon test to evaluate the predictive factors of a new neurologic deficit and a postoperative decrease in KPS.

- **Multivariate stepwise selection model**: Predictive factors selected by this model are presented in Table 5, which outlines the factors contributing to new neurologic deficits and decreased postoperative KPS. The analysis includes degrees of freedom for accuracy.

These factors were used to understand the clinical outcomes and aid in predicting postoperative challenges in patients undergoing skull base meningioma surgery.

### Obesity and meningioma: A US population-based study paired with analysis of a multi-institutional cohort [^113puB2Q]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2024). Low credibility.

Whether obesity is associated with meningioma and the impact of obesity by gender has been debated. The primary objective of this study was to investigate differences in BMI between male and female patients undergoing craniotomy for meningioma and to compare these patients with those undergoing craniotomy for other intracranial tumors. The secondary objective was to compare meningioma location and progression-free survival (PFS) between obese and non-obese patients in a multi-institutional cohort.

National data were obtained from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database. Male and female patients were analyzed separately. Patients undergoing craniotomies for meningioma were compared with patients of the same sex undergoing craniotomies for other intracranial tumors. Institutional data were collected from two academic centers for all male and an equivalent number of female meningioma patients undergoing meningioma resection.

Multivariate regression controlling for age was used to determine differences in meningioma location. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were computed to investigate differences in PFS.

From NSQIP, 4,163 male meningioma patients were compared with 24,266 controls, and 9,372 female meningioma patients were compared with 21,538 controls. Male and female patients undergoing meningioma resection were more likely to be overweight or obese compared with patients undergoing craniotomy for other tumors, with the odds ratio increasing with increasing weight class (all p < 0.0001).

### Exploring optimal microscopic keyhole access to the skull base: An anatomical evaluation of transciliary supraorbital and transpalpebral orbitofrontal craniotomy approaches [^1129saDi]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Low credibility.

During cadaveric dissections, the TPA was performed via a standard orbital-frontal craniotomy, encompassing the orbital rim and the lateral aspect of the orbital wall, extending inferiorly to the zygomatic frontal suture. These aspects were deemed crucial for a larger craniotomy compared to a TCA. While it is feasible to execute a small craniotomy confined to the orbital rim without engaging the lateral portion of the orbital bone, this approach may result in a narrow surgical corridor, thereby restricting access to the middle fossa.

The TPA creates a tangential view of the anterior skull base. A smaller angle of attack offered by the TPA may be a drawback when we consider surgeries involving the anterior skull base. On the other hand, a greater angle of attack, as the TCA provides, allows for a more perpendicular view of the anterior skull base. This leads to better control of the lesion and identification of important neuroanatomic landmarks. Although we have not coupled with an orbital osteotomy during dissections, this maneuver in the TCA provides an even better CC angle of attack for managing lesions located around the third ventricle, such as retrochiasmatic craniopharyngiomas or bulky tuberculum sellae meningiomas.

### Intraventricular meningiomas: A report of 25 cases [^1176bg59]. Neurosurgical Review (2006). Low credibility.

In order to study the clinical characteristics of intraventricular meningiomas, we retrospectively analyzed 25 patients and reviewed the literature regarding incidence, clinical manifestation, imaging features, preoperative diagnosis, surgical findings, and histopathological results. Intraventricular meningiomas are quite rare, but they represent an important differential diagnosis of intraventricular neoplasms. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging enables a correct diagnosis of intraventricular meningiomas in most cases. The tumors often grow slowly to a substantial size before they become symptomatic.

- **Surgical approach**: The operative route should be selected according to the tumor's location. Out of the 24 lateral ventricular meningiomas in our series, 20 were resected via a posterior parieto-occipital transcortical approach, two were resected via a transcallosal approach, and another two tumors, located in the frontal horn and body of the lateral ventricle, were resected via a frontal approach. A median suboccipital craniotomy was performed for the fourth ventricular meningioma.
- **Safety considerations**: The parieto-occipital route for lateral ventricular meningiomas is a safe surgical approach, which is not necessarily associated with postoperative visual deficits. Piecemeal removal of the tumor can be safely and easily performed, and special attention should be paid to the choroidal vessels intraoperatively.

### Is surgery justified for 80-year-old or older intracranial meningioma patients? A systematic review [^11472AFK]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

Based on the reviewed literature, seven retrospective studies have assessed surgical outcomes in 80-year-old or older intracranial meningioma (IM) patients. In these reviewed studies, 1-month and 1-year mortality varied between 0–23.5% and 9.4–27.3%, respectively. Moreover, all five studies that reported pre- and postoperative performance levels (ranked by Karnofsky Performance Status, KPS) found that the majority of surgically treated IM patients improved in performance within 6 to 12 months after operation.

Based on the available evidence, surgical treatment of IM patients 80 years old or older appears to be a relatively safe procedure for which the benefits outweigh the potential risks in many patients — especially if preoperative risk assessment and patient selection processes are carefully conducted. Therefore, increased age should perhaps not be used as a contraindication for meningioma surgery.

On the other hand, very old male IM patients with severe comorbidities (American Society of Anesthesiologists, ASA ≥ 3), impaired preoperative performance (KPS ≤ 80), moderate or strong peritumoral edema, and critical tumor location (at the cranial base, near large vessels, or in eloquent areas) may have a higher risk of postoperative mortality and morbidity.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^114R46r2]. Neurosurgery (2017). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cerebral edema, particularly in patients with traumatic brain injury, the BTF 2017 guidelines recommend performing a large frontotemporoparietal decompressive craniectomy (not less than 12×15 cm or 15 cm in diameter) over a small frontotemporoparietal decompressive craniectomy. This approach is associated with reduced mortality and improved neurologic outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.

### Repeated stereotactic radiosurgery for high grade meningioma [^116rhiT7]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Demographic variables and baseline characteristics are central to this study. Between January 2002 and December 2022, 161 patients underwent radiosurgery for atypical or anaplastic meningioma. Patients were excluded if they had undergone craniotomy in another institution, preventing histopathology confirmation (n = 19), if they had received radiotherapy prior to SRS (n = 9), or if they had inadequate follow-up (n = 21). After applying these criteria, 112 cases were considered eligible for evaluation.
- **Figure 1**: Flowchart showing the process of selecting patients who underwent SRS for atypical/anaplastic meningioma.

	- **SRS** stands for stereotactic radiosurgery.

The study cohort exhibited a slight preponderance of females (65:47) and a mean age of 57.9 years. Gross tumor removal was achieved in 35 subjects, while subtotal resection was achieved in 77 cases. The mean elapsed time between the date of craniotomy and radiosurgery was 14.4 months.

SRS was performed as adjuvant therapy for residual tumors in 59 patients. In the remaining 53 patients, SRS was utilized as salvage therapy — either for tumor progression (n = 18) or recurrence (n = 35). Atypical meningioma accounted for the majority of cases (105; 93.8%) with a mean volume of 14.9 ml. The most common locations of meningioma were the skull base (41 cases; 36.6%), parasagittal region (35 cases; 31.3%), and convexity (16 cases; 14.3%).

### Role of radiation therapy in treating intracranial meningiomas [^111DFjv3]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Surgery is the mainstay for many patients with meningiomas, and it remains the standard. In large single-institution series, gross-total resection has been reported to achieve 5-, 10-, and 15-year recurrence-free survival rates of approximately 90%, 80%, and 70%, respectively. There are a growing number of series of patients with prolonged follow-up in which authors have evaluated fractionated external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) either as an adjuvant to surgery for subtotally resected, recurrent, or higher-grade meningiomas, or as an alternative to surgery. The primary focus of this review is EBRT; however, to lend perspective, a comparative analysis of surgery and radiosurgery is also provided.

### Endoscopic endonasal approach for resection of a recurrent spheno-orbital meningioma resulting in complete resolution of visual symptoms: A case report and review of literature [^115zpzhf]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Although open surgical approaches such as frontotemporal craniotomy were the gold standard treatment for spheno-orbital meningiomas, endoscopic approaches are slowly gaining momentum. Here, we presented a successful case of spheno-orbital meningioma resection with an endoscopic endonasal approach with good outcomes. More studies are needed on the utility of endoscopic endonasal approaches for spheno-orbital meningiomas. However, in select patients, this may serve as a favorable, minimally invasive alternative with low morbidity in patients where complete tumor resection is not possible.

### Acquired progressive torcular dural arteriovenous fistula after subtotal resection of peritorcular meningioma [^111bXdN7]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Reflecting on my medical journey over the past eight years, I am struck by how much persistence was required to get answers. Initially, my symptoms were dismissed as menopause until I insisted on an MRI, which led to the discovery of a brain tumor. After my craniotomy and tumor resection, my symptoms worsened; whooshing sounds, pressure, vision issues, and severe fatigue became daily hurdles. It was my physiotherapist, whom I went to for back pain, who urged me to see a neuro-ophthalmologist, leading to an IIH diagnosis. My neurosurgeon and neuro-ophthalmologist worked together, but despite a lumbar puncture and various medications with difficult side effects, I continued experiencing whooshing, pressure, nerve pain, and muscle spasms that made sleep and even sitting difficult.

Researching my own condition, I advocated for a stent, believing compromised blood flow caused my symptoms, though my scans did not reflect this. Eventually, I was sent to a vascular neurosurgeon and an interventional neuroradiologist who confirmed an AV fistula that nearly took my life. This was the beginning of challenging treatments during COVID, with multiple surgeries and extended hospital stays, yet for the first time, I felt heard and part of the team. My fourth brain surgery appears to have cured the AV fistula, although I still have the brain tumor and face lingering effects like exhaustion, severe tinnitus, visual issues, and gastrointestinal problems. Despite it all, I'm grateful to be here.

### Surgery for extra-axial tumors of the cerebral convexity and midline [^113hdJCY]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Extra-axial tumors of the cerebral convexity and midline include both convexity and parasagittal meningiomas; they are the most common tumors of the cranial vault and are the principal topic of this article. Over the past 30 years, neurosurgery has witnessed steady change in both technological capacity and in the conceptualization of certain diseases. Meningiomas are good examples of this change. Although cranial base meningiomas have received the most attention in the past two decades, the management of cranial vault meningiomas has also changed significantly.

Particular issues include decisions about when to treat, deciding between surgery and radiosurgery, increasing use of image-guided surgery, the understanding of the biology of these tumors, and changing attitudes in the management of the sagittal sinus. These issues exemplify the changing biological, conceptual, and technological concepts that characterize contemporary neurosurgery.

Regarding surgical interventions for intracerebral hemorrhage, specifically concerning indications for surgery in cases of supratentorial hemorrhage, the AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines recommend considering decompressive craniectomy with or without hematoma evacuation. This approach aims to reduce mortality, though not necessarily to improve functional outcomes, in patients with supratentorial ICH who are in a coma, have large hematomas with significant midline shifts, or have elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) refractory to medical management.

### Role of risk factors, scoring systems, and prognostic models in predicting the functional outcome in meningioma surgery: Multicentric study of 552 skull base meningiomas [^115WE5uq]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). High credibility.

- **Discussion**: Surgical outcome is generally influenced by the patient's comorbidities, age, presence of neurologic deficit, the size and location of the meningioma, and the experience, surgical strategy, and technique of the surgeon. Individual predictive factors are the subject of several studies, and components of a few scoring systems. We analyzed the clinical outcome of SBM resection in 552 consecutive patients. KPS remained unchanged or increased in 84.8% and decreased in 15.2% of patients. Morbidity was 13.2% and surgery-related mortality was 1.3%. These results are consistent with contemporary meningioma series with reported rates of neurologic morbidity (3.9–13.7%) and mortality (0–5.4%). The preoperative risk factors were analyzed, and ROC models estimating the risk of a new neurologic deficit and a decrease in KPS following SBM resection were developed.

In the following paragraphs, we review existing grading systems and compare them with the proposed ROC models. Finally, we provide a brief overview of the risk factors in meningioma surgery.

### Is surgery justified for 80-year-old or older intracranial meningioma patients? A systematic review [^114qjDqD]. Neurosurgical review (2021). Low credibility.

The study selection protocol is depicted in Figure 1. From a total of 1,039 articles, seven fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All seven studies were retrospective, conducted between 1995 and 2018. Three of the studies were performed in Italy, two in France, one in Norway, and one in the United States. The latter was based on a large national register. Altogether, the studies included 308 operated intracranial meningioma (IM) patients, with numbers varying from 11 to 93 per study. There was an overrepresentation of females in each study. One publication was written in French.
- **Preoperative characteristics**:
	- **Preoperative status and morbidity**:
		All seven studies used the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) scale to assess preoperative physical status, which varied considerably among studies. Four studies included mostly healthy patients or those with mild comorbidities (ASA classes I–II), whereas in three studies, most patients had severe systemic comorbidities (ASA classes III–V). In addition, six studies used the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) to describe IM patients' preoperative functional status. In these studies, there was an equal representation of dependent (KPS 0–60) and independent (KPS 70–100) IM patients. Six studies reported indications for surgery resection. Motor deficits (27–65% in three studies), seizures (16–43% in four studies), and changed mental status (51–59% in three studies) were the most frequent symptoms leading to resection.

### Is surgery justified for 80-year-old or older intracranial meningioma patients? A systematic review [^111Q96qd]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

After a careful patient selection process, surgical removal of intracranial meningiomas (IM) appears to be a relatively safe procedure, even in 80-year-old and older meningioma patients. However, prospective studies should confirm these findings by comparing postoperative outcomes, ideally to a matched IM patient group that undergoes conservative treatment.

### The relation between surgical cleavage and preoperative neuroradiological findings in intracranial meningiomas [^114WN1RF]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are generally benign masses, and in many cases, they do not invade the brain, thus presenting a high potential for curative treatment. The most important cause of recurrence development in the post-operative period is subtotal resection. Acquiring information that facilitates total mass resection is beneficial for establishing a good long-term clinical procedure. The aim of this study is to obtain radiological data that can provide accurate information concerning the surgical cleavage between the tumor and parenchyma during the surgical planning of meningiomas.
- **Methods**: We evaluated 85 cases with intracranial meningioma treated by the same microsurgical technique. All posterior fossa and skull base meningiomas were excluded from the study.
- **Results**: Tumor size was smaller than 3 cm in 19 cases, between 3 and 6 cm in 46 cases, and larger than 6 cm in 20 cases. The cleavage line between the tumor capsule and the underlying cortex was extrapial in 32 cases, subpial in 29 cases, and mixed in 24 cases. Dominant arterial supply was dural in 46 cases; 33 cases were predominantly mixed, and 6 cases were predominantly corticopial. In magnetic resonance images, 16 of 28 cases that showed a clear tumor-cortex interface had an extrapial cleavage line.
- **Conclusions**: When considering surgical treatment for intracranial meningiomas, it is necessary to examine whether there is a surgically safe border with the cortex underneath in the preoperative images. It can be concluded that operating on small meningiomas is appropriate if a surgically safe border is confirmed preoperatively.

### Evolution of surgical approaches in the treatment of petroclival meningiomas: a retrospective review [^116AYjpT]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

We examined the surgical approaches used at a single institution to treat petroclival meningioma and evaluated changes in method utilization over time.
- **Methods**: Craniotomies performed to treat petroclival meningioma between September 1994 and July 2005 were examined retrospectively. We reviewed 46 patients with a mean follow-up of 3.6 years. Techniques included combined petrosal or transcochlear approaches in 15% of patients, retrosigmoid craniotomies with or without some degree of petrosectomy in 59% of patients, orbitozygomatic craniotomies in 7% of patients, and combined orbitozygomatic-retrosigmoid approaches in 19% of patients. In 18 patients, the tumor extended supratentorially. Overall, the rate of gross total resection was 43%. Seven patients demonstrated progression with a mean of 5.9 years follow-up. No patients died. At 36 months, the progression-free survival rate for patients treated without petrosal approaches was 96%. Of 14 patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery, none developed progression.
- **Conclusion**: Over the study period, a diminishing proportion of patients with petroclival meningioma were treated using petrosal approaches. Utilization of the orbitozygomatic and retrosigmoid approaches alone or in combination provided a viable alternative to petrosal approaches for the treatment of petroclival meningioma. Regardless of approach, progression-free survival rates were excellent over the short-term follow-up period.

### Intraorbital meningioma: Resection through modified orbitozygomatic craniotomy [^111E8tJJ]. Neurosurgical Focus (2012). Low credibility.

Intraorbital meningiomas are challenging lesions to excise due to their location and the restricted surgical corridor available because of important neighboring structures. Lesions located in the posterior one-third of the orbit require skull base approaches for exposure and safe resection. Frontoorbital and modified orbitozygomatic (OZ) craniotomies can facilitate the exposure and resection of masses in the posterior intraorbital space. Specifically, the one-piece modified OZ craniotomy provides many advantages of the "full" OZ craniotomy, which includes a more extensive zygomatic osteotomy. The modified OZ approach minimizes the extent of frontal lobe retraction and provides ample space for the surgeon to exploit all the working angles to resect the tumor.

A video presentation discusses the nuances of technique for resection of an intraorbital meningioma through the modified OZ approach, including optic nerve decompression. The video can be found here: http://youtu.be/fP5X2QNr5qk.

### Contemporary surgical outcome for skull base meningiomas [^115cvv3H]. Neurosurgical Review (2011). Low credibility.

Although surgical excision of meningiomas and their dural base is the most common primary management, skull base meningiomas are quite distinct. Contemporary management often involves multimodal treatment with the goal of achieving the best possible functional outcome and quality of life (QOL) for these patients. Surgery plays an important role in the treatment of skull base meningiomas, so it is crucial for neurosurgeons to understand the surgical outcomes and QOL following meningioma surgery. Outcomes for meningiomas are typically measured in terms of morbidity, mortality, time to recurrence, and QOL. Significant factors in predicting surgical outcomes include the extent of resection, tumor grade, proliferative markers, and tumor location. Therefore, we address each of these factors in detail in this review.

Advances in recent decades in microsurgical techniques, neuroimaging modalities, neuroanesthesia, and perioperative intensive care have substantially improved surgical outcomes. Consequently, most surgical outcomes discussed in this review are cited from contemporary literature (2000 to the present) to reflect the surgical outcomes of current microsurgery.

### From data to practice: Brain meningioma treatment in elderly patients - a survey of the Italian Society of Neurosurgery (SINch®) and systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Lbwwd]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Low credibility.

The management of meningioma in elderly patients (MEP) presents a complex and evolving challenge. Data available offer conflicting information on treatment options and complications. This survey aimed to examine the approach to MEP, comparing the national profile at the time of writing in the literature. A survey addressing the treatment options and management of meningioma in the elderly was designed on behalf of SINch® (Società Italiana di Neurochirurgia) and sent via email to all chiefs of neurosurgical departments. The survey remained open for responses from May 5th, 2022, until November 21st, 2022.

A search of the literature published between January 2000 and March 2023, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, was included. A total of 51 neurosurgical centers participated in the survey.

- **Caseload profile influences**: The caseload profile of each center influences the choice of treatment selection (stereotactic radiosurgery versus open surgery) (p = 0.01) and the consolidated practice of discussing cases within a multidisciplinary group (p = 0.02).

The pooled meta-analysis demonstrated a significantly increased risk in the elderly group for permanent deficits (p < 0.00001), postoperative infections (p = 0.0004), hemorrhage (p = 0.0001), perioperative mortality (p < 0.00001), and medical complications (p < 0.00001) compared to the young population. This study presents the initial comprehensive analysis of the existing trends in the surgical management of MEP in Italy. The significant variation in practices primarily stems from the absence of standardized guidelines.

### Surgery on giant meningiomas in very old patients entails frequent postoperative intracranial hemorrhages and atypical histopathology [^1121qmzf]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Clinical and surgical data were extracted from the electronic patient files as described previously. In brief, we included the following information:

- **Patient characteristics**: Preoperative physical status (Helsinki version of the American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) scale), surgical indication, and functional performance (Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scale).
- **Surgical details**: Surgical time, length of hospital stay, discharge location, histopathological diagnosis, and surgery-associated morbidity and mortality.
- **Independence assessments**: Pre- and postoperative independence, i.e. living at home. Postoperative independence was evaluated at discharge and within 1 year after the surgery.

With regard to independence (the rate of very old patients living at home 1 year after surgery) and postoperative functional performance (the KPS score), we reviewed the electronic health record data of every patient. For the KPS score estimation, we used only medical notes recorded during the visits in the outpatient clinic of the Department of Neurosurgery or Neurology, as both the neurological and performance status were well documented during these postoperative visits. If a patient had multiple visits in the outpatient clinic within the first postoperative year, we used the data from the last visit to estimate the 1-year postoperative KPS score. Since the time and frequency of postoperative visits of these very old patients varied throughout the study period, the time of the KPS score estimation also varied. Electronic health record data were also used to find out if operated patients l

### Microsurgical resection of skull base meningioma-expanding the operative corridor [^111HS7zb]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

A better understanding of surgical anatomy, marked improvement in illumination devices, provision of improved hemostatic agents, greater availability of more precise surgical instruments, and better modalities for skull base reconstruction have led to an inevitable evolution of skull base neurosurgery. For the past few decades, many skull base neurosurgeons have worked relentlessly to improve the surgical approach and trajectory for the expansion of the operative corridor. With the advent of newer techniques and their rapid adaptation, it is foundational, especially for young neurosurgeons, to understand the basics and nuances of modifications of traditional neurosurgical approaches.

The goal of this topic review is to discuss the evolution of concepts in and technical nuances regarding the operative corridor expansion in the field of skull base surgery for intracranial meningioma as they pertain to achieving the optimal functional outcome.

### Vascular complications after radiosurgery for meningiomas [^111G3xbw]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

During the past 25 years, radiosurgery has evolved as a primary treatment modality for certain meningiomas when resection would be associated with high patient morbidity. Radiosurgery is now routinely used as an adjunctive therapy for residual or recurrent meningiomas after surgical removal. In this review, the authors summarize the vascular complications that occur after radiosurgery for meningiomas, as well as experimental study data that provide insight into the pathogenesis of these complications. These data may be useful when discussing with patients the risk/benefit ratio of choosing among conservative management, radiosurgery, and surgery.

### Surgery on giant meningiomas in very old patients entails frequent postoperative intracranial hemorrhages and atypical histopathology [^113swDx6]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are the most common type of intracranial tumors, and the incidence rate of meningiomas increases strongly with age. Up to 80–90% of intracranial meningiomas are classified as World Health Organization (WHO) type I, representing a benign tumor entity with a favorable prognosis. Due to the population's increasing life expectancy, the finding of intracranial meningiomas in very old patients, i.e. patients that are 80 years old and older, is becoming more frequent. Nowadays, these very old patients with meningiomas often have a good functional status and still live independently at home, despite a known increased frailty. Consequently, neurosurgeons are increasingly confronted with the question of whether major surgery (i.e. intracranial tumor surgery) is justified and beneficial for these frail and very old patients.

Giant meningiomas, i.e. meningiomas with a largest diameter of at least 5 cm, form a distinct entity. Related to their size, giant meningiomas are located more frequently in eloquent areas and have a more intricate and complex relationship with neurovascular structures. Moreover, surgery of giant meningiomas is additionally challenging due to limited intraoperative visualization, edema, prominent vascularization, and larger-sized craniotomies.

Since giant meningiomas are reported to occur more frequently with aging, and since the number of very old patients is increasing, we studied the surgical outcome of very old patients with giant meningiomas. We hypothesized that surgery of giant meningiomas increases the risk of postoperative morbidity.

### Evolution of surgical approaches in the treatment of petroclival meningiomas: a retrospective review [^111wEob6]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

We examined the surgical approaches used at a single institution to treat petroclival meningioma and evaluated changes in method utilization over time. Craniotomies performed to treat petroclival meningioma between September 1994 and July 2005 were examined retrospectively. We reviewed 46 patients (mean follow-up, 3.6 years).
- **Surgical techniques**: Techniques included combined petrosal or transcochlear approaches (15% of patients), retrosigmoid craniotomies with or without some degree of petrosectomy (59% of patients), orbitozygomatic craniotomies (7% of patients), and combined orbitozygomatic-retrosigmoid approaches (19% of patients). In 18 patients, the tumor extended supratentorially.
- **Resection and progression**: Overall, the rate of gross total resection was 43%. Seven patients demonstrated progression over a mean of 5.9 years. No patients died. At 36 months, the progression-free survival rate for patients treated without petrosal approaches was 96%. Of 14 patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery, none developed progression.

Over the study period, a diminishing proportion of patients with petroclival meningioma were treated using petrosal approaches. Utilization of the orbitozygomatic and retrosigmoid approaches alone or in combination provided a viable alternative to petrosal approaches for treatment of petroclival meningioma. Regardless of approach, progression-free survival rates were excellent over the short-term follow-up period.

### Olfaction preservation in olfactory groove meningiomas: a systematic review [^111hVHbH]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

Olfactory groove meningiomas (OGM) are a type of skull base neoplasm that arises from the lamina cribrosa and frontoethmoidal suture. They represent between 8 and 13% of all intracranial meningiomas. Patients can present with headaches, personality and cognitive changes, visual impairment, and alterations in their sense of smell. When symptomatic, management of these tumors is primarily surgical. Broadly, these tumors can be approached endonasally with an endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) or transcranially through a craniotomy. Traditionally, the selection of the approach has focused on achieving the surgical goals of frontal lobe decompression, gross total resection, vision preservation, and enhanced recovery. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of articles examining olfaction and its preservation as a quality-of-life outcome measure.

The goal of this article is to systematically review the available literature examining olfaction outcomes in patients with olfactory groove meningiomas and recommend a strategy to approach these tumors.

### Incidental intracranial meningiomas: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factors and outcomes [^117APMjz]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

Quality and bias assessment results indicate that the quality assessment for each individual study is summarized in Online Resource 8. Ten studies were rated as "good", eight as "fair", and two as "poor". According to the GRADE framework, the quality of evidence informing each pooled risk was deemed to be very low (n = 6) or low (n = 1). Funnel plots generated were suspicious for potential reporting bias when pooling the estimate proportions of intervention (treatment arm: active monitoring) and WHO grade (treatment arm: surgery). However, Harbord's and Begg's tests (p > 0.05) did not indicate statistically significant bias. Reporting bias for studies informing SRS outcomes could not be performed due to the low number of studies (n = 2).

The overall quality score was determined based on the sum of the included domains. The type of evidence was based on the design of the included studies: + 2 equates to observational cohort studies and + 4 to randomized controlled trials. The risk of bias score reflected the selection process, measures and outcomes definitions, and general methodological and statistical concerns across studies informing each outcome (range − 2 to 0). Heterogeneity was scored using the corresponding I² statistic: low (≤ 25%) = + 1, moderate (~ 50%) = 0, and high (≥ 75%) = − 1. Directness was graded using PICO, taking into consideration the year of publication and the use of surrogate outcomes (range − 2 to 0). Precision was based on the width of the 95% confidence interval.

### Risk factors for the development of serious medical complications after resection of meningiomas. Clinical article [^113VVdf5]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

While the surgical and neurological risks of meningioma surgery have been reported, much less effort has been devoted to studying the rates of serious medical complications following such a procedure. The authors performed a review of 834 patients who underwent craniotomy for meningioma at their institution and analyzed the rate of major cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and hepatic complications.

The study identified all patients between 1993 and 2007 who underwent craniotomy for meningioma. Clinical information was reconstructed using patient medical records, medication records, radiological data, and pathological specimens from both the author institution and outside medical facilities. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to test the association between the dependent variable (rate of medical complications) and all covariates with a p-value < 0.05.
- **Results**: Advanced age (> 65 years), existing neurological deficits, and the use of > 2 cardiac medications prior to surgery (p < 0.004) all demonstrated significantly increased rates of medical complications on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, only a new or worsened neurological deficit remained a significant factor.

### Bone cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115t2KnY]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for chordoma, more specifically concerning the management of skull base/clival chordoma, the NCCN 2025 guidelines recommend:

- **Intralesional excision**: Offer maximal safe excision for maximal tumor removal when appropriate, with or without adjuvant radiation therapy, in patients with resectable skull base/clival chordoma. Follow up with contrast-enhanced MRI of the primary site to assess the adequacy of excision.
- **Adjuvant radiation therapy**: Consider offering this for positive surgical margins or for large extracompartmental tumors.
- **Re-excision**: Consider performing re-excision if necessary.

### Endoscope-assisted microsurgical resection of skull base meningiomas [^116pPDw6]. Neurosurgical Review (2011). High credibility.

This study aims to determine the value of endoscope assistance in the microsurgical resection of skull base meningiomas. Forty-six patients harboring a skull base meningioma underwent an endoscope-assisted microsurgical resection. In 30 patients (65%), tumor parts that could not be visualized under the microscope were detected with the endoscope. In 26 patients (56%), these tumor remnants were removed under endoscopic view. Gross total resection was achieved in 35 patients (76%) and near-total resection in 11 (24%). There was no surgical mortality. The major complication was a new cranial nerve deficit.

The application of endoscopes was most useful in the small supraorbital craniotomies to look under the ipsilateral optic nerve and internal carotid artery, as well as to visualize the diaphragm sellae and olfactory groove. In the retrosigmoid craniotomies, the endoscope was beneficial for inspecting the internal auditory canal, looking into Meckel's cave, and inspecting areas hidden behind the jugular tubercle and tentorial edge. There were no obvious complications related to the application of the endoscope.

Endoscope assistance is particularly valuable when skull base meningiomas are to be removed via small craniotomies to inspect blind corners that cannot be visualized in a straight line with the microscope. Additionally, there is a benefit to using endoscopes with various angles of view in standard craniotomies and skull base approaches, allowing surgeons to look around bony and dural corners or behind neurovascular structures.

### Increased prevalence of obesity and obesity-related postoperative complications in male patients with meningiomas [^1134m3ow]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

The female preponderance of meningiomas may reflect hormonal influences on meningioma growth. We hypothesized that because obesity affects male steroid hormone synthesis, male patients with meningiomas might exhibit a high obesity rate, which, in turn, might increase their frequency of postoperative complications.
- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed male patients who underwent craniotomy for benign meningiomas at our institution between 2001 and 2005 (n = 32) and used male patients undergoing craniotomy for aneurysms (n = 32) or glioblastomas (n = 32) from 2001 to 2005 as control subjects. A body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m was considered obese.
- **Results**: Male patients with meningiomas had a higher average BMI (30.2 kg/m) than male patients with aneurysms (BMI = 27.5 kg/m) or gliomas (BMI = 25.9 kg/m) (P = 0.04). The obesity rate in men with meningiomas (47%) exceeded that in men with aneurysms (19%) or gliomas (3%) (P = 0.2). The median age-normalized BMI percentile was greater in men with meningiomas (67th percentile) than in men with aneurysms (49th percentile) or gliomas (52nd percentile) (P = 0.02). Deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolus was more common in men with meningiomas (19%) than in men with aneurysms (0%) or gliomas (3%) (P = 0.002). Wound infections were more common in men with meningiomas (6%) than in men with aneurysms (3%) or gliomas (0%) (P = 0.2). The 53% of obese patients with meningiomas who were readmitted with postoperative complications exceeded the 18% of nonobese patients with meningiomas who were readmitted (P = 0.03).

### Decision-making algorithm for minimally invasive approaches to anterior skull base meningiomas [^117K9BvQ]. Neurosurgical Focus (2018). Low credibility.

Anterior skull base meningiomas are benign lesions that cause neurological symptoms through mass effect on adjacent neurovascular structures. Traditional transcranial approaches have proven effective at removing these tumors. However, minimally invasive approaches involving the use of an endoscope offer the possibility of reducing brain and nerve retraction, minimizing incision size, and speeding patient recovery. Despite these advantages, appropriate case selection and results in large series are lacking.
- **Methods**: The authors developed an algorithm for selecting a supraorbital keyhole minicraniotomy (SKM) for olfactory groove meningiomas or an expanded endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) for tuberculum sella (TS) or planum sphenoidale (PS) meningiomas, based on the presence or absence of olfaction and the anatomical extent of the tumor. Where neither approach is appropriate, a standard transcranial approach is utilized. The authors describe rates of gross-total resection (GTR), olfactory outcomes, and visual outcomes, as well as complications for 7 subgroups of patients. Exceptions to the algorithm are also discussed.
- **Results**: The series included 57 patients with anterior skull base meningiomas. The mean tumor volume was 14.7 ± 15.4 cm³ (range 2.2–66.1 cm³), and the mean follow-up duration was 42.2 ± 37.1 months (range 2–144 months). Of 19 patients with olfactory groove meningiomas, 10 had preserved olfaction and underwent SKM, with olfaction preservation seen in 60%. Of 9 patients who presented without olfaction, 8 had cribriform plate invasion and underwent combined approaches.

### Stereotactic radiosurgery for meningiomas [^117KEcf8]. Neurosurgical Focus (2003). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are benign tumors attached to the dura, typically exhibiting a slow growth rate. After gliomas, they are the most common primary brain tumor. They are ideal radiobiological targets because single-fraction radiation delivers a high biologically effective dose. Furthermore, a highly conformal radiation plan can effectively treat the tumor while sparing surrounding brain tissue. Meningioma control rates are between 90% and 95%, with a low risk of morbidity. Radiosurgery is an excellent treatment for asymptomatic, small- to moderate-sized meningiomas. It is also ideal for patients with incompletely resected meningiomas, recurrent meningiomas, or risk factors that preclude conventional surgery.

### From data to practice: Brain meningioma treatment in elderly patients - a survey of the Italian Society of Neurosurgery (SINch®) and systematic review and meta-analysis [^111zHb6w]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Low credibility.

The factor of age has a significant impact on surgical indications in centers with high caseload, with a statistically significant difference compared to centers with intermediate and low caseload (p = 0.02). Additionally, age plays a significant role in the choice between an SRS approach and "open surgery" in centers with high and intermediate caseload compared to those with low caseload (p = 0.01).

Moreover, cases are more frequently discussed within multidisciplinary teams for risk stratification and defining the best treatment option in centers with high and intermediate caseload in contrast to low caseload centers (p = 0.01).

### Surgical results of 158 petroclival meningiomas with special focus on standard craniotomies [^116p5cpn]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Petroclival meningiomas (PCM) account for 2% of all meningiomas. PCMs are located ventrally to the trigeminal nerve, originate on the dura mater of the petrous bone, and extend to the clivus, petrosphenoidal ligament, tentorium, or sphenoid wing. Due to the surrounding cranial nerves (CN) and the compression and adherence to the brain stem, the resection of these tumors is challenging and comes with a high risk of neurological deficits.

Intensive discussions regarding appropriate skull base approaches aim to expose the tumor and surrounding CN as safely as possible, avoiding complications. Given the origin and extension of the tumors, various tailored approaches have been favored. However, complex skull base approaches are time-consuming during both the opening phase and the closing procedure. Therefore, standard approaches and their staged use have been advocated.
- **Standard craniotomy approaches**: The workhorse for tumors of the cerebello-pontine angle is the suboccipital retrosigmoid approach (RSA). This approach is easy to perform, done on a routine basis, and non-time-consuming. If the PCM is located purely infratentorially, the RSA can be sufficient for tumor removal. In cases where the tumor extends supratentorially, a two-stage procedure, combining the suboccipital with a fronto-temporal craniotomy, will be necessary. Notably, in PCM without significant lateral extension, some neurosurgeons consider an endoscopic endonasal approach for effective brainstem decompression.

### Delayed dural arteriovenous fistula at the transverse-sigmoid sinus secondary to petroclival meningioma surgery via far lateral approach [^115Jjivb]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are characterized by pathological anastomoses between meningeal arteries and dural venous sinuses or cortical veins. There are many causes contributing to the etiology of DAVFs. Among these, acquired DAVFs secondary to craniotomy have rarely been reported, especially delayed DAVFs at the transverse-sigmoid sinus. To date, only 12 published cases of delayed DAVFs at the transverse-sigmoid sinus secondary to craniotomy exist.

This article describes an extraordinarily rare case secondary to petroclival meningioma resection via a far lateral approach. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first well-documented case of delayed DAVF at the transverse-sigmoid sinus following far lateral craniotomy. Additionally, cases of delayed DAVFs at the transverse-sigmoid sinus secondary to craniotomy were reviewed and investigated, with the clinical characteristics and treatment also broadly discussed.

### Neurological update: Consult the neurosurgical oracle for a standard operating procedure [^113aZXL6]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

**Real-life example of a consensus process regarding duraplasty during decompressive craniectomy**: The process involves several key steps, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and expert opinion in neurosurgical decision-making. In particular, the focus is on integrating practitioners' clinical experiences and methodologies, which guide the development of a standard operating procedure.

### Route patterns of the collateral venous pathway in patients with tumors invading the superior sagittal sinus: An angiographic study and clinical applications [^1113Q95D]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Low credibility.

Surgical resection concurrent with the preservation of venous flow or repair/reconstruction/bypass of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) is the mainstay treatment for tumors arising in the parasagittal region with SSS invasion. In some patients, combined microsurgery and radiosurgery are required to reduce resection-related morbidities and the risk of tumor recurrence. Occasionally, staged operations aimed at developing a collateral venous pathway (CVP) over time are a good alternative to prevent inadvertent venous complications.

To achieve adequate resection of parasagittal meningiomas, neurosurgeons tend to make the craniotomy size wider than the tumor margins. In studies by Sindou et al. and Ricci et al, the craniotomy to remove SSS-invading parasagittal meningioma was usually extended to approximately 2 to 3 cm beyond the margins of the occluded SSS and midline to reduce venous manipulation during tumor removal and provide adequate exposure for sinus reconstruction. However, a larger craniotomy could interrupt the collateral diploic veins (DV) in the vicinity. If any of the functions of the DV are interrupted as the main CVP, this injury can lead to serious venous complications. Therefore, the distance of the diploic channels from the tumor attachment to the SSS is important for neurosurgeons in deciding the extent of craniotomy.

In the present study, we explored the distance between the tumor to the SSS and the collateral DV. The results were intriguing because more than 60% of patients with DV as CVP demonstrated very close proximity (less than 1 cm) to a DV from tumor attachment in the SSS.

### Orbitozygomatic craniotomy and trans-sylvian approach for resection of a tuberculum sella meningioma with extension to the posterior fossa [^113uDF28]. Neurosurgical Focus (2017). Low credibility.

Tuberculum sella meningiomas can be approached through lateral approaches including pterional/orbitozygomatic craniotomies, frontobasal craniotomy, or through expanded endoscopic transsphenoidal approaches. The authors present the case of a 60-year-old male who presented with bitemporal hemianopia and significant right-side visual acuity compromise due to a large tuberculum sella meningioma. The tumor had an important extension to the posterior fossa. A right orbitozygomatic trans-sylvian approach was deemed most suitable to tackle the posterior extension of the tumor. Some operative nuances are detailed in the video including dissection of the tumor off the carotid artery, basilar bifurcation, and small thalamoperforators attached to the tumor. Postoperatively, the patient's bilateral hemianopia improved significantly, but his right visual activity remained unchanged. The remaining part of the tumor in the sella and midclivus was addressed with a second-stage expanded endoscopic transclival approach. The video can be found here: https://youtu.be/KbewhlT2FWs.
