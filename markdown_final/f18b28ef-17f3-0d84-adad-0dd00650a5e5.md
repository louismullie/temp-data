## Question

approach to 15 week pregnant with proteinuria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to approach proteinuria at 15 weeks' gestation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the timing and whether this is before or after 20 weeks, because that changes the differential. Then, I should verify the best way to quantify proteinuria and why dipsticks are unreliable. Next, I will consider the key differentials at 15 weeks, including chronic kidney disease, superimposed preeclampsia, and physiologic or benign proteinuria. After that, I need to outline immediate evaluation, including baseline labs and risk stratification. Then, I should detail management principles, including blood pressure targets, thromboprophylaxis thresholds, and when to consider renal biopsy. Finally, I will plan monitoring cadence and postpartum follow-up, and I will double-check where guidelines conflict so I can reconcile them explicitly.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: at 15 weeks, new proteinuria is before 20 weeks, so it cannot be preeclampsia by standard definitions, which require hypertension with proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks. Therefore, I should not anchor on preeclampsia here, even though I need to keep superimposed preeclampsia in mind if chronic hypertension or CKD is present [^111EEdGN] [^11177e8M].

> Wait, let me verify the best way to quantify proteinuria, because management hinges on accurate measurement. Dipsticks are notoriously inaccurate in pregnancy, with high false positives and false negatives, so I should not rely on them to diagnose significant proteinuria. Instead, I should use a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio or albumin-to-creatinine ratio, recognizing that uPCR thresholds around 0.3 mg/mg (30 mg/mmol) correspond to 300 mg/24 h, and that uACR around 8 mg/mmol aligns with uPCR 30 mg/mmol. If results are borderline or discordant, a 24-hour collection remains reasonable, but many contemporary guidelines accept uPCR/uACR as sufficient for quantification in pregnancy [^112AeHE2] [^117D9Xtv] [^111hQ8aS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I need to check the key differentials at 15 weeks: chronic kidney disease (including diabetic nephropathy, glomerular disease, or ADPKD), superimposed preeclampsia on chronic hypertension, and less commonly physiologic or orthostatic proteinuria. Importantly, proteinuria before 20 weeks strongly suggests underlying renal disease rather than gestational pathology, and baseline proteinuria in CKD increases risks of adverse outcomes and superimposed preeclampsia, so I should confirm preexisting disease and quantify baseline proteinuria early [^111xZc2r] [^11181aWZ] [^111Num8M].

> I will now examine the immediate evaluation I should order. Let me think about baseline maternal labs: serum creatinine with awareness that eGFR is invalid in pregnancy and creatinine falls physiologically in the second trimester, electrolytes, CBC with platelets, liver enzymes, and a spot uPCR or uACR. I should also obtain a blood pressure profile and, if not already done, screen for diabetes and autoimmune disease. If proteinuria is nephrotic-range or there is diagnostic uncertainty, I should consider angiogenic markers (sFlt-1/PlGF ratio) after 20 weeks, but at 15 weeks they are not validated for this purpose, so I should avoid overinterpreting them now [^114NeiKM] [^111aNmhM] [^115o3T3L].

> Let me consider risk stratification next. I should confirm whether proteinuria is non-nephrotic (< 300 mg/24 h or uPCR < 30 mg/mmol) or nephrotic (≥ 300 mg/24 h or uPCR ≥ 30 mg/mmol), because nephrotic-range proteinuria in pregnancy warrants thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin given the elevated VTE risk, whereas non-nephrotic proteinuria alone is not an automatic indication and should be individualized with additional risk factors in mind [^notfound].

> I need to ensure blood pressure is addressed promptly. Target blood pressure in pregnancy, especially with CKD, is generally less than 135/85 mmHg, and first-line agents include labetalol, nifedipine, and methyldopa. I should avoid ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics in pregnancy, and if the patient is on an ACEi, I should plan a preconception or early-pregnancy conversion strategy with close monitoring [^112wFf6h] [^111WWQf2] [^1161EoDS].

> But wait, what if the proteinuria is massive and the diagnosis remains unclear? I should double-check whether a renal biopsy is indicated. In select cases during the first and early second trimester, if a histologic diagnosis will change management, renal biopsy can be performed with maternal-fetal safety considerations. This is particularly relevant if there is nephrotic syndrome, hematuria with casts, or systemic features suggesting glomerulonephritis [^1152Q58Y].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence. For women with CKD or significant proteinuria, monthly assessment of blood pressure, kidney function, and proteinuria is reasonable, with home BP monitoring encouraged. As gestation advances, fetal surveillance should intensify with growth scans every 3–4 weeks and antepartum testing, and I should remain vigilant for superimposed preeclampsia after 20 weeks, which would pivot management toward preeclampsia protocols [^1161EoDS] [^112CTDxE].

> I should confirm postpartum planning now. Women with CKD or new-onset proteinuria in pregnancy need a planned early postpartum renal review to clarify diagnosis, reassess renal function, and coordinate long-term care, because pregnancy may unmask or accelerate CKD progression and adverse pregnancy outcomes increase future cardiovascular and renal risks [^11658U3z] [^116wFqt5].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential point of confusion. Earlier I almost said "repeat proteinuria testing is not recommended once preeclampsia is confirmed", but that applies after 20 weeks in the context of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. At 15 weeks, repeating and trending proteinuria is appropriate to establish baseline and detect progression, so I should not overgeneralize that statement to this pre-20-week scenario [^115iXzYn] [^1116V4vx].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency: confirm proteinuria with uPCR or uACR rather than dipstick, exclude physiologic causes, evaluate for CKD and its etiologies, stratify by nephrotic versus non-nephrotic range, initiate BP control with pregnancy-safe agents, consider thromboprophylaxis if nephrotic, escalate fetal surveillance as gestation advances, and arrange postpartum nephrology follow-up. This aligns with contemporary obstetric and nephrology guidance and balances maternal and fetal risks appropriately [^112AeHE2] [^1161EoDS] [^1152Q58Y].

At 15 weeks' gestation, proteinuria is **not due to preeclampsia** (which begins after 20 weeks) and should prompt evaluation for **underlying renal disease** or other causes [^111EEdGN]. Confirm proteinuria with a **spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio** or 24-hour collection, as dipsticks are unreliable [^111s1gky] [^112kZRzm]. Assess for chronic kidney disease, diabetes, autoimmune disease, and infection; obtain serum creatinine, electrolytes, CBC, and consider renal ultrasound. Manage based on the cause: optimize blood pressure to < 135/85 mmHg using labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa; avoid ACE inhibitors and ARBs [^112wFf6h]. If proteinuria is nephrotic-range (uPCR > 300 mg/mmol), consider thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin [^1152Q58Y]. Monitor closely for progression and coordinate care with maternal-fetal medicine and nephrology [^1161EoDS].

## Physiological changes in proteinuria during pregnancy

Physiological changes in proteinuria during pregnancy include increased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration, which can cause **mild proteinuria** (typically < 300 mg/24 h). Pathological proteinuria exceeds this threshold and warrants further evaluation [^111xZc2r].

---

## Differential diagnosis of proteinuria at 15 weeks gestation

Proteinuria at 15 weeks is **not due to preeclampsia**; consider the following:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Renal diseases | - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) <br/> - Glomerulonephritis <br/> - Nephrotic syndrome <br/> - Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^115ZhgXV] |
| Systemic diseases | - Diabetes mellitus (diabetic nephropathy) <br/> - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) <br/> - Antiphospholipid syndrome <br/> - Preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension (after 20 weeks) [^111EEdGN] |
| Infectious causes | - Urinary tract infection (UTI) <br/> - Asymptomatic bacteriuria [^115ZhgXV] |
| Physiological causes | - Orthostatic proteinuria <br/> - Dehydration <br/> - Exercise-induced proteinuria |

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Confirm proteinuria

Confirm proteinuria with a **spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR)** or a 24-hour collection; dipsticks are screening tools only and should be confirmed quantitatively [^111s1gky] [^112kZRzm].

---

### Initial laboratory evaluation

- **Serum creatinine and eGFR**: Assess renal function; eGFR is less reliable in pregnancy, so interpret cautiously [^111aNmhM].
- **Electrolytes, CBC, liver enzymes**: Screen for systemic involvement.
- **Glucose**: Screen for gestational diabetes.
- **Autoimmune screening**: ANA, anti-dsDNA, antiphospholipid antibodies if clinically indicated.
- **Infection screening**: Urine culture for UTI or asymptomatic bacteriuria [^115ZhgXV].

---

### Imaging

Obtain a **renal ultrasound** to assess kidney size, echogenicity, and exclude structural abnormalities (e.g. ADPKD) [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### General principles

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Coordinate with maternal-fetal medicine and nephrology [^1161EoDS].
- **Monitor blood pressure**: Target < 135/85 mmHg; use labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa; avoid ACE inhibitors and ARBs [^112wFf6h].
- **Monitor renal function**: Serial creatinine and electrolytes.
- **Fetal surveillance**: Growth ultrasounds and antepartum testing as indicated [^112CTDxE].

---

### Specific interventions

- **Nephrotic-range proteinuria (uPCR > 300 mg/mmol)**: Consider thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin [^1152Q58Y].
- **Infections**: Treat UTIs or asymptomatic bacteriuria promptly [^115ZhgXV].
- **Autoimmune disease**: Immunosuppressive therapy may be indicated (e.g. corticosteroids, azathioprine); avoid teratogenic agents.

---

## Prognostic implications

Proteinuria at 15 weeks is associated with increased risks of **preterm birth**, **fetal growth restriction**, and **preeclampsia**. Long-term, it may signal CKD progression and cardiovascular disease [^111xZc2r] [^113kZnnR].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Schedule **regular visits** to track blood pressure, renal function, and proteinuria, and adjust management as needed. Provide **patient education** on warning signs (e.g. severe headache, visual changes, swelling) and when to seek care [^1116V4vx].

---

Proteinuria at 15 weeks is **not due to preeclampsia** and requires structured evaluation for underlying renal or systemic disease. Confirm quantitatively, assess for causes, and manage with multidisciplinary care, blood pressure control, and targeted therapy to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes.

Systematic reviews with meta-analysis represent the highest level of evidence used to guide clinical practice. The defining criteria used to diagnose preeclampsia have evolved, and will likely continue to evolve. Proteinuria is sufficient but not necessary when defining preeclampsia. Hypertension without proteinuria but with severe features is diagnostic. The methods used to measure urinary protein have changed. The gold standard remains the 24-hour urine test. The efficacy of low-dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia is a function of baseline risk. Data suggest that treating mild to moderate blood pressure has clear maternal benefits with little fetal or neonatal risk.

Our understanding of the various aspects of pregnancy in women with kidney diseases has significantly improved in the last decades. Nevertheless, little is known about specific kidney diseases. Glomerular diseases are not only a frequent cause of chronic kidney disease in young women, but combine many challenges in pregnancy: immunologic diseases, hypertension, proteinuria, and kidney tissue damage. An international working group undertook the review of available current literature and elicited expert opinions on glomerular diseases in pregnancy with the aim to provide pragmatic information for nephrologists according to the present state-of-the-art knowledge. This work also highlights areas of clinical uncertainty and emphasizes the need for further collaborative studies to improve maternal and fetal health.

### Interpreting abnormal proteinuria in pregnancy: the need for a more pathophysiological approach [^1151fJ6e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

This review and opinion article focuses on the definitions and meanings of abnormal protein excretion in pregnancy, asking the following questions: Are our tests to determine abnormal proteinuria adequately performed? Are current guidelines for diagnosis of excessive proteinuria, especially when used to identify preeclampsia, supported by adequate data? Can the magnitude of proteinuria be used as a reliable clinical biomarker of the gravity of preeclampsia? Should timed urine collections, primarily 24-hour excretions, be supplanted by the urine protein/creatinine ratio in clinical practice? The answers to most of these questions are: We are not sure, or some guidelines are poorly supported by data and may prove erroneous. We suggest a more physiologic approach to assessment of proteinuria and believe that if clinicians and investigators looked at proteinuria in terms of how the kidney handles protein in health and disease it would lead to a more rational and evidence-based approach to proteinuria in pregnancy. Finally, we recommend that current cutoff for abnormal proteinuria be used to diagnose preeclampsia, but the level of proteinuria should not guide management. Other variables, such as status of blood pressure control, evidence of increasing organ damage in the liver and hematological systems, evidence of falling glomerular filtration rate, and signs of neurological involvement, are more reliable indicators of severity of preeclampsia.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^116UqLe2]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.5.2

We suggest that non-nephrotic range proteinuria in pregnancy is a risk factor for thrombosis and thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin should be considered in the presence of additional risk factors (2D).

Rationale

The guideline committee endorses the assessment and management of VTE risk in women with CKD according to guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) which states that all pregnant women undergo a documented assessment of risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Nephrotic syndrome is included as a significant risk factor in RCOG guidance with thromboprophylaxis offered to women with nephrotic syndrome in the third trimester and post-partum in the absence of other risk factors. However, there is inherent difficulty in making the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in pregnancy as physiological adaptation to pregnancy includes increased proteinuria, a fall in serum albumin concentrations, and peripheral oedema. Gestation specific thresholds for proteinuria and serum albumin for the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in pregnancy have not been established. This guideline therefore opts to use the Renal Association threshold for nephrotic range proteinuria (uPCR > 300 mg/mmol or ACR > 250 mg/mmol) to define high-risk proteinuria in pregnancy for which there is expert consensus that thromboprophylaxis is warranted in pregnancy and the post-partum period in the absence of other risk factors (with risk reassessed at 6 weeks post-partum).

6.2 Risk stratification and monitoring in asymptomatic high‐risk women

6.2.1 Antenatal maternal and fetal surveillance

The Edinburgh antenatal care visit paradigm was developed in large part to assist in screening for and diagnosing pregnancy hypertension. The introduction of that paradigm of 4‐weekly visits from booking until 27 +6 weeks, fortnightly visits from 28 +0–35 +6 weeks, and weekly visits from 36 +0 weeks until delivery was associated with accelerated improvements in maternal survival. The World Health Organization (WHO) focused antenatal care model (four visits per pregnancy) was associated with less optimal perinatal outcomes compared with the Edinburgh paradigm; hence the introduction of the eight‐encounter model in 2017. Both blood pressure measurement and proteinuria screening are integral elements of a WHO‐compliant antenatal visit program; however, the inclusion of regular proteinuria assessment at all visits did not follow formal evidence review. Canada has undertaken such a review, and the national advice now specifically states that proteinuria screening should not be performed as part of routine antenatal care.

### Proteinuria during pregnancy: definition, pathophysiology, methodology, and clinical significance [^116a6eU2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Qualitative and quantitative measurement of urine protein excretion is one of the most common tests performed during pregnancy. For more than 100 years, proteinuria was necessary for the diagnosis of preeclampsia, but recent guidelines recommend that proteinuria is sufficient but not necessary for the diagnosis. Still, in clinical practice, most patients with gestational hypertension will be diagnosed as having preeclampsia based on the presence of proteinuria. Although the reference standard for measuring urinary protein excretion is a 24-hour urine collection, spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is a reasonable "rule-out" test for proteinuria. Urine dipstick screening for proteinuria does not provide any clinical benefit and should not be used to diagnose proteinuria. The classic cutoff cited to define proteinuria during pregnancy is a value of > 300 mg/24 hours or a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of at least 0.3. Using this cutoff, the rate of isolated proteinuria in pregnancy may reach 8%, whereas preeclampsia occurs among 3% to 8% of pregnancies. Although this threshold is widely accepted, its origin is not based on evidence on adverse pregnancy outcomes but rather on expert opinion and results of small studies. After reviewing the available data, the most important factor that influences maternal and neonatal outcome is the severity of blood pressures and presence of end organ damage, rather than the excess protein excretion. Because the management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features is almost identical in frequency of surveillance and timing of delivery, the separation into 2 disorders is unnecessary. If the management of women with gestational hypertension with a positive assessment of proteinuria will not change, we believe that urine assessment for proteinuria is unnecessary in women who develop new-onset blood pressure at or after 20 weeks' gestation. Furthermore, we do not recommend repeated measurement of proteinuria for women with preeclampsia, the amount of proteinuria does not seem to be related to poor maternal and neonatal outcomes, and monitoring proteinuria may lead to unindicated preterm deliveries and related neonatal complications. Our current diagnosis of preeclampsia in women with chronic kidney disease may be based on a change in protein excretion, a baseline protein excretion evaluation is critical in certain conditions such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and autoimmune or other renal disorders. The current definition of superimposed preeclampsia possesses a diagnostic dilemma, and it is unclear whether a change in the baseline proteinuria reflects another systemic disease such as preeclampsia or whether women with chronic disease such as chronic hypertension or diabetes will experience a different "normal" pattern of protein excretion during pregnancy. Finally, limited data are available regarding angiogenic and other biomarkers in women with chronic kidney disease as a potential aid in distinguishing the worsening of baseline chronic kidney disease and chronic hypertension from superimposed preeclampsia.

Pregnancy and glomerular disease — coordinated care across prepregnancy, antenatal, delivery, and postnatal phases includes defined monitoring and thresholds. Prepregnancy planning includes to "Discuss timing of conception", provide contraception advice if needed, confirm disease activity when required, adjust to "non-teratogenic medications", and counsel on risks and surveillance. Antenatal care specifies "Target BP < 140/90 mmHg", initiation of low-dose aspirin, serial assessment of kidney function and proteinuria with "24 h collections", and fetal surveillance with "Up to twice weekly BPPs", "Up to weekly placental Dopplers", and "q2 weekly growth scans"; thromboembolism prevention is to "Consider venous thromboembolic event prophylaxis if risk factors". Delivery guidance states "NOT at pre-specified gestation", "Delivery if presence of fetal or maternal decompensation", and "Glucocorticoid administration for fetal lung maturation at least 24 h and up to 7 d prior to anticipated delivery if < 34 weeks gestation". Postnatal care includes to "Continue venous thromboembolic event prophylaxis for at least 6 weeks if necessary", with ongoing surveillance, medication level checks if adjusted in pregnancy, breastfeeding encouragement, and emotional support, with abbreviations defined as "BP, blood pressure; BPP, biophysical profile; q2, every 2".

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112kZRzm]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Quality of studies

Figure 2shows a summary of the quality assessment of the included studies. We found good compliance with appropriate population spectrum, selection criteria adequately described, appropriate reference standard, and adequate description of index and reference standard. Blinding of the assessors of the outcome measure to the results of the albumin to creatinine ratio or protein to creatinine ratio was poorly reported (3/20 studies). No studies reported on the use of any treatment in between the albumin to creatinine ratio or protein to creatinine ratio and delivery or whether the results of the tests were used in determining patients' management. Verification bias was minimised, as the number of eligible women progressing to the reference standard in included studies was more than 90% in 18/20. Five out of the 20 included studies used less than 80% of included women in the final analysis; reasons for this included exclusion after trial entry, lack of verification with reference standard, and loss to follow-up. In 379 (13%) cases this was due to incomplete 24 hour urine collection.

### A literature review and best practice advice for second and third trimester risk stratification, monitoring, and management of pre-eclampsia: compiled by the pregnancy and non-communicable diseases committee of FIGO (the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) [^112NkaxG]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Current wider‐scale antenatal care is based on healthcare models developed in the early 20th century. In 1929 the UK Ministry of Health issued a Memorandum on Antenatal Clinics, recommending that women should first be seen at the 16th week of pregnancy and then at 24 and 28 weeks, fortnightly until 36 weeks, and then weekly until delivery. No explicit rationale was offered for the timing or clinical content of visits, yet these guidelines established the pattern of antenatal care that has been followed throughout the world to the present day.

A common assumption has prevailed that antenatal care should be concentrated around the third trimester of pregnancy, where most complications clinically materialize and adverse outcomes can be diagnosed. The current method of monitoring for pre‐eclampsia is based on this 90‐year‐old care pathway that requires that at every clinical visit, women are assessed for hypertension and proteinuria. However, even in the case of early‐onset disease, this approach detects hypertension and pre‐eclampsia only at a late stage of presentation, which does not necessarily allow optimization of care for both the mother and the fetus, namely stabilization of blood pressure, prophylactic corticosteroid for fetal lung maturation, and transferal to a tertiary referral unit prior to the need for immediate delivery, which is the only definitive treatment for this disorder.

In the past decade, major efforts have been made to develop tools for risk stratification and prediction of pre‐eclampsia in high‐risk women, as well as short‐term prediction in women presenting with signs and symptoms of pre‐eclampsia and those with confirmed pre‐eclampsia. FIGO brought together international experts to discuss and evaluate current knowledge on the topic and develop a document to frame the issues and suggest key actions to address the health burden posed by pre‐eclampsia.

FIGO's objective, as outlined in this document, is: (1) to raise awareness of the links between pre‐eclampsia and poor maternal and perinatal outcomes as well as of the future health risks to mother and offspring, and demand a clearly defined agenda to tackle this issue globally; and (2) to create a consensus document, which provides guidance on prediction, risk stratification, monitoring, and management of pre‐eclampsia in the second and third trimester of pregnancy, and to disseminate and encourage its use.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^111F7ioH]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.9.7

We recommend the timing of birth for women with CKD is determined by obstetric indications, with consideration of renal factors including deteriorating renal function, symptomatic hypoalbuminaemia, pulmonary oedema, and refractory hypertension (1D).

Rationale

In women with CKD mode and timing of birth is usually determined by obstetric factors. Where maternal complications arise, clinicians must balance the competing risks of preterm delivery and maternal wellbeing. Potential maternal complications, which may inform the decision for iatrogenic preterm delivery in women with CKD, include loss of maternal renal function, symptomatic nephrotic syndrome including pulmonary oedema, and refractory hypertension. If maternal complications develop before 34 weeks' gestation, attempts should be made to continue the pregnancy if possible, due to the reduction in adverse neonatal and developmental outcomes at gestations of 34 weeks' gestation and more, although this decision will depend upon maternal wellbeing and the availability and likely success of medical management options. The guideline committee acknowledges that the diagnosis of superimposed kidney injury is difficult in pregnancy due to gestational variation in serum creatinine concentrations, possible underlying disease progression, and an unpredictable physiological response to pregnancy in CKD. In women without CKD, serum creatinine concentrations fall to a nadir in the second trimester before rising back towards pre-pregnancy levels at term. The guideline committee therefore suggest that women with serum creatinine concentrations in pregnancy that are greater than pre-pregnancy concentrations warrant discussion with and/or assessment by the MDT.

There is no evidence that mode of delivery affects maternal renal function. Mode of delivery should therefore be based on obstetric indications and maternal preference according to guidance in women without CKD.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^114R4kZo]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

ADPKD pregnancy management — monitoring, blood pressure, aspirin, UTI screening, and postpartum medications: During pregnancy, regular monthly assessment of blood pressure (BP), kidney function, and proteinuria by a health care provider is recommended, and home BP monitoring is encouraged, with a suggested target BP < 135/85 mm Hg. A low dose of aspirin from week 12 to week 36 is recommended for all pregnant ADPKD women; monthly screening for urinary tract infections (UTIs) is advised and those with positive urine cultures should be treated adequately, and increased fluid intake is encouraged. After pregnancy, tolvaptan is contraindicated during breastfeeding and should not be prescribed during this time; some ACE inhibitors (ACEi) such as enalapril or captopril have very low penetration into human milk and can be used with careful monitoring of the infant for signs of hypotension if other agents are not adequately controlling blood pressure, and women with bladder instability or urinary incontinence after pregnancy should be offered pelvic floor physiotherapy, especially when tolvaptan will be prescribed.

Clinical application

When considering the most appropriate diagnostic threshold for a test in practice, one must consider the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity that relates to threshold. What is acceptable in clinical practice will be determined by the place of the test in the management pathway (such as add-on, triage, or replacement) and the nature of the disease. When considering pre-eclampsia, one would wish a replacement test (stand alone) to limit the number of false negative results, as these women run the risk of developing undetected pre-eclampsia with a risk of serious morbidity and mortality. Women with false positive results will be subjected to increased monitoring and possibly pre-term delivery. Thus, protein to creatinine ratio as a replacement test would ideally use a threshold that maximises sensitivity and specificity. If protein to creatinine ratio were to be used as a triage test, with patients who test positive going on to have a 24 hour urine collection to verify the significant proteinuria, then false negatives need to be minimised but false positives will be identified by the second test, so sensitivity can be maximised at the expense of specificity. Our results can be used to determine the most appropriate threshold for each of these situations.

The findings from the multivariate meta-analysis relate to the accuracy of protein to creatinine ratio at the summary level (that is, averaged across all studies). Considerable heterogeneity exists at any threshold for which two or more studies provide evidence, so the performance of protein to creatinine ratio in an individual study setting may be somewhat different from the summary results presented here. Further research needs to identify the causes of heterogeneity in test accuracy across studies (for example, method of measurement, inaccurate reference standards) and identify those circumstances in which protein to creatinine ratio performs consistently well.

Prevalence of proteinuria also varied considerably across studies and has a big effect on how a protein to creatinine ratio test could be used. Following the protein to creatinine test, high positive and negative predictive values above 0.85 are achieved when the prevalence is high (for example, 0.8; see appendix E). However, when the prevalence is low (for example, 0.2; see appendix C), the negative predictive value remains above 0.85 but positive predictive value is then around 0.4. Thus a negative protein to creatinine ratio remains a good test for ruling out significant proteinuria, but positive tests results may have a high rate of false positives in this low prevalence population. Clinicians thus need to know the prevalence of significant proteinuria in the population and setting under investigation to allow accurate interpretation of the test results

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^1164MCZk]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy

Guideline 5.4.1

We recommend that women with diabetic nephropathy have optimisation of blood glucose, blood pressure and proteinuria prior to conception (1C).

Guideline 5.4.2

We recommend that women with diabetic nephropathy continue angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors until conception, with regular pregnancy testing during attempts to conceive (1C).

Guideline 5.4.3

We recommend that the schedule of care, surveillance and management of women with diabetic nephropathy should be untaken according to national guidelines for diabetes in pregnancy, in addition to specialist monitoring of renal disease in pregnancy (1D).

Rationale

Most women with diabetic nephropathy have successful pregnancy outcomes. However, diabetic nephropathy in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes including pregnancy loss, congenital malformation, pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, growth restriction and neonatal unit admission; with glycaemic control at the time of conception and the severity of underlying CKD contributing. Reassuringly, a European-wide cohort study including 163 pregnancies in women with type 1 diabetes compared to 630 women with type 1 diabetes who did not undertake a pregnancy, showed that pregnancy was not an independent risk factor for the development of microvascular complications.

Pre-pregnancy counselling of women with diabetes is associated with improved glycaemic control prior to pregnancy and a reduction in rates of spontaneous pregnancy loss and congenital malformations. Data from single arm studies (n = 8–24) show that reduction of pre-pregnancy proteinuria with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) is associated with a reduction in proteinuria in pregnancy. Women with diabetes and proteinuria (n = 7) treated with ACEi prior to pregnancy to achieve blood pressure < 135/85 mmHg and albuminuria < 300 mg/day have been shown to have pregnancy outcomes comparable to women with diabetes in the absence of nephropathy. The periconceptual use of ACEi is described in section 3.3.5.

Proteinuria increases in pregnancy in the majority of women with diabetic nephropathy, including progression to the nephrotic range. Low molecular weight heparin may be indicated for the prevention of venous thromboembolism, although the level of proteinuria at which the risk of venous thromboembolism becomes clinically significant is unknown (see section 4.5).

The guideline committee endorses national guidance for the management of diabetes in pregnancy.

Blood pressure management

Guideline 4.4.1

We recommend that the target blood pressure during pregnancy for women with CKD is 135/85 mmHg or less, which should be documented in the woman's healthcare record (1D).

Guideline 4.4.2

We suggest antihypertensive treatment in women with CKD is continued in pregnancy unless systolic blood pressure is consistently < 110 mmHg systolic, or diastolic blood is pressure consistently < 70 mmHg diastolic BP, or there is symptomatic hypotension (2D).

Guideline 4.4.3

We recommend labetalol, nifedipine and methyldopa can be used to treat hypertension in pregnancy (1B).

Guideline 4.4.4

We recommend angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists and diuretics are not used to treat hypertension in pregnancy (1B).

Guideline 4.4.5

We recommend a diagnosis of superimposed pre-eclampsia is considered:
in a woman with non-proteinuric CKD, if she develops new hypertension (systolic BP > 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP > 90 mmHg) and proteinuria (uPCR > 30 mg/mmol or uACR > 8 mg/mmol) or maternal organ dysfunction after 20 weeks' gestation (1B).
in a women with proteinuric CKD if she develops new hypertension (systolic BP > 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP > 90 mmHg) or maternal organ dysfunction after 20 weeks' gestation (1B)
in a women with chronic hypertension and proteinuria, if she develops maternal organ dysfunction after 20 weeks' gestation (1B).

Guideline 4.4.6

We suggest in women with chronic hypertension and proteinuria that the development of sustained severe hypertension (systolic BP > 160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP > 110 mmHg or doubling of antihypertensive agents) and/or a substantial rise in proteinuria (doubling of uPCR or uACR compared to early pregnancy) should prompt clinical assessment for superimposed pre-eclampsia (2D).

Proteinuria, with excretion of 0. 3 g or more of protein in a 24-hour urine specimen. Although the exact incidence of preeclampsia remains unknown, this pregnancy-specific syndrome has been reported to affect 5 to 8 percent of pregnancies. Primarily a disorder of first pregnancies, it also occurs in many other settings, including multifetal gestations, chronic hypertension, and pregestational diabetes. Proteinuria, with excretion of 5 g or more of protein in a 24-hour urine specimen or 3+ or greater on two random samples collected four or more hours apart; Oliguria, with excretion of less than 500 mL of urine in 24 hours; Pulmonary edema or cyanosis; Impairment of liver function; Visual or cerebral disturbances; Pain in the epigastric area or right upper quadrant; Decreased platelet count; Intrauterine growth restriction. A woman with preeclampsia who has new-onset grand mal seizures is considered to have eclampsia.

Clinical Considerations and Recommendations Is there an effective test for identifying women at risk for preeclampsia. To date, no test has been shown to be reliable and cost-effective. The positive predictive value of uric acid levels is only 33 percent. Usefulness has not been demonstrated for Doppler velocimetry of the uterine arteries in low-risk pregnant women. What is the best treatment for preeclampsia. If the fetus is preterm and preeclampsia is mild, continued fetal and maternal evaluation is appropriate. The best tests for fetal evaluation have not been determined. The Working Group recommends weekly nonstress tests and/or biophysical profiles, twice-weekly testing if oligohydramnios or fetal growth restriction is suspected, and ultrasound examinations every three weeks. Daily assessment of fetal movement may be useful.

Laboratory tests for patients with mild preeclampsia and no progression include weekly platelet counts, liver enzyme levels, renal function evaluations, and protein levels. If disease progression is in question, testing should be more frequent. Pregnant women who are remote from term and have severe preeclampsia are best managed in a tertiary care center or in consultation with an obstetrician-gynecologist who has expertise in managing high-risk pregnancies. Daily laboratory tests and fetal surveillance may be needed.

5 CURRENT METHOD OF MONITORING FOR PRE‐ECLAMPSIA

Current wider‐scale antenatal care is based on healthcare models developed in the early 20th century. In 1929 the UK Ministry of Health issued a Memorandum on Antenatal Clinics, recommending that women should first be seen at the 16th week of pregnancy and then at 24 and 28 weeks, fortnightly until 36 weeks, and then weekly until delivery. No explicit rationale was offered for the timing or clinical content of visits, yet these guidelines established the pattern of antenatal care that has been followed throughout the world to the present day.

A common assumption has prevailed that antenatal care should be concentrated around the third trimester of pregnancy, where most complications clinically materialize and adverse outcomes can be diagnosed. The current method of monitoring for pre‐eclampsia is based on this 90‐year‐old care pathway that requires that at every clinical visit, women are assessed for hypertension and proteinuria. However, even in the case of early‐onset disease, this approach detects hypertension and pre‐eclampsia only at a late stage of presentation, which does not allow optimization of care for both the mother and the fetus, namely stabilization of blood pressure, prophylactic corticosteroid for fetal lung maturation, and transfer to a tertiary referral unit prior to the need for immediate delivery, which is the only definitive treatment for this disorder.

In the past decade, major efforts have been made to develop tools for risk stratification and prediction of pre‐eclampsia in high‐risk women, as well as short‐term prediction in women presenting with signs and symptoms of pre‐eclampsia. An overview of the existing literature is summarized in the following section.

7.6 Timed delivery

Indications for planned birth, regardless of gestational age or hypertensive disorder, include those end‐organ complications associated with a heightened risk of maternal or perinatal death. For women with pre‐eclampsia, neither the serum uric acid nor the level of proteinuria should be used as indications for delivery.

At < 34 +0 weeks there are no data to indicate that women with chronic or gestational hypertension would benefit from delivery unless there is a specific indication for birth, as listed above. At this gestational age for women with pre‐eclampsia, small randomized controlled trials suggest that expectant care may improve neonatal outcomes without increasing maternal risk. However, expectant care should be undertaken only where there are adequate services to support the needs of a sick mother and baby.

At 34 +0–36 +6 weeks there are few data to guide care of women with chronic or gestational hypertension. One study on timing of birth included women with chronic hypertension, but they had either superimposed pre‐eclampsia or "deteriorating hypertension" that satisfies the definition of superimposed pre‐eclampsia by many guidelines. The HYPITAT‐II trial included 182 women with gestational hypertension. While outcomes were similar to those of women with pre‐eclampsia in subgroup analyses, initiation of birth may have been associated with reduction in maternal but an increase in neonatal risk; however, the number of women randomized was insufficient on which to base a recommendation.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^111Num8M]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Chronic hypertension in pregnancy — renal function and baseline assessment — Moderate renal impairment defined as serum creatinine from 1.4 mg/dL to 2.4–2.8 mg/dL is associated with only 50% of women having the expected increase in creatinine clearance, and severe impairment with serum creatinine more than 2.4–2.8 mg/dL is associated with no increase in creatinine clearance; patients with impaired creatinine clearance and elevated serum creatinine levels are at risk of worsening renal disease and, thus, serial assessment is indicated. Assessment of kidney function by serum and urinary components can assist counseling and management through pregnancy, and baseline proteinuria in women with chronic hypertension significantly increases the risk of superimposed preeclampsia, preterm delivery, fetal growth restriction, and neonatal admission to intensive care; conversely, a normal baseline renal function assessment, including the absence of proteinuria, permits comparison to assist diagnosis of superimposed preeclampsia if suspected later in pregnancy.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117W8iAV]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of our systematic review were that, on average across all studies, the optimum threshold (to maximise sensitivity and specificity) for protein to creatinine ratio to detect significant proteinuria is between 0.30 and 0.35, relating to sensitivity and specificity values above 75%. However, no threshold gave a summary estimate above 80% for both sensitivity and specificity, and considerable heterogeneity existed in diagnostic accuracy across studies at most thresholds. Thus, although the protein to creatinine ratio shows promising diagnostic value, how it should be implemented in clinical practice is unclear from the evidence. For albumin to creatinine ratio, meta-analysis was not possible; the results are based on single studies and show that albumin to creatinine ratio shows potential to be a good diagnostic test. No studies assessed protein to creatinine ratio to predict adverse pregnancy outcome, and only one study assessed this for albumin to creatinine ratio, so insufficient evidence exists for us to comment on the use of these tests in this context.

The finding of "significant proteinuria" is key to the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, stratification of perinatal risk, and hence the management of pregnant women with hypertension. Women with significant proteinuria are at increased risk of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Accurate diagnosis and thus diagnostic tests are important to limit inappropriate intervention in the form of further testing or treatment. In the United Kingdom, the standard testing is for women to have a 24 hour urine collection for total protein estimation as either an outpatient or an inpatient, which is inconvenient for the women, has cost implications, can imply a delay in diagnosis and implementation of treatment, and has weaknesses resulting from incomplete collection and varying use of assays leading to inconsistent test results. A need thus exists for a quick, reliable, acceptable, and cost effective alternative. This systematic review evaluated spot protein to creatinine ratio and albumin to creatinine ratio in the management of pregnant women with suspected pre-eclampsia.

Delivery versus expectant management for gestational hypertension or preeclampsia without severe features — initial evaluation and timing: "At the initial evaluation, a complete blood count with platelet estimate, serum creatinine, LDH, AST, ALT, and testing for proteinuria should be obtained in parallel with a comprehensive clinical maternal and fetal evaluation". In diagnostic dilemmas evaluating possible superimposed preeclampsia, "a uric acid test may be considered". "Fetal evaluation should include ultrasonographic evaluation for estimated fetal weight and amount of amniotic fluid, as well as fetal antepartum testing". "Continued observation is appropriate for a woman with a preterm fetus if she has gestational hypertension or preeclampsia without severe features", and retrospective data suggest the balance favors "continued monitoring until delivery at 37 0/7 weeks of gestation in the absence of abnormal antepartum testing, preterm labor, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes… or vaginal bleeding, for neonatal benefit". Risks of expectant management are "small and counterbalanced by the increased rates of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, neonatal respiratory complications and neonatal death that would be associated with delivery before 37 0/7 weeks of gestation".

Current methods for detecting and treating preeclampsia

Based on the guidelines from various global organizations, preeclampsia is generally defined as a condition that occurs in pregnancy or the postpartum period, characterized primarily by new-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension accompanied by evidence of end-organ injury. Specifically, the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP)defines preeclampsia as gestational hypertension accompanied by proteinuria or other maternal end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks of gestation. This includes neurological complications, pulmonary edema, hematological complications, acute kidney injury (AKI), liver involvement, and uteroplacental dysfunction. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)identifies preeclampsia as new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with either proteinuria or other maternal organ dysfunction. This includes renal insufficiency, liver involvement, neurological complications, hematological complications, and uteroplacental dysfunction. In contrast, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)no longer considers proteinuria a necessary sign for diagnosing preeclampsia. ACOG's guidelines focus on elevated blood pressure with either proteinuria or other complications such as thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, impaired liver function, pulmonary edema, or cerebral/visual symptoms.

While definitions of preeclampsia historically focused primarily on the combination of high blood pressure and proteinuria, modern guidelines recognize a broader spectrum of symptoms and complications. These include, but are not limited to, organ dysfunction (such as renal, liver, or neurological complications), hematological issues such as HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets) syndrome, and uteroplacental dysfunction. This evolution in the definition allows for a more comprehensive and sensitive approach to diagnosing and managing preeclampsia, with the ultimate aim of improving outcomes for both pregnant people and their neonates.

Most interventions for PE primarily address advanced presentations, incorporating the use of antihypertensive drugs to control severe hypertension and prevent maternal morbidity, corticosteroids to prevent neonatal morbidity, and preterm delivery if evidence of HELLP syndrome or other end-organ dysfunction arises –. Several preventive strategies with mixed efficacy, among them the administration of aspirin prior to 16-weeks' gestation, have been suggested to potentially mitigate PE risk. However, the effectiveness of these strategies hinges on the availability of screening technologies capable of detecting PE biomarkers at the earliest gestational stages, thereby enabling timely intervention.

Pre‐eclampsia (PE) is a multisystem disorder that typically affects 2%–5% of pregnant women and is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, especially when the condition is of early onset. Globally, 76 000 women and 500 000 babies die each year from this disorder. Furthermore, women in low‐resource countries are at a higher risk of developing PE compared with those in high‐resource countries.

Although a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of PE remains unclear, the current theory suggests a two‐stage process. The first stage is caused by shallow invasion of the trophoblast, resulting in inadequate remodeling of the spiral arteries. This is presumed to lead to the second stage, which involves the maternal response to endothelial dysfunction and imbalance between angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, resulting in the clinical features of the disorder.

Accurate prediction and uniform prevention continue to elude us. The quest to effectively predict PE in the first trimester of pregnancy is fueled by the desire to identify women who are at high risk of developing PE, so that necessary measures can be initiated early enough to improve placentation and thus prevent or at least reduce the frequency of its occurrence. Furthermore, identification of an "at risk" group will allow tailored prenatal surveillance to anticipate and recognize the onset of the clinical syndrome and manage it promptly.

PE has been previously defined as the onset of hypertension accompanied by significant proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. Recently, the definition of PE has been broadened. Now the internationally agreed definition of PE is the one proposed by the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP).

According to the ISSHP, PE is defined as systolic blood pressure at ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure at ≥ 90 mm Hg on at least two occasions measured 4 hours apart in previously normotensive women and is accompanied by one or more of the following new‐onset conditions at or after 20 weeks of gestation:

1. Proteinuria (i.e. ≥ 30 mg/mol protein:creatinine ratio; ≥ 300 mg/24 hour; or ≥ 2 + dipstick);
2. **Evidence of other maternal organ dysfunction, including**: acute kidney injury (creatinine ≥ 90 μmol/L; 1 mg/dL); liver involvement (elevated transaminases, e.g. alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase > 40 IU/L) with or without right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain; neurological complications (e.g. eclampsia, altered mental status, blindness, stroke, clonus, severe headaches, and persistent visual scotomata); or hematological complications (thrombocytopenia–platelet count < 150 000/μL, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolysis); or
3. Uteroplacental dysfunction (such as fetal growth restriction, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler waveform analysis, or stillbirth).

It is well established that a number of maternal risk factors are associated with the development of PE: advanced maternal age; nulliparity; previous history of PE; short and long interpregnancy interval; use of assisted reproductive technologies; family history of PE; obesity; Afro‐Caribbean and South Asian racial origin; co‐morbid medical conditions including hyperglycemia in pregnancy; pre‐existing chronic hypertension; renal disease; and autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome. These risk factors have been described by various professional organizations for the identification of women at risk of PE; however, this approach to screening is inadequate for effective prediction of PE.

PE can be subclassified into:

1. Early‐onset PE (with delivery at < 34+0 weeks of gestation);
2. Preterm PE (with delivery at < 37+0 weeks of gestation);
3. Late‐onset PE (with delivery at ≥ 34+0 weeks of gestation);
4. Term PE (with delivery at ≥ 37+0 weeks of gestation).

These subclassifications are not mutually exclusive. Early‐onset PE is associated with a much higher risk of short‐ and long‐term maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.

Obstetricians managing women with preterm PE are faced with the challenge of balancing the need to achieve fetal maturation in utero with the risks to the mother and fetus of continuing the pregnancy longer. These risks include progression to eclampsia, development of placental abruption and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme, low platelet) syndrome. On the other hand, preterm delivery is associated with higher infant mortality rates and increased morbidity resulting from small for gestational age (SGA), thrombocytopenia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cerebral palsy, and an increased risk of various chronic diseases in adult life, particularly type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Women who have experienced PE may also face additional health problems in later life, as the condition is associated with an increased risk of death from future cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke, renal impairment, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. The life expectancy of women who developed preterm PE is reduced on average by 10 years. There is also significant impact on the infants in the long term, such as increased risks of insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and hypertension in infants born to pre‐eclamptic women.

The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) brought together international experts to discuss and evaluate current knowledge on PE and develop a document to frame the issues and suggest key actions to address the health burden posed by PE.

FIGO's objectives, as outlined in this document, are: (1) To raise awareness of the links between PE and poor maternal and perinatal outcomes, as well as to the future health risks to mother and offspring, and demand a clearly defined global health agenda to tackle this issue; and (2) To create a consensus document that provides guidance for the first‐trimester screening and prevention of preterm PE, and to disseminate and encourage its use.

Based on high‐quality evidence, the document outlines current global standards for the first‐trimester screening and prevention of preterm PE, which is in line with FIGO good clinical practice advice on first trimester screening and prevention of pre‐eclampsia in singleton pregnancy.1

It provides both the best and the most pragmatic recommendations according to the level of acceptability, feasibility, and ease of implementation that have the potential to produce the most significant impact in different resource settings. Suggestions are provided for a variety of different regional and resource settings based on their financial, human, and infrastructure resources, as well as for research priorities to bridge the current knowledge and evidence gap.

To deal with the issue of PE, FIGO recommends the following:

Public health focus: There should be greater international attention given to PE and to the links between maternal health and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) on the Sustainable Developmental Goals agenda. Public health measures to increase awareness, access, affordability, and acceptance of preconception counselling, and prenatal and postnatal services for women of reproductive age should be prioritized. Greater efforts are required to raise awareness of the benefits of early prenatal visits targeted at reproductive‐aged women, particularly in low‐resource countries.

Universal screening: All pregnant women should be screened for preterm PE during early pregnancy by the first‐trimester combined test with maternal risk factors and biomarkers as a one‐step procedure. The risk calculator is available free of charge at https://fetalmedicine.org/research/assess/preeclampsia. FIGO encourages all countries and its member associations to adopt and promote strategies to ensure this. The best combined test is one that includes maternal risk factors, measurements of mean arterial pressure (MAP), serum placental growth factor (PLGF), and uterine artery pulsatility index (UTPI). Where it is not possible to measure PLGF and/or UTPI, the baseline screening test should be a combination of maternal risk factors with MAP, and not maternal risk factors alone. If maternal serum pregnancy‐associated plasma protein A (PAPP‐A) is measured for routine first‐trimester screening for fetal aneuploidies, the result can be included for PE risk assessment. Variations to the full combined test would lead to a reduction in the performance screening. A woman is considered high risk when the risk is 1 in 100 or more based on the first‐trimester combined test with maternal risk factors, MAP, PLGF, and UTPI.

Contingent screening: Where resources are limited, routine screening for preterm PE by maternal factors and MAP in all pregnancies and reserving measurements of PLGF and UTPI for a subgroup of the population (selected on the basis of the risk derived from screening by maternal factors and MAP) can be considered.

Prophylactic measures: Following first‐trimester screening for preterm PE, women identified at high risk should receive aspirin prophylaxis commencing at 11–14+6 weeks of gestation at a dose of ~150 mg to be taken every night until 36 weeks of gestation, when delivery occurs, or when PE is diagnosed. Low‐dose aspirin should not be prescribed to all pregnant women. In women with low calcium intake (< 800 mg/d), either calcium replacement (≤ 1 g elemental calcium/d) or calcium supplementation (1.5–2 g elemental calcium/d) may reduce the burden of both early‐ and late‐onset PE.

Gestational hypertension or preeclampsia without severe features — expectant outpatient management up to 37 0/7 weeks of gestation is recommended and requires frequent fetal and maternal evaluation consisting of ultrasonography to determine fetal growth every 3–4 weeks of gestation, amniotic fluid volume assessment at least once weekly, and an antenatal test one-to-two times per week; maternal monitoring includes weekly evaluation of platelet count, serum creatinine, and liver enzyme levels, once weekly assessment of proteinuria for gestational hypertension, and serial blood pressure and symptom assessments using in-clinic and ambulatory approaches with at least one visit per week in-clinic.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^111xZc2r]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.1.2

We recommend women with CKD have formal quantification of proteinuria in pregnancy (1D).

Rationale

The amount of protein excreted into urine increases in normal pregnancy as a consequence of physiological changes in the kidney with gestation. These changes include an increase in renal blood flow with a corresponding increase in glomerular filtration, a more porous glomerular basement membrane, and altered tubular reabsorption. The amount of protein excreted by the kidney in pregnancy is greater than that in the non-pregnant population. The 95% confidence interval for 24 h urinary protein excretion in 270 healthy pregnant women was found to be 259.4 mg, hence abnormal proteinuria is defined as proteinuria levels of > 300 mg/24 h, twice the normal limit in non-pregnant women. For women with CKD, renal adaptation to pregnancy and relative change in proteinuria are not predictable. Formal quantification of proteinuria is therefore required in order to be able to assess relative change in pregnancy, particularly after 20 weeks' gestation when pre-eclampsia may develop (see sections 4.4.5 and 4.4.6), and in conditions where an increase in proteinuria may represent disease flare or progression.

Proteinuria in early pregnancy also predicts adverse fetal and maternal outcomes in women with CKD. The Torino-Cagliari Observational Study compared obstetric and renal outcomes in 504 women with CKD with 836 women without CKD. Proteinuria (> 1 g/24 h) was an independent risk factor for preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation (odds Ratio (OR) 3.65; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.61–8.24) and 34 weeks' gestation (OR 4.81; 95% CI 1.48–15.66). Adverse outcomes associated with proteinuria were corroborated in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 studies including 621 pregnancies in women with CKD. This study showed that women with macroproteinuria (albuminuria ≥ 300 mg/24 h or proteinuria ≥ 500 mg/24 h) had an increased risk of pre-eclampsia (OR 13.76; 95% CI 8.02–23.63) and preterm birth (OR 5.19; 95% CI 3.21–8.40).

### Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia: ACOG practice bulletin, number 222 [^111wvi8v]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Gestational hypertension — this is defined as a systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or more or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more, on two occasions at least 4 hours apart after 20 weeks of gestation, in a woman with a previously normal blood pressure; it is considered severe when the systolic level reaches 160 mm Hg or the diastolic level reaches 110 mm Hg, or both, and on occasion the diagnosis may need to be confirmed within a shorter interval (minutes) than 4 hours to facilitate timely antihypertensive therapy; it occurs when hypertension without proteinuria or severe features develops after 20 weeks of gestation and blood pressure levels return to normal in the postpartum period; up to 50% of women with gestational hypertension will eventually develop proteinuria or other end-organ dysfunction, this progression is more likely when the hypertension is diagnosed before 32 weeks of gestation, and in a cohort of 1,348 hypertensive pregnant patients those with proteinuria progressed more frequently to severe hypertension and had higher rates of preterm birth and perinatal mortality whereas women without proteinuria had a higher frequency of thrombocytopenia or liver dysfunction; women with gestational hypertension who present with severe-range blood pressures should be managed with the same approach as for women with severe preeclampsia.

### Urinary protein excretion and expectant management of early onset, severe pre-eclampsia [^116tChsX]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the importance of proteinuria in the expectant management of early onset, severe pre-eclampsia.

Methods

In this prospective series of 340 women, 24-h urine collections were performed and monitored twice weekly in a high-care ward.

Results

Seventy-four women with at least two 24-h urine collections were grouped into women with a proteinuria increase of ≥ 2 g (n = 29) and with women whose proteinuria decreased, or increased by < 2 g (n = 45). Major maternal complications, prolongation of gestation, and perinatal outcomes were comparable. Fifty-six (75%) women experienced an increase in proteinuria. When patients with heavy proteinuria (n = 83) were compared to those with moderate proteinuria (n = 257), maternal and perinatal outcomes were comparable. More days were gained before delivery in the heavy proteinuria group than in the moderate (12 vs. 9; P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Most patients experienced increased proteinuria. Neither the rate of increase nor the amount of proteinuria affected maternal and perinatal outcomes.

### ACG clinical guideline: liver disease and pregnancy [^113FPnkH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia and eclampsia — definition, frequency, and management thresholds are specified as follows: Preeclampsia is characterized by new onset hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg) and proteinuria (≥ 300 mg/24h) after 20 weeks of gestation; up to 7.5% of all pregnancies are affected, but only 25% of preeclampsia cases are severe. Eclampsia is present when grand mal seizures occur. Liver tests cannot exclusively be used to gauge clinical decisions. An expectant approach is advised until after 34 weeks gestation, but delivery is the only curative treatment and after 36–37 weeks there is no advantage in continuing the pregnancy.

### Screening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: US preventive services task force final recommendation statement [^114w4L9Q]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF hypertensive disorders of pregnancy — screening tests and thresholds: Blood pressure measurements are routinely used as a screening tool for hypertensive disorders throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period, and accurate blood pressure measurement requires an appropriate technique, a device validated for use in pregnancy, and a cuff of an appropriate size for the patient. A positive screening result for new-onset hypertension during pregnancy is defined as an elevated blood pressure reading (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg) in the absence of chronic hypertension or kidney disease measured at least 4 hours apart. Screening evaluations include testing for proteinuria when preeclampsia is suspected; however, the USPSTF found that point-of-care tests for protein in the urine had low accuracy, and evidence does not support routine point-of-care urine tests to screen for preeclampsia because proteinuria alone may not be a good predictor of preeclampsia health outcomes. Protein measurement is not used in the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia.

### Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia: a practice bulletin… [^111BW6nq]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Low-dose aspirin therapy should be started between 12 and 28 weeks' gestation for patients with one high risk factor or two moderate risk factors for preeclampsia.
- Any patient with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension at 37 weeks' gestation or greater should proceed to delivery.
- Patients with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension with severe features at 34 weeks' gestation or greater should proceed to delivery, whereas expectant management can be considered at less than 34 weeks' gestation From the AFP Editors. The presence of hypertension and proteinuria is most commonly used to diagnose preeclampsia. In a woman at 20 weeks' gestation or more whose blood pressure was previously in the healthy range, hypertension is defined as at least 140 mm Hg systolic or at least 90 mm Hg diastolic twice on measurements taken four or more hours apart.

Hypertension is considered severe when blood pressure is at least 160 mm Hg systolic or at least 110 mm Hg diastolic. Severe blood pressure values should be confirmed within a few minutes to facilitate timely intervention. To diagnose preeclampsia, women with hypertension also will have proteinuria, defined as at least 300 mg per 24-hour urine collection, a protein-to-creatinine ratio of at least 0. 3 mg per dL, or urine dipstick test result of 2+. Recommendations GOOD EVIDENCE Low-dose aspirin has been shown to reduce the incidence of preeclampsia in high-risk women. Women with one high risk factor or those with at least two moderate risk factors from Table 1 should take 81 mg of aspirin daily, starting at 12 to 28 weeks' gestation, preferably by 16 weeks, until the infant is delivered. If the mother's or infant's condition worsens, expectant management should be stopped and delivery performed.

If the infant is not expected to survive, expectant management is not appropriate because increased maternal risks are not offset by any benefit to the infant. When a woman presents with severe hypertension lasting at least 15 minutes, antihypertensive treatment, typically with oral nifedipine or intravenous hydralazine or labetalol, should be started as soon as possible and within 60 minutes of presentation to avoid such adverse outcomes as congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia, renal failure, and stroke.

Nephrologists are frequently called on to diagnose and treat renal disorders in pregnant women. In this review, we update recent literature pertinent to pregnancy and renal disease. We initially begin by describing the application of common clinical estimators of GFR and proteinuria in pregnancy and then summarize recent studies regarding pregnancy in women with chronic kidney disease and the latest information on the use of common renal medications in pregnancy. In the final section, we describe advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and the potential clinical implications of these discoveries for screening, prevention, and treatment of preeclampsia.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116bACZ8]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Hypertension in pregnancy — definitions and diagnostic thresholds are specified as follows: Normotension requires no hypertension before pregnancy with systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 90 mm Hg. Chronic hypertension is defined by a hypertension diagnosis before pregnancy or SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and must be diagnosed before 20 wk of gestation. Gestational hypertension occurs with no hypertension before pregnancy; SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, sustained on 2 measurements at least 4 h apart; and is diagnosed ≥ 20 wk of gestation. Preeclampsia consists of gestational hypertension plus proteinuria or evidence of other organ dysfunction (thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, pulmonary edema, or severe headache or visual symptoms), is diagnosed ≥ 20 wk of gestation, and may occur postpartum. Mild to moderate hypertension is SBP 140–159 mm Hg or DBP 90–109 mm Hg, sustained on 2 measurements at least 4 h apart. Severe hypertension is SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg, sustained on 2 measurements 15 min apart. Superimposed preeclampsia is preeclampsia in a patient with a history of hypertension before pregnancy or before 20 wk of gestation and may occur postpartum. HELLP syndrome is a severe form of preeclampsia with evidence of hemolysis and associated elevations in liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia, may have atypical presentation without hypertension or proteinuria, and may occur postpartum. Eclampsia is a severe form of preeclampsia with generalized seizures and encephalopathy, may have atypical presentation without preceding hypertension, and may occur postpartum.

### Management of pregnancies with suspected preeclampsia based on 6-hour vs 24-hour urine protein collection-a randomized double-blind controlled pilot trial [^1149i44U]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Traditionally, the diagnosis of preeclampsia requires elevated blood pressure measurements and proteinuria demonstrated in a 24-hour urine collection. This prolonged urine collection is associated with patient discomfort, a delay in diagnosis, and in some cases, hospitalization for further management of outcomes.

Objective

We aimed to assess the feasibility, reliability, and association between maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnancies managed according to a 6-hour vs 24-hour urine protein collection for suspected preeclampsia.

Study Design

This was a randomized controlled trial conducted at a tertiary university hospital between January 2019 and January 2021 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03724786). Patients who were hospitalized for preeclampsia workup were asked to participate and randomized at a 1:1 ratio to 6- and 24-hour urine protein collection groups. Both groups collected urine for 24 hours, during which the collection was also tested after 6-hours. After 24 hours, both results were reviewed by one of the research staff, and either the 6- or 24-hour collection result was reported to the patient's managing physician and was documented in the patient's medical record. Both patient and the managing physician were blinded to group allocation. Unblinding was undertaken in cases of a discrepancy between the results (1 of 2 results of > 300 mg protein), and the results were analyzed by intention to treat. The primary study outcome was defined as a composite of adverse maternal outcomes. The sample size was set empirically as per proof on concept design.

Results

During the study period, 115 patients participated in the trial, 101 of whom completed the follow-up and were analyzed-51 in the 6-hour group and 50 in the 24-hour group. Patient demographics were similar between the study groups. Unblinding occurred in 7 cases in the 6-hour group, in which the initial 6-hour result ranged from 168 to 475 mg. The rates of composite adverse maternal outcomes were 15.6% and 12.0% in the 6- and 24-hour groups, respectively (P = 0.59). No significant difference was demonstrated in the rate of adverse neonatal outcomes, cesarean delivery, induction of labor, gestational age at delivery, betamethasone treatment, or neonatal birthweight.

Conclusion

Managing pregnancies suspected of preeclampsia with a 6-hour urine protein collection is feasible and associated with similar maternal and neonatal outcomes. In cases where the 6-hour result is in the 168 to 475 mg range, we propose completing a 24-hour collection.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112rnTBQ]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that the protein to creatinine ratio has promising diagnostic value for significant proteinuria in suspected pre-eclampsia. The existing evidence is not, however, sufficient to determine how protein to creatinine ratio should be used in clinical practice, as it compares protein to creatinine ratio only with the presumed gold standard of 24 hour urine collection, and large heterogeneity exists in diagnostic accuracy across studies, even at the same threshold. Before its widespread implementation, the most appropriate setting, the prevalence of proteinuria in that setting, the most appropriate cut-off value to limit maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, and the further testing and interventions that should follow a positive or negative test result need to be determined, and evidence for its cost effectiveness is needed. This evidence can be obtained only by prospectively designed studies of test accuracy with adequate sample size and attention to limiting bias and using appropriate outcome measures and cost effectiveness analysis using a decision tree model. This will allow the trade-off between positive and negative benefits to be truly evaluated.

### Measuring albuminuria or proteinuria: does one answer fit all? [^113bgsG9]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurement of proteinuria is critical for diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease. A variety of measures are available to clinicians and can identify all urinary proteins (proteinuria) or urine albumin alone (albuminuria). Proteinuria and albuminuria can be measured in either a random urine sample or a timed urine collection (often over 24 hours). Although an international guideline advocates the use of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio for most purposes, this measure is not universally available worldwide and historically has been more costly than alternatives. In addition, there may be important differences in accuracy between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and others based on magnitude of albuminuria, sex, and certain clinical contexts. In this mini review, we review recommendations from international guidelines and discuss specific contexts where the optimal measure of proteinuria is unclear and, in some situations, controversial. We discuss the evidence supporting current recommendations for choice of measure, including the clinical settings of glomerulonephritis, transplantation, and pregnancy. We also discuss how patient sex and cost may impact this decision.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD: summary of recommendation statements and clinical approach to the patient [^113kZnnR]. Kidney International (2014). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders and kidney outcomes — albuminuria and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) risks are higher after preeclampsia or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, with reported incidences of albuminuria at 5–10 years of 31% versus 7%, approximate 30-year cumulative ESKD incidence of 0.4% versus 0.1%, and approximate 12-year cumulative ESKD incidence of 0.6% versus 0.1%; lower long-term ESKD risk after a history of hypertension in pregnancy is associated with a mild event, more than 10 years since the last event, no current hypertension/albuminuria/low GFR, and no wish for future pregnancies, and a history of gestational diabetes mellitus is also associated with a higher risk of ESKD.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^117D9Xtv]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.1.3

We recommend quantification of proteinuria is undertaken by protein:creatinine ratio (uPCR) or albumin:creatinine ratio (uACR). Twenty-four hour urine collection for quantification of protein is not required (1B).

Rationale

Dipstick testing of urine with reagent strips to detect proteinuria preferentially detects albumin. False positives occur with dehydration, exercise, infection and alkaline urine. False negatives occur with dilute urine, and non-albumin proteinuria. A systematic review of seven prospective studies showed that the sensitivity and specificity of a dipstick result of ≥ 1+ protein for predicting abnormal proteinuria in pregnancy (> 300 mg/24 h) ranges from 47 to 86% and 39–95% respectively, leading to the conclusion that the accuracy of dipstick urinalysis with a 1+ threshold in the prediction of significant proteinuria is poor. However, automated dipstick urinalysis provides a more accurate screening test for the detection of proteinuria than visual testing in hypertensive pregnancies.

"The frequency of these tests may be modified based on clinical findings and patient symptoms". After diagnosis, "additional quantifications of proteinuria are no longer necessary", because "this change is not predictive of perinatal outcome and should not influence the management of preeclampsia". Counseling includes, "Women should be advised to immediately report any persistent, concerning, or unusual symptoms".

Gestational hypertension:
Persistent de novo hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg) after 20 weeks of gestation in the absence of features of pre‐eclampsia.

Pre‐eclampsia de novo:
Gestational hypertension accompanied by ≥ 1 of the following new‐onset conditions at or after 20 weeks of gestation: ‐ Proteinuria: 24‐hour urine protein ≥ 300 mg/day; spot urine protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/mmoL or ≥ 0.30 mg/mg, or urine dipstick testing ≥ 2+ ‐ Other maternal organ dysfunction: ▪ Acute kidney injury (creatinine ≥ 90 µmol/L; > 1.1 mg/dL); ▪ Liver involvement (such as elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) > 40 IU/L with or without right upper quadrant or epigastric pain); ▪ Neurological complications (including eclampsia, altered mental status, blindness, stroke, or more commonly hyperreflexia when accompanied by clonus, severe headaches, and persistent visual scotomata); ▪ Hematological complications (thrombocytopenia–platelet count < 150 000/µL, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolysis); ▪ Uteroplacental dysfunction (such as fetal growth restriction, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler wave form or stillbirth).

Superimposed pre‐eclampsia on chronic hypertension:
Women with chronic essential hypertension develop any of the above maternal organ dysfunctions consistent with pre‐eclampsia.
Increase in blood pressure per se is not sufficient to diagnose superimposed pre‐eclampsia.
In the absence of pre‐existing proteinuria, new‐onset proteinuria in the setting of a rise in blood pressure is sufficient to diagnose superimposed pre‐eclampsia.

In women with proteinuric renal disease, an increase in proteinuria during pregnancy is not sufficient per se to diagnose superimposed pre‐eclampsia.

Refer to Section 7.4 "Antihypertensive therapy" for the definition of severe hypertension.

As described in the FIGO initiative on pre‐eclampsia, published in 2019, according to the associated risks of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, pre‐eclampsia can be further subclassified into:
Early‐onset pre‐eclampsia (with delivery at < 34 +0 weeks of gestation).
Preterm pre‐eclampsia (with delivery at < 37 +0 weeks of gestation).
Late‐onset pre‐eclampsia (with delivery at ≥ 34 +0 weeks of gestation).
Term pre‐eclampsia (with delivery at ≥ 37 +0 weeks of gestation).

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^1112Z7wi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Baseline evaluation for chronic hypertension in pregnancy — initial testing before or at presentation is used to detect possible end-organ involvement, and if testing was not done before pregnancy, it should be performed at entry to prenatal care. Recommended baseline tests include serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, serum creatinine, serum electrolytes (specifically potassium), blood urea nitrogen, complete blood count, spot urine protein/creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine for total protein and creatinine (to calculate creatinine clearance) as appropriate, and electrocardiogram or echocardiogram as appropriate; uric acid is no longer a recommended routine baseline test. Because the kidneys are usually the first end-organ to be affected, baseline renal function assessment commonly includes serum creatinine, a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and, if needed, a 24-hour urinary collection for total protein and creatinine clearance; for patients with borderline or abnormal urine protein-to-creatinine ratios or serum creatinine values, a 24-hour urine collection is recommended. A spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of less than 0.15 safely indicates a level of proteinuria less than 300 mg for a 24-hour sample and, in the absence of an abnormality in serum creatinine, likely does not warrant further evaluation with a 24-hour urine collection, unless there is a need to assess creatinine clearance. Evidence includes a systematic review reporting protein-to-creatinine ratio cutoffs of 0.13–0.15 with sensitivities ranging from 90% to 99% to rule out significant proteinuria of 300 mg or more, and a meta-analysis with sensitivities of 86% (95% CI, 86–93%) for a cutoff of 0.13 and 88% (95% CI, 85–92%) for a cutoff of 0.15 to detect 300 mg or more of protein in a 24-hour urine sample. Assessment of creatinine clearance may be helpful in some cases; with mild renal impairment (serum creatinine between 0.9 mg/dL and 1.4 mg/dL), there is normal intravascular volume expansion and an incremental increase in creatinine clearance.

### A woman with GN presenting during pregnancy [^112BP9Sa]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The combination of kidney disease and pregnancy has long been recognized as a high-risk situation. When renal disease is recognized for the first time during pregnancy, it presents unique problems for both the obstetric and the renal teams. Particularly difficult can be distinguishing preeclampsia from preexisting kidney disease in women presenting for the first time with hypertension, proteinuria, and reduced GFR during pregnancy. Decision-making regarding performing a kidney biopsy and treatment of glomerular disease during pregnancy is often much more complicated by safety concerns for both the mother and the developing fetus.

International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The authors went on to implement these thresholds in a pragmatic stepped‐wedge trial to see if knowledge of the test influenced behaviors and outcomes. The PARROT trial demonstrated that at an average of 32 weeks of gestation, the availability of PLGF results (using the Triage PLGF test) substantially reduced the time to clinical confirmation of pre‐eclampsia (1.9 vs 4.1 days; time ratio 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15–0.87; P = 0.027) and reduced adverse maternal outcomes (4% vs 5%; adjusted odds ratio 0.32, 95% CI, 0.11–0.96; P = 0.043), supporting the adoption of PLGF‐based testing into routine clinical practice.

The high negative predictive value of PLGF‐based tests supports their use as a "rule out" tool in women with suspected disease preterm. We suggest their use alongside clinical assessment to help rule out pre‐eclampsia in women suspected of developing the disease. While angiogenic markers may be of value in pre‐eclampsia given the number of women with both hypertension and dipstick proteinuria at baseline, this remains to be established. In addition, further work is needed to establish the value of repeated PLGF measurements in women presenting with suspected or confirmed pre‐eclampsia, particularly after 35 weeks.

### Amount of proteinuria and duration of expectant management in severe preeclampsia [^114mG93N]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study is to evaluate the association between the amount of proteinuria at the time of diagnosis of preeclampsia with severe features (severe preeclampsia [SPE]) and duration of expectant management (EM) and other perinatal outcomes.

Study Design

This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with SPE delivering live, non-anomalous singletons at 23 0/7 to 34 2/7 weeks' estimated gestational age (EGA) at a single tertiary center 2016 to 2018. Patients with proteinuria assessment (24-hour total urine protein or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio extrapolation) within 3 days of SPE diagnosis were included. Patients delivered for an indication other than SPE were excluded. Patients were categorized by amount of proteinuria (mg): none (≤ 300), mild (301–1,000), moderate (1,001–3,000), and massive (≥ 3,001). The primary outcome was the proportion of potential EM time achieved (%EM), i.e., days of EM divided by days from SPE diagnosis to 34 weeks. Secondary outcomes included delivery EGA, days of EM, and perinatal outcomes. Bivariable and multivariable analyses compared outcomes across groups.

Results

Of 295 patients included, 21% had no proteinuria, 33% mild, 19% moderate, and 27% massive. Groups differed by EGA at diagnosis, age, parity, chronic hypertension, and renal disease. %EM was not significantly different between groups (adjusted β coefficient 4.1 [95% CI -5.3, 13.5] for mild proteinuria vs. none, -4.1 [95% CI -14.9, 6.6] for moderate proteinuria vs. none, and -5.6 [95% CI -16.0, 4.7] for massive proteinuria vs. none). Increasing proteinuria was associated with earlier delivery EGA but only days of EM in the mild versus no proteinuria groups. There was no significant association between proteinuria and maternal composite morbidity, but patients with mild and massive proteinuria had higher odds of neonatal composite morbidities compared with no proteinuria.

Conclusion

Among patients with SPE, proteinuria level was not consistently associated with duration of EM. However, patients with the greatest amounts of proteinuria may have worse neonatal and selected maternal outcomes.

Key Points

· Amount of proteinuria was not associated with the duration of expectant management. · Greater proteinuria was associated with earlier delivery in severe preeclampsia. · Massive proteinuria in preeclampsia was associated with select adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.

6.1.2 Soluble fms‐like tyrosine kinase 1 to placental growth factor ratio

The role of the sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio to predict adverse outcomes related to pre‐eclampsia was investigated in a prospective study with 616 women presenting with signs and symptoms of the disease. Women were eligible for enrolment when they presented with either elevated blood pressure or proteinuria and/or symptoms such as headache, visual symptoms, right upper quadrant pain, or edema. The primary endpoint was the development of maternal and/or fetal adverse events related to pre‐eclampsia within 2 weeks. Maternal adverse events were defined as a combination of hypertension and abnormal liver function tests, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pulmonary edema, or eclampsia. Fetal adverse events included indicated delivery, fetal growth restriction, or fetal or neonatal death. Adverse events occurred in 43.5% of all patients (n = 268) and in 33.5% of women presenting at less than 34 weeks of gestation (n = 59). Women who had an adverse event related to pre‐eclampsia had a significantly elevated sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio compared with those who did not (47.0, interquartile range [IQR] 15.5–112.2 vs 10.8, IQR 4.1–28.6; P < 0.001). In women who presented at less than 34 weeks of gestation (n = 176), the results were more striking (226.6, IQR 50.4–547.3 vs 4.5, IQR 2.0–13.5; P < 0.001). For women who presented before 34 weeks of gestation, the addition of the sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio to hypertension and proteinuria significantly improved the prediction for subsequent adverse outcomes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.93 for hypertension, proteinuria, and sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio versus 0.84 for hypertension and proteinuria alone; P < 0.001). Delivery occurred within 2 weeks of presentation in 86.0% of women with an sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio greater than 85 compared with 15.8% of women with an sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio less than 85 (hazard ratio, 15.2; 95% CI, 8.0–28.7).

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116AjnBq]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality that complicates 2–8% of all pregnancies. It is a multisystem endothelial disease that leads to glomeruloendotheliosis, and in severe cases it may lead to renal impairment and failure. "Permeability" of the glomerular basement membrane to proteins, including albumin, is key to the diagnosis. The presence of significant proteinuria (in addition to hypertension) predisposes a pregnant woman to coagulopathy, liver disease, and stroke. Serious perinatal morbidity occurs in the form of preterm delivery (often iatrogenic) and fetal growth restriction. The diagnosis of pre-eclampsia (International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy) is determined by the presence of elevated blood pressure combined with significant proteinuria (≥ 0.3 g/24 hours) after the 20th week of gestation in a previously normotensive, non-proteinuric patient. One of the "cornerstones" of antenatal care includes a screening programme directed at the detection of pre-eclampsia with regular measurements of blood pressure and urinalysis for proteinuria (often using urinalysis dipsticks). The "dipstick analysis", using visual reagent strips, is quick, portable, and easy to do. However, urine samples are taken at varying times of the day. This test is complicated by relatively high false positive and false negative rates, so it is almost always followed up by the "gold standard" test of 24 hour urine collection. This test is in itself not without problems. The collection is cumbersome, time consuming, inconvenient (to patients as well as hospital staff), and subject to errors such as incomplete collection leading to inaccuracies (in 13–68% of collections). Delays may occur in the institution of a management plan while results are awaited, and verification of diagnosis of pre-eclampsia may not be possible if patients deliver before the urine collection is complete. The laboratory assay methods used also vary widely, and the incidence of significant proteinuria has been shown to vary depending on the assay used.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^11658U3z]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.10.2

We recommend women with CKD have a planned early postpartum renal review (1D).

Rationale

There are no published data to guide post-partum surveillance on women with CKD. Whilst guidelines for the management of CKD do not require follow up secondary care for all patients, every woman with suspected kidney disease (acute or chronic) newly identified in pregnancy and all those with known CKD should have a clear plan in place for appropriate postpartum follow up. Timing of postpartum follow-up should be determined by the MDT, guided by the level of and change in renal function, the aetiology of CKD, blood pressure, and the need for post-partum therapeutic drug monitoring. For women who are thought to have previously undiagnosed CKD in pregnancy, post-partum renal review should be arranged in order to facilitate diagnosis. This may not have been possible in pregnancy if a biopsy was not done, or due to difficulties interpreting renal function in the context of gestational change or in the face of superimposed preeclampsia. Appropriate treatment should be advised and a pathway for long-term care made clear both to the patient and her primary care physician. The key is to avoid women being lost to follow-up and presenting years later with what might have been avoidable, progressive kidney disease.

Guideline 4.10.3

We recommend that women with CKD are prescribed medications that are compatible with breastfeeding whenever possible (1D).

Rationale

Women with CKD should be supported in their wish to breastfeed and be prescribed medications which are considered safe in lactation (see section 2). Currently, breastfeeding is not advised for infants of mothers taking mycophenolate mofetil as there are no data to confirm safety. If mycophenolate mofetil is deemed to be the only therapeutic option, then breastfeeding should be avoided.

Guideline 4.10.4

We recommend that women with CKD are offered safe and effective contraception post-partum and receive updated pre-pregnancy counselling before future pregnancies (1D).

Rationale

The provision of information and a choice regarding contraceptive method within seven days of delivery has been set as a quality standard in the UK, addressing a priority area for quality improvement in health and social care. Safe and effective methods of contraception in women with CKD are detailed in section 3.1.3.

Events during pregnancy including obstetric complications, the development of superimposed pre-eclampsia, and a decline in maternal renal function will inform future obstetric risk, necessitating the need for new pre-pregnancy counselling to ensure informed decision-making regarding future pregnancy.

### Insulin requirements in type 1 diabetic pregnancy: do twin pregnant women require twice as much insulin as singleton pregnant women? [^116Hr5fT]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

A retrospective study including all twin pregnancies in women with type 1 diabetes referred to our center during 2000–2011. Data were available for 15 out of 16 twin pregnancies identified.

For comparison, 108 prospective singleton pregnant women with type 1 diabetes and previously studied relevant available clinical data from the same center during 2004–2006 were included.

At 8, 14, 21, 27, and 33 weeks weight, HbA₁c, insulin dose, and blood pressure were recorded, and a urine dipstick test was taken to screen for proteinuria. Total insulin doses are presented to focus on the usefulness of the data in the clinical setting. Data on insulin dose after 33 weeks were not available for the twin pregnancies due to high rate of preterm delivery.

The patients registered their self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) values in diabetes diaries, which were evaluated at each clinical visit. The values were not downloaded electronically from the glucose monitors. Patients were instructed to perform self-adjustments of insulin dose in between clinical visits based on the SMPG profiles of the previous 3 days to maintain preprandial SMPG of 4.0–6.0 mmol/L, 90 min postprandial SMPG of 4.0–8.0 mmol/L, and prebedtime SMPG of 6.0–8.0 mmol/L. Insulin dose was adjusted further at each visit after their caregiver reviewed their SMPG profiles. HbA₁c < 5.6% in second part of pregnancy was recommended. Overall, patient management remained fairly unchanged during the study period.

Diabetic retinopathy was diagnosed with retinal photos at inclusion.

The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency. According to Danish law, the regional committees for ethics and science did not have to be contacted.

Statistical analysis

Data are given as median (range) or number (%). Differences between groups were analyzed using χ² test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate, for categorical variables and by Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney tests when appropriate for continuous variables.

The median increment in total insulin requirement during pregnancy was based on each patient's change in insulin dose from before pregnancy until 33 weeks.

Statistically significant differences were defined as P < 0.05.

### Management of gestational hypertension-preeclampsia… [^1125JQB8]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

For a diagnosis of gestational hypertension to be made, the patient must have been normotensive before becoming pregnant and must have a blood pressure of at least 140/90 mm Hg before 20 weeks' gestation at least two times and at least six hours apart. Sustained blood pressure measurements over 160/110 mm Hg are classified as severe gestational hypertension. Preeclampsia is characterized by proteinuria in addition to hypertension. Because urine dipstick assessments correlate poorly with proteinuria, 24-hour protein excretions should be measured. The definition of severe proteinuria requires a protein excretion of at least 5, 000 mg per 24 hours. The etiology of preeclampsia is unknown, but widespread pathologic changes can result in pulmonary edema, oliguria, seizures, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal liver enzymes.

Despite the results of several trials, the use of aspirin or supplementation with calcium, vitamins C and E, magnesium, zinc, or fish oils has not been proved to prevent preeclampsia. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Experts disagree about the optimal treatment of mild gestational hypertension and mild preeclampsia before 37 weeks' gestation. Although prolonged bed rest or hospitalization are frequently recommended, no randomized controlled trials validate these approaches. In addition, immobilization increases the risk of thromboembolism. Antihypertensive drugs appear to lower rates of progression to severe disease but have not been shown to improve outcomes for the pregnant woman or the fetus. There is agreement that mother and fetus should be carefully monitored, although the optimal form of surveillance has not been determined.

Daily fetal movement counts usually are combined with regular nonstress tests or biophysical profiles. Ultrasonic determination of fetal weight and volume of amniotic fluid at diagnosis and every three to four weeks after diagnosis may be used to monitor patients. In countries outside the United States, Doppler flow velocimetry is used to monitor uteroplacental blood flow. Maternal blood usually is checked weekly for platelet count, hepatic enzymes, and serum creatinine level. The general protocol for the management of mild gestational hypertension or preeclampsia is shown in the accompanying figure.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^11181aWZ]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 3.3.2

We recommend women with CKD are advised there is an increased risk of complications in pregnancy including pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and neonatal unit (NNU) admission, and that they are more likely to require caesarean delivery (1C).

Rationale

Cohort studies and meta-analysis show that women with CKD have an increased risk of antenatal complications including pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, fetal growth restriction compared to women without CKD, although a successful pregnancy is feasible for most women. A meta-analysis that compared 2682 pregnancies in women with CKD with 26,149 pregnancies in healthy controls showed that weighted averages of adverse maternal events in women with CKD and healthy controls were 11.5 and 2% respectively, with a two-fold increase in adverse neonatal outcomes (premature births, fetal growth restriction, small for gestational age, neonatal mortality, stillbirths, and low birth weight) in women with CKD. The likelihood of adverse outcomes are predominantly dependent on baseline excretory renal function, hypertension, proteinuria and, to a lesser extent, aetiology of renal disease. However, as adverse outcomes are more common even in women with preserved excretory renal function (pre-pregnancy CKD stages 1 and 2) than the general obstetric population, counselling should be offered to all women with CKD. A questionnaire study in the UK found that over 90% of women with CKD attending pre-pregnancy counselling found consultations informative and helpful in making a decision on pursuing pregnancy.

The provision of pre-pregnancy counselling is likely to depend upon local availability of expertise. However the guideline committee recommend expert, multidisciplinary pre-pregnancy counselling for women with an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m², women with CKD progression, women with uncontrolled hypertension (> 140/90 mmHg), women with nephrotic-range proteinuria, women with active renal disease, women with lupus nephritis, women with renal transplants and all women with previous adverse obstetric outcomes.

BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and setting

We performed a secondary data analysis on a large cohort of pregnant women enrolled as part of the Alliance for Maternal and Child Health Improvement (AMANHI) biorepository study. Between May 2014 and June 2018, the AMANHI study enrolled 10,001 pregnant women between 8 to < 20 weeks of gestational age from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Tanzania. Women were enrolled after confirmation of pregnancy and gestational age through ultrasound, at the time of enrollment, 24–28 or 32–36 weeks of gestation, at the time of birth and 6 weeks after delivery. At each contact, trained field workers collected detailed information on the health and care-seeking behavior of the pregnant woman using standardized tools across all sites. A detailed description of the study sites and characteristics of the cohort has been published previously.

Trained community health workers (CHWs) measured women's blood pressure and performed dipstick urinalysis for proteinuria at 24–28 weeks, 32–36 weeks, and 38–40 weeks, whereas postnatal blood pressure was checked at the 0–6-day visit and finally at 42–60 days of delivery. Blood pressure was measured using an automated pregnancy-validated oscillometric device (WatchBP® Home Monitor, Microlife®, Taipei, Taiwan). Women were instructed to sit quietly and rest for 15 min with their legs uncrossed. After the resting period, their measurements were taken with the participant sitting upright with proper back support and arm supported on a table or a surface at heart level. Blood pressure was then measured three times, with 3-min intervals between each reading. The blood pressure for the visit was calculated as the average of the second and third readings. All readings were stored electronically in.NET databases.

In cases where the blood pressure reading was greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg at least four hours apart during any of the visits, CHWs referred the pregnant woman to the study physician for further investigation. They were prescribed oral methyldopa (250 mg) and advised to follow up after a week. If blood pressure was recorded as greater than 150/100 mm Hg, the physician provided oral methyldopa (500 mg) and referred the women to a tertiary care hospital for further management. In cases where preeclampsia was suspected, they were referred to a comprehensive emergency obstetric care facility as advised by the study physician.

10 COST‐EFFECTIVENESS OF SUPPLEMENTING CURRENT CLINICAL PRACTICE WITH PLACENTAL GROWTH FACTOR‐BASED TESTS

The diagnosis of pre‐eclampsia is based on blood pressure, maternal end‐organ involvement (i.e. proteinuria, maternal symptoms, maternal signs, and laboratory test abnormalities), and fetoplacental dysfunction. The criteria can result in false‐positive diagnoses. This may lead to unnecessary antenatal admissions, requests for multiple laboratory tests and, not infrequently, the decision of iatrogenic preterm delivery.

A Health Technology Assessment was undertaken in the UK in 2016based on three published studies, with the aim to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and cost‐effectiveness of PLGF‐based tests for patients referred to secondary care with suspected pre‐eclampsia at 20–37 weeks of pregnancy. The authors performed an independent economic analysis based on a decision tree model. The model evaluated costsfrom an NHS and Personal Social Services perspective. The total cost of managing a false‐positive diagnosis of pre‐eclampsia was £9576.25 and a true positive case of severe pre‐eclampsia was £14,545.49. Based on the modelling study, the authors concluded that the model predicts that when testing supplements routine clinical assessment to rule out and rule in pre‐eclampsia, the two tests are cost saving when performed between 20 and 35 weeks of gestation, and marginally cost saving when performed at 35–37 weeks. Length of neonatal intensive care unit stay was the most influential parameter in sensitivity analyses.

Another UK cost utility study showed that with the current clinical practice without the use of sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio test information, 36% of women were hospitalized before a diagnosis of pre‐eclampsia, of whom only 27% subsequently developed pre‐eclampsia. If the test information was available, the proportion of women hospitalized could be reduced to 16%, of whom 38% would have subsequently developed pre‐eclampsia. Among women who were not hospitalized, approximately the same proportion subsequently developed pre‐eclampsia. The introduction of the sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio is also expected to reduce the number of hospitalizations at first presentation, before developing pre‐eclampsia, from 36% to 16%. The authors concluded that the introduction of the sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio into clinical practice results in cost savings of £344 per patient compared with a non‐test (current clinical practice). Savings are primarily through an improvement in diagnostic accuracy and reduction of unnecessary hospitalization.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to screening for preeclampsia, ISSHP 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain quantitative proteinuria testing for preeclampsia in patients with suspected or at high risk of developing preeclampsia. Define proteinuria as ≥ 30 mg/mmol urine protein-to-creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample, albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 8 mg/mmol, or ≥ 0.3 g/day in a complete 24-hour urine collection, or ≥ 2+ by urinary dipstick if confirmatory testing is not available.

### A hierarchical procedure to select intrauterine and extrauterine factors for methodological validation of preterm birth risk estimation [^113n7MCe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Risk factors definitions

We classified the sample of 111 pregnant women in low (i.e. n = 68) or high risk (i.e. n = 43) for PTB, according to the 2012 ACOG clinical management guidelines, considering risk factors related to obstetrical and gynecological history and pregnancy complications. Each risk factor has been labeled in relation to the environment from which it originates: uterus (U), placenta (P), fetus (F), or extrauterine indicating those clinical conditions that do not originate from the utero-placenta-fetal system. Both mother age (p = .075) and gestational age (p = .71) did not significantly differ between low and high risk subsamples of pregnant women (see Table 1 and Fig. 1). PTB was defined as any delivery below 37 weeks and 0 days of gestational age, regardless of the etiology (spontaneous or iatrogenic). Dating of pregnancy was confirmed in all cases included in the study with ultrasound crown-rump length measurements obtained in the first trimester. Fetal growth restriction was defined in presence of fetal biometry below the 3rd centile for gestational age or, with a drop in abdominal circumference below the 10th centile or EFW of > 2 quartiles or > 50 percentiles and/or abnormalities of fetal or uterine Doppler. Pregnancy induced hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg developing after 20 weeks of gestation, whereas hypertension that antecedes pregnancy or was present on at least two occasions before the 20th week of gestation or persists longer than 12 weeks postpartum was defined as chronic hypertension. Preeclampsia was defined as a new onset of hypertension and proteinuria or a new onset of hypertension and significant end-organ dysfunction with or without proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation or postpartum in a previously normotensive woman. Short cervix was defined in presence of transvaginal ultrasound measurement cervical length below 15 mm at 20–24 weeks. Polydramnios was defined as a deepest amniotic fluid above 8 cm, oligohydramnios as an amniotic fluid index below 5 cm. Placenta previa was defined when the lower edge of the placental insertion was distant from the internal os ≤ 15 mm at time of delivery, and abruption placentae as any hemorrhage above 20 weeks trimester resulting in the evidence of bleeding from the placental bed.

The explanatory variables are socio-demographic, clinical, laboratory, and management. These are maternal age, residency, parity, gestational age, number of gestation, the presence of antenatal care visit, place of antenatal care, eminent symptoms, the number of convulsions, duration of convulsions, referral system to our hospital, past obstetric history, history of self-chronic illness, history of family chronic illness, vital signs at admission, blood pressure at referral, labor initiation, duration of labor, place of delivery, mode of delivery, indication for cesarean section, antihypertensive requirement, anticonvulsant requirement, and laboratory/imaging findings.

Definitions: Adverse maternal outcomes included maternal mortality or one or more serious complications of major organ morbidity. Hypertensive disease of pregnancy: Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 90 or systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 140 with two occasions at least 4 h apart and 1 week, after 20 weeks of pregnancy and 12 weeks of the postpartum period with ± proteinuria. Maternal death or maternal mortality is defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes. Maternal near-miss: The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th version defined a maternal near-miss case as a woman who nearly died but survived a complication that occurred during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy. Uncontrolled seizure: It is when there is a requirement of another anticonvulsant or reloading of Magnesium Sulfate after 15 min of an initial loading dose of Magnesium Sulfate to control recurrent seizures.

Preeclampsia/eclampsia

Preeclampsia is defined by the presence of hypertension and proteinuria after the 20 th week of gestation; it affects 2–8% of all pregnancies. Eclampsia is considered when pregnant women with preeclampsia develop seizures without any other explanation. Preeclampsia/eclampsia is a multisystemic disorder characterized by an abnormal vascular response to placenta growth associated with vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, metabolic changes and increased inflammatory responses. Hepatic involvement may be explained by hepatic arterial vasospasm and precipitation of fibrin within the portal and periportal areas of the liver lobule, which may result in lobular ischemia and hepatocyte necrosis.

The diagnosis is based on hypertension with blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg in two consecutive measures (interval 6 h) and proteinuria: urine proteins ≥ 0.3 g in a 24-h urine specimen, a protein (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL) ratio of 0.3 or higher, or a urine dipstick protein of 1. Women complain of persistent and severe headache with vomiting, peripheral edema, diplopia and blurred vision. Abnormal live enzymes are present in 20% to 30% of cases, with mild to moderate elevation (1.5–5 times normal). Conjugated bilirubin, albumin and PT tend to remain normal. Preeclampsia is considered as severe if the following features are present: pulmonary edema, seizures, oliguria, thrombocytopenia (< 100,000/μL), abnormal liver enzymes associated with persistent epigastric or right upper-quadrant pain and central nervous system symptoms such as headaches, blurred vision, blindness or altered mental status. Preterm delivery (15–65%) and fetal growth restriction (10–25%) are the most common adverse consequences to the fetus.

The liver condition associated with preeclampsia/eclampsia does not need specific treatment and the medical approach is based on blood pressure control, relief of associated symptoms and prompt treatment of seizures. After 37 weeks, women with preeclampsia should be delivered. In preeclampsia cases with severity criteria, delivery should be considered at week 34 or even before (24–34 weeks), if there is fetal or maternal worsening.

7.5 Magnesium sulfate and other strategies for women with pre‐eclampsia

There is clear evidence that magnesium sulfate halves both the incidence of seizures among women with pre‐eclampsia, and the recurrence of seizures among women with eclampsia. Among women with pre‐eclampsia, the number needed to treat (NNT) is approximately 100 to prevent one seizure. However, it is controversial whether all women with pre‐eclampsia should receive magnesium sulfate due to an elevated risk of cesarean delivery, more maternal adverse effects, and higher costs (i.e. USD [year 2001] $23 000 to prevent one seizure if administered to all women with pre‐eclampsia). As the NNT is lower among women with "severe" pre‐eclampsia (approximately 50), it is reasonable in well‐resourced settings to restrict magnesium sulfate use to "severe" pre‐eclampsia as defined in the Magpie trial: blood pressure ≥ 170/110 mmHg and ≥ 3+ proteinuria, or blood pressure ≥ 150/100 mmHg with ≥ 2+ proteinuria and neurological signs or symptoms of "imminent eclampsia" (which was not defined but is taken to mean headache, visual symptoms, or clonus). Each unit should have a consistent policy concerning their use of magnesium sulfate.

The dosing regimens used in the Magpietrial should be used (e.g. 4 g intravenous loading and 1 g per hour maintenance intravenously). This includes continuation of magnesium sulfate for 24 hours, until further evidence is published on the effectiveness of alternative dosing that is either smaller in dose or abbreviated in duration. Monitoring of serum magnesium levels is not necessary unless there is reduced kidney function or another reason for heightened risk of toxicity.

There is evidence that antenatal magnesium sulfate given prior to preterm birth for fetal neuroprotection prevents cerebral palsy and reduces the combined risk of fetal/infant death or cerebral palsy. Benefit is seen regardless of the reason for preterm birth, with similar effects across a range of preterm gestational ages and different regimens.

Hypertensive pregnancy is a major cause of iatrogenic prematurity. Antenatal corticosteroids for acceleration of fetal pulmonary maturity should be used in hypertensive as in other pregnancy based on gestational age criteria and local policy.

Plasma volume expansion with colloid solutions does not improve pregnancy outcomes, and may increase the need for cesarean delivery, decrease pregnancy prolongation, and increase the risk of pulmonary edema. For women with pre‐eclampsia, total fluid intake in labor should be restricted to approximately 80 mL per hour.

1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Pre‐eclampsia is a multisystem disorder that typically affects 2%–5% of pregnant women and is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, especially when the condition is of early onset. Globally, 76 000 women and 500 000 babies die each year from this disorder. Furthermore, women in low‐resource countries are at a higher risk of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and pre‐eclampsia compared with those in high‐resource countries. This is because socioeconomic, educational, and environmental disadvantages have historically beset vulnerable communities, leading to nutritional disparities, poor‐quality diet, obesity, and diabetes (before and during pregnancy), thus increasing the rates of pregnancy complications, in particular pre‐eclampsia.

Pre‐eclampsia has been traditionally defined as the onset of hypertension accompanied by significant proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. Recently, the definition of pre‐eclampsia has been broadened. Now the internationally agreed definition of pre‐eclampsia is that proposed by the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP).

According to ISSHP, pre‐eclampsia is defined as systolic blood pressure at ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure at ≥ 90 mmHg on at least two occasions measured 4 hours apart in previously normotensive women and is accompanied by ≥ 1 of the following new‐onset conditions at or after 20 weeks of gestation:
Proteinuria: 24‐hour urine protein ≥ 300 mg/day; spot urine protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/mmoL or ≥ 0.3 mg/mg, or urine dipstick testing ≥ 2+
Other maternal organ dysfunction: ‐ Acute kidney injury (creatinine ≥ 90 µmol/L; > 1.1 mg/dL); ‐ Liver involvement (such as elevated liver transaminases > 40 IU/L) with or without right upper quadrant or epigastric pain; ‐ Neurological complications (including eclampsia, altered mental status, blindness, stroke, or more commonly hyperreflexia when accompanied by clonus, severe headaches, and persistent visual scotomata); ‐ Hematological complications (thrombocytopenia–platelet count < 150 000/µL, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolysis); ‐ Uteroplacental dysfunction (such as fetal growth restriction, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler wave form or stillbirth).

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^111hQ8aS]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

24-h urine collection is time-consuming and subject to inadequacies in collection. Outside of pregnancy, uPCR and uACR are highly correlated with 24-h urine collection and are more convenient in clinical practice. Pregnant cohorts show a similar correlation between 24-h urine protein excretion and both uPCR and uACR. A prospective multi-centre cohort study of 959 pregnant women after 20 weeks' gestation with hypertension and trace protein or more on urine dipstick found that both uPCR and uACR could be both used as rule out tests for preeclampsia with no additional benefit from 24-h urine collection.

There is on-going debate as to whether uPCR or uACR should be preferentially used for the quantification of proteinuria in pregnancy. In non-pregnant patients with CKD, uACR is the investigation of choice as it provides greater sensitivity at lower levels of proteinuria, although uPCR can be used as an alternative, particularly where uACR is 70 mg/mmol or greater. In contrast, uPCR is currently the most common test used to quantify proteinuria in pregnancy. A single centre experience of 181 pregnant women without CKD showed that uACR and uPCR were highly correlated to each other, with equivalent performance in the prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes. More recent, larger, prospective cohort data from normal pregnancies show that although uACR and uPCR are comparable in performance, uACR had a significantly higher area under the receiver-operating curve (ROC) for the diagnosis of severe pre-eclampsia compared to local laboratory uPCR (ROC 0.89 versus 0.87, p = 0.004). However it remains unclear whether this small absolute difference translates into significant clinical benefit. Cost effectiveness for uACR over uPCR was also suggested, although 95% confidence intervals for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio crossed zero due to significant uncertainty and the small difference in incremental cost and quality added life years. There are no published data on the predictive and/or diagnostic benefits of uACR compered to uPCR in pregnant women with CKD. It is therefore the consensus of the guideline group that the decision to use uACR or uPCR should be based on local obstetric experience ensuring a baseline measurement in early pregnancy in order to be able to recognise relative change in proteinuria in pregnancy. In women without pre-existing proteinuria, diagnostic performance equivalent to 30 mg/mmol of uPCR is achieved with a uACR cut-off of 8 mg/mmol.

Preeclampsia — risk identification and prevention — states that patients at high risk for developing preeclampsia should be treated with low-dose aspirin therapy to reduce that risk. An early evaluation might also consist of a complete metabolic panel and urine protein/creatinine ratio in patients at risk for having underlying hepatic or renal disease. Patients with one or more high-risk factors or two or more moderate-risk factors should be offered low-dose aspirin therapy between 12 and 28 weeks' gestation (optimally before 16 weeks) and should be continued until delivery.

### Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia: ACOG practice bulletin summary, number 222 [^112bET4Y]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "ACOG criteria for preeclampsia" for preeclampsia and hypertension in pregnancy.

The ACOG diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia is a clinical calculator developed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. It is specifically designed for pregnant women and is used to diagnose preeclampsia, a potentially dangerous pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the early detection and management of preeclampsia, which can help prevent severe complications such as eclampsia, organ damage, and preterm birth. The ACOG criteria for preeclampsia include factors such as blood pressure measurements, proteinuria, and signs of organ dysfunction.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the ACOG diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia. However, it is important to note that this calculator is only applicable to pregnant women and should not be used in non-pregnant individuals or for diagnosing other conditions.

The ACOG criteria for preeclampsia calculator determines if a patient meets the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia by assessing three key metrics: blood pressure, proteinuria, and symptoms associated with new-onset hypertension. Each of these factors is evaluated using specific conditions that are assigned points reflecting their clinical importance.

For blood pressure, two conditions are examined:

- A systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher, or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or higher (based on two measurements at least four hours apart in a patient with previously normal blood pressure, after 20 weeks of gestation) scores 3 points.
- A more severe case, where the systolic blood pressure is 160 mmHg or higher, or the diastolic blood pressure is 110 mmHg or higher, scores 20 points.

Proteinuria, the presence of excess protein in urine, is assessed using different methods:

- No proteinuria scores 0 points.
- A level of 300 mg or more in a 24-hour urine collection, a protein/creatinine ratio of 0.3 mg/dL or more, or 2+ on a dipstick (in circumstances where other methods aren't available) each score 2 points.

The presence of new-onset hypertension combined with any one of the following conditions also affects the score:

- Thrombocytopenia, indicated by platelet counts less than 100×10⁹/L, scores 2 points.
- Renal insufficiency, evident either by a serum creatinine level higher than 1.1 mg/dL or the serum creatinine concentration doubling without other renal issues, adds 2 points.
- Impaired liver function, noted by elevated liver transaminases to twice their normal concentration, scores an additional 2 points.
- Pulmonary edema scores 2 points.
- New-onset headaches that don't respond to medication and can't be explained by other conditions, or visual symptoms, both add 2 points.

Scores from these categories are summed to get a total. In interpreting this total score:

- A score of 5 or more indicates the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia are met.
- If the score reaches 22 or more, it suggests the criteria for severe preeclampsia are met.
- A score below 5 suggests that the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia are not fulfilled.

This systematic approach helps clinicians make informed decisions about the presence and severity of preeclampsia, guiding effective patient care.

Introduction

Higher blood pressure (BP) measurements are associated with more adverse outcomes outside of and during pregnancy. To stratify risk management and justify additional investigations and interventions, a systolic BP (sBP) ≥ 140 mmHg and diastolic BP (dBP) ≥ 90 mmHg have long been categorized as hypertension. In pregnancy, hypertension has been regarded as chronic if hypertension is recorded at < 20 weeks gestation and as gestational if hypertension first appears ≥ 20 weeks gestation. When gestational hypertension occurs with proteinuria, another maternal end-organ complication, or uteroplacental dysfunction, the criteria are met for classification as preeclampsia, the hypertensive disorder of pregnancy associated with the highest maternal and perinatal risks.

AJOG at a Glance

In 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recommended lowering the BP thresholds for diagnosis of hypertension outside of pregnancy based on the association of these lower BP values with elevated cardiovascular risk. BP was considered to be normal if < 120/80 mmHg, and the traditional definition of hypertension (sBP ≥ 140 mmHg and diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg) has been termed stage 2 hypertension. Two new BP categories were created, namely elevated BP (sBP, 120–129 mmHg and dBP < 80 mmHg) and stage 1 hypertension (sBP, 130–139 mmHg and dBP, 80–89 mmHg).

Since 2017, the diagnostic criteria for hypertension from a sBP ≥ 140 mmHg and a diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg have not been changed in any of the pregnancy hypertension guidelines. In 2019, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) called for investigation into the consequences of adopting the 2017 ACC-AHA BP criteria. Many studies have been published, evaluating the association between preeclampsia (and other adverse pregnancy outcomes) and elevated BP, stage 1 hypertension, or a combination of both, particularly when BP was measured < 20 weeks gestation.

4 CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS HETEROZYGOUS FOR ALPORT SYNDROME P/VARIANTS

Although there are recommendations available for the clinical management of adults with Alport P/LP variants, (Nozu et al.) there are currently no published recommendations specifically for the evaluation and management of the pregnant person with an Alport syndrome P/LP gene variant. We present the following recommendations for evaluating and managing these individuals during and after pregnancy, as well as for evaluating and managing the pregnant person's family and the child or children resulting from the pregnancy; these recommendations are summarized in Figure 1. We recognize that individual circumstances, such as access to nephrologists and genetic counselors and insurance coverage limitations, may cause variation in implementing these recommendations.

FIGURE 1
Potential management algorithm for individuals with positive carrier screenings for Alport syndrome. GA, gestation; P/LP, pathogenic/likely pathogenic.

4.1 Management of individuals identified with P/variants in the obstetric setting

Proteinuria is a key risk factor for kidney disease progression in people with a COL4A3–5 variant, and in a pregnant person may be associated with an increased chance for preeclampsia and development of nephrotic syndrome levels of proteinuria. Screening for proteinuria by urine protein–creatinine ratio (UPCR) should ideally occur before pregnancy or at least before 20 weeks gestation. Proteinuria (UPCR > 0.3 mg/mg or 300 mg/g) present before pregnancy or before 20 weeks gestation indicates the presence of kidney disease, while proteinuria appearing after 20 weeks gestation could be due to Alport syndrome‐associated, new onset proteinuria or preeclampsia. Pregnant persons with new onset proteinuria should be evaluated and followed for hypertension, and kidney function should be evaluated through serum creatinine measurements. When proteinuria is present before pregnancy or 20 weeks' gestation, the patient should be referred to nephrology and managed using existing clinical practice guidelines for kidney disease during pregnancy (Fitzpatrick et al; Schmidt et al; Wiles et al.). Prophylactic low‐dose aspirin should also be considered for prevention of preeclampsia (Rolnik et al.).

4.2 Management of individuals with P/variants outside of pregnancy

In the absence of proteinuria, annual screening for onset of proteinuria by a primary care provider or a nephrologist is recommended. Individuals who develop proteinuria should be referred to nephrology for management. Postpartum individuals whose proteinuria appears after 20 weeks' gestation should be referred to nephrology if proteinuria does not resolve within 6 weeks of delivery (Cífková).

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^115o3T3L]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Making the diagnosis of superimposed pre-eclampsia is complex in women with chronic kidney disease, particularly in the presence of pre-existing proteinuria and/or hypertension as these two signs are part of the diagnostic criteria for pre-eclampsia. Appearance of a new feature and/or the development of maternal organ dysfunction (Table 2) should lead to a diagnosis of preeclampsia being considered. Proteinuria is usually a feature of pre-eclampsia; however it is not required for diagnosis where there is other maternal organ dysfunction. Although it is recognized that gestational rises in blood pressure or protein excretion may occur, sudden and substantial change in these parameters in a woman with CKD should prompt her clinicians to evaluate her for a diagnosis of superimposed pre-eclampsia.

Table 2
Maternal organ dysfunction in pre-eclampsia. Adapted from

National guidelines recommend the use of placental growth factor-based testing (e.g. Triage placental growth factor (PlGF) test or the Elecsys immunoassay soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1)/PlGF ratio), alongside standard clinical assessment and subsequent clinical follow-up, to help rule-out pre-eclampsia in women presenting with suspected pre-eclampsia between 20 weeks and 34 weeks plus 6 days of gestation. These tests have high sensitivity and negative predictive value for the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia and the need for delivery within 14 days in general obstetric cohorts; use of revealed PlGF testing halves the time to diagnosis of pre-eclampsia and reduces severe maternal adverse outcomes. PlGF-based testing has been reported to have similar diagnostic utility in small cohorts of women with CKD.

Venous thromboembolism

Guideline 4.5.1

We recommend that women with nephrotic-range proteinuria (uPCR > 300 mg/mmol or ACR > 250 mg/mmol) be offered thromboboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin in pregnancy and the post-partum period unless there is a specific contraindication including risk of labour or active bleeding (1D).

### Use of a smartphone app to explore potential underuse of prophylactic aspirin for preeclampsia [^112s1NGy]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Preeclampsia, characterized by new onset of hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks' gestation, is a leading factor associated with maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortalityand occurs in 2% to 8% of all pregnancies. It is one of the few preventable causes of prematurity, yet it currently is associated with approximately 15% of premature births. Randomized clinical trials support the use of low-dose aspirin (LDASA) (75–150 mg daily) during pregnancy as an effective prophylactic approach. However, the association of LDASA with a protective effect has been reported to depend on 3 conditions. The first is appropriate and early identification of patients at moderate to high risk of preeclampsia; prophylaxis has been reported to be optimal if started before 16 weeks' gestation and may still be associated with improved outcomes if initiated before 28 weeks. The second is communication between patients and their prenatal care practitioner, with the receipt of clear communications regarding risk being positively associated with LDASA use. The third is daily aspirin adherence on the part of the pregnant person, which review studies have shown may be challenging to achieve. Thus, achievement of the potential benefits of LDASA in a real-world clinical setting would require accurate and quick identification of patients at risk for preeclampsia, clear communication of a prophylactic recommendation to patients, and ensuring adherence to that recommendation.

### CKD in reproductive-aged women: a call for early nephrology referral and multidisciplinary care [^116wFqt5]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy and CKD: risks and complications

Pregnancy poses significant challenges for woman with kidney disease due to the complex bidirectional interactions between kidney disease and pregnancy. Women with CKD are at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, which include AKI, worsening of proteinuria, and progression of underlying CKD. They are also at increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly preeclampsia, which is associated with AKI, accelerated CKD progression, and end-stage kidney disease. Recent data from United Kingdom reveal that 46% of pregnancies in women with CKD stages 3–5 had kidney disease progression -defined as at least 25% reduction in eGFR or the need for renal replacement therapy – within one year postpartum. Additionally, pregnancies in women with CKD stages 3–5 has been shown to shorten the time to renal replacement therapy by 2.5–4.7 years.

Given these risks, individuals with advanced CKD should be counseled about the potential irreversible loss of kidney function during pregnancy, which can be severe enough to necessitate the initiation of dialysis. In addition to maternal risks, there is also a significant increase in adverse fetal outcomes such as small gestational age, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, intrauterine growth restriction, and even fetal demise. Maternal and fetal risks vary considerably across CKD stages and are exacerbated by the presence of comorbidities. Studies show that maternal and fetal risks are present even in earlier CKD stages, though generally to a lesser extent than in advanced stages. For instance, worsening hypertension, increased proteinuria, and preeclampsia can develop in up to one-third of pregnant women with mild CKD. Prematurity (birth before 37 weeks), low birth weight, and fetal demise occur at slightly higher rates in women with mild CKD compared those without kidney disease.

Comorbidities further elevate these risks, particularly diabetes, chronic hypertension, and autoimmune disorders which can significantly affect maternal and fetal outcomes if not well controlled before pregnancy. Pregnancy-related AKI has a significant impact on maternal and fetal outcomes. During the postpartum period, hemorrhage, infections, antibiotics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can all increase the risk of AKI.

To manage these risks effectively, patients require thorough education on the potential complications and need for close monitoring and physicians' guidance in selecting the safest timing for pregnancy. Given the elevated risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) across all CKD stages, a multidisciplinary approach that includes early involvement of a nephrologist is essential to optimize outcomes for both mother and child.

3.2 Antepartum blood pressure management

HDPs of pregnancy are the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, contributing to 14% of maternal deaths world‐wide. 24 The ACOG 25 identifies the importance of identification and treatment of acute onset, severe hypertension in pregnant or postpartum women, emphasizing, "the goal is not to normalize blood pressure, but to achieve a range of SBP 140–150/ DBP 90–100 mm Hg in order to prevent repeated, prolonged exposure to severe systolic hypertension". 25 More commonly seen is gestational hypertension defined as onset of hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg) after 20 weeks of gestation without proteinuria or absence of new signs of end‐organ dysfunction. The diagnosis evolves into preeclampsia if new‐onset proteinuria or end‐organ dysfunction accompany elevated blood pressure.

The ACOG Practice Bulletin on Chronic Hypertension in Pregnancy 26 acknowledged its conflict with the 2017 ACC/AHA Blood Pressure Guideline recommendations, as the hypertension diagnosis threshold for nonpregnant women is lower compared with ACOG's criteria. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that nonpregnant patients with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130‐139 mm Hg and/or DBP 80‐89 mm Hg) with CVD risk factors should begin treatment. While ACOG states that it is reasonable to continue to manage a chronic hypertensive patient in pregnancy similarly to the ACC/AHA guidelines for chronic hypertension, there is no recommendation for management of a gestational hypertensive woman within the stage 1 range. A secondary analysis of a low‐dose aspirin trial for preeclampsia prevention found that aspirin did not appear to lower the risk of preeclampsia in the group redefined as stage 1 hypertensive. 27 Application of the ACC/AHA blood pressure guidelines to pregnant women thus needs to be an active area of research. Without contemporary data and randomized controlled trials demonstrating improved outcomes with lower hypertension thresholds, it is difficult to translate current CVD guidelines to an antepartum population. For example, the Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study (CHIPS) randomized trial of "less‐tight" control (target DBP 100 mm Hg) or "tight" control (target DBP 85 mm Hg) demonstrated no significant differences in the risk of pregnancy loss, high‐level neonatal care, or overall maternal complications, although less‐tight control was associated with higher frequency of severe maternal hypertension. 28 Research is needed to determine whether lower blood pressure thresholds and treatment targets in pregnancy improve long‐term CVD outcomes.

Background

Prognostic criteria to inform women with moderate to severe renal insufficiency who wish to bear children are not well established.

Study Design

Longitudinal multicenter cohort study.

Settings & Participants

Nondiabetic white women with pregnancies proceeded beyond the 20th week and estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (< 1 mL/s/1.73 m²) before conception.

Predictors

Baseline GFR and proteinuria (exposure); other clinical characteristics at conception (covariates).

Outcomes & Measurements

Difference in GFR decreases before conception versus after delivery (mixed linear models); low birth weight (< 2,500 g), and maternal renal survival (logistic and Cox regressions).

Results

49 women were studied. Mean serum creatinine and GFR at conception were 2.1 ± 1 (SD) mg/dL (186 ± 88 micromol/L) and 35 ± 12 mL/min/1.73 m² (0.58 ± 0.2 mL/s/1.73 m²), respectively. Overall mean GFR after delivery was less than before conception (30 ± 13.8 versus 35 ± 12.2 mL/min/1.73 m² [0.50 ± 0.23 versus 0.58 ± 0.20 mL/s/1.73 m²]; P < 0.001), but the rate of GFR decrease did not change (0.55 ± 0.8 versus 0.50 ± 0.3 mL/min/mo [0.0092 ± 0.013 versus 0.0083 ± 0.005 mL/s/mo]; P = 0.661). Independent of potential confounders, the combined presence of baseline GFR less than 40 mL/min/m² (< 0.67 mL/s/m²) and proteinuria with protein greater than 1 g/d, but not either factor alone, predicted faster GFR loss after delivery compared with before conception (1.17 ± 1.23 versus 0.55 ± 0.39 mL/min/mo; difference, 0.62 mL/min/mo; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27 to 0.96 mL/min/mo [0.020 ± 0.021 versus 0.0092 ± 0.007 mL/s/mo; difference, 0.10 mL/s/mo; 95% CI, 0.005 to 0.016 mL/s/mo]). The presence of both risk factors, but not either alone, also predicted shorter time to dialysis therapy or GFR halving (N = 20; hazard ratio, 5.2; 95% CI, 1.7 to 15.9) and low birth weight (N = 29; odds ratio, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.03 to 25.6).

Limitations

Generalizability to other settings; study power.

Conclusion

In women with renal insufficiency, the presence of both GFR less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (< 0.67 mL/s/m(2)) and proteinuria with protein greater than 1 g/d before conception predicts poor maternal and fetal outcomes.

### Nephrotic syndrome in pregnancy poses risks with both maternal and fetal complications [^113RvJF1]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

In the absence of uncontrolled hypertension or renal insufficiency, many consider the perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with nephrotic syndrome to be good. To further investigate this we performed a retrospective chart review of women with biopsy-proven nephrotic syndrome due to primary glomerular disease during pregnancy at a single tertiary center. Our review determined characteristics, presentation, management, pathologic diagnoses, and associated renal and maternal-fetal outcomes of 19 individuals with 26 pregnancies and 26 offspring. The mean age was 27.6 years, the mean gestational age at the presentation of nephrotic syndrome was 18.6 weeks, the mean creatinine was 0.85 mg/dL, mean serum albumin was 1.98 g/dL, and the mean proteinuria was 8.33 g/24 hours. The mean cardiac output was 8.6 L/minute, which was elevated compared to normal pregnancy. A kidney biopsy was performed during pregnancy in 8 individuals (median gestational age at time of biopsy was 21 weeks), changing management in six. Of the 26 pregnancies, maternal complications included preeclampsia in seven, acute kidney injury in six, premature rupture of membranes in two, and cellulitis in three. The mean age of gestation at delivery was 35.5 weeks. Fetal complications included low birth weight (under 2,500 g) in 14, intra-uterine growth restriction in three, and neonatal intensive care unit admission in eight. Thus, pregnant women with nephrotic syndrome are at high risk for developing both maternal and fetal complications, even in the absence of significant renal impairment or uncontrolled hypertension at the time of presentation of nephrotic syndrome.

Pregnancy status assessment and timing relative to donation — because a fetus may be harmed by radiation or radiocontrast, programs should confirm absence of pregnancy before tests such as abdominal CT or nuclear GFR; some guidelines suggest it may be reasonable to proceed without a quantitative β-hCG test if menses is not overdue and there are no pregnancy symptoms; a woman should not donate while pregnant, candidates should avoid becoming pregnant from approval for donation until recovery after nephrectomy, approximately 1% develop postoperative venous thromboembolism after donor nephrectomy, estrogen-based oral contraceptives before surgery should be balanced against harms, and barrier birth control can be appropriate in the weeks before surgery.
