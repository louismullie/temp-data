## Question

Can I use a PPI in chronic kidney disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can be used in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether there is a valid indication for a PPI. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about PPI use in CKD. Next, I will review the strength and limitations of the evidence linking PPIs to kidney harm. After that, I need to consider dose, duration, and alternatives. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation with monitoring advice and a bottom line answer.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: in CKD, PPIs are often used for gastroprotection with antiplatelet therapy, for GERD/esophagitis, and for stress ulcer prophylaxis in high-risk settings, so the question is not just "can I use a PPI", but "when should I use it, at what dose, and for how long" given potential kidney risks and the patient's competing priorities [^116dxK18] [^115h2VaF] [^113mPPi1].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. KDIGO 2024 explicitly recommends considering PPI gastroprophylaxis when prescribing antiplatelet or antithrombotic therapy in CKD, particularly when dual antiplatelet therapy is used, reflecting a favorable risk–benefit balance in that context [^116dxK18]. The ACG GERD guideline similarly states PPIs can be used in renal insufficiency with close monitoring or nephrology input, and it does not recommend routine creatinine monitoring solely due to PPI use in otherwise low-risk patients, which reassures me that routine lab surveillance is not mandated for all CKD patients on PPIs [^115h2VaF] [^113hRHhu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the quality of the evidence suggesting harm. Multiple large observational cohorts and meta-analyses report associations between PPI use and incident CKD, CKD progression, and ESRD, with effect sizes typically modest (HRs around 1.2–1.5) and substantial risk of bias, confounding, and exposure misclassification, so causality remains uncertain [^1112XSGJ] [^114ygbc8] [^116hdNif] [^116pjru4]. I should double-check that randomized data are sparse; indeed, a 3-year pantoprazole RCT did not show increased CKD, but it had limited ascertainment and was not powered for renal endpoints, so it cannot fully exclude harm [^113sqVL3].

> Wait, let me verify whether CKD-specific data change the calculus. Several CKD cohorts suggest no increased risk of progression to ESRD or death with PPIs versus H2 blockers or no acid suppression, which tempers concern in established CKD, though these are observational and limited by confounding and adherence uncertainty [^115zN5Mp] [^112woTnL]. Conversely, some pre-ESRD and post-AKI cohorts, particularly in Asian populations, associate PPI use with faster progression, so I should be cautious in advanced CKD and consider alternatives when feasible [^111MdMPk] [^113nzq64].

> I will now examine mechanisms and dose-response to guide practice. Plausible mechanisms include acute interstitial nephritis, hypomagnesemia with downstream tubular injury, and CYP2C19-mediated interactions, and several studies show higher risk with twice-daily dosing and longer cumulative exposure, reinforcing a "lowest effective dose for the shortest duration" approach rather than blanket avoidance [^1112XSGJ] [^114ygbc8] [^114vGqzm]. Let me reconsider whether any of these mechanisms mandate routine labs; unless there are additional risk factors, routine creatinine checks solely for PPI use are not recommended, but I should maintain vigilance for AKI symptoms and drug interactions [^115h2VaF].

> Next, I should review alternatives and mitigation. H2 receptor antagonists are reasonable substitutes when PPIs are not essential, though they are less potent for GERD control and ulcer prophylaxis; in CKD, they are not clearly safer for renal outcomes, so the choice should be indication-driven and periodically reassessed [^115h2VaF] [^115zN5Mp]. I need to ensure I am not conflating NSAID risk with PPI risk; NSAIDs are definitively nephrotoxic and should be avoided in advanced CKD, whereas PPIs carry a possible, modest renal signal and should be used judiciously rather than reflexively discontinued when clearly indicated [^112epMqU] [^111X1Brb].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. Yes, PPIs can be used in CKD when there is a clear indication such as GERD with esophagitis, H. pylori eradication, or gastroprotection with antiplatelet therapy, with preference for the lowest effective dose, once-daily scheduling when effective, and the shortest necessary course with planned deprescribing trials whenever possible [^115h2VaF] [^116dxK18]. I should confirm that patients avoid unnecessary long-term use and that we periodically review all medications for continued indication, especially in polypharmacy-prone CKD populations [^115h2VaF].

> But wait, what if the patient has advanced CKD, is on multiple nephrotoxins, or recently had an AKI episode? In those higher-risk scenarios, I should have a lower threshold to choose an H2 blocker if clinically acceptable, monitor kidney function more closely, and consider magnesium assessment if on prolonged therapy, recognizing that evidence is imperfect and decisions should be individualized [^115h2VaF] [^111Psyk6]. I should double-check for interacting drugs metabolized via CYP2C19 and coordinate with cardiology or gastroenterology when gastroprotection is essential but renal risk is elevated [^114vGqzm].

> Bottom line, after weighing guidelines, observational signals, and mechanistic plausibility, I conclude that PPIs can be used in CKD when indicated, but they should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration, with periodic reassessment of need and consideration of alternatives in high-risk CKD patients. Routine creatinine monitoring solely for PPI use is not required, but clinicians should remain alert to AKI and drug–drug interactions in this population [^116dxK18] [^115h2VaF] [^111Psyk6].

---

PPIs can be used in CKD when clinically indicated, but **use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration** and monitor renal function periodically [^115h2VaF] [^115oq4s8]. Observational studies link PPIs to AKI, AIN, and CKD progression, but causality is uncertain and confounded [^116pjru4]; nonetheless, **avoid routine or long-term use without indication** and consider H2 blockers or antacids when appropriate [^115oq4s8] [^115UkEb4]. If PPIs are necessary (e.g. for GI bleeding prophylaxis with antiplatelets), monitor for AKI, electrolytes, and bone health, and reassess the need regularly [^116dxK18] [^111Psyk6].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of PPIs in CKD

PPIs are minimally renally cleared, so **no dose adjustment is required** in CKD; however, prolonged use may increase risks of hypomagnesemia, fractures, and infections, which are more consequential in CKD [^115h2VaF] [^111Psyk6].

---

## Evidence linking PPIs to adverse renal outcomes

Multiple observational studies and meta-analyses associate PPIs with adverse renal outcomes, including:

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Increased risk, partly via acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) [^116hdNif] [^114ygbc8].
- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Higher incident CKD and progression risk with prolonged use [^1112XSGJ] [^114ygbc8].
- **End-stage renal disease (ESRD)**: Elevated risk in long-term users, though confounding is likely [^114ygbc8] [^116pjru4].

These associations are modest and likely confounded; **causality remains unproven** [^116pjru4] [^116dCEyc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **judicious PPI use** in CKD:

- **KDIGO 2024**: Recommends periodic medication review to assess continued indication and potential nephrotoxicity, including PPIs [^115oq4s8].
- **ACG 2022**: States PPIs can be used in renal insufficiency with close monitoring; routine creatinine monitoring is not required unless other risk factors exist [^115h2VaF] [^113hRHhu].
- **KDIGO 2022**: Suggests reconsidering PPIs as first-line peptic ulcer prophylaxis due to links with AKI and CKD; H2 blockers are alternatives [^114FAMjv].

---

## Risks and benefits of PPI use in CKD

| **Potential benefits** | **Potential risks** |
|-|-|
| Effective acid suppression for GERD, peptic ulcer disease, and GI bleeding prophylaxis | Increased risk of AKI, AIN, and CKD progression |
| Reduced GI bleeding risk in patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy | Hypomagnesemia, fractures, and infections |
| Minimal renal clearance, no dose adjustment required | Observational associations, not proven causality |

---

## Clinical scenarios where PPIs may be necessary in CKD

PPIs may be appropriate in CKD for:

- **GI bleeding prophylaxis**: With antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, especially dual antiplatelet therapy [^116dxK18] [^115nce78].
- **Peptic ulcer disease**: Active ulcers or H. pylori eradication.
- **Severe GERD**: Refractory to H2 blockers or antacids.

---

## Alternative therapies and strategies

To minimize PPI-related risks, consider:

- **H2 receptor antagonists**: Lower AKI/CKD risk signal, though less potent [^notfound].
- **Antacids**: For mild symptoms.
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, dietary changes, head-of-bed elevation [^notfound].
- **Periodic deprescribing**: Reassess need and taper if possible [^111Psyk6].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

When PPIs are used in CKD, **clinicians should**:

- **Monitor renal function**: Periodic creatinine/eGFR checks, especially with long-term use or other nephrotoxins [^115h2VaF].
- **Watch for AKI**: Promptly evaluate rising creatinine or new proteinuria [^notfound].
- **Assess electrolytes**: Magnesium, calcium, and vitamin B12 with prolonged therapy [^notfound].
- **Reassess indication**: Regularly review ongoing need and dose [^115oq4s8].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Use PPIs in CKD only when clearly indicated**, at the lowest effective dose, and for the shortest duration [^115h2VaF] [^115oq4s8].
- **Monitor renal function periodically**, especially with long-term use or other nephrotoxins [^115h2VaF].
- **Consider H2 blockers or antacids** when appropriate to reduce exposure [^115UkEb4].
- **Reassess the need for continued PPI therapy regularly** and deprescribe when possible [^115oq4s8].

---

PPIs can be used in CKD when indicated, but **clinicians should balance benefits and risks**, favor the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and monitor renal function and electrolytes. Avoid routine or long-term use without a clear indication, and consider alternatives when feasible [^115h2VaF] [^115oq4s8].

### The association of proton pump inhibitors and chronic kidney disease: cause or confounding? [^113w1PXe]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss whether the recently described relationship between proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use and the risk of adverse kidney outcomes represents a causal relationship or is merely the result of confounding.

Recent Findings

A wave of observational studies has described an association between PPI use and the risk of development of chronic kidney disease and its progression to end-stage renal disease. The results are generally robust and remarkably consistent across different studies. The application of modern pharmacoepidemiologic methods to estimate the effect of a putative unmeasured or unknown confounder or set of confounders on the relationship of PPI use and risk of adverse renal outcomes suggests that confounding is unlikely to explain away the reported association.

Summary

The constellation of evidence from all available studies suggests that PPI use is associated with increased risk of adverse kidney outcomes. Exercising vigilance in the use of PPI is warranted.

Abstract

Pharmacoepidemiology studies are increasingly used for research into safe prescribing in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Typically, patients prescribed a drug are compared with patients who are not on the drug and outcomes are compared to draw conclusions about the drug effects. This review article aims to provide the reader with a framework to critically appraise such research. A key concern in pharmacoepidemiology studies is confounding, in that patients who have worse health status are prescribed more drugs or different agents and their worse outcomes are attributed to the drugs not the health status. It may be challenging to adjust for this using statistical methods unless a comparison group with a similar health status but who are prescribed a different (comparison) drug(s) is identified. Another challenge in pharmacoepidemiology is outcome misclassification, as people who are more ill engage more often with the health service, leading to earlier diagnosis in people who are frequent attenders. Finally, using replication cohorts with the same methodology in the same type of health system does not ensure that findings are more robust. We use two recent papers that investigated the association of proton pump inhibitor drugs with CKD as a device to review the main pitfalls of pharmacoepidemiology studies and how to attempt to mitigate against potential biases that can occur.

Prevalent versus new-user (incident) cohort

Inclusion of existing users of a drug to define comparison groups may create bias since participants who remain on treatment have not yet developed substantial side effects or have a different indication to remain on the drug versus short-term users. Sometimes, even protective associations can be found, as for example in studies of hormone replacement therapy and vascular outcomes in women. Conversely, people who remain on long-term treatment may be more sick than those who only take treatments for short periods, and therefore are generally more likely to develop conditions like acute kidney injury (AKI) or CKD. Therefore, 'new-user cohorts' are preferred in pharmacoepidemiology, particularly to examine side effects, such as AKI, that may occur shortly after starting treatment with a drug. The paper by Lazarus et al. is based on prevalent PPI use but includes a new-user sensitivity analysis, while the paper by Xie et al. is based on a new-user cohort.

Choice of comparison group

The gold-standard way of determining drug efficacy and adverse effects is the randomized clinical trial. Fundamentally this is because, if adequately powered and with a successful allocation procedure, randomization ensures that there is a balance of both measured and unmeasured confounders between the study arms. Similarly, comparison of effects between drugs, or between treatment and none, is also commonly assessed in observational studies. It can provide robust results reproducing clinical trial outcomes if there is a high degree of randomness between choices of drugs. However, as use of a type of medication becomes widespread and when drugs are clearly indicated for specific conditions, the results of these study designs can be misleading. Such 'confounding by indication' may explain in part many drug-related adverse outcomes seen in observational studies.

The study question was whether PPI users are more likely to develop CKD than people not using PPIs. It is probable that people who do not use PPIs are less ill than PPI users. Therefore, both of these studies (at least in part) compare outcomes between users of PPIs and H 2 -blockers and find an increased incidence of CKD among those exposed to PPIs. But, although prescribed for similar indications, to what extent are H 2 -blockers a valid comparator for PPI users? We need to consider the patterns of use of each class of drug at the time that patients entered the study and compare the measured characteristics of each group.

CONCLUSION

Bearing in mind the history of PPI-associated adverse event research and the potential sources of bias, we do not believe that these papers on their own provide strong evidence of a causal link with CKD. This caution has also been expressed by the authors, e.g. Lazarus et al. state 'further research is required to investigate whether PPI use itself causes kidney damage', while Xie et al. state 'the findings should not deter from prescription and use of PPI where medically indicated'. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that many patients remain on PPIs for long periods with no clear indication. Studies such as these serve as salutary reminders to constantly review whether all drugs remain indicated for each patient, and to de-prescribe if necessary. Stopping PPIs can cause an exacerbation of severe dyspeptic symptoms, and inevitably some patients may suffer more severe complications, for instance, upper GI bleeding (as one of the high-risk consequences), after cessation.

One may argue that decisions about prescribing are best informed by an overall risk–benefit analysis derived from well-conducted clinical trials. However, in reality, many such trials will not be feasible (e.g. for rare harms), nor affordable, nor always ethical. If done well, observational data have a great deal to contribute to our understanding of the incidence and causes of prescribing-related adverse outcomes in routine clinical care.

Conclusions

In this study, we found that long-term use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with increased risk of development of CKD and death. Although cause and effect cannot be determined with an observational study, with the large number of patients being treated with proton pump inhibitors, healthcare providers need to be cautious in prescribing these drugs because of the potential side effects.

### Proton pump inhibitors and kidney disease: fact or fiction? [^116dCEyc]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed medications for dyspepsia and gastroesophageal reflux. There are concerns about their use in the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Summary

The available published literature fails to support an association with PPI and the development of CKD. Placebo-controlled trials demonstrate no difference in the incidence of CKD between placebo and PPI. If one examines the data according to the Bradford Hill perspective incorporating temporal relationship, the strength of association, dose-response relationship, replacement of findings, cessation of exposure, specificity of the association, and consistency with other knowledge, one can only conclude that there is no consistent relationship between PPI use and the development of CKD, or its progression.

Key Messages

There is insufficient evidence to link PPI exposure with the development or progression of CKD.

### The association between proton pump inhibitor use with acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease [^111zvMrh]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly prescribed medicines and are the mainstay of treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of these medicines for unclear and inappropriate indications. Although generally well tolerated and considered to be safe, several observational studies have linked PPI use with a variety of conditions such as pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, fractures, hypomagnesemia, and dementia. The well-established association between PPIs and acute interstitial nephritis has raised questions about whether they may also cause acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Observational studies have evaluated these possible associations. This paper reviews the currently available literature about these associations and considers their possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The level of evidence-linking PPI use with acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease is weak and does not establish causality. More research is required to explore these possible associations further. The PPIs should be used in the lowest effective dose and inappropriate use should be avoided.

### Proton pump inhibitors and chronic kidney disease: is it time to sound the alarm? [^115QaeVZ]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors are widely used worldwide for the management of gastroesophageal reflux, but have been associated with the development of interstitial nephritis and acute kidney injury. A large observational study using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort and the Geisinger Health System demonstrates an association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and chronic kidney disease. Although the study does not prove causality, the robustness of the findings in two cohorts suggests a need for further study and reevaluation of the safety of these agents for widespread, non-prescription use.

Dose response effect

Showing that increasing doses of a drug are associated with progressively greater risk of the outcome can strengthen arguments for causality in a pharmacoepidemiological study. Both studies considered here suggest a relationship between the PPI dose and the incidence of CKD for twice-versus once-daily dosing in the study by Lazarus et al. and for duration of exposure in the paper by Xie et al. However, these findings may also be due to confounding: dose frequency may reflect the severity of the indication while the duration of exposure may suggest an ongoing indication for the drug, both factors that may be associated with a greater risk of subsequent CKD.

Study era

During the time periods covered by these studies there have been extensive changes in the patterns of use of acid-suppressant drugs, with PPIs being increasingly prescribed, and, in addition, the definitions and recording of AKI as well as CKD have changed. In 1999, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study was published and the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative classification was published in 2002. As familiarity with the CKD staging system has grown, the sensitivity of ICD-9 codes for detection of CKD have progressively improved. Both papers used Cox regression to model their final estimates, and adjustment for the duration of follow-up within the study is intrinsic to this technique. If substantial temporal changes affecting data used in an analysis are suspected, it is common to also adjust for study era and to conduct sensitivity analyses to examine whether effect estimates are similar for different periods within the study. However, it does not appear that either of these studies also adjusted for calendar time. Both in the Geisinger cohort and the Xie et al. study, adjustment for available confounders reduced the effect size. Would further adjustment for other risk factors (not captured here), including study era, attenuate the relative risk further?

Time-updated exposure status

In a study of drug effects, people are commonly divided for analysis into groups based on their drug exposure at baseline (when they enter the cohort). This is the method used for the primary analysis of both papers, but it can introduce error since exposure status may change over the follow-up time. However, in a secondary analysis in the paper by Lazarus et al. exposure was also modelled as a time-varying ever-use variable in which a participant who was a non-user at baseline switched categories at the first instance of PPI use. The nature of the data meant that the authors could define when patients started taking the drugs, but not when they stopped, so all subsequent time was classified as exposed even if they had stopped taking PPIs. Although this is an important step in reducing misclassification, if people taking PPIs are sicker than the comparator groups, this analysis will not reduce confounding. Ideally this analysis should also define periods of time when people have definitely stopped taking the drugs, i.e. have not been prescribed a repeat drug dose, to assess the rate of CKD during subsequent periods of better health.

### Proton pump inhibitors and the kidney: implications of current evidence for clinical practice and when and how to deprescribe [^111Psyk6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), long thought to be safe, are associated with a number of nonkidney adverse health outcomes and several untoward kidney outcomes, including hypomagnesemia, acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, incident chronic kidney disease, kidney disease progression, kidney failure, and increased risk for all-cause mortality and mortality due to chronic kidney disease. PPIs are abundantly prescribed, rarely deprescribed, and frequently purchased over the counter. They are frequently used without medical indication, and when medically indicated, they are often used for much longer than needed. In this In Practice review, we summarize evidence linking PPI use with adverse events in general and adverse kidney outcomes in particular. We review the literature on the association of PPI use and risk for hypomagnesemia, acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, incident chronic kidney disease, kidney disease progression, end-stage kidney disease, and death. We provide an assessment of how this evidence should inform clinical practice. We review the impact of this evidence on patients' perception of risk, synthesize PPI deprescription literature, and provide our recommendations on how to approach PPI use and deprescription.

### Pharmacoepidemiology for nephrologists: do proton pump inhibitors cause chronic kidney disease? [^113f42NS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

In the paper by Xie et al. the primary outcomes were the first eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (encompassing both CKD and AKI), and CKD defined as two eGFRs < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² at least 90 days apart.

Use of a CKD end point based on two measurements requires patients to stay alive for the second measurement to fulfil the chronicity definition. If sicker patients die beforehand or do not attend for repeat tests, they would not be coded as having CKD, which would bias the study towards the null. On the other hand, physicians may be more likely to monitor renal function regularly in those they consider to be at higher risk.

Both papers also examined an association between PPI exposure and AKI as an additional outcome. Demonstrating an association with a second outcome may substantially strengthen an argument for causality in a pharmacoepidemiological analysis, particularly where the second outcome may be on the causal pathway as is proposed for AKI and CKD. However, in these studies the outcomes are closely correlated: in the paper by Lazarus et al. both are defined by ICD-9 coding, while in that by Xie et al. both CKD and AKI are defined by the change in creatinine values. For the hospital-derived coding of AKI there has been a huge change in recognition (similar to that of CKD) over the past decade. Determining AKI by changes in creatinine appears slightly more robust (than clinical coding), but the problem of sicker patients being more closely monitored remains. Within each cohort, the same problems apply to both outcomes, respectively. Therefore, it is unsurprising that an association between PPI use and AKI is found in both papers.

Considerations for implementation — For people with chronic kidney disease, a decision not to anticoagulate for thromboprophylaxis due to low risk would ideally be re-evaluated at each clinical encounter and at least every 6 months, and when using antithrombotic therapy it is prudent to treat modifiable risk factors for bleeding (e.g., alcohol intake) and use gastroprophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), particularly when combined with antiplatelet therapy.

WHAT NEXT?

Both papers produce similar estimates for the increase in risk of incident CKD among PPI users: in the adjusted models for the main analysis the hazard ratio was 1.50 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14–1.96] in that by Lazarus et al. and 1.28 (95% CI 1.23–1.34) in the paper by Xie et al. If truly causal, these effect sizes would be very important for public health due to the frequency of prescription of PPIs.

A link between PPIs and CKD or AKI is plausible given the probable link between PPI use and interstitial nephritis. However, PPIs have a long history of being associated with other illnesses. The paper by Lazarus et al. states that 'observational studies have linked PPI use to uncommon but serious adverse health outcomes, including hip fracture, community acquired pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, acute interstitial nephritis and AKI'. More recently they have also been associated with dementia. While each is individually plausible, such a broad spectrum of associated adverse outcomes all with similar and small effect sizes raises a concern that the findings could relate to the same sources of bias.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^116pjru4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed as acid-suppression therapy. Some observational studies suggest that long-term use of PPIs is potentially associated with certain adverse kidney outcomes. We conducted a systematic literature review to assess potential bias in non-randomized studies reporting on putative associations between PPIs and adverse kidney outcomes (acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, chronic interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease).

Methods

We searched the medical literature within 10 years of 17 December 2020. Pre-specified criteria guided identification of relevant English language articles for assessment. Risk of bias on an outcome-specific basis was evaluated using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool by two independent reviewers.

Results

Of 620 initially identified records, 26 studies met a priori eligibility criteria and underwent risk of bias assessment. Nineteen studies were judged as having a moderate risk of bias for reported adverse kidney outcomes, while six studies were judged as having a serious risk of bias (mainly due to inadequate control of confounders and selection bias). We were unable to determine the overall risk of bias in two studies (one of which was assessed as having a moderate risk of bias for a different adverse kidney outcome) due to insufficient information presented. Effect estimates for PPIs in relation to adverse kidney outcomes varied widely (0.24–7.34) but associations mostly showed increased risk.

Conclusion

Using ROBINS-I, we found that non-randomized observational studies suggesting kidney harm by PPIs have moderate to serious risk of bias, making it challenging to establish causality. Additional high-quality, real-world evidence among generalizable populations are needed to better understand the relation between PPI treatment and acute and chronic kidney outcomes, accounting for the effects of varying durations of PPI treatment, self-treatment with over-the-counter PPIs, and potential critical confounders.

Propensity score methods

Both studies include analyses using a propensity score to attempt to adjust for confounding. This analytical technique examines the effect of the treatment among patients who have the same predicted probability of receiving the drug, based on their characteristics when the treatment is chosen. In short, comparisons are made between people who are more similar with regard to factors associated with receiving the drug, and therefore confounding should be reduced. If the propensity score is developed based on the same covariates as those included in the primary analysis, there is little evidence that propensity methods yield substantially different or more accurate estimates than those seen after adequate standard multivariable adjustment. In both types of analysis, elimination of confounding depends on high-quality data and inclusion of all confounders in the analysis. The main benefit of using propensity scores is to identify two comparable (matched) groups at baseline. A standard regression would give an answer in the full study population but may inadvertently extrapolate beyond the regions of the data where there is a reasonable comparison to be made. In the paper by Xie et al. (and probably also that by Lazarus et al.) there was a large reduction in the number of PPI users included in the analysis due to individual matching to H 2 -blocker users. The reduced numbers could suggest that H 2 -blocker users are in general not comparable to PPI users in routine care, but we do not know which kind of PPI user was left out of the analysis. Reduced comparator numbers also mean that there is substantially reduced statistical power and that included PPI users may have been unrepresentative of PPI users as a whole.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and the risk of chronic kidney disease [^1112XSGJ]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly used drugs worldwide and have been linked to acute interstitial nephritis. Less is known about the association between PPI use and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Objective

To quantify the association between PPI use and incident CKD in a population-based cohort.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In total, 10,482 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 60 mL/min/1.73 m² were followed from a baseline visit between February 1, 1996, and January 30, 1999, to December 31, 2011. The data was analyzed from May 2015 to October 2015. The findings were replicated in an administrative cohort of 248,751 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 60 mL/min/1.73 m² from the Geisinger Health System.

Exposures

Self-reported PPI use in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study or an outpatient PPI prescription in the Geisinger Health System replication cohort. Histamine2 (H2) receptor antagonist use was considered a negative control and active comparator.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incident CKD was defined using diagnostic codes at hospital discharge or death in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, and by a sustained outpatient estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² in the Geisinger Health System replication cohort.

Results

Among 10,482 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, the mean (SD) age was 63.0 (5.6) years, and 43.9% were male. Compared with nonusers, PPI users were more often of white race, obese, and taking antihypertensive medication. Proton pump inhibitor use was associated with incident CKD in unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.45; 95% CI, 1.11–1.90); in analysis adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical variables (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.14–1.96); and in analysis with PPI ever use modeled as a time-varying variable (adjusted HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.17–1.55). The association persisted when baseline PPI users were compared directly with H2 receptor antagonist users (adjusted HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.01–1.91) and with propensity score-matched nonusers (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.13–2.74). In the Geisinger Health System replication cohort, PPI use was associated with CKD in all analyses, including a time-varying new-user design (adjusted HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.20–1.28). Twice-daily PPI dosing (adjusted HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.28–1.67) was associated with a higher risk than once-daily dosing (adjusted HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.09–1.21).

Conclusions and Relevance

Proton pump inhibitor use is associated with a higher risk of incident CKD. Future research should evaluate whether limiting PPI use reduces the incidence of CKD.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^117SPPgp]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) became available in the United States in 1989, and have become one of the most widely prescribed classes of drugs. The approved indications for use of PPIs include gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease and erosive esophagitis. However, PPIs are often prescribed outside of their approved uses. It has been estimated that up to two-thirds of all people on PPIs do not have a verified indication for the drug. A 2009 analysis using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey found an increase in the frequency of prescription PPI treatment from less than five prescriptions per 1000 GERD-related physician visits in 1995 to 43.9 prescriptions per 1000 visits in 2006 in the United States, a more than eight-fold increase. There were a total of 119 million U.S. prescriptions filled in 2009 for all PPIs totaling $13.6 billion.

Several studies have shown increased hazards of cardiovascular disease and death with PPIs. Renal side effects of PPIs are less often reported and may go unrecognized. These include acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia. In general, most patients with acute kidney injury are assumed to have acute tubular necrosis. It is not surprising that AIN secondary to PPI use may also go undetected due to several reasons: 1) awareness that PPIs can cause AIN may not be wide spread; 2) the time interval from drug initiation to onset of clinical abnormalities is quite variable, ranging from 1 week to 9 months (median 9.9 weeks); and 3) typical features of hypersensitivity reaction are present in only a minority of cases. Patients with undiagnosed AKI due to PPIs may present later with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, data is lacking on the association of PPI use with CKD. In this manuscript we investigate the relationship of PPI use and the development of CKD and death.

STUDY DESIGN

It is appropriate to remind ourselves of the possible designs that a study may adopt to assess the effects of a drug exposure on a disease outcome (Figure 2). Cross-sectional studies cannot confirm a sequence of events in terms of drug exposure and outcome and are not discussed. Case–control studies are usually nested in a defined cohort to avoid selection bias. The recently published studies exploring the relationship between PPI use and risk of CKD have used cohort designs (Table 1). Because the chosen outcome was CKD, at baseline there should be no participant having CKD.

Table 1.
Study design features of pharmacoepidemiology studies published by Lazarus et al. and Xie et al. that investigated the association of PPI use and CKD as well as AKI

FIGURE 2:
Schema of different study designs in pharmacoepidemiology (colour image available online).

Definition of the cohort

In the paper by Lazarus et al. the first cohort is defined by participation in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, although with some limitations to ensure normal baseline eGFR and data completeness. This study has all the strengths of a well-designed prospective cohort, including thorough measurement of baseline covariates such as proteinuria (often poorly measured in routine data). In contrast, the second cohort is based within the Geisinger Health System (Pennsylvania, USA), a data source that provides large power but has the issues of incomplete and biased recording typical of routinely collected health care data. Participants entered when they first had measurements of both creatinine (equating to an eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and systolic blood pressure available. In the paper by Xie et al. participants (US veterans) had to have an eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in the 90 days before receiving the first PPI prescription and a subsequent eGFR. This restriction is important to identify those without CKD. These definitions promote inclusion of participants who are being closely monitored, which may affect the generalizability of the study, but unless monitoring is different between the comparison groups, there should be limited bias.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^115zuMPj]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Aspirin for primary prevention in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — Large trials assessing aspirin versus placebo for primary prevention in high‑risk populations found that any harm from major bleeding counterbalanced any benefit on cardiovascular risk, with ASPREE and ARRIVE finding no significant effect on cardiovascular events; a dedicated large primary prevention aspirin trial in CKD is underway. Certainty of evidence is described as low, with a low certainty of evidence (Level C). For resource use, low‑dose aspirin is available at low cost and does not require monitoring. Proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs) are generally effective, safe, and low cost, and the Work Group considered it prudent to consider bleeding risk when prescribing antiplatelet or antithrombotic therapy, particularly when such therapies are combined.

### Pharmacoepidemiology for nephrologists: do proton pump inhibitors cause chronic kidney disease? [^1174Cb7F]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

In both studies it seems likely that PPIs were prescribed for those with more severe upper GI comorbidities such as ulceration and bleeding, which were also indicators of poorer health status. This may be associated with a greater risk of subsequent CKD. Since prescribing indications are not available for the ARIC participants, this difference in health status is not clear from the comparison of baseline characteristics, but the statement that H 2 -blockers were 'prescribed for the same indication as PPIs' is certainly questionable.

To understand whether differences at baseline between the two groups will affect the results of the study, the question now is whether the two groups are otherwise similar in every important aspect with regard to their risk of the outcome. This requires a detailed understanding of the risk factors for the outcome.

Outcome definition

For the ARIC cohort, incident CKD and AKI were defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) coding or by incident ESRD, as determined through linkage with the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) registry. Defining incident CKD with an ICD-9 code requires a patient to be admitted to hospital to get a diagnosis. Patients who are admitted to hospital need to be able to afford testing and/or admission, and so there may be socio-economic factors that prevent a timely diagnosis of CKD. Also, if PPI users were sicker and more often admitted to hospital than users of H 2 -blockers, then they may have been more likely to receive an ICD-9 code of CKD.

For the Geisinger Health System cohort, incident CKD was defined as the first outpatient eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² that was sustained at all subsequent assessments of the eGFR, or ESRD defined through USRDS linkage. This outcome is specific for the development of sustained CKD.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^111Hp3Tv]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Aspirin and antiplatelet therapy in chronic kidney disease — Meta-analysis of trials "has clearly established the cardiovascular benefits of low-dose aspirin in people who have established ASCVD", and "Any harm of bleeding is far outweighed by the benefits". Resource and implementation notes specify that "Low-dose aspirin is available at low cost and does not require monitoring" and that "Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are generally effective, safe, and low cost… and… it is prudent to consider bleeding risk and offers PPIs when prescribing antiplatelet therapy or antithrombotic therapy, particularly when such therapies are combined". Practice Point 3.15.2.1 states: "Consider other antiplatelet therapy (e.g. P2Y12 inhibitors) when there is aspirin intolerance". Cardiology guidance indicates to "apply the same diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in people with CKD", noting that "CKD does not modify the benefits of ticagrelor, and antiplatelet therapy does not need to be modified at decreased eGFR", while "other antithrombotic therapy choices and doses may need to consider a person's GFR". Internationally, "Given the clinical effectiveness of low-dose aspirin and its low cost, there should not be many barriers to accessing this medication in any setting".

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^111A1AG3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used for gastric acid-related disorders, but their safety profile and risk stratification for high-burden diseases need further investigation. Analyzing over 2 million participants from five prospective cohorts from the US, the UK, and China, we found that PPI use correlated with increased risk of 15 leading global diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, diabetes, respiratory infections, and chronic kidney disease. These associations showed dose-response relationships and consistency across different PPI types. PPI-related absolute risks increased with baseline risks, with approximately 82% of cases occurring in those at the upper 40% of the baseline predicted risk, and only 11.5% of cases occurring in individuals at the lower 50% of the baseline risk. While statistical association does not necessarily imply causation, its potential safety concerns suggest that personalized use of PPIs through risk stratification might guide appropriate decision-making for patients, clinicians, and the public.

### Proton-pump inhibitor vs. H2-receptor blocker use and overall risk of CKD progression [^115zN5Mp]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The relationship between proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression remains controversial. Specifically, there is a lack of data evaluating renal outcomes in established CKD patients. The aim of our study is to determine the risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or death amongst CKD patients on PPI, histamine-2 receptor blocker (H2B), or no anti-acid therapy.

Methods

Using our CKD registry, we evaluated the relationship between PPI and H2B use and outcomes amongst patients with CKD (eGFR < 60), with at least 2 PCP visits in the year prior. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the relationship between medication groups and overall mortality, while competing risks regression models were used to determine the risk of ESKD with death as a competing risk.

Results

25,455 patients met inclusion criteria and were stratified according to medication group: no antacid therapy (15,961), PPI use (8646), or H2B use (848). At 4 years, the cumulative incidence of ESKD with death as a competing risk was 2.0% (95% CI: 1.7, 2.4), 1.5% (0.8, 2.8), and 1.6%(1.4, 1.9) among PPI, H2B, and no medication respectively (P = 0.22). The cumulative incidence of death with ESKD as a competing risk was 17.6% (95% CI: 16.6, 18.6), 16.7% (13.7, 19.8), and 17.3% (16.6, 18.0) (P = 0.71).

Conclusions

Use of PPI in a CKD population was not associated with increased mortality or progression to ESKD when compared to H2 blocker and to no acid suppressing therapy.

### Cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular concerns with proton pump inhibitors: are they safe? [^115KRWKg]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The introduction of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has been a cornerstone in the treatment of acid-related disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer, and their use has increased rapidly during the last decades. Being highly lipophilic drugs, they may potentially affect several pathophysiological pathways involved in cardiovascular and kidney morbidity, immune response and infections, absorption of selected nutrients, bone metabolism and cognitive function. Clinical epidemiology evidence coming from well-designed analyses of observational data consistently reported that long-term use of PPIs may increase the risk of cardiovascular events among patients treated with thienopyridines, tubular-interstitial nephritis and chronic kidney disease, hypomagnesemia, and fractures. Conversely, currently available evidence about the impact of PPIs on cardiovascular risk among patients not treated with thienopyridines, infections, nutritional disorders, cognitive impairment and dementia is limited by confounding. Given that randomized controlled trials investigating these issues are unlikely to be realized, the application of modern pharmacoepidemiology principles is expected to mitigate limitations of observational studies while addressing these relevant knowledge gaps. Meanwhile, physicians should be aware of potential issues related to long-term use of PPIs and weigh benefits of PPI therapy for appropriate indications along with the likelihood of the potential risks. A deprescription trial should be considered for all PPI users who do not have definite indications for long-term therapy.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^113sqVL3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed as acid-suppression therapy and have transformed the management of conditions affecting the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's esophagus (BE), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and other related disorders. These agents have been of great benefit to patients who are at risk of upper GI ulceration and bleeding from aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In the United States alone, it is estimated that 15 million Americans used a prescription PPI in 2013, and PPIs represent one of the most prescribed drug classes in the United States. Moreover, PPI use among the US population has increased over time, from 5.7% in 2002–2003 to 6.73% in 2016. In addition, the use of non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) PPIs is considered to be substantial in the United States.

Although this drug class has historically been recognized as safe given the low risk of ulceration and GI bleeding, results from mostly observational studies suggest that long-term use of PPIs may be associated with serious local and systemic adverse health outcomes. Furthermore, PPIs are increasingly being prescribed off-label by health care professionals and are rarely deprescribed when no longer medically necessary. Without appropriate oversight, some experts argue that they are prone to long-term misuse.

Limited data are available from randomized control trials (RCTs) on the long-term use of PPIs and adverse kidney outcomes. An RCT by Moayyedi et al. reported that PPI (pantoprazole) was not associated with any adverse event [including chronic kidney disease (CKD)] when used for 3 years. However, a subsequent commentary identified several limitations in this study, including CKD ascertainment, potential exposure misclassification, reliance on intention-to-treat analysis, and failure to consider alternative induction periods, which may have biased the results toward the null. Nevertheless, using the gold standard study design for causal evidence in medicine, this RCT by Moayyedi et al. provides insight into potential causality for several reported PPI associations using experimental data.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and bone fractures in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1175q1Xj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for bone fractures, which are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) have been linked to an increased risk for fractures in the general population as well as in patients with need for hemodialysis, but studies in patients with CKD are currently missing.

Methods

We performed a population-based observational case-control study exploring a sample of patients with CKD derived from the IQVIATM Disease Analyzer database. Patients with and without fractures were matched using the 1:1 nearest neighbor propensity score matching method. To investigate the association between PPI use and fractures, multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed adjusting for confounding factors.

Results

In total, 6076 patients with and 6076 patients without fractures were matched and subsequently available for analyses. In the total cohort, PPI use was associated with an increased risk for fractures [odds ratio (OR) 1.68; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.55–1.83]. This association was noted for nearly all types of fractures. The strongest association between PPI use and fractures was found in patients below the age of 60 years with a PPI prescription for longer than 2 years (OR 6.85; 95% CI 1.85–25.38). The same was true when analyzing cumulative PPI doses. Here, patients below the age of 60 years with a cumulative PPI dose above 16000 mg (highest quartile) had the highest risk for fractures (OR 4.62; 95% CI 1.87–11.44). There was no difference between men or women regarding the association between PPI use and fractures.

Conclusions

This study provides evidence that PPI use is associated with fractures in patients with CKD. Deprescription of PPI in patients without an indication for treatment could be a modifiable risk factor to reduce fracture risk in this high-risk group.

### Accelerated risk of renal disease progression in pre-ESRD patients with proton pump inhibitors use: a nationwide population-based study [^111MdMPk]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were mostly prescribed for gastrointestinal (GI) disease widely, there were numerous studies about PPIs and adverse renal outcome. Most evidence was to evaluate the risk of PPIs in patients with normal renal function and in the absence of the moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study focuses on the accelerated progression of renal function following proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) use, and the increased risks of acute kidney injury (AKI) among moderate to advanced CKD (pre-ESRD) patients.

Patients and methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted by including adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3b to 5 who initiated PPI or H2 blocker (H2B) therapy between 2011 and 2018. The risk of renal events was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Sensitivity analyses were performed, including propensity score matching, as-treated analysis, and subgroup analysis.

Results

The cohort comprised 83,432 pre-ESRD patients, with 5,138 treated with H2B and 1,051 with PPIs. The progression to ESRD was significantly more likely in patients using PPIs compared to those using H2B (adjusted HR, 1.495; 95% CI: 1.198–1.867). Specifically, omeprazole (adjusted HR, 1.784; 95% CI: 1.079–2.951) and esomeprazole (adjusted HR, 1.847; 95% CI: 1.332–2.561) were associated with a notably higher risk of ESRD and AKI.

Conclusions

The study highlights the significance of the accelerated renal risk, especially for moderate to advanced CKD patients, when prescribing PPIs and to implicate the clinicians prescribed PPIs and H2B in pre-ESRD patients.

### Gastrointestinal disease and the kidney [^116D1CWV]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Renal disease at any stage, from insufficiency to end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or following renal transplantation, is often accompanied by significant gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Conversely, patients with GI disease may present with significant renal complications. Patients with end-stage renal disease, patients undergoing dialysis, and recipients of renal grafts are at increased risk for GI complications, including erosive disease and GI bleeding. Selection of pharmacotherapy for GI conditions in patients with concomitant renal disease is complicated by three factors: (1) the potential for a significant negative impact on renal function, which is already compromised; (2) the requirement for dosing alteration in renal insufficiency; and (3) the potential for drug-drug interactions with concomitant medications. Proton pump inhibitors appear to be the most suitable acid-suppressing therapy for patients with renal disease; recently developed drugs in this class (e.g. rabeprazole) may be the best choice for treatment of patients with both acid-related GI conditions and renal disease.

### Adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors: fact or fake news? [^1133Mmgt]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review summarizes the past year's literature, both clinical and basic science, regarding potential adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors.

Recent Findings

Proton pump inhibitors are amongst the most widely prescribed and overprescribed medications worldwide. Although generally considered well tolerated, epidemiologic studies mining large databases have reported a panoply of purported serious adverse effects associated with proton pump inhibitors, including chronic kidney disease, cognitive decline, myocardial infarction, stroke, bone fracture and even death. It should be noted that the quality of the evidence underlying these associations is very low and these studies, by design, cannot ascribe cause and effect. Nonetheless, these associations have been sensationalized in the media and misinterpreted by patients and providers. Unintended consequences of the fake news are that patients are not being prescribed and/or taking clinical guideline-recommended proton pump inhibitors to prevent and treat complications from gastroesophageal reflux disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding precipitated by NSAIDs and dual antiplatelet therapies. In addition, physicians, who already have limited time to interact with their patients, are spending an inordinate amount of additional time placing these findings into proper perspective and reassuring their patients when initiating treatment as well as on every follow-up visit.

Summary

Most of the recent highly publicized serious adverse effects ascribed to proton pump inhibitors are not based on demonstrable evidence. Nevertheless, when proton pump inhibitors are prescribed long-term, they should be used at the lowest effective dose and the need for their use periodically reassessed.

Reported association between PPI use and kidney outcomes by risk of bias.

Among the 19 studies with an overall moderate risk of bias rating, eight assessed CKD outcomes. In total, they represented 1,146,346 patients from the United States, Brazil, Taiwan, Sweden, and Denmark. Effect estimates for the association between PPI treatment (compared with non-PPI users or H 2 blocker users) and CKD ranged from an adjusted HR of 1.12 (95% CI 1.08–1.17)to 7.34 (95% CI 3.94–13.71), and an adjusted OR of 1.20 (95% CI 1.11–1.29)to 1.42 (95% CI 1.35–1.49). A single study reported that the magnitude of the association was similar between individual PPIs and CKD. Furthermore, a study in the Geisinger Health System found that twice daily dosing of a PPI was associated with a higher risk of CKD relative to once daily dosing.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^116KWwMW]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Our study showed that the use of PPIs is associated with a 75% increased risk of mortality. Other studies have also shown a similar association of PPI use and increased risk of death, especially in elderly and institutionalized patients and among patients who were on clopidogrel.

There are a few limitations to this study. There is potential for indication bias in our results. However, indication bias in this cohort is unlikely. In fact, the study patients on PPI were less likely to have a higher comorbidity burden than those who did not receive PPI. This actually strengthens the case for the association of PPI use with CKD and mortality. Covariates that are not associated with either treatment or outcome do not cause a bias. The covariates that are associated with both treatment and outcome were included in the model and, hence, were controlled for. It is possible that variables not in our data set, such as use of NSAIDs, smoking and therefore not controlled for could cause indication bias, as is true in all observational studies. Furthermore we also did propensity score analyses to mitigate indication bias, and the results didn't change. However, we note the potential for indication bias as a limitation of any observational study. We used one eGFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 as the definition of CKD, because although this does not meet the KDOQI definition, most large epidemiologic studies have used a single eGFR definition for CKD. Our results may not be generalizable due to the fact that females and non-whites are underrepresented in the VA study population. However, this was a real world cohort from the largest integrated health care system in United States and utilizes a uniform data collection system.

### Proton-pump inhibitor vs. H2-receptor blocker use and overall risk of CKD progression [^115QZdjA]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the introduction of Omeprazole in 1989, Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) have gone on to become one of the most widely prescribed medications in the United States. These drugs are also increasingly sold over the counter (OTC), making the actual use of PPIs across the general population much higher. Initially praised for their superiority in treating many acid-related disorders, PPIs have more recently garnered scrutiny over their potential adverse effects. Acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with PPI use is well documented in the literature. Case reports and small case series initially described the development of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) in patients prescribed PPIs. Since that time, there have been various large observational studies and meta-analyses which have reproduced the same findings of increased risk of developing AKI with PPI use.

More recently, some studies have suggested an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) among patients with normal renal function. The underlying mechanism of this association remains unclear. A popular theory that an intervening AKI in the setting of PPI use leads to the development of CKD was not upheld when examined by Xie and colleagues. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis also demonstrated a higher incidence of CKD with PPI use. Interestingly, the subgroup analysis found no association between PPI use and risk of CKD in older patients (age > 62 years), in studies with large sample sizes (> 10,000 participants), in case-control studies, and in the US study location (3 out of the 4 studies reviewed). Despite the growing body of evidence on PPI use and increased risk for developing CKD, there is limited data on patients with already established CKD. To the best of our knowledge, only one such study has been published. It concluded that PPI use was associated with increased major renal adverse events, defined as doubling of serum creatinine or progression to end-stage renal disease.

Given the inconclusive data on PPI safety in the CKD population, we elected to examine the rate of CKD progression among CKD patients on PPI versus Histamine-2-Receptor Blockers (H2B) and to no acid-suppressing therapy.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and worsening kidney function: a retrospective cohort study including 122, 606 acid-suppressing users [^1147KEsC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have emerged as one of the most commonly prescribed medications worldwide. While the efficacy of PPIs for approved indications is well-established for short term use (2–12 weeks), misuse of PPIs is estimated to occur at an alarming rate of 50% across both hospital and ambulatory settings.

Concerns about potential long-term adverse outcomes are growing with numerous recent studies highlighting PPI-related adverse events such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), dementia, bone fractures, hypomagnesemia, Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea and mortality. –

Subsequent analyses suggested that the rise in PPI-related mortality may primarily be attributed to cardiovascular disease, CKD, and upper gastrointestinal cancers. Residual confoundingand prothopatic biashave been proposed as alternative explanations for increased PPI-related mortality. Regarding kidney disease, some observational studies found that PPIs or even histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2-blockers) use might increase the risk of CKD. – However, these findings were not confirmed in other studies.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and worsening kidney function in PPI initiators as compared with H2-blockers initiators in a large database.

Statistical methods

Descriptive baseline statistics were produced for the study population. Patients were divided in 2 groups based on PPI use, Group 1 -on PPI, Group 2 –not on PPI. These two groups were compared using Fisher exact test for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Similarly descriptive baseline statistics were produced for patients who developed CKD versus those who did not and between patients who died versus those who did not. A prospective logistic analysis of case–control data was used to investigate the association of treatment (exposure to PPI) with each outcome of interest; onset of CKD and mortality, respectively, controlling for age, sex, race, GI and pre-PPI comorbidities. It was shown by Prentice and Pyke that the odds ratio estimators and associated confidence intervals for the effects of risk factor on an outcome variable in case–control studies may be estimated by applying the standard logistic regression modeling to the case–control data as if the data had been obtained in a prospective study. Their work generalizes the findings of Breslow & Powers on the equivalence of odds ratio estimators when both prospective and retrospective logistic models are applied to case–control data. We also performed adjusted stratified analysis by levels of dichotomized versions of the variables in the initial main-effects model, to test for PPI effects within subgroups.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^112dm2ET]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute interstitial nephritis secondary to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) frequently goes undiagnosed due to its subacute clinical presentation, which may later present as chronic kidney disease (CKD). We investigated the association of PPI use with the development of CKD and death.

Methods

Two separate retrospective case–control study designs were employed with a prospective logistic regression analysis of data to evaluate the association of development of CKD and death with PPI use. The population included 99,269 patients who were seen in primary care VISN2 clinics from 4/2001 until 4/2008. For evaluation of the CKD outcome, 22,807 with preexisting CKD at the first observation in Veterans Affairs Health Care Upstate New York (VISN2) network data system were excluded. Data obtained included use of PPI (Yes/No), demographics, laboratory data, pre-PPI comorbidity variables.

Results

A total of 19,311/76,462 patients developed CKD. Of those who developed CKD 24.4% were on PPI. Patients receiving PPI were less likely to have vascular disease, COPD, cancer and diabetes. Of the total of 99,269 patients analyzed for mortality outcome, 11,758 died. A prospective logistic analysis of case–control data showed higher odds for development of CKD (OR 1.10 95% CI 1.05–1.16) and mortality (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.67–1.84) among patients taking PPIs versus those not on PPIs.

Conclusions

Use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with increased risk of development of CKD and death. With the large number of patients being treated with proton pump inhibitors, healthcare providers need to be better educated about the potential side effects of these medications.

### The association between proton pump inhibitor use and the risk of adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116hdNif]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Existing epidemiological studies illustrate that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be related to adverse kidney outcomes. To date, no comprehensive meta-analysis has been conducted to evaluate and quantify this association.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies to assess the association between PPI use and the risk of adverse kidney outcomes. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and grey literature with no language restrictions (through 31 October 2016). Adverse kidney outcomes were acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The risk ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random effects model. The strength of evidence (SOE) for each outcome was assessed using the Grading of Recommended Assessment, Development and Evaluation system.

Results

Of 2037 identified studies, four cohort and five case-control studies with ∼2.6 million patients were included. Of these, 534 003 (20.2%) were PPI users. Compared with non-PPI users, PPI users experienced a significantly higher risk of AKI [RR 1.44 (95% CI 1.08–1.91); P = 0.013; SOE, low] and CKD [RR 1.36 (95% CI 1.07–1.72); P = 0.012; SOE, low]. Moreover, PPIs increased the risk of AIN [RR 3.61 (95% CI 2.37–5.51); P < 0.001; SOE, insufficient] and ESRD [RR 1.42 (95% CI 1.28–1.58); P < 0.001; SOE, insufficient].

Conclusion

PPI usage was associated with adverse kidney outcomes; however, these findings were based on observational studies and low-quality evidence. Additional rigorous studies are needed for further clarification.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^11188Ffx]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Taking into consideration the sources of bias described above makes it challenging to establish causality and may clarify many of the observed potential associations. A review published in 2018 considered the available evidence from non-randomized observational studies and potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for the development of AKI and CKD with PPI use. The authors observed that the association between CKD and PPI use, although consistent for the studies reviewed, did not meet the Hill criteria for causationand may have been confounded by NSAID use and underlying comorbidities (i.e. hypertension, diabetes). In contrast, the association between AKI and PPI was described as inconsistent based on the studies reviewed, but also potentially confounded by NSAID use and failing to meet the Hill criteria. Overall, these findings suggest that it is important to distinguish associations from causality in the interpretation of results from non-randomized observational studies.

We also found that effect estimates for the evaluation of reported associations were largely of small magnitude and uncertain clinical relevance; thus, these results should not prevent prescribers from using appropriate doses of PPIs for proper indications. Results from our study, combined with other literature reviews, should support recommendations for clinical prudence. For instance, health care professionals should avoid unnecessary long-term PPI use by being cautious in their initial decision-making for prescribing PPI, and by periodically revisiting the need for continued PPI therapy to ensure medical indication. There is considerable variation in defining long-term PPI use in prior studies, ranging from more than 8 weeks of regular daily use to greater than 1 year. Few studies selected for this review defined long-term PPI use. Among the eight studies that reported on the association between long-term PPI use or duration of PPI use, respectively, and associated kidney effects, long-term PPI use was described as ranging from as low as 3 monthsto over 3 years. Using recommendations outlined in guidelines on prescribing PPIs and how to mitigate the potential harms of long-term PPI therapy for three common indications (GERD, BE, and NSAID bleeding prophylaxis), physicians can safely and appropriately balance the evidence on the benefits and harms of PPI use in managing their patients.

### Proton pump inhibitors and acute kidney injury: a nested case-control study [^11244JGY]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are a widely-used class of drugs for the treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease and other acid-related disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. As a class, PPIs have demonstrated a favorable safety profile. However, case reports have suggested that this class of drugs may be linked to acute kidney injury, which may in turn lead to chronic injury or failure. The objective of this study was to determine if an association between PPIs and kidney failure exists and to estimate an effect size for the relationship between PPI use and renal disease.

Methods

A nested case-control study was conducted in a privately insured population in a single Midwestern state including a total of 184,480 patients aged 18 years or older who were continuously enrolled with the insurer for at least 24 months between September 2002 and November 2005.

Results

Renal disease was positively associated with PPI use (odds ratio [OR] 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27, 2.32, p < 0.001) even after controlling for potential confounding conditions. After removing patients with potential confounding disease states from the study population, the number of cases (195 of the 854) and controls (607) was lower, but the relationship between renal disease and PPI use remained consistent (OR 2.25, CI 1.09–4.62, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Patients with a renal disease diagnosis were twice as likely to have used a previous prescription for a PPI. Therefore, it is necessary for physicians to increase recognition of patient complaints or clinical manifestations of this potentially harmful event in order to prevent further injury.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113hRHhu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

ACG GERD guideline — proton pump inhibitor (PPI) monitoring and risk statements: For patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) on PPIs without additional risk factors, the guideline states "we do not recommend that they raise their intake of vitamin B12 or that they have routine monitoring of serum B12 levels" and likewise "we do not recommend that they have routine monitoring of serum creatinine levels". It further notes that in prolonged PPI users who have "LA grade C or D esophagitis or whose GERD symptoms are not adequately controlled with alternative medical therapies", available data "suggest that the established benefits of PPI treatment outweigh their proposed but highly questionable cardiovascular risks", and that "PPIs can be used to treat GERD in patients with renal insufficiency with close monitoring of renal function or consultation with a nephrologist".

### Association between proton pump inhibitor use and risk of progression of chronic kidney disease [^113tCYtg]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) have been associated with acute kidney injury and recent studies suggest that they may be associated with the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis using the Stockholm creatinine measurements database, which contains information on diagnoses, dispensation claims, and laboratory test results for all citizens in the Stockholm region from 2007 through 2010. We identified new users of PPIs (n = 105,305) and new users of H 2 blockers (H 2 B; n = 9578); data on renal outcomes were collected for a median 2.7 years. The primary outcome was progression CKD, defined as doubling of creatinine or decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30% or more. Secondary outcomes were end-stage renal disease and acute kidney injury. Complete collection of repeated PPI and H 2 B dispensations at pharmacies in Sweden allowed modeling the time-dependent risk associated with cumulative PPI exposure.

Results

Users of PPIs, compared with users of H 2 Bs, had an increased risk for doubled levels of creatinine (1985 events; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05–1.51) and decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30% or more (11,045 events; 1.26; 95% CI, 1.16–1.36). PPI use also associated with development of end-stage renal disease (HR, 2.40; 95% CI, 0.76–7.58) and acute kidney injury (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.00–1.69). There was a graded association between cumulative exposure to PPIs and risk of CKD progression. This was not the case for cumulative H 2 B use.

Conclusions

Initiation of PPI therapy and cumulative PPI exposure is associate with increased risk of CKD progression in a large, North European healthcare system. Although consistent, the association was modest in magnitude, and cannot exclude residual confounding.

### Using proton pump inhibitors correlates with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease: a nationwide database-derived case-controlled study [^115mD1Ta]. Family Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Those taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) might have a higher risk of acute kidney injury. The long-term safety, especially the PPI-associated chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the subsequent concern.

Objective

This study explores the potential relationship between using PPIs and CKD in Taiwan.

Methods

Using a database collated by the Taiwan National Health Insurance programme, we conducted a population-based case-controlled study to identify 16 704 cases of patients aged 20 years or older with newly diagnosed CKD between 2000 and 2013. 16 704 controls were randomly selected and were matched by sex, age and comorbidities. 'Use' of PPIs was defined as when subjects had received at least a prescription for PPIs before the index date. 'Non-use' was defined as subjects who had never received a prescription for PPIs before the index date. The odds ratio (OR) for CKD associated with the use of PPIs was estimated by a logistic regression model.

Results

The OR for CKD was 1.41 for subjects using PPIs [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34, 1.48] compared with subjects who had never used PPIs. Almost all major types of PPIs present a weak association with increased odds of CKD in cumulative duration and dosage regression analysis. The OR in relation to cumulative duration (per month) of PPIs use was 1.02 (95% CI 1.01, 1.02) and the OR in relation to cumulative dosage (per microgram) of PPIs use was 1.23 (95% CI 1.18, 1.28).

Conclusions

Using PPIs presented 1.4-fold higher odds of CKD in Taiwan health insurance claims data analysis.

### Accelerated risk of renal disease progression in pre-ESRD patients with proton pump inhibitors use: a nationwide population-based study [^112szjMx]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are established as the leading medications for gastric acid suppression, and have a crucial role in treating peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and in eradicating Helicobacter pylori. Their significant clinical use is well-documented. However, recent studies have raised concerns about the long-term use of PPIs, particularly the potential risk of adverse renal outcomes. These range from minor issues such as hypomagnesemia to serious conditions such as acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and even the risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The underlying mechanisms of PPI-induced renal dysfunction, potentially involving a dose-response relationship, are an area of ongoing research.

The metabolic processing of PPIs, especially omeprazole and esomeprazole, which predominantly rely on the Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) enzyme, is a key issue. Studies indicate a significant variability in CYP2C19 activity among different ethnic populations, with Asians often exhibiting a slower metabolic rate compared to Western populations. This variation suggests that Asian populations may be more likely to accelerate adverse renal outcomes, when treated with CYP2C19 -metabolized PPIs.

Taiwan, despite implementing a pre-ESRD pay-for-performance program in 2006 to enhance care for CKD stages 3b to 5 patients, continues to have one of the highest global ESRD prevalence. This alarming statistic underscores the importance of region-specific research on potential renal risks associated with PPIs. Current research in Taiwan on PPI-related renal risks primarily comprises case-control studies. While these studies have been valuable in suggesting potential associations, their design limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions. This limitation highlights the need for further research using more rigorous methodologies to better understand the potential effects of PPI usage on renal outcomes.

Our study investigates to expand upon these findings by exploring the relationship between PPI usage and the risk of AKI and progression to ESRD specifically in the pre-ESRD patient in Taiwan. We focus particularly on PPIs, exploring whether these medications accelerated e the risk of renal function progression in pre-ESRD patients. By examining the implications of PPI usage in a broader and more extended context, this research aims to provide valuable insights into renal health outcomes. These findings will contribute to more informed clinical decisions in the prescription of PPIs or H2 blockers (H2B) especially in moderate to advanced CKD patients, particularly in these population in pre-ESRD program in Taiwan.

### Estimates of all cause mortality and cause specific mortality associated with proton pump inhibitors among US veterans: cohort study [^113gRhPJ]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

The results show a consistent excess of cause specific mortality even among patients without documented gastrointestinal indications for acid suppression drugs — an alarming finding which might help guide the design and implementation of deprescription programs to reduce the number of unnecessary or un-indicated PPI prescriptions. The evidence that mortality due to cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and upper gastrointestinal cancer was not modified by the presence of baseline cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or upper gastrointestinal cancer, respectively, suggests the need for heightened vigilance among those with and — with equal importance — those at risk of these conditions. The evidence from all available studies suggests that long term PPI use is associated with serious adverse events, including an increased risk of all cause mortality, and our results specifically suggest an increased mortality due to cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and upper gastrointestinal cancer. Because of the high prevalence of PPI use, the findings have public health implications and underscore the important message that PPIs should be used only when medically indicated and for the minimum duration necessary.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and worsening kidney function: a retrospective cohort study including 122, 606 acid-suppressing users [^111X2UKy]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Worsening Kidney Function

The number of observed events varied depending on the severity of the endpoint, ranging from 109 cases with eGFR below 15 ml/min/1.73 m² to 2,601 cases with eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m². The corresponding crude incidence rates ranged from 1.26 to 31.57 cases per 1,000 person-years (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Table 6). Crude incidence rates were consistently lower for ranitidine than for PPIs, with the highest incidences observed for pantoprazole. For instance, eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² had an IR 18.7 95%CI (12.0–27.8) for ranitidine and an IR 31.2 95%CI (29.9–32.5) for omeprazole. The analysis stratified by sex and age showed higher IRs of worsening kidney function as advancing age (Supplementary Tables 7–9). Figure 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1 represent the cumulative incidence of worsening kidney function during the first two and the first year of follow-up, respectively.

### Proton-pump inhibitor vs. H2-receptor blocker use and overall risk of CKD progression [^112woTnL]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Similar rates of progression to ESKD and overall mortality were noted among PPI vs H2B users in the CKD population. There were several limitations to this study, the biggest one being the inability to confirm duration of prescription use. However, the results from this study are still relevant, as a large portion of the CKD population rely on acid-suppressing therapy to manage their co-morbidities. Although more prospective research is still needed, the results from this study suggest that proton-pump inhibitors may be safe for use in select CKD patients.

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^112RYrcB]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are currently the first-line treatment for acid-related disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease. PPIs are one of the top ten most prescribed drugs worldwide. The global PPI market was evaluated at $2.9 billion in 2020 and is anticipated to grow by 6.9% annually from 2023 to 2030.

Although the pharmaceutical industry has made remarkable progress in novel drug discovery for safer and better PPIs, there has been a growing concern over the potential adverse effects of long-term PPI usage. In 2021, an umbrella review of 42 meta-analyses showed that long-term use of PPIs was associated with a variety of diseases, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and enteric infection. Moreover, the reporting of new PPI-associated adverse effects continues. In the past 2 years alone, epidemiological studies, for the first time, linked PPI use to increased risk of biliary tract cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, type-2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and cholelithiasis. The evidence for these associations was generally observational. Reporting of these adverse events attracted increasing attention to the appropriate use of PPIs, while it also resulted in fears and reduced adherence to PPI treatment in patients. The need for personalized strategies for reducing unnecessary PPI use has become an urgent subject to be addressed.

There are several weaknesses in existing studies. First, most of the previous studies only evaluated single outcomes within one population. Some studies might be limited by selective reporting or lack of validation in different populations. Second, a comprehensive evaluation of the overall safety profile and dose–response effects, particularly for major diseases with top global disease burden remains lacking. Finally, and more importantly, there exists a major knowledge gap on which group of people are more vulnerable to PPI-related adverse events. Thus, individualized treatment based on patients' underlying risk may confer benefits and reduce harms. Such a risk stratification approach, successfully implemented in selecting patients for antihypertensive and statin therapy, has also been applied to individuate avoidance of additional risks related to PPI use, such as type-2 diabetes, stroke, and cholelithiasis. However, its application for other PPI-associated adverse events remains unclear. To address these concerns and improve decision-making for the appropriate use of PPIs in the public, patients, clinicians, and industry, we comprehensively evaluated the overall safety profile, dose–response relationships, and individual risk stratification for PPI use and the top 30 causes of global disease burden based on five large cohorts from the US, the UK, and China.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^113Szxtu]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

This study has several notable strengths. This is the first systematic review to assess the risk of bias in NRS reporting on putative associations between PPIs and adverse kidney outcomes. To accomplish this, a complete and thorough literature search with explicit eligibility criteria was undertaken across several databases with articles subsequently screened for inclusion in this review. Selection, data extraction, and adjudication of risk of bias were done by two independent reviewers. Additional strengths of the review include its compliance with established guidelines for systematic literature reviews (i.e. PRISMA statement), including the use of a pre-specified protocol and search criteria. In addition, we used the ROBINS-I tool, which assesses a higher number of major methodological elements compared with several other risk of bias assessment tools. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO to promote transparency and allow for future replication or updates. Furthermore, this review includes more recently published data, and is consistent with seven previously published systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses, which showed a positive association with adverse kidney outcome (with OR/RR estimates ranging from 1.20 to 3.76).–

We recognize our review has some limitations. Although this review was designed to capture a wide range of literature, it is limited to recent publications in the last 10 years, as well as publications in the English language, and may therefore be limited by a lack of representativeness for the full body of published literature. Some of the studies were based on a single facility and/or included small sample sizes of PPI-treated patients. Also, several studies evaluated were limited by short follow-up duration. Finally, these findings may not be generalizable to patients of different age groups, races, or patients living in different countries. For example, four studies in the US Department of Veterans Affairs databases identified adverse kidney outcomes among users of PPIs relative to users of H 2 blockers. In addition, several of the studies identified describe older cohorts, where the use of PPIs and the incidence of kidney outcomes may be greater due to aging. Moreover, these patient populations are potentially more likely to experience comorbidities and be treated with several concomitant medications compared with younger populations. Despite these limitations, our study is the first systematic review using the ROBINS-I tool to indicate that potential reported associations between PPI and adverse kidney outcomes, although generally positive, are likely influenced by inadequate control of confounders and the selection of participants with prior PPI treatment.

### Long-term kidney outcomes among users of proton pump inhibitors without intervening acute kidney injury [^115Uf9t3]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use is associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), incident chronic kidney disease (CKD), and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). PPI-associated CKD is presumed to be mediated by intervening AKI. However, whether PPI use is associated with an increased risk of chronic renal outcomes in the absence of intervening AKI is unknown. To evaluate this we used the Department of Veterans Affairs national databases to build a cohort of 144,032 incident users of acid suppression therapy that included 125,596 PPI and 18,436 Histamine H2 receptor antagonist (H2 blockers) consumers. Over 5 years of follow-up in survival models, cohort participants were censored at the time of AKI occurrence. Compared with incident users of H2 blockers, incident users of PPIs had an increased risk of an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) under 60 ml/min/1.73 m² (hazard ratio 1.19; 95% confidence interval 1.15–1.24), incident CKD (1.26; 1.20–1.33), eGFR decline over 30% (1.22; 1.16–1.28), and ESRD or eGFR decline over 50% (1.30; 1.15–1.48). Results were consistent in models that excluded participants with AKI either before chronic renal outcomes, during the time in the cohort, or before cohort entry. The proportion of PPI effect mediated by AKI was 44.7%, 45.47%, 46.00%, and 46.72% for incident eGFR under 60 ml/min/1.73m 2, incident CKD, eGFR decline over 30%, and ESRD or over 50% decline in eGFR, respectively. Thus, PPI use is associated with increased risk of chronic renal outcomes in the absence of intervening AKI. Hence, reliance on antecedent AKI as warning sign to guard against the risk of CKD among PPI users is not sufficient as a sole mitigation strategy.

### Proton-pump inhibitor vs. H2-receptor blocker use and overall risk of CKD progression [^111oawsk]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Association between PPI use and all-cause mortality is difficult to interpret due to the large variance in patients studied to date. PPI use has been associated with increased mortality in cancer patients, liver cirrhotics, and those requiring artificial nutrition. However, these patient cohorts are dissimilar to the CKD population, and thus of limited use in determining true risk. Of the studies that more closely resemble our patient cohort, there are some that also suggest increased mortality in patients using PPIs. Xie and colleagues showed a small excess of cause specific mortality due to cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney, disease, and upper gastrointestinal cancer in patients taking PPIs. In addition, another cohort study determined increased risk of overall mortality with PPI use in kidney transplant recipients with average eGFR of 52. These findings are in contrast with the results from Grant's study which looked at the CKD population specifically and found no association between PPI use and increased mortality. Overall, the reports to date have major limitations including the observational nature of the studies and the degree of illness in the cohorts analyzed. Our study could find no association between PPI use and overall mortality when assessing patients with pre-established CKD.

### Adverse effects associated with proton pump inhibitors… [^113Prj1F]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors have been among the most widely prescribed medications in the United States for decades. This is largely due to 2 very common uses of PPIs: treatment of dyspepsia and prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding among patients prescribed antiplatelet therapy, coupled with the belief that PPIs have few adverse effects. However, mounting evidence demonstrates that PPIs are associated with a number of adverse effects and are overprescribed. This issue was highlighted in JAMA Internal Medicine's launch of the Less Is More series in 2010. 1, 2 Since then, additional evidence of adverse effects of PPIs has accumulated. In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Lazarus et al3 add chronic kidney disease to the list of possible harms of PPIs. Schoenfeld AJ, Grady D. Adverse Effects Associated With Proton Pump Inhibitors. JAMA Intern Med. 2016; 176: 172–174.

Multivariate analysis

Logistic analyses revealed a statistically significant increase in the rate of occurrence of mortality and CKD among patients who were taking PPIs compared to those who were not taking PPIs (Table 3). Figures 1 and 2 give the estimated probabilities of event by age for CKD and mortality analysis. We estimated probability of event by age from the fitted model (mean time at risk were 12.4 quarters and 15.9 for CKD and mortality, respectively). There was a significant effect of the interaction of age and PPI use (p -value < 0.0001), in models for both development of CKD and mortality. The result shows patients younger than 53 years old were significantly at higher risk of CKD incidence if taking PPI. Patients younger than 78 years old had significantly in higher risk of death if taking PPI. To determine whether the effect of PPI varied according to baseline characteristics, we performed stratified analyses for the risk of CKD and mortality. Patients who were white, male, < 65 years and did not have DM, vascular disease, cancer were at greater risk of CKD outcome if on PPI than if not on PPI blockers. However mortality outcome with PPI did not vary based on demographic or comorbidity (Table 4).

1 Adding CKD (Yes/No) as a covariate in the analysis of mortality, the CKD effect was significant but the PPI effect on mortality did not change; 2. When we controlled for propensity score the odds ratio for CKD outcome was 1.08 (95% CI 1.03–1.13), and for mortality outcome the odds ratio was 1.70 (95% CI 1.62–1.79), for PPI versus no PPI. 3. For the propensity matched data results were similar.

### Indications for the use of proton pump inhibitors for stress ulcer prophylaxis and peptic ulcer bleeding in hospitalized patients [^113mPPi1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors are widely used throughout the world for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders that are related to acid secretion, such as peptic ulcer disease and dyspepsia. Another common indication for proton pump inhibitors is stress ulcer prophylaxis. Proton pump inhibitors have proven efficacy for the treatment of acid-related gastrointestinal disorders, but there is concern that their use may be associated with the development of significant complications, such as fractures, Clostridium difficile infection, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and hypomagnesemia. Proton pump inhibitors are overused in the hospital setting, both for stress ulcer prophylaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding, and then they are often inappropriately continued after discharge from the hospital. This narrative review article outlines the evidence surrounding appropriate proton pump inhibitor use for stress ulcer prophylaxis and peptic ulcer bleeding.

### Association of proton pump inhibitor use and immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated acute kidney injury: a meta-analysis and a review of related outcomes [^114PWs2p]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment. However, they pose the risk of immune-related adverse events, including ICI-mediated acute kidney injury (ICI-AKI). Recent studies have implicated proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as potential contributors to ICI-AKI development. This meta-analysis examines the association between PPI use and ICI-AKI, exploring a potential modifiable risk factor in ICI therapy while also reviewing the possible outcomes of ICI-AKI.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies, assessing the risk of ICI-AKI in cancer patients concurrently using PPIs and potential outcomes. Odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate heterogeneity and potential biases.

Results

A total of 14 studies involving 12,694 patients were included. In total, we analyzed 639 patients with all-cause AKI and 779 patients with ICI-AKI. The pooled OR for the overall incidence of AKI from all-causes was 1.57 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–2.40) among patients on PPIs. Specifically, the risk of ICI-AKI associated with PPI use was significantly higher, with a pooled OR of 1.84 (95% CI 1.16–2.90). This indicates approximately 84% higher likelihood of developing ICI-AKI with concurrent use of PPIs. Additionally, among patients with ICI-AKI, 67% had complete or partial recovery of renal function, 32% progressed to chronic kidney disease (CKD), and about 36% died during a follow-up period of at least 3 months.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis highlights the importance of cautious PPI prescription in cancer patients undergoing ICI therapy. Clinicians are advised to evaluate the risks and benefits of PPI use and consider alternative therapies when feasible.

Long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) issues — key concepts for GERD — include that regarding safety, we suggest that patients should be advised as follows: PPIs are the most effective medical treatment for GERD; available associations do not establish a cause-and-effect relationship, high-quality studies have found that PPIs do not significantly increase the risk of any of these conditions except intestinal infections, and for GERD the well-established benefits of PPIs far outweigh their theoretical risks. Switching PPIs can be considered for patients who experience minor PPI side effects including headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and flatulence. For patients with GERD on PPIs who have no other risk factors for bone disease, we do not recommend that they raise their intake of calcium or vitamin D or that they have routine monitoring of bone mineral density; for patients with GERD on PPIs who have no other risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency, we do not recommend that they raise their intake of vitamin B12 or that they have routine monitoring of serum B12 levels; for patients with GERD on PPIs who have no other risk factors for kidney disease, we do not recommend that they have routine monitoring of serum creatinine levels. For patients with GERD on clopidogrel who have LA Grade C or D esophagitis whose GERD symptoms are not adequately controlled with alternative medical therapies, the highest quality available suggests that the established benefits of PPI treatment outweigh their proposed but highly questionable cardiovascular risks. PPIs can be used to treat GERD in patients with renal insufficiency with close monitoring of renal function or consultation with a nephrologist.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^114iVnJ2]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and setting

Two separate retrospective case–control study designs were employed with a prospective logistic regression analysis of data to evaluate the association of two different outcomes (development of CKD and death) with PPI use. The data were obtained from the Veterans Affairs Health Care Upstate New York (VISN2) network, which is composed of five VA medical centers and 29 community based outpatient clinics. The VISN2 database contains longitudinal records of 180,553 VA patients, who were seen in primary care VISN2 clinics from 4/2001 until 4/2008.

Participants

Patients were included only if they had at least one outpatient estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) estimated by the Chronic Kidney Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) equation during their observation period. For the CKD study, we excluded patients with an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² at entry (pre-existing CKD patients). Cases were identified as those patients who were subsequently diagnosed with CKD (ie, had an observed eGFR < 60). Controls were identified as those patients who were not diagnosed with CKD during their observation period. Records were retrospectively reviewed starting from the time of CKD diagnosis for cases, and from the time of last observation for controls to assess whether or not risk factors existed in the history of each patient. For the mortality study, cases were identified as individuals who died during the observation period and controls as individuals who were alive on March 31, 2008.

Risk factor variables

The primary risk factor to be tested for significance was the prescription of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in the history of cases or controls. PPI use was determined by whether a prescription was filled during a quarter. In addition to use of PPI (Yes/No), the following control variables were included in the analyses: age, gender, race, time at risk (ie, time from initial observation in the data system to the case–control outcome), and the pre-PPI comorbidity variables: vascular disease, gastrointestinal (GI) comorbidities, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, diabetes, and hypertension.

### Clinical characteristics of and risk factors for chronic kidney disease among adults and children: an analysis of the CURE-CKD registry [^112ZmfKB]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the clinical characteristics of and major risk factors for chronic kidney disease among patients in 2 large US health care systems?

Findings

In this cohort study of the Center for Kidney Research, Education, and Hope (CURE-CKD) registry, more than 2.6 million adults and children had chronic kidney disease or were at risk. Albuminuria or proteinuria was tested in approximately one-eighth of adults with chronic kidney disease, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors were prescribed to one-fifth, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or proton pump inhibitors were prescribed to more than one-third.

Meaning

Despite common occurrence of chronic kidney disease, rates of identification and use of kidney protective agents were low, while use of potential nephrotoxins was widespread.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^115oq4s8]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) polypharmacy and stewardship — practice point for medication review: People with CKD are "particularly susceptible to polypharmacy", and "most people with CKD not treated with dialysis receive 6–12 different medications per day", so clinicians should "perform thorough medication review periodically and at transitions of care to assess adherence, continued indication, and potential drug interactions because people with CKD often have complex medication regimens and are seen by multiple specialists". Medication review is described as "essential for minimizing the occurrence of medication-related problems", with opportunities to deprescribe when "a person no longer has an indication for a medication that may contribute to kidney injury (e.g. PPIs)" and to reassess "at each clinical encounter, especially care transitions", including dose/interval after a "decline in GFR (e.g., metformin)" or physiologic changes affecting distribution (e.g., "volume overload and sarcopenia").

Discussing the brand new class I indication on proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and DAPT for CKD patients

Observational studies have raised concerns that several PPIs, especially omeprazole, may decrease the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel through an inhibition of CYP2C19, resulting in an increased rate of major cardiovascular events when DAPT and PPIs were combined. However, a major confounder is the fact that patients receiving PPIs frequently represent a high-risk population, having several comorbidities, including CKD, which are themselves associated with worse outcomes and a higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The latest ESC Update granted a class I level B indication for using a PPI in combination with DAPT. This recommendation mostly stems from the Clopidogrel and the Optimization of Gastrointestinal Events Trial (COGENT), which assessed the efficacy and safety of concomitant administration of clopidogrel (75 mg) and omeprazole (20 mg) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (including patients with an ACS undergoing PCI), who are receiving clopidogrel plus aspirin (75 to 325 mg/d) for at least 12 months. The event rate for the primary gastrointestinal end-point was reduced from 2.9% with placebo to 1.1% with omeprazole at 180 days after randomization (P < 0.001).

Although there was no significant difference in the rate of the primary cardiovascular end-point between the two groups (P = 0.98), a finding which was consistent in higher-risk subgroups, these results " do no not rule out a clinically meaningful difference in cardiovascular events due to use of a PPI ". Importantly, as acknowledged by the authors themselves, the trial was not designed to represent high-risk patients. Since exclusion criteria comprised " clinically significant laboratory abnormality at screening or any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, precludes participation in the study ", one may hypothesize that CKD patients were mostly excluded. Of note, neither the manuscript table of baseline patient features nor subgroup analyses reported any data related to baseline kidney function, although serum creatinine was measured at baseline according to the protocol. It is therefore actually unknown whether the COGENT findings may apply to CKD patients since it is likely that no interaction with baseline CKD could be sought in this trial.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^114q3Jpa]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Moderate risk of bias

The overwhelming majority of studies (n = 19; 73%) were judged as having a moderate risk of bias for the adverse kidney outcomes assessed. Among these 19 studies, 14 were cohort (retrospective, prospective), with the remainder being case-control. Across the 19 studies, confounding bias was assessed as moderate due to the lack of control for potential critical confounders of interest (i.e. age, sex, race, baseline eGFR, diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure/hypertension, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, liver disease, and NSAID use), which varied across the studies. In addition, 10 of the 19 studies. were judged as having a moderate risk of selection bias for the adverse kidney outcomes assessed, mostly due to the inclusion of patients with PPI use prior to study initiation (i.e. prevalent users).

The description of individual PPI (or a specific PPI) used by participants was not uniformly reported across studies. For those studies reporting this information, PPI type generally comprised omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole; the limited information on dosage differed by PPI type (15 mg/day or 30 mg/day of lansoprazole, 20 mg/day of esomeprazole, 10 mg/day of rabeprazole, and 20 mg/day of omeprazole). The length of follow-up varied widely, ranging from 14 days to approximately 14 years for AKI, 120 days to approximately 16 years for CKD, and 1 to 5 years for ESRD.

Among the 19 studies, nine reported more than one outcome. AKI was the most frequently assessed outcome assessed as having a moderate risk of bias with 12 studies identified. In total, they represented 7,958,698 patients from the United States, Canada, China, Japan, Denmark, France, Sweden, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, with 65% of patients stemming from a large aggregation of three national databases in New Zealand. Patients were more likely to be older, with 11 studies reporting a mean or median age over 60 years at baseline.

### Effects of prolonged proton-pump inhibitor use on renal dysfunction and bone fragility [^115pDGYd]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use for management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) consists of a short-duration trial, according to guidelines. Long-term usage is appropriate under certain indications. Literature has increasingly documented an adverse effect profile of PPIs, including kidney disease and bone fragility.

Objective

To investigate the rate of occurrence of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients using PPI therapy for longer than the recommended trial period of 8 weeks.

Methods

Retrospective cohort analysis of a single-site primary care clinic. Patients aged 18 to 65 years with PPI prescriptions longer than 8 weeks were included. Information regarding PPI prescriptions, demographics, and medical diagnoses was collected.

Results

The search discovered 293 PPI-users and 1908 never-PPI-users. Demographics varied, with a P -value < 0.05 in age, body mass index (BMI), and black population (higher in PPI group). The PPI cohort featured higher rates of osteoporosis/osteopenia and CKD (P < 0.001). The odds ratios (ORs) of diagnosis with PPI use was 2.91 (95% CI = [1.692, 4.979]) in osteoporosis/osteopenia. The OR was 1.14 (95% CI = [1.141, 2.229]) in CKD and PPI use but higher with diabetes, elevated BMI, black race, and male gender.

Conclusions and Relevance

We observed increased occurrence rates of osteoporosis, or osteopenia, and CKD in patients with prolonged PPI use. Demographics varied in age, BMI, and black race proportion. A logistic regression revealed increased likelihood of kidney disease and osteoporosis/osteopenia in association with PPI use. These results add to the evidence regarding long-term PPI use and the development of these conditions, but additional studies are needed.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^115z62B1]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

A number of non-randomized epidemiologic studies have suggested a potential association between PPIs and adverse kidney outcomes, including acute kidney injury (AKI), acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), CKD, progression of CKD, and risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It has also been observed that patients with CKD are prescribed PPIs for longer durations and in higher quantities than patients without CKD, which may contribute to worsening kidney outcomes in this high-risk population. Prevalence and duration of PPI treatment are reported to increase with age; thus, the risk of the adverse kidney outcomes is likely higher among older adults.

Although there is no physiologic explanation for the effect, some studies report that these associations are well established. Non-randomized studies (NRS) of the effects of interventions (benefits or harm) are important to many areas of health care decision-making. However, critical limitations inherent to the data sources (lack of detailed information on clinical parameters, OTC medications, lifestyle, etc.) and study design of observational studies can lead to an increased risk of residual confounding (surveillance bias, channeling bias) and selection bias. Across NRS, it is possible to find many different types of data sources, each with unique strengths and limitations, and various methodologic and analytic approaches. Many times, the likelihood of residual confounding cannot be ruled out, particularly in cases where only weak associations were observed. More importantly, a review by Vaezi et al. has questioned the value of recent meta-analyses of observational studies on this topic because of the presence of potential bias and confounding in individual studies. The authors made a plea to the research community for future systematic reviews to evaluate the trustworthiness of the individual studies in terms of the presence of bias and confounding.

Given the importance of these data for evidence-based practice and specific need for a different approach, a more detailed, comprehensive, and critical systematic review of the existing observational literature is needed to evaluate the quality of non-randomized observational studies reporting on potential associations between PPIs and adverse kidney outcomes. Specifically, the present study systematically reviews the literature and assesses the risk of bias using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for NRS, to allow, for the evaluation of the strength of the evidence on the association of PPIs and adverse kidney outcomes.

Materials and methods

Study protocol

This systematic literature review was performed as outlined in guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The study protocol was developed with input from clinical experts and registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number CRD42021227555).

Search strategy and data sources

Two electronic data sources (PubMed and Embase) were searched to identify potentially relevant studies published within 10 years of the search date, 17 December 2020. The search strategy included terms for AKI, AIN, or chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN), acute tubular necrosis (ATN), CKD, ESRD, PPIs (including individual brand names), observational studies, and measures of association. All terms were searched using title/abstract and relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms in PubMed (details in) and title/abstract and database-recommended candidate terms in Embase (details in). A manual search of key publications and references was also conducted.

Study selection process and criteria

Dual process screening was individually conducted by two trained epidemiologist reviewers, with any disagreements in screening resolved during consensus or through consultation with a third senior reviewer. Titles and abstracts of articles identified using the search strategy were individually screened, and studies that included information on the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes, Timeframe, and Study Design/Setting (PICOTS)according to inclusion criteria were carried forward to the full-text review. All studies that were considered out-of-scope based on the inclusion criteria during the full-text review were excluded with a documented rationale.

Studies included in the final extraction met the following criteria: (1) adult patients (⩾18 years), (2) an original observational study (i.e. case-control, cohort/registry), (3) included PPI(s) as an intervention, (4) included H 2 blockers and/or non-users of PPIs as a comparator, and (5) measured at least one of the outcomes of interest (AKI, AIN, CIN, ATN, CKD, ESRD) with a measure of association [hazard ratio (HR), odds ratio (OR), risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD)] (detailed eligibility requirements in).

### Reducing kidney function decline in patients with CKD: core curriculum 2021 [^112rrxoB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

An estimated 8% to 16% of the world's population has chronic kidney disease, defined by low glomerular filtration rate or albuminuria. Progression of chronic kidney disease is associated with adverse outcomes, including incident kidney failure with replacement therapy, accelerated cardiovascular disease, disability, and mortality. Therefore, slowing kidney function decline is paramount in the management of a patient with chronic kidney disease. Ascertaining the cause of kidney disease is an important first step and may compel specific therapies. Effective approaches that apply to the vast majority of patients with chronic kidney disease include the optimization of blood pressure and blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, particularly if albuminuria is present. Recent studies suggest that sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are highly effective treatments in patients with diabetes and/or albuminuria. For patients with type 2 diabetes, glycemic control is important in preventing the development of microvascular complications, and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists may help reduce albuminuria levels. Other strategies include correcting metabolic acidosis, maintaining ideal body weight, following diets that are low in sodium and animal protein, and avoiding potential nephrotoxins such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, proton-pump inhibitors, and iodinated contrast.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and worsening kidney function: a retrospective cohort study including 122, 606 acid-suppressing users [^111pCu8J]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have a number of limitations, such as absence of relevant baseline information, specific populations that limited the generalizability of results, multiple medications switches during the study, the inclusion of baseline PPI users, diagnosis of CKD based on diagnostic codes instead of laboratory findings, limited sCr or eGFR measurements, self-reported acid-suppressing use, or comorbidity imbalance between PPI and non-PPI groups. In a recent study, Kweon et al. found no association between PPI and CKD in a retrospective observational study including 7,836 PPI users and 7,836 H2-blocker users. In Spain, neither PPI nor H2-blockers can be obtained over the counter, reducing misclassification of acid-suppressing use. Moreover, ranitidine was withdrawn from the market in Spain around the end the study period, therefore the sample size of ranitidine initiators in 2020 is small.

We found no differences between PPI and H2-blockers in clinically relevant events such as ESRD and eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2, and absolute risks were low. Our findings are consistent with results recently published by Cholin et al. in patients with underlying CKD. Similar findings were reported by Klatte et al. in patients with baseline eGFR > 15 ml/min/1.73 m². However, other studies found association between PPI use and ESRD or CKD progression.

Vaezi et al. reviewed PPI adverse events according with Bradford Hill causality criteria concluding that worsening kidney function met temporality but none of the remaining criteria. In addition, approximately 50% of worsening kidney function in PPI users could be explained by AKI, but the remaining lacked a well understood mechanism.

### Proton pump inhibitors and risk of incident CKD and progression to ESRD [^114ygbc8]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The association between proton pump inhibitors (PPI) use and risk of acute interstitial nephritis has been described. However, whether exposure to PPI associates with incident CKD, CKD progression, or ESRD is not known. We used Department of Veterans Affairs national databases to build a primary cohort of new users of PPI (n = 173,321) and new users of histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists (H 2 blockers; n = 20,270) and followed these patients over 5 years to ascertain renal outcomes. In adjusted Cox survival models, the PPI group, compared with the H 2 blockers group, had an increased risk of incident eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² and of incident CKD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.18 to 1.26; and HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.34, respectively). Patients treated with PPI also had a significantly elevated risk of doubling of serum creatinine level (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.42 to 1.65), of eGFR decline > 30% (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.37), and of ESRD (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.18). Furthermore, we detected a graded association between duration of PPI exposure and risk of renal outcomes among those exposed to PPI for 31–90, 91–180, 181–360, and 361–720 days compared with those exposed for ≤ 30 days. Examination of risk of renal outcomes in 1:1 propensity score-matched cohorts of patients taking H 2 blockers versus patients taking PPI and patients taking PPI versus controls yielded consistent results. Our results suggest that PPI exposure associates with increased risk of incident CKD, CKD progression, and ESRD.

### Proton-pump inhibitor vs. H2-receptor blocker use and overall risk of CKD progression [^113MEPX5]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Patient population

We used data from our Electronic Health Record (EHR) - based Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) registry to evaluate the relationship between the use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) and H2 blockers and outcomes. We have previously described the development and validation of this registry. For the current analysis, we included patients who: a) had at least one face-to-face outpatient encounter with a Cleveland Clinic health care provider and at least two estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measures < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2, > 90 days apart, between January 1, 2007 and December 30, 2017 and patients who were not on dialysis nor had a functioning kidney transplant, b) had active PPI and no prior H2B prescription, or had active H2B and no prior PPI prescription, or had neither prior PPI nor prior H2B on the date of second eGFR < 60 (CKD), c) were residents of the State of Ohio, and d) had continuity of care at our institution with at least 2 PCP visits in the year prior to the second eGFR < 60.

Patient characteristics

We extracted demographic information from the EHR, and defined comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, malignancy, congestive heart failure, and hyperlipidemia using pre-specified and previously validated criteria. We evaluated whether these conditions existed prior to the second eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 which was the inception date for each patient. We also extracted relevant laboratory data (serum albumin, potassium and bicarbonate, proteinuria) from the EHR. For laboratory results, the last outpatient laboratory result obtained within 2 years prior to inception was included.

We evaluated whether patients had continuity of care at our institution by searching for 2 completed visits or appointments with the listed primary care provider (PCP) within the year prior to the second eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m².

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^115kotyo]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Sensitivity analysis

We did several sensitivity analyses: 1. We removed individuals with baseline CKD for the analysis of mortality and added CKD (Yes/No) as a covariate in the analysis of mortality outcome; 2. For the second sensitivity analysis, we first defined the propensity score as the estimated probability of receiving PPI, which was obtained from a logistic regression analysis of PPI on age, race, sex and the pre-PPI comorbidity variables: vascular disease, COPD, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension. We repeated our analysis of case–control data for each outcome of interest controlling for propensity score instead of controlling for comorbidities prior to PPI; 3. We also used propensity score matching (PSM) technique to reduce the bias due to confounding variables.

It should be noted, in the sensitivity analyses that involved propensity scoring, all potentially confounding variables except GI were included in the propensity score. GI was of particular interest separately and, therefore, was added to the model directly as a covariate. This allows interpretation of the coefficient on PPI as the effect of PPI unconfounded by preceding GI and the coefficient on GI as the effect of preceding GI that is not mediated through the effect of GI on the decision to prescribe PPI. Thus, since GI is an indication for PPI prescription and it is known that GI is associated with CKD and death, including GI as a covariate directly allows us to assess whether the effect of GI is mediated through its effect on PPI.

All of the analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) [Statistical significance was set to α = 0.05]. The Logistic procedure in SAS was used for the analysis of each model.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^116oyqoh]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Non-judicious PPI use is a matter of great concern in the elderly, who often have multiple comorbidities, are taking multiple medications, and are thus at increased risk of long-term PPI-related adverse outcomes. PPI-related adverse events involve the GI tract as well as other organs and systems. The potential risks of long-term PPI therapy, along with the respective evidence summary, have been summarized in the Safety section. While some concerns about the possible adverse effects of PPIs (including an increased risk of gastric carcinoids, gastric carcinoma, decreased absorption of minerals and vitamins) have been raised since their introduction in the late 1980s, more recently, the number of publications dealing with PPI-related adverse outcomes has steadily increased. It is worth mentioning, however, that the majority of studies are observational in nature and do not allow for establishing causality, but merely associations. Residual bias is always a concern in observational studies, even after statistical adjustment, because all confounding factors cannot be recorded or even known. When effect sizes are small (relative risk/OR/hazard ratio < 2), it is not possible to determine whether the association is valid or represents the result of residual bias. Hazard ratios for PPI use and some reported adverse effects (e.g. dementia, chronic kidney disease, any fracture, or community-acquired pneumonia) were all ≤ 1.5. Nevertheless, if a true causality exists, even small effect sizes can result in a meaningful risk for common interventions and conditions.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and worsening kidney function: a retrospective cohort study including 122, 606 acid-suppressing users [^1174CJP3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Follow-Up and Study Endpoints

Baseline serum creatinine (sCr) and eGFR was obtained from the most recent measurement available during the 12 months prior to start date. Independent follow-ups were performed for each study endpoint. Thus, follow-up continued until the earliest of the following: study endpoint, death, the date of transfer-out from the database, the last date of data collection from their practitioners, or the end of the study period (30th June 2021, to guarantee at least 6 months follow-up).

This study had two primary endpoints: worsening kidney function and incidence of AKI, compared between the cohort of PPI initiators and the H2-blocker new user cohort. Worsening kidney function was assessed during follow-up using several definitions: doubling of baseline sCr, eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² (confirmed with at least one subsequent measurement), a decrease in eGFR 30% or 50% from baseline (confirmed with at least one subsequent measurement), and ESRD (defined as a hospital admission for chronic renal disease (CKD) or an eGFR value < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² confirmed with at least one subsequent measurement). We also explored the rate of change in eGFR during the study period among those with at least two measurements of eGFR after basal data, where the first measurement was less than 120 days after baseline data and the last measurement more than 180 days from the first measurement (e.g. leaving enough time for the potential eGFR change).

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular, renal or gastrointestinal comorbidities: joint APAGE / APLAR / APSDE / APSH / APSN / PoA recommendations [^111X1Brb]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most commonly prescribed medications, but they are associated with a number of serious adverse effects, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney injury and GI complications.

Objective

To develop a set of multidisciplinary recommendations for the safe prescription of NSAIDs.

Methods

Randomised control trials and observational studies published before January 2018 were reviewed, with 329 papers included for the synthesis of evidence-based recommendations.

Results

Whenever possible, a NSAID should be avoided in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, high risk of cardiovascular disease and severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). Before treatment with a NSAID is started, blood pressure should be measured, unrecognised CKD should be screened in high risk cases, and unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia should be investigated. For patients with high cardiovascular risk, and if NSAID treatment cannot be avoided, naproxen or celecoxib are preferred. For patients with a moderate risk of peptic ulcer disease, monotherapy with a non-selective NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), or a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor should be used; for those with a high risk of peptic ulcer disease, a selective COX-2 inhibitor plus PPI are needed. For patients with pre-existing hypertension receiving renin-angiotensin system blockers, empirical addition (or increase in the dose) of an antihypertensive agent of a different class should be considered. Blood pressure and renal function should be monitored in most cases.

Conclusion

NSAIDs are a valuable armamentarium in clinical medicine, but appropriate recognition of high-risk cases, selection of a specific agent, choice of ulcer prophylaxis and monitoring after therapy are necessary to minimise the risk of adverse events.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^112tSgQc]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study revealed that PPI use was associated with increased odds of development of CKD and death. Although the association of PPI use with mortality has been widely reported, we found an association of PPI use with development of CKD. It is not surprising that PPI use is associated with CKD as these drugs are one of the most common causes of AIN in the United States.

Our study showed that PPI use increased the odds of development of CKD by 10%. The most likely explanation is unrecognized or partially recovered AIN. Thirty to 70% of patients with drug induced AIN do not fully recover their baseline renal function, likely due to rapid transformation of interstitial cellular infiltrates into large areas of fibrosis. Simpson et al found an incidence of AIN of 8.0 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 2.6–18.7), based on 15 cases and an estimated 750,000 1-month treatments dispensed annually. Blank et al found similar results in a case control study. Recovery from AKI occurs following withdrawal of the offending drug with or without corticosteroid treatment may not be complete and many patients are left with some degree of renal impairment. Geevasinga et al identified 18 cases of biopsy-proven PPI-induced AIN causing AKI in a retrospective case review. All patients recovered renal function, but the mean calculated creatinine clearance was 15.9 ml/min/ 1.73 m 2 and 11.5 ml/min/1.73 m 2 lower than baseline at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Simpson et al also noted an incomplete recovery of renal function after PPI induced AIN.

### Proton pump inhibitors and acute kidney injury: a nested case-control study [^114wVSBN]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this nested case-controlled study affirm an association between renal disease and PPI use. Our study revealed that patients with a renal disease diagnosis were twice as likely to have a previous prescription for a PPI. Therefore, it is necessary that pharmacist and physician awareness and recognition of patient complaints or clinical manifestations of this potentially harmful event are increased. Furthermore, it is important that future research seek to establish a definitive causal relationship.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) — over-the-counter (OTC) medications, herbal remedies, and dietary supplements: kidney disease risk can be exacerbated by OTC medications, herbal remedies, and other dietary supplements; NSAIDs are associated with interstitial nephritis, analgesic nephropathy, and hypertension, and indiscriminate chronic OTC NSAID use has been associated with a higher risks of kidney failure compared with nonuse and should be discouraged, although judicious NSAID use, under careful supervision of a nephrologist, may be preferred to opioids. Proton pump inhibitors are also common OTC medications in some countries that have been associated with AKI and CKD due to tubulointerstitial nephritis. Herbal compounds are highly prevalent and often used in an unmonitored setting; the frequency of CKD associated with herbal remedy use is not known and the potential toxicity of herbal remedies may be enhanced by coexisting volume depletion and by other illness or medication use. Dietary supplements are widely available with unknown pharmacokinetics and potential toxicity; examples include creatine supplements associated with allergic interstitial nephritis and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supplements which in excess can lead to tubular calcium oxalate crystal deposition. Healthcare providers are encouraged to routinely inquire about the use of herbal remedies and recommend stopping any unprescribed alternative remedy that may pose a threat for (kidney) health.

### Accelerated risk of renal disease progression in pre-ESRD patients with proton pump inhibitors use: a nationwide population-based study [^114vGqzm]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The exact mechanisms by which PPIs contribute to renal function deterioration are not fully understood. Previous studies have indicated a link between PPI use and the development of AKI, which may progress to chronicity. However, this association is contested by findings from Xie et al. who reported that AKI does not mediate the relationship between PPI use and the onset of CKD. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the potential nephrotoxic effects of PPIs. One theory suggests that PPI use may induce hypomagnesemia or elevate levels of asymmetrical dimethylarginine, both of which are factors associated with the decline in kidney function. Additionally, PPIs are implicated in promoting enteric infections such as Clostridium difficile. These infections are thought to result from decreased gastric acidity and alterations in the gut microbiome, as well as the translocation of endotoxins into the circulation, which could contribute to uremic toxicity, inflammation, and the progression of kidney disease. Moreover, the metabolic pathways of most PPIs, with the exception of rabeprazole, involve significant processing (> 80%) by the CYP2C19 enzyme. Omeprazole and esomeprazole, in particular, act as inhibitors of CYP2C19. The drug interaction between PPIs and other nephrotoxic drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 could further increase the risk of renal function impairment in patients with renal diseases. Additionally, there is a possibility that PPIs, either alone or in combination with other medications, may accumulate in the kidneys, leading to a reduction in renal function.

Results

Patient characteristics

After exclusion of patients with no outpatient eGFR measurement, our sample size was 99,269 individuals. Of these, 36,282 were on PPI at some time during their observation period. 22,807 had CKD at the time of first observation in the VISN2 data system, leaving 76,462 patients for analysis of the CKD onset outcome.

A total of 22,734 were taking PPI (4711 in the case group and 18023 in the control group). Mean age of the patients in the data set for analysis of CKD was 56.6 years. There were 4682 (6.1%) females and 7719 (10.1%) African Americans (AA). Table 1 gives the frequencies of risk factors for CKD outcome by PPI status. Patients using PPI were less likely to have vascular disease (15.5% vs 18.5%), cancer (7.3% vs 10.3%), and diabetes (17.5% vs 21.2%) prior to PPI use; and more likely to have COPD (9.85% vs 8.92%) or hypertension (62.5% vs 62.3%). Logistic regression analysis revealed patients with vascular disease, diabetes, and cancers at baseline were less likely to have received PPI.

### Passing the acid test? Evaluating the impact of national education initiatives to reduce proton pump inhibitor use in Australia [^112eDaFe]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

In the past two decades, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have become the ubiquitous treatment for managing gastrointestinal-acid-related disorders globally. These disorders are widespread in Western societies with worldwide prevalence estimates for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) ranging from 10% to 20%and 5% to 10% for peptic ulcer disease.PPIs are also commonly prescribed prophylactically to prevent stress ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be induced by treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or certain anticoagulant medicines. Contemporary prevalence estimates of PPI use range internationally from 7% to 16%; it is estimated that 15% of Australian adults were dispensed at least one PPI in 2017.

PPIs have an excellent safety profile when used for short periods; however, concerns are growing regarding their long-term use due to increased risks of bone fractures, vitamin B 12 and magnesium deficiencies, and C lostridium difficile infection, especially in older people. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests an increased risk of mortality with prolonged PPI use, specifically mortality due to cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and upper gastrointestinal cancer. The rapid rise in PPI use since their introduction to the market in the 1990shas prompted widespread trepidation about their overuse, particularly the use of higher dose PPIs for durations longer than clinically necessary.

Results

Systematic literature search

Figure 1 displays the PRISMA diagram. Our electronic search initially returned 615 articles; an additional five were identified from a manual search of other sources (e.g. review articles) and 100 duplicates were deleted. Of the 520 records screened based on their titles and abstracts, we excluded 448 (primarily due to ineligible study design, intervention, or outcome), and included 72 in the full-text assessment. Of those, 46 were excluded based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria (reasons for exclusion included in Figure 1). We included a total of 26 studies for final qualitative synthesis for PPI-related adverse kidney outcomes.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^112Zoy8Q]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

We also identified six studies, with a moderate risk of bias that assessed ESRD outcomes (e.g. MARE, ESRD, ESRD, or > 50% decline in eGFR, ESKD). In total, they represented 660,560 patients from the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, France, and Taiwan. Effect estimates for the association between PPI treatment (compared with non-PPI users or H 2 blocker users) and ESRD-related outcomes ranged from an adjusted HR of 1.13 (95% CI 1.02–1.25)to 5.32 (95% CI 1.53–18.55), with a single study reporting an adjusted OR of 1.88 (95% CI 1.71–2.06). Finally, three studies, reported on the association between PPIs and AIN, with an adjusted HR of 3.00 (95% CI 1.47–6.14)reported in a single study among 581,184 patients in Canada and adjusted ORs ranging from 2.05 (95% CI 1.52–2.72)to 3.20 (95% CI 0.80–12.79)among 4143 patients from the United States and 3415 patients from the United Kingdom, respectively.

Serious risk of bias

A total of six studies (four cohort, one case-control, one case-cohort), reported outcomes that were assessed as having a serious risk of bias (see Table 2). Adverse kidney outcomes included three studies of AKI, in 2043 patients and three studies of CKD, in 650,685 patients. The primary reasons for an overall serious risk of bias judgment for these six studies included potential bias due to confounding, selection bias, and classification of interventions. Across these six studies, PPI treatment (compared with non-users) was moderately associated with AKI and CKD outcomes, respectively, with adjusted HRs ranging from 0.82 (95% CI 0.40–1.67) to 2.85 (95% CI 1.34–6.08)and adjusted ORs ranging from 1.10 (95% CI 1.05–1.16)to 2.85 (95% CI 1.81–4.48).

### Proton pump inhibitors and acute kidney injury: a nested case-control study [^112wdA7x]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are a widely-used class of drugs for the treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease and other acid-related disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. In 2009, more than 119 million PPI prescriptions were filled in the United States, accounting for nearly $14 billion dollars in prescription PPI sales, in addition to billions more in over-the-counter (OTC) sales. The PPI class includes several different agents, such as esomeprazole, omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, deslansoprazole, rabeprazole, etc. all of which possess a common mechanism of action for reducing parietal cell acid production by blocking H+/K + adenosine triphosphatase.

As a class, PPIs have demonstrated a favorable safety profile. Overall, complications have been infrequent and minor. The most common unwanted effects reported have been headaches, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In fact, the favorable adverse effect profile has led to movement of some of these agents to non-prescription status. However, as the use of PPIs has grown more widespread so have safety concerns. A growing body of literature suggests that this class of drugs may be linked to acute kidney injury, which can potentially lead to chronic injury or kidney failure. In 1992, a sentinel case-report identified the PPI omeprazole as a possible cause of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) in an elderly woman. Since that time, numerous biopsy-confirmed case reports and retrospective descriptive reports have been published suggesting a connection between PPI use and AIN. Detailed summaries of these case reports have been published. However, research in this area has been limited and consisted of small sample sizes without comparator groups. As a result, no estimate of the effect size is currently available. In turn, determining if an association between PPI use and AIN exists requires studies using larger sample sizes and control groups.

### Risk of stroke associated with proton pump inhibitor use among individuals with and without pre-existing cardiovascular diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111zi3VC]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

To refine our understanding of PPI use and its potential association with stroke risk, large-scale, prospective RCTs specifically designed to investigate cardiovascular outcomes are needed. These studies should aim to stratify participants according to their baseline risk for stroke, pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, and other risk factors like diabetes and CKD. There is also a need for mechanistic studies to elucidate the biological pathways through which PPIs may influence stroke risk, which could lead to targeted interventions or the development of safer therapeutic alternatives. Additionally, research into patient subgroups based on genetic predispositions, such as variants in the CYP2C19 gene, which may modify the effect of PPIs, could provide valuable insights for personalized medicine approaches. Finally, long-term observational studies with rigorous methodologies and adjustments for confounders are essential to understanding the real-world implications of chronic PPI use. Another potential consideration for future research could involve the design of a RCT PPIs with Gaviscon for managing conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Such a study could provide clarity on the relative efficacy and safety profiles of these two widely used treatments, especially in light of increasing concerns around long-term PPI use, including risks of nutrient deficiencies, renal impairment, and altered microbiomes. However, given the extensive and routine clinical use of PPIs, an RCT may present ethical challenges. Patients assigned to a Gaviscon-only group could potentially be deprived of a more established treatment standard, raising concerns about withholding a proven therapeutic option. Careful ethical considerations, along with the establishment of robust monitoring and criteria for therapeutic crossover, would be essential in designing a trial that respects patient welfare while addressing this important question.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and the risk of chronic kidney disease… [^113ai4wu]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

In the Geisinger Health System replication cohort, PPI use was associated with CKD in all analyses, including a time-varying new-user design. Twice-daily PPI dosing was associated with a higher risk than once-daily dosing. The objective of this study was to quantify the association between PPI use and incident kidney disease in the general population. We hypothesized that PPI use is an independent risk factor for CKD and that the use of Histamine2 receptor antagonists, another common class of medications used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, is not. In the replication cohort, the risk of CKD was also evaluated in once-daily and twice-daily PPI users. Similar analyses were performed for the secondary outcome of AKI.

Absolute risk differences were estimated as the difference between the expected 10-year risk among PPI users and the expected 10-year risk had they not used PPIs. Subgroup analyses were consistent with the primary results. The 10-year estimated absolute risk of CKD among the 322 baseline PPI users was 11. 8% while the expected risk had they not used PPIs was
8. 5%. The observed association persisted when PPI exposure was modeled as a time-varying ever-use variable and was replicated in a separate administrative cohort of 248 751 individuals. The risk was specific to PPI medications because the use of H2 receptor antagonists, which are prescribed for the same indication as PPIs, was not independently associated with CKD. Similar findings were demonstrated for the outcome of AKI and collectively suggest that PPI use is an independent risk factor for CKD and for AKI.

In summary, we found that PPI use is an independent risk factor for CKD and AKI, but H2 antagonist use is not. Further research is required to investigate whether PPI use itself causes kidney damage and, if so, the underlying mechanisms of this association. Correction: This article was corrected on February 29, 2016, to fix a typographical error in Table 2.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^1155UNFy]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

In our study we found that younger individuals were more likely to develop CKD associated with PPI use. This is in contrast to the observation in Sierra's systematic review of AIN who found that AIN due to PPI was more common among older patients. Although older patients are more likely to have multiple comorbidities and the renal interstitium may be more vulnerable to damage due to compromised blood flow, allowing a larger exposure time to the medications, PPI use was associated with increased odds of CKD among younger patients in our study. It is difficult to speculate the mechanism among younger patients. It is possible that the prevalence of CKD among elderly is high with or without PPI, but in the younger population the prevalence of CKD without PPI use is quite low making the prevalence of CKD associated with PPI use more significant. In a similar phenomenon prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidity in dialysis patients is more than 100 times higher in a younger population compared to only 2 times higher at the age of 80 years as compared to the general population. Another potential mechanism by which these medications can lead to CKD is through progressive chronic interstitial nephritis due to magnesium deficiency. Hypomagnesemia has been shown to cause endothelial cell dysfunction, inflammation and oxidative stress. Also, there is evidence of association between hypomagnesemia and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. Pham et al reported that serum magnesium level was significantly associated with the slope of inverse serum creatinine in type 2 diabetic patients with near normal renal function. Sakaguchi et al, in a retrospective cohort study found that hypomagnesemia was significantly associated with progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy but not in those with nondiabetic CKD. Rats fed a magnesium deficient diet have been shown to have higher urine N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase levels, reflecting that magnesium deficiency induces renal interstitial tubular injury. We did not examine the magnesium levels of these patients, thus additional studies are needed to explore any substantial association between PPI induced hypomagnesemia and chronic kidney disease. The precise pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease in patients on proton pump inhibitors needs to be further investigated.

Data extraction

A standardized data extraction spreadsheet form was developed in advance of data collection. Two reviewers extracted study data independently on separate spreadsheets. A third reviewer filled in briefly with extraction when one reviewer was unavailable. Reviewers extracted information on source, study design, population(s), exposure(s), outcome(s), confounders, results, and study limitations using spreadsheet software. Both reviewers examined the extraction spreadsheet forms together and synthesized the extracted data into one master spreadsheet. Any disagreements in data extraction were resolved during consensus or through consultation with a senior reviewer.

### Kidney function decline associated with proton pump inhibitors: results from the ELSA-Brasil cohort [^1179jhHq]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are drugs used for gastric disorders. Because of their low toxicity, they are overprescribed and not always used rationally. Although PPIs are safe, observational studies suggest that PPI use is associated with an increased risk of several adverse health events, including acute kidney injury (AKI), development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

According to the Kidney Disease Improvement Global Outcomes (KDIGO), CKD is characterized by persistent kidney damage (more than three months), usually identified by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or urinary albumin creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g. In developed countries, the estimated prevalence of CKD ranges from 5 to 15%. In Latin America, these data are still scarce, although some studies show an increasing number of people on renal replacement therapy. In a large epidemiological study in Brazil, the prevalence of CKD was estimated at 6.6% (95%CI 6.0–7.4%) among adults. The prevalence of CKD was determined in baseline exams (2008–2010) of the Longitudinal Health Study (ELSA-Brasil) and 8.9% had a glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

### Proton-pump inhibitor vs. H2-receptor blocker use and overall risk of CKD progression [^1163XtUA]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths of this analysis include a diverse population of stage III-V CKD, availability of several confounding factors, and the inclusion of patients with at least 2 PCP visits. By only including patients with at least 2 PCP visits, we ensured continuity of care, medication reconciliation and verification of continued acid-suppression therapy use, and avoided a potential selection bias from loss to follow up. As patients in the PPI group were sicker at baseline, the lack of association between PPI use and increased risk of adverse renal outcomes is less likely to have been influenced by confounding variables.

Our study had several limitations as well. Similar to other observational studies, we were not able to confirm medication compliance or whether or not there was additional PPI use over the counter. The cumulative dose and duration of prescribed PPI could also not be established. Due to this fact, it is possible that patients that were on PPI for more extended periods of time might have been impacted by the medication differently than on-demand users. However, by requiring 2 PCP visits, we were able to partially mitigate this issue by ensuring PPI use was documented at two different points in the study. Incident PPI users were, therefore, not included in the final patient cohort. Another limitation was the retrospective nature of the study, which made it prone to residual confounding. While we included several variables that could affect mortality, we lacked details about nutritional data and albuminuria. Further, our patients have been followed in a health care system and hence these data might not be applicable to the community-dwelling adults with CKD. Finally, though including at least 2 PCP visits as an inclusion criterion helped minimize selection bias, it also reduced our sample size; therefore potentially making our findings less significant.

In summary, the use of PPI in a CKD population was not associated with increased risk of CKD progression compared to the use of H2B and to no acid-suppression therapy. More prospective research is needed to solidify those results and to identify the safety of PPI in CKD populations.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^114hUDxQ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Notably, non-randomized observational studies are subject to the limitations inherent to the databases used. The studies reviewed in this assessment utilized patient databases that were not specifically designed to assess a putative association between PPI and adverse kidney outcomes. In most studies, the potential associations with PPIs were modest and the likelihood of residual confounding was high. In general, confounding bias was assessed as moderate due to the lack of control through study design or analysis methods for all critical confounders of interest, which included age, sex, race, baseline eGFR, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, liver disease, and NSAID use. Furthermore, confounding due to non-prescription OTC use of NSAIDs is also of potential concern as most studies did not account for this potential source of exposure. Importantly, the association between PPI use and adverse kidney outcomes may be confounded by indication in cancer patients who are being treating with nephrotoxic medications [e.g. immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPi)-AKI]. Several studies were also judged as having a moderate risk of selection bias for the reported outcome due to the inclusion of patients with PPI use prior to study initiation. These patients could have experienced events prior to study initiation that would not have been captured.

Although we generally evaluated the intervention and outcome domains as having a low risk of bias, there remains the potential for exposure misclassification arising from OTC use of PPIs and a lack of information on medication adherence. Evaluation of OTC use of medications could be facilitated in part by electronic medical records (EMRs) or by querying patients about such use. Potential outcome misclassification may have arisen in studies that used administrative billing coding in place of laboratory indices of kidney function. It should be noted that some AKI measures were combined with other measures, such as cardiac surgery associated (CSA)-AKI, or included ATN as part of the definition of AKI. Also, studies utilized different definitions of CKD (e.g. < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, > 30% decline in eGFR) or included ESRD as part of major adverse events, which likely contributed to variability in effect estimates observed across studies. Furthermore, most studies collected data retrospectively, which may have contributed to an underestimation of AKI frequency if patients had AKI events managed at hospitals outside of the setting (e.g. health care network). These potential sources of error are likely to have underestimated the effect of PPI on assessed kidney outcomes.

### Kidney function decline associated with proton pump inhibitors: results from the ELSA-Brasil cohort [^112zH2GB]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Investigate the longitudinal association of use and time of use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) with incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney function change.

Methods

Prospective study with 13,909 participants from baseline (2008–2010) and second wave (2012–2014) of the ELSA-Brasil (mean interval between visits = 3.9 years (1.7–6.0)). Participants answered about use and time use of the PPI in the two weeks prior the interview. Renal function was assessed by glomerular filtration rate estimated by the Collaboration Equation for the Epidemiology of Chronic Kidney Disease. Values below 60ml/min/1.73 m² in wave 2 were considered incident CKD. Associations between PPI use and time of use at baseline and incident CKD and decline in renal function were estimated, respectively, by logistic regression and linear models with mixed effects, after adjusting for confounders.

Results

After adjustments, PPI users for more than six months had an increased risk of CKD compared to non-users. Compared to non-users, users PPIs for up to six months and above six months had greater decline in kidney function over time.

Conclusion

This cohort of adults and elderly, after a mean interval of 3.9 years, PPI use and initial duration were associated with kidney function change between visits.

### Proton pump inhibitors augment the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and end-stage renal disease in patients with acute kidney injury after temporary dialysis [^113nzq64]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been reported to increase the risk of acute and chronic renal disease. However, the data are unclear in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring dialysis (AKI-D) who are often candidates for PPIs. To investigate this important issue, we identified 26,052 AKI-D patients from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database weaning from dialysis. During a mean follow-up period of 3.52 years, the PPI users had a higher incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) than the PPI nonusers (P < 0.001). After propensity score matching and treating mortality as a competing risk factor, the PPI users had a higher risk of ESRD (subhazard ratio (sHR) 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.31–1.50) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE, sHR 1.53; 95% CI, 1.37–1.71) compared with the PPI nonusers with AKI-D survivors. In conclusion, the use of PPIs was associated with a higher risk of ESRD and MACE, compared with the PPI nonusers in AKI-D patients who weaned from dialysis.
