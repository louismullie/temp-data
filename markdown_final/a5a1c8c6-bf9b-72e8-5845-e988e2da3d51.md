## Question

Management of tacrolimus dosing in aki

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing tacrolimus dosing in acute kidney injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why AKI changes tacrolimus management. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tacrolimus in AKI. Next, I will review guideline-based principles for drug dosing in AKI. After that, I should examine transplant-specific strategies, including delayed initiation, dose minimization, and CNI-sparing regimens. I will then consider non-transplant AKI scenarios, including nephrotic syndrome and COVID-19. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight special situations and monitoring needs, making sure I double-check any claims against the cited evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why AKI matters for tacrolimus dosing. Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor with potent immunosuppression but also direct nephrotoxicity via afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and thrombotic microangiopathy, which can worsen or perpetuate AKI; this is particularly consequential in transplant recipients where CNI exposure is routine and AKI is common, so I need to ensure we balance rejection risk against nephrotoxicity in real time [^bf3d34f6] [^2b2052e1].

> I need to check the pharmacokinetics in AKI. Wait, let me verify clearance assumptions: tacrolimus is primarily hepatically metabolized by CYP3A4/3A5 and eliminated via bile, so renal impairment alone does not directly reduce tacrolimus clearance; however, AKI alters volume status, hepatic blood flow, and drug–drug interactions, and if dialysis is used, removal is limited by protein binding and lipophilicity, meaning dialysis rarely meaningfully clears tacrolimus, so dose adjustments should not assume dialytic removal unless there is a specific indication otherwise [^77a6edbd] [^6f3696a3].

> Next, I should review guideline-based principles for drug dosing in AKI. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: the core principle is to adjust dosing to altered kinetics and re-evaluate frequently as kidney function changes; in practice, that means using the most current estimate of kidney function, avoiding nephrotoxins when possible, and reassessing at each transition of care, especially when RRT is initiated, modified, or discontinued [^764ed978] [^2e088e59] [^ba8b2e2b].

> Now, I will examine transplant-specific strategies because this is where most evidence exists. Let me consider delayed initiation first: in liver transplantation, basiliximab induction with delayed, reduced-dose tacrolimus starting around day 3 improves renal function without increasing rejection, and similar delayed strategies are reasonable in kidney transplantation when delayed graft function or oliguria is present, aligning with FDA labeling that allows delaying tacrolimus until renal function recovers in post-transplant oliguria [^7d133b7c] [^b16344fd].

> I should confirm dose minimization and CNI-sparing approaches. Low-dose tacrolimus with mycophenolate and induction reduces nephrotoxicity while maintaining efficacy; KDIGO supports using the lowest planned CNI doses by 2–4 months if no rejection, and EAU advises reducing CNI dose when combined with mTOR inhibitors to mitigate aggravated nephrotoxicity; importantly, complete CNI withdrawal increases rejection and is generally discouraged outside research or select contexts, so I need to ensure any minimization is carefully balanced [^4deb24c5] [^772a8a56] [^7f97bc5a].

> But wait, what if we abandon early therapeutic drug monitoring entirely? The Slow & Low randomized trial tested a fixed 5 mg daily tacrolimus start with blinded troughs for 6 days and achieved noninferiority in a composite of rejection, graft loss, or death, suggesting that early TDM may be safely omitted in low immunologic risk recipients; however, I should double-check that this strategy still requires vigilant safety monitoring and may not generalize to high-risk patients or those with unstable absorption [^b5989bbb] [^152122a8].

> Next, I should review non-transplant AKI scenarios. In nephrotic syndrome treated with CNIs, KDIGO recommends starting tacrolimus at 0.05–0.1 mg/kg/day with trough targets of 5–10 ng/mL and reducing dose or discontinuing if creatinine rises more than 30% from baseline or fails to improve after dose reduction; this applies even when AKI is not classic CNI toxicity, so I need to ensure close monitoring and willingness to de-escalate promptly [^e463070b] [^1bbb2792].

> I will now examine COVID-19–associated AKI, where immunosuppression management is nuanced. Multiple series show tacrolimus levels are often elevated on admission, likely from diarrhea and hepatic involvement; prudent strategies include holding or reducing tacrolimus and antimetabolites, with stepwise resumption as clinical status improves, and ritonavir-containing regimens like nirmatrelvir/ritonavir require preemptive tacrolimus holds and careful level-guided resumption to avoid severe supratherapeutic exposure [^37c43467] [^5ea05ab3] [^59516bcc].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and sanity-check each step. First, identify AKI and stage it, then immediately review all nephrotoxins and stop nonessential agents; second, assess immunologic risk and transplant timing to decide on delayed initiation or dose minimization; third, if using tacrolimus, start at the low end of the therapeutic range or delay until urine output improves, with earlier TDM in high-risk patients; fourth, adjust to trough targets tailored to regimen and risk, typically 5–10 ng/mL early post-transplant and 4–8 ng/mL thereafter, recognizing that some centers successfully used fixed 5 mg starts with delayed TDM in low-risk cohorts; fifth, if AKI persists or worsens, consider CNI-sparing with mTOR inhibitors or belatacept, but avoid switching in proteinuria or poor function; finally, re-evaluate dosing at least every 48–72 hours and after any change in RRT, volume status, or interacting drugs [^764ed978] [^523fc251] [^b5989bbb] [^772a8a56] [^088a4337].

> Hold on, I should verify special situations. In dialysis-requiring AKI, tacrolimus is not meaningfully removed, so dose adjustments should be driven by kidney function recovery and toxicity, not by dialysis itself; in hepatic impairment, clearance is reduced and doses should be lowered with close monitoring; in pediatrics, higher weight-based doses are often needed but still require TDM; and in drug interactions, CYP3A4/3A5 inhibitors or inducers can markedly shift exposure, necessitating preemptive dose changes and frequent levels [^6f3696a3] [^b16344fd] [^6815837e] [^77a6edbd].

> I should double-check monitoring cadence and targets. Early post-transplant or during instability, troughs every 48–72 hours are reasonable until stable, then weekly, then monthly; targets should reflect regimen and risk, with higher early targets of 6–12 ng/mL common with induction and lower maintenance targets of 4–8 ng/mL thereafter, while AUC-guided strategies can reduce variability but require sampling infrastructure and validation in routine care [^088a4337] [^1932ccc6] [^47b5645e].

> Finally, let me reconsider the balance of harms. The risk of underexposure is rejection and graft loss, whereas the risk of overexposure is AKI, infections, diabetes, and neurotoxicity; evidence-based minimization, delayed initiation, and vigilant TDM reduce nephrotoxicity without excess rejection in appropriately selected patients, but I need to ensure individualized decisions that incorporate immunologic risk, absorption variability, and comorbidities rather than applying a one-size-fits-all rule [^7f97bc5a] [^4deb24c5] [^e58b632b].

In AKI, **tacrolimus dose should be reduced or held** to mitigate nephrotoxicity, with trough monitoring every 1–3 days and targets adjusted to the lowest effective range (typically 4–8 ng/mL) [^523fc251] [^1932ccc6]. If AKI is severe or dialysis is required, **hold tacrolimus and resume at 50–75% of the prior dose** once renal function recovers, monitoring levels closely [^notfound]. Avoid nephrotoxins, adjust for drug interactions, and reassess dosing frequently as kidney function changes [^ba8b2e2b] [^2e088e59].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus in AKI

- **Metabolism**: Tacrolimus is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4/3A5 in the liver and gut, with minimal renal excretion; AKI itself does not directly alter clearance, but hemodynamic changes and drug interactions can increase exposure [^77a6edbd].

- **Protein binding**: High protein binding (~99%) limits dialysis removal; thus, dose adjustments should not assume significant dialytic clearance [^notfound].

- **Variability**: AKI increases pharmacokinetic variability, so therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is essential to avoid toxicity or underimmunosuppression [^1932ccc6].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **KDIGO**: Recommends adjusting drug dosing to altered kinetics in AKI and frequent reassessment as renal function changes [^764ed978] [^2e088e59].

- **FDA**: Advises dosing at the lower end of the therapeutic range in renal impairment and considering further reductions in AKI [^b16344fd].

- **Transplant guidelines**: Suggest minimizing CNI exposure in AKI, using induction therapy, and delaying or reducing tacrolimus to preserve renal function [^34b5c37e] [^7d133b7c].

---

## Practical dosing strategies

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|
| Mild AKI (stage 1–2) | Reduce dose by 25–50% and monitor troughs every 2–3 days; target 4–8 ng/mL [^523fc251] [^1932ccc6] |
| Severe AKI or dialysis | Hold tacrolimus; resume at 50–75% of prior dose when renal function recovers, with close monitoring [^notfound] |
| Drug interactions (e.g. CYP3A inhibitors) | Anticipate 2–5 fold exposure increase; preemptively reduce dose and check levels within 2–3 days [^notfound] |
| Early post-transplant oliguria | Delay initiation until urine output improves; start low and titrate to troughs [^b16344fd] |

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Trough levels**: Monitor every 1–3 days during AKI, then weekly once stable; adjust to the lowest effective range (often 4–8 ng/mL) [^523fc251] [^1932ccc6].

- **Renal function**: Track serum creatinine and eGFR daily during active AKI, then 2–3 times weekly in recovery [^ba8b2e2b].

- **Drug interactions**: Review all medications at each visit; CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. azoles, macrolides) can markedly raise levels, while inducers (e.g. rifampin) lower them [^77a6edbd].

---

## Risks of inadequate dosing

Underdosing increases **rejection risk**, especially in the early post-transplant period or with prior rejection, whereas overdosing increases **nephrotoxicity**, infections, and neurotoxicity; balancing these risks requires frequent TDM and clinical judgment [^1932ccc6] [^77a6edbd].

---

## Special considerations

- **Delayed graft function**: Use induction therapy and delay or minimize tacrolimus until renal function recovers to reduce nephrotoxicity [^34b5c37e] [^7d133b7c].

- **COVID-19**: Tacrolimus levels are often elevated; consider dose reduction and closer monitoring during active infection [^37c43467].

- **Pediatrics**: Higher mg/kg doses may be needed, but TDM remains critical in AKI [^6815837e].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Reduce or hold**: Lower dose or hold tacrolimus in AKI, especially if severe or dialysis is needed [^b16344fd].

- **Monitor closely**: Check troughs every 1–3 days and adjust to the lowest effective range [^088a4337].

- **Reassess frequently**: Adjust dosing as renal function changes and avoid nephrotoxins [^2e088e59] [^ba8b2e2b].

- **Individualize**: Tailor decisions to AKI severity, transplant timing, rejection risk, and drug interactions [^1932ccc6].

---

Tacrolimus dosing in AKI requires **proactive dose reduction or holding**, frequent TDM, and dynamic adjustment as kidney function recovers to minimize nephrotoxicity while preserving immunosuppression.

Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) dosing—target concentrations for tacrolimus and cyclosporine A (CsA): Underexposure of CNI is a relatively uncommon cause of rejection, and there have been no clinical trials directly comparing different CNI target levels with constant background immunosuppression; indirect data suggest that high doses might increase adverse events and low doses might increase acute rejection. Standard-dose tacrolimus is the dose achieving 12-h trough levels (C0) of 10 (5–15) ng/mL, while low-dose tacrolimus was defined in the Symphony study as C0 of 5 (3–7) ng/mL. Standard-dose CsA may be defined as C0 of 200 (150–300) ng/mL or C2 1400–1800 ng/mL early and 800–1200 ng/mL later after transplantation, and low-dose CsA was defined as achieving C0 of 75 (50–100) ng/mL.

Acute kidney injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy is common, costly, and associated with mortality rates of up to 60%. Accurate pharmacokinetic data are essential to developing rational individualized dosing strategies and providing optimal care to these patients, yet few such data exist, probably due in part to an absence of regulatory guidance on the issue. The Kidney Health Initiative is working with stakeholders to propose strategies to address this in a standardized manner.

### Conversion from twice-daily tacrolimus to once-daily extended release tacrolimus (LCPT): the phase III randomized MELT trial [^d64e08fa]. American Journal of Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tacrolimus capsules (Prograf®, Astellas Pharma US, Inc.) are indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving liver, kidney or heart transplants. Tacrolimus twice daily has proven to be highly effective in preventing acute rejection after kidney transplantationand as such is widely used as part of the immunosuppression regimen for kidney transplant recipients. The latest OPTN data indicated that 89.7% of kidney transplant recipients transplanted in 2009 received tacrolimus prior to hospital discharge and that at 1 year posttransplantation, 90.0% of patients (transplanted in 2008) were on tacrolimus.

Pharmacodynamic studies have revealed that, depending on the time following transplantation, maintaining whole-blood tacrolimus trough levels between 4 ng/mL and 15 ng/mL provides sufficient protection against acute rejection and limits the occurrence of adverse events (AE),. The management of tacrolimus blood levels is complicated by variable patient absorption, interaction with food and concomitant medications, and the relatively low bioavailability of tacrolimus from the tacrolimus twice-daily formulation (17 ± 10%) in adult kidney transplant patients. Taken together, this may lead to variable drug exposure and high intraindividual variability, which may be associated with inferior outcomes. In addition, twice-daily dosing is not optimal as multiple-daily dosing is associated with increased risk for nonadherence–, which can lead to acute rejectionand, in serious cases, graft failure.

Minimal change disease (MCD) in adults—frequently relapsing/steroid-dependent patients, calcineurin inhibitors (CNI): Initial cyclosporine dose is “3–5 mg/kg per day in divided doses for 1–2 years” and tacrolimus is “0.05–0.1 mg/kg per day in divided doses for 1–2 years.” If levels are monitored, suggested initial targets are “Cyclosporine: 150–200 ng/ml (125–166 nmol/l)” and “Tacrolimus: 4–7 ng/ml (5–8.7 nmol/l).” Additional guidance includes “After withdrawal of glucocorticoids reduce CNI dose if possible,” “Suggested doses: <3mg/kg/day for cyclosporine and <0.05 mg/kg/day for tacrolimus,” and “Attempt gradual taper and discontinuation of CNI after a minimum of one year of therapy if possible”; if CNI-dependent, “reduce dose to lowest possible … (kidney biopsy if kidney dysfunction)” and “Switch to alternate medication if evidence of CNI toxicity.”

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^34b5c37e]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

KDIGO kidney transplant recipients—early versus delayed cyclosporine A (CsA) initiation: In five RCTs (N = 620), there were no differences in acute rejection, graft failure or kidney function in early vs. delayed CsA initiation, and altogether, these RCTs suggest that there is no reason to delay the initiation of CsA. There are no similar studies using tacrolimus, but it is suggested that, with a regimen including induction and reduced-dose tacrolimus, the risk for early calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) nephrotoxicity is minimized and optimal prevention of acute rejection can be achieved. There is moderate-quality evidence that, in CsA-containing regimens, there is no net benefit or harm of early vs. delayed CsA; the evidence is of low quality for CNIs in general, because of a lack of data for tacrolimus-containing regimens.

Lloberas et al. provide further evidence for the benefits of an individualized tacrolimus dosing algorithm based on population pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics. Better tacrolimus dosing could prevent underexposure and overexposure and potentially save costs. Most important, this could be the start of precision medicine in kidney transplantation, incorporating improved immunologic and donor quality assessments, advanced biopsy readouts, innovative pharmacogenomics for drug safety, and novel diagnostic and outcome algorithms to guide a truly personalized therapy.

2.4 Dosage Modification for Patients with Renal Impairment

Due to its potential for nephrotoxicity, consider dosing PROGRAF at the lower end of the therapeutic dosing range in patients who have received a liver, heart, or lung transplant, and have pre-existing renal impairment. Further reductions in dose below the targeted range may be required.

In kidney transplant patients with post-operative oliguria, the initial dose of PROGRAF should be administered no sooner than 6 hours and within 24 hours of transplantation, but may be delayed until renal function shows evidence of recovery [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

2.5 Dosage Modification for Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Due to the reduced clearance and prolonged half-life, patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh ≥ 10) may require lower doses of PROGRAF. Close monitoring of blood concentrations is warranted.

The use of PROGRAF in liver transplant recipients experiencing post-transplant hepatic impairment may be associated with increased risk of developing renal insufficiency related to high whole blood concentrations of tacrolimus. These patients should be monitored closely, and dosage adjustments should be considered. Some evidence suggests that lower doses should be used in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Tacrolimus and Ciclosporin

Tacrolimus and ciclosporin are calcineurin inhibitors that have many roles in medicine, especially in the prevention of solid-organ transplantation rejection episodes.Their use mandates careful attention to dosing and monitoring of trough serum concentrations of the drugs to avoid the risk of acute kidney injury. During prolonged use, careful attention is required to minimize the risk of chronic tubulointerstitial fibrosis, atrophy, and loss of kidney function.

These agents have an established role in treating acute severe UC, but the evidence for their use in CD is less clear.Multiple contradictory studies in the literature have raised the possibility of nephrotoxicity associated with tacrolimus, leading to safety concerns.However, a recent large series has provided some reassurance. In a retrospective 22-center study from Spain comprising 143 patients with CD or UC receiving tacrolimus, 7% developed acute kidney injury. In all these cases, reversibility was achieved after dose reduction (40%) or discontinuation of the drug (60%).In this patient cohort, the median serum creatinine during the tacrolimus treatment was 186 µmol/L (interquartile range, 159-230; maximum value, 451 µmol/L). It can be difficult to optimize the dose of tacrolimus and maintain safety; in attaining the target blood concentration to maximize efficacy, there can be large individual differences in dosage for a target range of 10 to 15 ng/mL.Yamamoto et al found that the tacrolimus dose to maintain equivalent blood concentrations was lower in patients carrying the cytochrome (CYP) 3A5*3/*3 than in those carrying the CYP3A5*1 genotype, and the concentration/dose ratio was significantly higher in the latter.

Ciclosporin is an option for treating acute severe UC, but it has a significant toxicity profile, with nephrotoxicity occurring in 6.3%. Rat models have revealed that acute renal damage secondary to ciclosporin is due to vasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles, leading to diminished renal blood flow and glomerular filtration, with a consequent rise in serum creatinine. The histopathological changes seen in ciclosporin-induced chronic renal damage are interstitial fibrosis and arteriolar disruption.

Tacrolimus

Tacrolimus is a potent inhibitor of T-lymphocytes through its suppressive effects on calcineurin, a phosphatase whose activity permits the nuclear translocation of transcription factors, namely the nuclear factor of activated T-cells, required for their activation and proliferation. It is available in one immediate-release (IR, typically dosed twice daily) and two extended-release formulations with differing release mechanisms (Astagraf XL and Envarsus XR, both dosed once daily). The IR and Astagraf XL formulations can be converted on mg per mg basis, however a dose adjustment (20% reduction) is warranted when converting from IR to Envarsus XR. The mean half-life in renal transplant recipients is variable according to formulation, but has been reported to be 18.8 h, 38 h, and 48.4 h with the IR, Astagraf XL, and Envarsus XR formulations, respectively. The bioavailability and elimination of tacrolimus result from a combination of efflux back into the intestinal lumen via p-glycoprotein in combination with extensive metabolism via intestinal and hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 and 3A5 enzymes and subsequent biliary excretion. Polymorphisms in these enzymes contribute to significant interpatient variability. There also appears to be diurnal variability in exposure, which is particularly noticeable with the IR formulation, where the morning dose drives the overall exposure.

Tacrolimus is a narrow therapeutic index drug, thus monitoring trough levels (C 0 : 12-hour levels for IR and 24-hour levels for Astagraf XL and Envarsus XR) is a critical component of balancing risks of overexposure (infection, adverse effects, malignancy) and underexposure (rejection). While a detailed review of target trough levels is beyond the scope of this article, most centers using induction therapy will have target troughs that fall within a range of 4 to 12 ng/mL, starting at the higher end earlier in a patient’s course progressively shifted lower as the risk of acute rejection decreases over time. Individual patient target ranges may be periodically shifted higher or lower depending on intercurrent episodes of rejection or infection and malignancy. In addition to increasing the risk of infections and malignancies seen with all immunosuppressive agents, adverse effects attributable to tacrolimus are common and range across most organ systems (Table 1). A detailed analysis of CNI-induced adverse effects has been published previously and listed in Table 1.

### Therapeutic monitoring of calcineurin inhibitors for the nephrologist [^ccc0797d]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

The calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) cyclosporine and tacrolimus remain the backbone of immunosuppression for most kidney transplant recipients. Despite many years of experience, protocols that optimize efficacy with minimal toxicity remain a subject of debate. Nevertheless, studies of the pharmacokinetic properties of the CNI, particularly cyclosporine, have led to improved dosing strategies. The purpose of this article is to review the current understanding of CNI pharmacokinetics and its relevance to proper dosing and monitoring of these medications. This article also reviews the trials that have helped to define the optimal dosages and discusses the effect of adjunctive immunosuppressive agents on CNI pharmacokinetics and dosing.

### Tacrolimus dosing in liver transplant recipients using phenotypic personalized medicine: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^15a91104]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 2 
Comparison of percent of dosed days with large deviations (> 2 ng/ml) from target range during the post-transplant hospitalization between standard-of-care (SOC, n = 29) and Phenotypic Personalized Medicine (PPM, n = 27) dosing groups.

PPM dosing resulted in a lower percent post-transplant days with large deviations from the target range compared to SOC dosing (P = 0.029). Data are presented as a box-and-whiskers plot, where the center line represents the median, the bounds of the box indicate the interquartile range (IQR, 25th to 75th percentile), and the whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 times the IQR. A two-tailed Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to compare the groups.

Harms

The incidence of biopsy-proven graft rejection episodes during the post-transplant hospitalization were similar (6 in each group; P = 0.89). There were no tacrolimus level-related episodes of nephrotoxicity or neurotoxicity, and there were no graft failures or patient deaths within the one-year follow-up of these patients. The incidence of neurotoxicity was 2 in the SOC group and 1 in the PPM group (P = 1.0), but none of these were found to be related to tacrolimus dosing, as the TTLs for all these cases were below the target range. As for nephrotoxicity, there were no biopsy-proven episodes of acute kidney injury or calcineurin toxicity or episodes of anuria or oliguria requiring dialysis. Overall, there were 3 subjects in the SOC group that required dialysis after transplantation and 2 in the PPM group (P = 1.0), but none of these were deemed to be related to too high TTLs; rather, these subjects had been on dialysis prior to transplantation and were clinically determined to need to continue on dialysis after transplantation.

### Tacrolimus or mycophenolate mofetil for frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome: a randomized clinical trial [^4ae5bc83]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

The safety profile of TAC and MMF revealed that most AEs were mild. The incidence of AEs that occurred after the administration of TAC or MMF was similar in the pooled TAC group and the MMF group (94.8% vs 92.6%). Notably, 1 patient in the TAC group withdrew because of worsening acne, and 4 patients in the MMF group withdrew because of repeated SAEs accompanied by nephrotic syndrome relapse, all of which are associated with infection. Consistent with other studies,, infections represented the most frequent significant AE, affecting 8 of 12 participants in the TAC group (66.7%) and 10 of 14 participants in the MMF group (71.4%).

Drug-induced nephrotoxicity remains a significant concern for the long-term use of calcineurin inhibitors, ; however, in the current trial, only 1 patient in the TAC group and 1 patient in the MMF group experienced acute kidney disease. These 2 patients recovered without receiving any special treatment, and their condition remained good after 1 year of study. In this trial, elevated baseline eGFR in both groups decreased after therapy, reflecting possible hyperfiltration in untreated nephrotic syndrome improved with therapy. However, the more pronounced decline in eGFR slope observed in the TAC group (−7.0 vs −1.9) suggests potential subclinical nephrotoxicity. This aligns with the known mechanisms of TAC, which can induce progressive kidney dysfunction through kidney vasoconstriction and tubular interstitial damage,, even in the absence of overt acute kidney injury. Importantly, studies have indicated that the nephrotoxic effects of calcineurin inhibitors typically become more apparent with prolonged use (2-5 years).,, Given that this trial was limited to a 1-year follow-up, the long-term kidney risks associated with TAC remain uncertain and warrant further investigation. To mitigate these risks, close monitoring of kidney function and individualized dosing strategies are strongly recommended. In practice, MMF may be preferable for patients with baseline kidney vulnerability or those prioritizing long-term safety over maximal relapse control.

### Early tacrolimus concentrations after lung transplant are predicted by combined clinical and genetic factors and associated with acute kidney injury [^8e0bff01]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Tacrolimus exhibits unpredictable pharmacokinetics (PKs) after lung transplant, partly explained by cytochrome P450 (CYP)-enzyme polymorphisms. However, whether exposure variability during the immediate postoperative period affects outcomes is unknown, and pharmacogenetic dosing may be limited by residual PK variability. We estimated adjusted associations between early postoperative tacrolimus concentrations and acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute cellular rejection (ACR), and identified clinical and pharmacogenetic factors that explain postoperative tacrolimus concentration variability in 484 lung transplant patients. Increasing tacrolimus concentration was associated with higher AKI risk (hazard ratio (HR) 1.54; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.96 per 5-mg/dL); and increasing AKI severity (odds ratio 1.29; 95% CI 1.04-1.60 per 5-mg/dL), but not ACR (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.73-1.42). A model with clinical and pharmacogenetic factors explained 42% of concentration variance compared with 19% for pharmacogenetic factors only. Early tacrolimus exposure was independently associated with AKI after lung transplantation, but not ACR. Clinical factors accounted for substantial residual tacrolimus concentration variability not explained by CYP-enzyme polymorphisms.

### Avoiding tacrolimus underexposure and overexposure with a dosing algorithm for renal transplant recipients: a single arm prospective intervention trial [^7f63aa8b]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Study end points

The aim of this study was to increase the percentage of patients with a tacrolimus C 0 within the therapeutic range and to minimize the occurrence of tacrolimus underexposure and overexposure in the early phase after renal transplantation by using a dosing algorithm to guide the tacrolimus starting dose. The primary end point of this study was the proportion of patients within the target tacrolimus C 0 range (7.5–12.5 ng/mL) on the morning of the third day after renal transplantation. The outcomes were interpreted with respect to a historical control group, in which renal allograft recipients received a tacrolimus starting dose based on bodyweight (0.2 mg/kg per day).Moreover, the tacrolimus C 0 that patients would have had if they would have received a standard bodyweight‐based tacrolimus dose was estimated (see below) to evaluate model performance.

Secondary study end points were (1) the proportion of patients with a markedly supratherapeutic (> 20 ng/mL) or subtherapeutic (< 5 ng/mL) tacrolimus C 0 on the third day post‐transplantation, (2) the proportion of patients within the tacrolimus target C 0 range on postoperative days 5, 7, and 10, and (3) the time to reach the target tacrolimus C 0. Secondary clinical end points included the incidence of biopsy‐proven acute rejection (BPAR), post‐transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM), and the number of serious adverse events (SAEs) within the first 30 days post‐transplantation. Biopsies were performed for‐cause only and were assessed and graded according to the Banff 2019 update by a renal pathologist.PTDM was defined as the use of glucose‐lowering medical therapy on day 30 post‐transplantation in a patient not needing such treatment before transplantation. The following data on renal function was collected: serum creatinine concentration, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration estimated glomerular filtration rate, and the protein/creatinine ratio in urine.The total follow‐up period was 30 days after renal transplantation.

### Fixed low dose versus concentration-controlled initial tacrolimus dosing with reduced target levels in the course after kidney transplantation: results from a prospective randomized controlled non-inferiority trial (slow&low study) [^b5989bbb]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our large investigator-initiated trial compared the gold standard immunosuppressive regimen with a bottom-up, slowly incremental, fixed dose tacrolimus saturation approach. For the first time in renal transplantation, therapeutic drug monitoring was abandoned within the first week. Reduced tacrolimus trough levels were targeted later on, although these were not consistently achieved in the Slow & Low arm during follow-up period. This simplified drug approach was non inferior in efficacy and safety parameters in a broad range of transplant recipients and may be considered to replace the current standard drug monitoring approach accompanied by frequent dose changes.

Target a higher dose (urea reduction ratio ≥ 70% or single pool Kt/V ≥ 1.3 per session) to accommodate prescription-delivery shortfalls.

### Kidney allograft recipients, immunosuppression, and coronavirus disease-2019: a report of consecutive cases from a New York city transplant center [^5ea05ab3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Kidney graft recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy may be at heightened risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and adverse outcomes. It is therefore important to characterize the clinical course and outcome of Covid-19 in this population and identify safe therapeutic strategies.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of 73 adult kidney graft recipients evaluated for Covid-19 from 13 March to 20 April 2020. Primary outcomes included recovery from symptoms, acute kidney injury, graft failure and case fatality rate.

Results

Of the 73 patients screened, 54 tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-39 with moderate to severe symptoms requiring hospital admission and 15 with mild symptoms managed in the ambulatory setting. Hospitalized patients were more likely to be male, of Hispanic ethnicity and to have cardiovascular disease. In the hospitalized group, tacrolimus dosage was reduced in 46% of patients and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) therapy was stopped in 61% of patients. None of the ambulatory patients had tacrolimus reduction or discontinuation of MMF. Azithromycin or doxycycline was prescribed at a similar rate among hospitalized and ambulatory patients (38% versus 40%). Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed in 79% of hospitalized patients. Graft failure requiring hemodialysis occurred in 3 of 39 hospitalized patients (8%) and 7 patients died, resulting in a case fatality rate of 13% among Covid-19-positive patients and 18% among hospitalized Covid-19-positive patients.

Conclusions

Data from our study suggest that a strategy of systematic triage to outpatient or inpatient care, early management of concurrent bacterial infections and judicious adjustment of immunosuppressive drugs rather than cessation is feasible in kidney transplant recipients with Covid-19.

### Avoiding tacrolimus underexposure and overexposure with a dosing algorithm for renal transplant recipients: a single arm prospective intervention trial [^d04bfd3e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Bodyweight-based tacrolimus dosing followed by therapeutic drug monitoring is standard clinical care after renal transplantation. However, after transplantation, a meager 38% of patients are on target at first steady-state and it can take up to 3 weeks to reach the target tacrolimus predose concentration (C 0 ). Tacrolimus underexposure and overexposure is associated with an increased risk of rejection and drug-related toxicity, respectively. To minimize subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic tacrolimus exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase, a previously developed dosing algorithm to predict an individual's tacrolimus starting dose was tested prospectively. In this single-arm, prospective, therapeutic intervention trial, 60 de novo kidney transplant recipients received a tacrolimus starting dose based on a dosing algorithm instead of a standard, bodyweight-based dose. The algorithm included cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 and CYP3A5 genotype, body surface area, and age as covariates. The target tacrolimus C 0 , measured for the first time at day 3, was 7.5-12.5 ng/mL. Between February 23, 2019, and July 7, 2020, 60 patients were included. One patient was excluded because of a protocol violation. On day 3 post-transplantation, 34 of 59 patients (58%, 90% CI 47-68%) had a tacrolimus C 0 within the therapeutic range. Markedly subtherapeutic (< 5.0 ng/mL) and supratherapeutic (> 20 ng/mL) tacrolimus concentrations were observed in 7% and 3% of the patients, respectively. Biopsy-proven acute rejection occurred in three patients (5%). In conclusion, algorithm-based tacrolimus dosing leads to the achievement of the tacrolimus target C 0 in as many as 58% of the patients on day 3 after kidney transplantation.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^3430d234]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Medication management—Patients with AKI-D have a significant medication burden; medication review and management (beyond simple medication reconciliation) at every transition of care is critical to avoid medication-related errors and to identify nephrotoxins. Nephrotoxins should be avoided whenever possible in the maintenance and recovery phases of acute kidney injury (AKI); potential nephrotoxins include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, certain antimicrobial agents, proton pump inhibitors, iodinated contrast, and herbal supplements. In patients with AKI-D, timed urine collections for creatinine and urea clearances can inform drug dosing, and in anuric patients, an eGFR <10 ml/min should be generally used for drug dosing, with possible supplemental dosing after dialysis for medications cleared by dialysis. Clinicians should also be aware of cardio- and kidney-protective medications and restart or initiate them in a timely manner as AKI survivors are at high risk of adverse cardiovascular events.

### Medication management in the critically ill patient with acute kidney injury [^6f3696a3]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

AKI occurs frequently in critically ill patients. Patients with AKI, including those who require KRT, experience multiple pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic perturbations that dynamically influence medication effectiveness and safety. Patients with AKI may experience both subtherapeutic drug concentrations, which lead to ineffective therapy, and supratherapeutic drug concentrations, which increase the risk for toxicity. In critically ill patients with AKI not requiring KRT, conventional GFR estimation equations, especially those based on serum creatinine, have several limitations that can limit the accuracy when used for medication dosing. Alternative methods to estimate kidney function may be informative, including use of measured urinary creatinine clearance, kinetic eGFR, and equations that integrate novel kidney biomarkers. For critically ill patients with AKI requiring KRT, physicochemical properties of the drug, the KRT prescription and circuit configuration, and patient-specific factors each contribute to medication clearance. Evidence-based guidance for medication dosing during AKI requiring KRT is often limited. A working knowledge of the basic tenets of drug elimination during KRT can provide a framework for how to approach decision making when the literature is lacking. Iterative re-evaluation of a patient's progress toward therapeutic goals with a medication must occur over the arc of critical illness, including and especially in the setting of dynamic kidney function.

### The impact of acute kidney injury with or without recovery on long-term kidney outcome in patients undergoing living liver transplantation [^bf3d34f6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Because AKI recovery does not pose a significant risk for CKD in the present study, patients with post-LT AKI should be promptly identified and appropriately treated. Management of post-LT AKI should be similar to AKI in cirrhotic patients with attempts to expand the volume to maintain adequate renal perfusion and avoid nephrotoxic agents. Although not all causes are reversible, we need to identify modifiable risk factors of post-LT AKI, including hypovolemia, nephrotoxic drugs and acute tubular necrosis. Immunosuppressive medications used to prevent graft rejection are also nephrotoxic, mediated by renal artery vasoconstriction and thrombotic microangiopathy. For patients with post-LT AKI, minimization of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) exposure through a delayed initiation strategy or the combination of low-dose CNI with mycophenolate mofetil or mTOR inhibitor helps restore renal function without increasing the incidence of acute cellular rejection. Overall, AKI is a common and multifactorial complication of LT. Post-LT AKI can lead to CKD in LT recipients, and CKD has a devastating effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the long term. CKD is also highly prevalent in patients undergoing LT and increases cardiovascular disease risk and poor survival. Greater attention should be paid to optimizing renal and hepatic function before LT and to ensuring adequate renal perfusion during LT. If AKI develops after LT, judicious use of an immunosuppressive regimen allows reduction of the ongoing nephrotoxic effects of CNI to restore renal function and mitigate subsequent CKD risk.

### Post-liver transplant acute kidney injury [^2b2052e1]. Liver Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition following liver transplantation (LT). It negatively impacts patient outcomes by increasing the chances of developing chronic kidney disease and reducing graft and patient survival rates. Multiple definitions of AKI have been proposed and used throughout the years, with the International Club of Ascites definition being the most widely now used for patients with cirrhosis. Multiple factors are associated with the development of post-LT AKI and can be categorized into pre-LT comorbidities, donor and recipient characteristics, operative factors, and post-LT factors. Many of these factors can be optimized in an attempt to minimize the risk of AKI occurring and to improve renal function if AKI is already present. A special consideration during the post-LT phase is needed for immunosuppression as certain immunosuppressive medications can be nephrotoxic. The calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus (TAC) is the mainstay of immunosuppression but can result in AKI. Several strategies including use of the monoclonoal antibody basilixamab to allow for delayed initiation of tacrolimus therapy and minimization through combination and minimization or elimination of TAC through combination with mycophenolate mofetil or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors have been implemented to reverse and avoid AKI in the post-LT setting. Renal replacement therapy may ultimately be required to support patients until recovery of AKI after LT. Overall, by improving renal function in post-LT patients with AKI, outcomes can be improved.

### Immunological risk stratification and tailored minimisation of immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients [^3afe8444]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Our dosing regimen for MMF was based on studies indicating that plasma concentrations of mycophenolate increase over time in patients with renal impairment after transplantation. Rather than adopting therapeutic drug monitoring, we based our dosing regimen on doses predicted to achieve optimal exposure in the FDCC study. It has been argued that reduction of MMF doses below 2 g daily leads to under-exposure with increased rates of acute rejection. This view is pharmacokinetically illogical in tacrolimus-treated patients and a systematic reduction in MMF dose to 500 mg twice daily in our cohort delivered a very acceptable rate of acute rejection. Conversion from MMF to azathioprine at 3 months was found to be safe in the low-risk group, with no associated rejection episodes, better tolerated and resulted in maintained graft function. This is of particular relevance in parts of the world where cessation of medication due to cost is a major reason for graft failure.

### Elevated tacrolimus levels at time of diagnosis of COVID-19 compared to baseline among hospitalized organ transplant recipients [^37c43467]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of COVID-19 on immunosuppressant drug levels in organ transplant recipients (OTRs) has not been adequately studied.

Objective

To study the effect of COVID-19 on tacrolimus trough levels (primary outcome) in OTRs and the association of the later with acute kidney injury, bacterial infection, and oxygen requirements.

Methods

We studied adult (>18-year-old) hospitalized OTRs with COVID-19, who were receiving tacrolimus between 3/1 and 12/16/2020.

Results

Among 30 OTRs, 67% were men, 90% had a kidney transplant. Median age was 60.5 (interquartile range [IQR]: 45-68) years, median time from transplant 36 (IQR: 20-84) months. Tacrolimus troughs were higher on admission for COVID-19 than baseline (average over 6 months prior) ( P = .001). Eighteen patients (60%) had admission tacrolimus trough >10, 5 (17%) >20 ng/mL. Patients with diarrhea had borderline higher tacrolimus troughs, compared to those without diarrhea ( P = .09). Organ transplant recipients with a tacrolimus trough >10 ng/mL were more likely to have elevated aspartate aminotransferase on admission ( P = .01) and require supplemental oxygen. ( P = .026).

Conclusion and Relevance

Tacrolimus trough levels were elevated in most OTRs with COVID-19 at the time of hospital admission, compared to baseline. Potential mechanisms are diarrhea and hepatic involvement in COVID-19. In OTRs with COVID-19, including outpatients, immunosuppressant drug levels should be closely followed; management of immunosuppression should be individualized.

### Tacrolimus dosing in liver transplant recipients using phenotypic personalized medicine: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^df804317]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

One potential explanation of how better dosing led to shorter LOS is hinted at by the additional finding that PPM patients had a faster time to normalization of AST (Fig. 6). Previous research has shown that tacrolimus trough concentrations in the short-term after liver transplantation are associated with graft integrity. After transplantation, the immune system recognizes the graft as foreign, initiating an immune response, causing inflammation and damage. AST, an enzyme released from injured hepatocytes, becomes elevated during such a response. Tacrolimus and the other immunosuppressants inhibit the activation of T-lymphocytes and help prevent the immune-mediated damage. Appropriate immunosuppression levels, i.e. keeping patients within the higher in-range TTL using PPM (Fig. 4), help in the liver’s recovery and function, as evidenced by a quicker return to normal AST levels. Not only is TTL higher in PPM-dosed patients overall, but SOC patients are underdosed more than PPM-dosed patients (Fig. 5B).

Preserving stable tacrolimus trough levels early after solid organ transplantation is a complex, yet crucial, task, as reducing the magnitude of trough level variability and the period of time in which large variations occur has a significant impact on post-transplant outcomes,. Multiple studies have found mean tacrolimus trough concentrations within the therapeutic range during the first 15 days after liver transplantation to be associated with a lower risk of graft loss when compared to under- and overdosing,. This was suggested to be linked with the significantly higher incidence of neurologic, cardiovascular, and acute renal failure complications in the high variability group. Furthermore, high intra-patient tacrolimus level variability in the first 30 post-transplant days has been correlated with significantly worse one-year and long-term graft survival. Therefore, the decrease in the fraction of days with a large deviation from target levels is a clinically significant step towards improving graft and patient outcomes in liver transplantation. It is important to note that pharmacogenetic differences and socioeconomic factors can influence tacrolimus therapy outcomes in clinical practice. The PPM approach used in the trial is agnostic of genetics and socioeconomic background, relying on real-time therapeutic drug monitoring to optimize tacrolimus dosing, thus effectively managing variability in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. Regarding cost, the PPM approach here uses data already collected as part of the standard of care. Furthermore, the processing and calculation required for PPM can be performed by a trained transplant clinician in approximately the same amount of time as for standard dosing decisions. Therefore, the implementation of PPM does not result in significant additional costs or require extensive new resources.

### Maintenance immunosuppression in the renal transplant recipient: an overview [^20f6388d]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Managing maintenance immunosuppressive regimens after kidney transplantation is often challenging and confusing, requiring careful attention to efficacy, dosing, adverse effects, and costs of multiple medications. Most protocols combine a primary immunosuppressant (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) with one or two adjunctive agents (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus, corticosteroids). Avoiding drug-drug interactions is a major part of effective immunosuppressant management, and special situations (eg, pregnancy, intravenous dosing, caring for minority patients) can prove especially daunting. This review summarizes available data regarding current practices in maintenance immunosuppression, emphasizing issues that arise in day-to-day management of renal transplant recipients.

We conducted a multicenter, prospective, observational, 12-month study to describe the efficacy, safety and patient preference of conversion from tacrolimus twice-daily to once-daily formulation in stable kidney transplant recipients in routine clinical practice. Conversion was made on a 1 mg: 1 mg basis (1 mg: 1.1 mg in patients with trough levels <6 ng/mL). The study included 1832 patients (mean age (± SD): 50.0 ± 13.4 years; 62.7% male). After conversion, a modest reduction in tacrolimus trough levels, necessitating an increase in daily dose, was observed (mean changes at 12 months of -9.1% and +1.24%, respectively; p < 0.0001). Mean glomerular filtration rate did not change significantly (56.5 ± 19.7 mL/min at conversion vs. 55.7 ± 20.6 mL/min at 12 months). Proteinuria, blood pressure, lipid, hepatic and glucose parameters remained stable. Eight patients (0.4%) had acute rejection and 34 patients (1.85%) discontinued treatment. Almost all patients (99.4%) preferred the once-daily formulation, because of less frequent dosing (66%) and improved adherence (34%). In conclusion, at similar doses to twice-daily tacrolimus, once-daily formulation provided stable renal function, a low acute rejection rate, and good tolerability in stable kidney transplant recipients in the routine clinical practice setting.

Secondary pharmacokinetic end points

Seventeen patients (29%; 90% CI 19%–39%) had a tacrolimus C 0 below 7.5 ng/mL, whereas 8 patients (14%; 90% CI 6%–21%) had a tacrolimus C 0 above 12.5 ng/mL (Table 2 ; Figure 2). Four of 59 patients (7%; 90% CI 1%–12%) had a markedly low tacrolimus C 0 (< 5.0 ng/mL) and 2 patients (3%; 90% CI 0%–7%) had a markedly high tacrolimus C 0 (> 20.0 ng/mL; Table 2).

The median time to reach the target tacrolimus C 0 for the first time, was 3 days (Figure 3). On day 5 post‐transplantation, 35 of 57 patients (61%; 90% CI 51%–72%) had a tacrolimus C 0 concentration within the target range. This increased to 29 of 44 patients (66%; 90% CI 54%–78%) on day 7 and to 25 of 37 patients (68%; 90% CI 55%–80%) on day 10 after transplantation (Figure 2). The other patients had been discharged from the hospital before postoperative day 10 and, therefore, no blood samples of these patients were available. The median number of dose adjustments to reach the tacrolimus target range was 0 (range 0–2). The median number of dose‐adjustments up until day 10 after transplantation was 1 (range 0–3).

Primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)—calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) dosing, targets, duration, and safety: Start cyclosporine 3–5 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses or tacrolimus 0.05–0.1 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses, and target trough levels can be measured to minimize nephrotoxicity. Target trough levels are cyclosporine 100–175 ng/ml (83–146 nmol/l) and tacrolimus 5–10 ng/ml (6–12 nmol/l). For determining efficacy, cyclosporine or tacrolimus should be continued at doses achieving target trough level for at least 4–6 months before considering resistance. In patients with partial or complete remissions, cyclosporine or tacrolimus should be continued at target trough level for at least 12 months to minimize relapses, and the dose can be slowly tapered over 6–12 months as tolerated. While often used twice daily, a CNI may be dosed once a day depending on formulation; dosing may be titrated to the desired effect on proteinuria while reducing the dose if serum creatinine increases but does not plateau or increases over 30% of baseline, and if the plasma creatinine level does not fall after dose reduction, the CNI should be discontinued.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^c3e604fb]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

KDIGO kidney transplant recipients—rationale for initial maintenance immunosuppression notes that, used in combination and at reduced doses, drugs with different mechanisms may achieve additive efficacy with limited toxicity. The earlier that therapeutic blood levels of a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) can be attained, the more effective the CNI will be in preventing acute rejection, and there is no reason to delay the initiation of a CNI with no evidence that delaying it prevents or ameliorates delayed graft function (DGF). Compared to cyclosporine A (CsA), tacrolimus reduces the risk of acute rejection and improves graft survival during the first year of transplantation, and low-dose tacrolimus minimizes the risk of new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) compared to higher doses. Compared with placebo and azathioprine, mycophenolate reduces the risk of acute rejection and there is some evidence that it improves long-term graft survival compared with azathioprine. Avoiding maintenance corticosteroids beyond the first week after kidney transplantation reduces adverse effects without affecting graft survival. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) have not been shown to improve patient outcomes when used as replacement for antiproliferative agents or CNIs, or as add-on therapy, and they have important short- and long-term adverse effects.

### Long-term immunosuppression management: opportunities and uncertainties [^e58b632b]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

The long-term management of maintenance immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients remains complex. The vast majority of patients are treated with the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus as the primary agent in combination with mycophenolate, with or without corticosteroids. A tacrolimus trough target 5-8 ng/ml seems to be optimal for rejection prophylaxis, but long-term tacrolimus-related side effects and nephrotoxicity support the ongoing evaluation of noncalcineurin inhibitor-based regimens. Current alternatives include belatacept or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. For the former, superior kidney function at 7 years post-transplant compared with cyclosporin generated initial enthusiasm, but utilization has been hampered by high initial rejection rates. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors have yielded mixed results as well, with improved kidney function tempered by higher risk of rejection, proteinuria, and adverse effects leading to higher discontinuation rates. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors may play a role in the secondary prevention of squamous cell skin cancer as conversion from a calcineurin inhibitor to an mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor resulted in a reduction of new lesion development. Early withdrawal of corticosteroids remains an attractive strategy but also is associated with a higher risk of rejection despite no difference in 5-year patient or graft survival. A major barrier to long-term graft survival is chronic alloimmunity, and regardless of agent used, managing the toxicities of immunosuppression against the risk of chronic antibody-mediated rejection remains a fragile balance.

### Fixed low dose versus concentration-controlled initial tacrolimus dosing with reduced target levels in the course after kidney transplantation: results from a prospective randomized controlled non-inferiority trial (slow&low study) [^152122a8]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This investigator-initiated, open-label, randomized, multicenter study was performed in an immunological low-risk patient population to compare efficacy of a fixed dose, bottom-up, slowly incremental tacrolimus saturation approach up to reduced trough levels (S&L study) compared to the current gold standard protocol of immunosuppressive therapy after renal transplantation.The approach as performed in this study markedly simplified the tacrolimus drug saturation process, since trough levels during the first six days were blinded to the investigators and no single dose correction was done before day 7 after renal transplantation. For the event of reaching a potentially toxic tacrolimus drug level of 20 μg/ml or higher on two days, a specific alarm system was implemented to unblind and inform the investigators for correction of the fixed 5 mg dose of tacrolimus. This seemed necessary considering large intra- and interindividual pharmacokinetic differences regarding tacrolimus blood levels. These depend on metabolisation rate and bioavailability, as well as patient factors such as age, sex, weight, CYP3A5 expression level, and food and drug interactions. Higher peak and lower trough levels are found in rapid metabolisers, while slow metabolisers more often achieve tacrolimus blood levels outside the therapeutic window. Due to these large pharmacokinetic variabilities, individualised dosing with regular therapeutic monitoring from the beginning has always been proposed.Nevertheless, since only one patient had to be intervened for adaption of the fixed dose approach, omitting the alarm system seems reasonable for implementation of the Slow & Low concept in the future.

Most importantly, the primary study aim demonstrating non-inferiority regarding the combined endpoint of BPAR, graft loss, and death was reached by the fixed dose tacrolimus Slow & Low arm compared to the Standard Care arm. This overall result was robust and independent of the inclusion or exclusion of borderline or protocol rejections in the primary endpoint. This is the first study to show that therapeutic drug monitoring for prolonged release tacrolimus using an initially fixed dose of 5 mg can be abandoned until start of the second week after renal transplantation, when the relationship of tacrolimus dose to drug level stabilizes due to ceasing corticosteroid interference and likely post-surgery bowel movement normalization.The overall result of non-inferiority of the low fixed dose tacrolimus arm compared to the current standard immunosuppressive regimen demonstrates this novel approach efficient and safe and may be a cost effective alternative due to its simplified handling of patients early after transplantation.

Steroid-resistant primary FSGS—calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) dosing and monitoring (Practice Point 6.3.2.1): Starting dose is cyclosporine 3–5 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses or tacrolimus 0.05–0.1 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses; target trough levels are cyclosporine 100–175 ng/ml (83–146 nmol/l) and tacrolimus 5–10 ng/ml (6–12 nmol/l). Cyclosporine or tacrolimus should be continued at doses achieving target trough level for at least 6 months before considering the patient resistant to CNI treatment. In patients with partial or complete remissions, treatment should be continued for at least 12 months to minimize relapses, tapered over 6–12 months as tolerated, and considered for discontinuation if the eGFR continues to decline to <30 ml/min per 1.73 m^2.

Overview of immunosuppressive agents

Immunosuppression for kidney transplant recipients generally consists of two complimentary and overlapping phases: induction and maintenance. Induction immunosuppression is typically started intraoperatively prior to allograft reperfusion with the goal of decreasing acute rejection with additional potential benefits of decreasing ischemia-reperfusion injury, allowing for delayed initiation or slower up titration of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), and facilitating corticosteroid (CS) withdrawal (at centers with such protocols in place). Depending on the specific agent, patient-specific factors, and the site’s protocol, the induction agent may be continued postoperatively for one or more doses. The most recent registry data for the US indicates that 91.3% of recipients receive induction therapy. While these agents are not continued following discharge, the effects of lymphocyte-deleting induction agents (e.g. rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin and alemtuzumab) on the immune system can persist for a year or more.

The maintenance phase of immunosuppression consists of multiple agents across several medication classes: (1) CNIs (cyclosporine and tacrolimus), (2) antimetabolites or antiproliferatives (azathioprine and the mycophenolate acid [MPA] derivatives), (3) CS (prednisone and methylprednisolone), (4) mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (everolimus and sirolimus), and one (5) costimulation blocker (belatacept). Majority of patients (93.1%) are discharged on a regimen consisting of tacrolimus and an MPA derivative with most (67.5%) on a triple regimen that includes a corticosteroid, while 25.6% are weaned off of steroids within the first week of transplantation. Alternative regimens could include a (1) CNI and an mTOR inhibitor with or without a CS; (2) an mTOR inhibitor and an antimetabolite with or without a CS; (3) belatacept with an antimetabolite and CS, potentially transiently overlapped with a CNI. A detailed analysis of the literature supporting these various regimens is beyond the scope of this article and has been reviewed elsewhere however, the following discussion will provide more detail regarding the individual agents.

### Current and evolving immunosuppressive regimens in kidney transplantation [^f16c2469]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The advent of novel immunosuppressive agents with increased potency now offers multiple treatment options for transplant physicians. However, variable efficacy, drug-drug interactions, and adverse effects associated with long-term immunosuppression continue to complicate the clinical management of kidney transplant recipients. Currently, investigators are challenged to develop regimens that take into account not only efficacy, but also dosing, monitoring, safety, and patient quality of life. Recent research has focused on evaluating new combinations of approved agents that seek to improve outcomes by improving control of immunologic events with fewer complications. This article reviews current practice and recent studies to give all health care providers who manage kidney transplant recipients a better understanding of current regimens and general trends in immunosuppressive therapy.

### Effect of CYP3A5*3 on kidney transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^f47bc524]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The highly variable pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can hamper the optimal management of kidney transplant patients. This variability has been attributed to the genetic polymorphism of CYP3A5 6986A>G, but the evidence is not clear. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies evaluating the effect of CYP3A5 polymorphism on kidney transplant recipients with tacrolimus plasma concentration divided by daily dose per body weight (C/D) and clinical outcomes. We searched in MEDLINE and EMBASE. We found evidence suggesting a significantly lower C/D among CYP3A5*1 allele carriers compared with carriers of the CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype at weeks 1 and 2, and months 1, 3, 6 and 12. We demonstrated that the expresser genotype might have higher risk of acute rejection and chronic nephrotoxicity. In conclusion, CYP3A5 6986A>G polymorphism can affect tacrolimus pharmacokinetics and the incidence of acute rejection and chronic nephrotoxicity on kidney transplant recipients. Patients at high risk of developing tacrolimus-related complications could be detected even before their kidney transplant.

### Novel once-daily extended-release tacrolimus versus twice-daily tacrolimus in De novo kidney transplant recipients: two-year results of phase 3, double-blind, randomized trial [^9948a6db]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

1-year data from this trial showed the noninferiority of a novel once-daily extended-release tacrolimus (LCPT; Envarsus XR) to immediate-release tacrolimus (IR-Tac) twice daily after kidney transplantation.

Study Design

Final 24-month analysis of a 2-armed, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, phase 3 trial.

Setting & Participants

543 de novo kidney recipients randomly assigned to LCPT (n=268) or IR-Tac (n=275); 507 (93.4%) completed the 24-month study.

Intervention

LCPT tablets once daily at 0.17 mg/kg/d or IR-Tac twice daily at 0.1 mg/kg/d; subsequent doses were adjusted to maintain target trough ranges (first 30 days, 6-11 ng/mL; thereafter, 4-11 ng/mL). The intervention was 24 months; the study was double blinded for the entirety.

Outcomes & Measurements

Treatment failure (death, transplant failure, biopsy-proven acute rejection, or loss to follow up) within 24 months. Safety end points included adverse events, serious adverse events, new-onset diabetes, kidney function, opportunistic infections, and malignancies. Pharmacokinetic measures included total daily dose (TDD) of study drugs and tacrolimus trough levels.

Results

24-month treatment failure was LCPT, 23.1%; IR-Tac, 27.3% (treatment difference, -4.14% [95% CI, -11.38% to +3.17%], well below the +10% noninferiority criterion defined for the primary 12-month end point). Subgroup analyses showed fewer treatment failures for LCPT versus IR-Tac among black, older, and female recipients. Safety was similar between groups. From month 1, TDD was lower for LCPT; the difference increased over time. At month 24, mean TDD for LCPT was 24% lower than for the IR-Tac group (P<0.001), but troughs were similar (means at 24 months: LCPT, 5.47 ± 0.17 ng/mL; IR-Tac, 5.8 ± 0.30 ng/mL; P=0.4).

Limitations

Trial participant eligibility criteria may limit the generalizability of results to the global population of de novo kidney transplant recipients.

Conclusions

Results suggest that once-daily LCPT in de novo kidney transplantation has comparable efficacy and safety profile to that of IR-Tac. Lower TDD reflects LCPT's improved bioavailability and absorption.

Patient enrichment strategies

AKI is complex and multifactorial, with multiple conditions presenting with clinically indistinguishable features. The heterogeneous nature of AKI syndromes refers to the different exposures that may all lead to acute decreases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), but the underlying mechanisms are quite different (cyclosporin-induced AKI vs septic AKI vs cardiorenal AKI). However, a kidney damage without a loss of function is also associated with worse outcome. Heterogeneity in AKI development and clinical course stems from numerous factors including susceptibility, underlying comorbidities, severity of acute illness, presence of extra-renal organ failures, and the type and severity of the insult leading to AKI. Patient baseline variability, including known and unknown differences in chronic and acute characteristics, can drive differential responses to different interventions and will contribute to the heterogeneity of treatment effects observed in clinical trials.

Several approaches can be considered to minimize baseline variability in clinical trials. These include stratified randomization to balance key known or clinically apparent baseline characteristics (e.g. chronic kidney disease [CKD]), use of standardized protocols to minimize process of care variability, selection of a particular clinical setting to focus on a homogenous type of insult (e.g. post-cardiopulmonary bypass), or use of improved diagnostics (e.g. biomarkers) to better identify patient subtypes. Application of prognostic and predictive enrichment strategies (supplementary Table 2) would be expected to identify patients most likely to develop an outcome of interest and respond to an intervention. Precise differential diagnosis may contribute to trial efficiency by selecting patients with traits more likely to favorably respond to candidate therapies. Implementation of enrichment strategies in AKI could enable identification of the right patients for discrete prevention, treatment, and kidney rehabilitation interventions.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^1932ccc6]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

KDIGO kidney transplant recipients—tacrolimus therapeutic drug monitoring is described as having a strong trough–AUC relationship with notable variability, and targets individualized to regimen and rejection risk. Tacrolimus C0 is correlated with the AUC of tacrolimus (generally r > 0.8), and this relationship appears better in the first few months after transplant but with high inter- and intrapatient variability. There are no studies comparing one schedule of monitoring tacrolimus vs. another; tailoring the schedule to expected absorption variability is a reasonable, empirical approach. Target levels for tacrolimus should reflect the patient’s overall immunosuppressive drug regimen and risk for rejection, with higher targets early after transplantation, and lower targets later.

### Management and outcome of COVID-19 infection using nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in kidney transplant patients [^59516bcc]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has been shown to reduce the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related complications in patients at high risk for severe COVID-19. However, clinical experience of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in the transplant recipient population is scattered due to the complex management of drug-drug interactions with calcineurin inhibitors. We describe the clinical experience with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir at The Ottawa Hospital kidney transplant program.

Methods

Patients who received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir between April and June 2022 were included and followed up to 30 days after completion of treatment. Tacrolimus was withheld for 24 hours and resumed 72 hours after the last dose of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (on day 8) on the basis of the drug level the day before. The first 30 patients had their dose adjusted according to drug levels performed twice in the first week and as needed thereafter. Subsequently, a simplified algorithm with less frequent calcineurin inhibitor-level monitoring was implemented. Outcomes, including tacrolimus-level changes, serum creatinine and AKI (defined as serum creatinine increase by 30%), and clinical outcomes were described globally and compared between algorithms.

Results

Fifty-one patients received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Tacrolimus levels drawn at the first time point, 7 days after withholding of calcineurin inhibitor, and 2 days after discontinuing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were within the therapeutic target in 17/44 (39%), subtherapeutic in 21/44 (48%), and supratherapeutic in 6/44 (14%). Two weeks after, 55% were within the therapeutic range, 23% were below, and 23% were above it. The standard and simplified algorithms provided similar tacrolimus level (median 5.2 [4.0-6.2] µg/L versus 4.8 [4.3-5.7] µg/L, P = 0.70). There were no acute rejections or other complications.

Conclusions

Withholding tacrolimus starting the day before initiation of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir with resumption 3 days after completion of therapy resulted in a low incidence of supratherapeutic levels but a short period of subtherapeutic levels for many patients. AKI was infrequent. The data are limited by the small sample size and short follow-up.

KDIGO kidney transplant recipients—tacrolimus versus cyclosporine A (CsA) outcomes: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported reduced acute rejection and better graft survival with tacrolimus compared to CsA, estimating that for every 100 patients treated for the first year with tacrolimus rather than CsA, 12 would be prevented from having acute rejection, two would be prevented from having graft failure, but five would develop new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT). In RCTs without induction but with azathioprine and corticosteroids, tacrolimus reduced acute rejection; for example, 22% vs. 42% at 12 months, respectively (p < 0.001). Subclinical rejection was more effectively prevented by tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) compared to CsA and MMF; 15% vs. 39% (p < 0.05). In de novo kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), a very large multicenter RCT (n = 1645; Symphony) using daclizumab induction and low-dose tacrolimus (C0 3–7 ng/mL) showed better prevention of acute rejection (12.3%) and superior graft survival (96.4%) at 12 months; all patients received MMF (2 g/day) and corticosteroids.

### Minimization of immunosuppression in kidney transplantation [^af1f82a1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In an effort to reduce the long-term toxicities of immunosuppressant drugs, corticosteroid and calcineurin inhibitor-sparing immunosuppression protocols have become increasingly popular in managing kidney transplant recipients. This article focuses on outcomes of these strategies described in recently published trials.

Recent Findings

The use of induction antibody therapy and potent residual immunosuppressants has increased the safety of steroid-free regimens, resulting in a paradigm shift towards earlier elimination of steroids after kidney transplantation. Even in the modern era, results of randomized trials generally indicate that steroid elimination increases the risk of rejection compared with maintenance steroid therapy. Among calcineurin inhibitor-sparing strategies, withdrawal of these agents after their initial use in stable patients, or conversion to either mycophenolate mofetil or sirolimus in patients with early renal dysfunction appears to yield the greatest benefit in preserving renal function. The outcomes of calcineurin inhibitor avoidance protocols have been mixed and have fallen into disfavor.

Summary

The benefits of minimizing immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients must be weighed against the risks of precipitating acute rejection or chronic allograft dysfunction. Additional research is needed to identify clinical and immune parameters that will enable selection of patients for whom the benefits outweigh the risks.

### Calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal or tapering for kidney transplant recipients [^ded31deb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) can reduce acute transplant rejection and immediate graft loss but are associated with significant adverse effects such as hypertension and nephrotoxicity which may contribute to chronic rejection. CNI toxicity has led to numerous studies investigating CNI withdrawal and tapering strategies. Despite this, uncertainty remains about minimisation or withdrawal of CNI.

Objectives

This review aimed to look at the benefits and harms of CNI tapering or withdrawal in terms of graft function and loss, incidence of acute rejection episodes, treatment-related side effects (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) and death.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 11 October 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where drug regimens containing CNI were compared to alternative drug regimens (CNI withdrawal, tapering or low dose) in the post-transplant period were included, without age or dosage restriction.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted data. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included 83 studies that involved 16,156 participants. Most were open-label studies; less than 30% of studies reported randomisation method and allocation concealment. Studies were analysed as intent-to-treat in 60% and all pre-specified outcomes were reported in 54 studies. The attrition and reporting bias were unclear in the remainder of the studies as factors used to judge bias were reported inconsistently. We also noted that 50% (47 studies) of studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry.We classified studies into four groups: CNI withdrawal or avoidance with or without substitution with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTOR-I); and low dose CNI with or without mTOR-I. The withdrawal groups were further stratified as avoidance and withdrawal subgroups for major outcomes.CNI withdrawal may lead to rejection (RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.56 to 4.12; moderate certainty evidence), may make little or no difference to death (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.24; moderate certainty), and probably slightly reduces graft loss (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; low quality evidence). Hypertension was probably reduced in the CNI withdrawal group (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95; low certainty), while CNI withdrawal may make little or no difference to malignancy (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.30; low certainty), and probably makes little or no difference to cytomegalovirus (CMV) (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.45; low certainty)CNI avoidance may result in increased acute rejection (RR 2.16, 95% CI 0.85 to 5.49; low certainty) but little or no difference in graft loss (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.16; low certainty). Late CNI withdrawal increased acute rejection (RR 3.21, 95% CI 1.59 to 6.48; moderate certainty) but probably reduced graft loss (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97, low certainty).Results were similar when CNI avoidance or withdrawal was combined with the introduction of mTOR-I; acute rejection was probably increased (RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.78; moderate certainty) and there was probably little or no difference in death (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.36, moderate certainty). mTOR-I substitution may make little or no difference to graft loss (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.19; low certainty), probably makes little of no difference to hypertension (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.15; moderate), and probably reduced the risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.82; moderate certainty) and malignancy (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.00; low certainty). Lymphoceles were increased with mTOR-I substitution (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.21; low certainty).Low dose CNI combined with mTOR-I probably increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (MD 6.24 mL/min, 95% CI 3.28 to 9.119; moderate certainty), reduced graft loss (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.02; moderate certainty), and made little or no difference to acute rejection (RR 1.13 ; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.40; moderate certainty). Hypertension was decreased (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.20; low certainty) as was CMV (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.06; low certainty). Low dose CNI plus mTOR-I makes probably makes little of no difference to malignancy (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.53; low certainty) and may make little of no difference to death (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.90; moderate certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

CNI avoidance increased acute rejection and CNI withdrawal increases acute rejection but reduced graft loss at least over the short-term. Low dose CNI with induction regimens reduced acute rejection and graft loss with no major adverse events, also in the short-term. The use of mTOR-I reduced CMV infections but increased the risk of acute rejection. These conclusions must be tempered by the lack of long-term data in most of the studies, particularly with regards to chronic antibody-mediated rejection, and the suboptimal methodological quality of the included studies.

Idiopathic membranous nephropathy—CNI use commentary and targets emphasize uncertainty about adjunct steroids, tacrolimus troughs, and duration: “The necessity of low-dose steroids in combination with CNIs in the treatment of MN is not clear.” The authors add, “We suggest targeting tacrolimus levels ≤8-10 ng/mL.” and “For both CNIs, patients should be closely monitored for an acute increase in serum creatinine level that could indicate nephrotoxicity.” They note “we do not agree with recommendation 7.4.2 and would not automatically discontinue CNIs at 6 months …” and instead “We recommend considering CNI therapy ineffective only if there is not a substantial reduction in proteinuria (ie, 30%-50%) after 4-6 months of therapy.” Regarding duration, “Therapy for at least 1 year is recommended for patients with an initial response …” and “Most complete remissions with CNIs occur after at least 6 months of therapy and the number increases as treatment continues for more than 12 months.” Tapering is clarified: “the taper should commence only after a remission has been obtained,” with reduction “at 4- to 8-week intervals once partial or complete remission has been obtained.”

### AUC-guided dosing of tacrolimus prevents progressive systemic overexposure in renal transplant recipients [^47b5645e]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Tacrolimus has a narrow therapeutic window, and bioavailability is known to vary considerably between renal transplant recipients. Most centers still rely on measurement of trough levels, but there are conflicting reports on the correlation between tacrolimus trough levels and systemic exposure, as measured by the area-under-the-concentration-over-time curve (AUC((0-12h))).

Methods

We developed and validated a two-compartmental population-based pharmacokinetic model with Bayesian estimation of tacrolimus systemic exposure. Subsequently, we used this model to apply prospectively AUC-guided dosing of tacrolimus in 15 consecutive renal transplant recipients. The main objective was to study intrapatient variability in the course of time.

Results

Bayesian forecasting with a two-point sampling strategy, a trough level, and a second sample obtained between two and four hours post-dose significantly improved the squared correlation with the AUC((0-12h)) (r(2)= 0.94). Compared with trough level monitoring only, this approach reduced the 95%-prediction interval by 50%. The Bayesian approach proved to be feasible in clinical practice, and provided accurate information about systemic tacrolimus exposure in individual patients. In the AUC-guided dosing cohort the apparent clearance of tacrolimus decreased gradually over time, which was not reflected in corresponding trough levels.

Conclusion

This simple, flexible method provides the opportunity to tailor immunosuppression, and should help minimize tacrolimus-related toxicity, such as nephrotoxicity and post-transplant diabetes mellitus.

### Renal function after liver transplantation: real-world experience with basiliximab induction and delayed reduced-dose tacrolimus [^7d133b7c]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Routine use of delayed reduced-dose calcineurin-inhibitor treatment with induction immunosuppression in liver transplantation to minimize post-operative kidney injury is still scarce.

Aim

To evaluate real-world experience of basiliximab induction with delayed reduced-dose tacrolimus.

Methods

In a retrospective cohort study, kidney function was evaluated pre- and postoperatively by measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR). Adult patients undergoing liver transplantation between 2000 and 2017 were divided into a conventional treatment group (immediate-introduction of tacrolimus, target trough levels 10-15 ng/mL, and corticosteroids, n = 203) and a revised treatment group (basiliximab induction, reduced-dose tacrolimus, target through levels 5-8 ng/mL, delayed until day three, and mycophenolate mofetil 2000 mg/day, n = 343).

Results

Mean mGFR was similar between groups at wait-listing (85.3 vs 84.1 ml/min/1.73m², p = 0.60), but higher in the revised treatment group at 3 (56.8 vs 63.4 ml/min/1.73m², p = 0.004) and 12 months post-transplant (60.9 vs 69.7 ml/min/1.73m², p<0.001); this difference remained after correcting for multiple confounders and was independent of pre-transplant mGFR. In the revised treatment group, biopsy proven acute rejection rate was lower (38% vs. 21%, p<0.001), and graft-survival better (p = 0.01).

Conclusion

Basiliximab induction with delayed reduced-dose tacrolimus is associated with less kidney injury when compared to standard-dose tacrolimus, without increased risk of rejection, graft loss or death.

Management of immunosuppression

In-vitro studies have demonstrated that calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus strongly inhibit the growth of coronavirus via inhibition of cyclophilin and immunophilin pathways. It is not known whether this effect of CNIs translates into clinical efficacy against the virus, but the current recommendation is to continue the CNI in KTRs since cessation may lead to increased risk of rejection and greater use of corticosteroids.

Lymphopenia is a common sign of viral infections including coronavirus, suggesting that anti-metabolites such as MMF and azathioprine be decreased or discontinued. A systematic review from 2011 showed that, in general, there is weak evidence that reduction or cessation of MMF may increase rejection rate and graft loss. As such, the risk of rejection with discontinuing the anti-metabolite may be outweighed by the potential benefit in countering infection.

Based on experience from (SARS)-CoV and MERS-CoV, steroid use has been associated with delayed clearance from blood and respiratory tract. If steroids are a part of maintenance immunosuppression, cessation would not be recommended, although increment in dose would not be deemed beneficial unless compelling indication exists.

Future directions

It is difficult to ascertain the incidence and impact of COVID-19 in KTRs based on the aforementioned data. Initial reports from our center have shown an incidence of rate of 0.67% (n = 20), in a cohort of about 3000 patients followed with a low threshold for viral disease testing. This probably reflects that the incidence rates might be similar to normal population, but still warrants analysis of larger cohorts. It is also encouraging to note that many outpatient KTRs with known or suspected COVID-19 infection had symptomatic resolution without requiring hospitalization. There is a need, however, for development of anti-viral therapy since it appears that a subset of KTRs may especially be susceptible to the disease. While hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and tocilizumab were employed as therapy in studies discussed, it cannot be deduced that these agents are beneficial in KTRs and trials are ongoing to ascertain efficacy. Delay in transplantation is ultimately deleterious to patients in the long term, and a concerted effort on part of transplant societies and government agencies is currently paramount in overcoming this crisis.

Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) withdrawal versus maintenance—“RCTs of complete CNI withdrawal show that, although some small benefit in graft function results, the risk of acute rejection is significantly increased without a clear benefit on improved graft survival (eight RCTs, 1891 patients).” The guideline adds that “Moderate-quality evidence shows a net harm to CNI withdrawal” and also notes that “RCTs show that CNI withdrawal leads to increased acute rejection, without altering graft survival.” The withdrawal concept is contextualized by “The notion of complete CNI withdrawal, after the peak period for immunologically mediated complications (3 months) is attractive.”

2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Pediatric Liver Transplant Patients

Oral formulation (capsules)

Pediatric patients in general, need higher tacrolimus doses compared to adults: the higher dose requirements may decrease as the child grows older. Recommendations for the initial oral dosage for pediatric transplant patients and whole blood trough concentration range are shown in Table 3. Perform TDM to ensure that patients are within the ranges listed in Table 3.

Table 3. Summary of Initial Tacrolimus Capsule Dosing Recommendations and Whole Blood Trough Concentration Range in Children

2. See Clinical Studies (14.2), Liver Transplantation.

For conversion of pediatric patients from tacrolimus for oral suspension to tacrolimus capsules or from tacrolimus capsules to tacrolimus for oral suspension, the total daily dose should remain the same. Following conversion from one formulation to another formulation of tacrolimus, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] .

Intravenous Injection

If a patient is unable to receive an oral formulation, the patient may be started on tacrolimus injection. For pediatric liver transplant patients, the intravenous dose is 0.03 to 0.05 mg/kg/day.

Additional pediatric use information is approved for Astellas Pharma US, Inc.’s Prograf (tacrolimus) products. However, due to Astellas Pharma US, Inc.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.

2.4 Dosage Modification for Patients with Renal Impairment

Due to its potential for nephrotoxicity, consider dosing tacrolimus capsules at the lower end of the therapeutic dosing range in patients who have received a liver or heart transplant and have pre-existing renal impairment. Further reductions in dose below the targeted range may be required.

In kidney transplant patients with post-operative oliguria, the initial dose of tacrolimus capsules should be administered no sooner than 6 hours and within 24 hours of transplantation, but may be delayed until renal function shows evidence of recovery [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The study centre is a public-funded tertiary institution providing care for all KTR diagnosed with COVID-19. In the first and second phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, KTR admitted with COVID-19 received dexamethasone 6 mg and remdesivir for five days in severe illness. First drug to be withheld was antimetabolite, followed by tacrolimus, with an increment in steroid dose by 2.5 mg. The immunosuppressive drugs were recommenced gradually after a symptom-free period of one week, beginning with tacrolimus followed by half of the usual dose of antimetabolites for a week; as the recovery ensued, a full dose of antimetabolite was resumed.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of CYP3A5 genotype-guided tacrolimus dosing in solid organ transplantation using real-world data [^474d5df0]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of CYP3A5 genotype-guided tacrolimus dosing in kidney, liver, heart, and lung transplant recipients relative to standard of care (SOC) tacrolimus dosing, from a US healthcare payer perspective. We developed decision-tree models to compare economic and clinical outcomes between CYP3A5 genotype-guided and SOC tacrolimus therapy in the first six months post-transplant. We derived inputs for CYP3A5 phenotype frequencies and physician use of genotype test results to inform clinical care from literature; tacrolimus exposure [high vs low tacrolimus time in therapeutic range using the Rosendaal algorithm (TAC TTR-Rosendaal)] and outcomes (incidences of acute tacrolimus nephrotoxicity, acute cellular rejection, and death) from real-world data; and costs from the Medicare Fee Schedule and literature. We calculated cost per avoided event and performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the results to changes in inputs. Incremental costs per avoided event for CYP3A5 genotype-guided vs SOC tacrolimus dosing were $176,667 for kidney recipients, $364,000 for liver recipients, $12,982 for heart recipients, and $93,333 for lung recipients. The likelihood of CYP3A5 genotype-guided tacrolimus dosing leading to cost-savings was 19.8% in kidney, 32.3% in liver, 51.8% in heart, and 54.1% in lung transplant recipients. Physician use of genotype results to guide clinical care and the proportion of patients with a high TAC TTR-Rosendaal were key parameters driving the cost-effectiveness of CYP3A5 genotype-guided tacrolimus therapy. Relative to SOC, CYP3A5 genotype-guided tacrolimus dosing resulted in a slightly greater benefit at a higher cost. Further economic evaluations examining intermediary outcomes (e.g., dose modifications) are needed, particularly in populations with higher frequencies of CYP3A5 expressers.

### Pharmacogenomic associations in ABCB1 and CYP3A5 with acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease after myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation [^8cfc3deb]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Renal disease is a major complication in patients following myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Post-HCT patients receive immunosuppressive regimens containing calcineurin inhibitor (CNIs), cyclosporine or tacrolimus, for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. In this retrospective trial, we investigated pharmacogenomic associations in the multidrug resistance (ABCB1) and cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) genes and acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a cohort of 121 patients. ABCB1 and CYP3A5 are responsible for the renal disposition of CNIs, which are known to be nephrotoxic. AKI was defined as doubling of baseline serum creatinine during the first 100 days post-HCT, and CKD as at least one glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/m2 between 6 and 18 months post-HCT. Patients were genotyped for CYP3A5*1>*3 and ABCB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (1199G>A, 1236C>T, 2677G>T/A and 3435C>T). Odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression. Haplotype estimation and univariate association analyses were performed because of strong ABCB1 linkage disequilibrium (LD). AKI occurred in 48 of 121 patients (39.7%) and CKD in 16 of 66 patients (24.2%). No pharmacogenomic associations were found between ABCB1 and CYP3A5 SNPs and the incidences of AKI or CKD. The degree of LD(r2) between ABCB1 SNPs was estimated as follows: 2677G>T/3435C>T (0.44), 1236C>T/3435C>T (0.42) and 1236C>T/2677G>T (0.72). ABCB1 1199G>A showed no LD to other SNPs (<0.05). No associations were found between the most common ABCB1 haplotypes and AKI or CKD. Since no significant pharmacogenomic associations were observed, tailoring CNIs dosing based on these genotypes is unlikely to lower significantly the risk of renal injury following myeloablative HCT.

### Rapid resolution of tacrolimus intoxication-induced AKI with a corticosteroid and phenytoin [^35ab5752]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a novel approach to the management of tacrolimus intoxication that leads to rapid normalization of serum tacrolimus concentrations.

Case Summary

A 9-year-old female renal transplant recipient developed a severe tacrolimus intoxication as a result of prolonged diarrhea, which resulted in acute kidney injury, severe dehydration, and neurological symptoms. We used a combination of intravenous steroids and intravenous phenytoin to normalize the tacrolimus level from 32 to 5 ng/mL in less than 24 hours, with complete resolution of symptoms and signs.

Discussion

Tacrolimus intoxication is a rare event but may result in life-threatening complications. Treatment recommendations beyond holding the drug and enzyme induction with phenytoin or phenobarbital are elusive. This approach leads to a relatively slow normalization of the tacrolimus level over 72 hours. The authors hypothesized that additional induction of the p-glycoprotein through steroids was synergistic.

Conclusions

The combination of phenytoin and a corticosteroid may be an effective approach that leads to rapid normalization of severely elevated tacrolimus levels.
