## Question

A Patient with breast cancer would you them on hormonal therapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with breast cancer should be placed on hormonal therapy, and if so, which regimen and duration fit best. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the tumor's hormone receptor status because that determines whether endocrine therapy is indicated. Then, I should verify the patient's menopausal status since that dictates the choice of agent. Next, I will assess disease stage and risk features to decide on standard versus extended duration. After that, I need to consider special populations such as premenopausal women, older adults, and men. Finally, I should review side effects, adherence, and how to handle menopausal symptom management without systemic estrogen, and close with a concise recommendation plan anchored in guidelines and evidence [^1129q98C] [^114NivtP] [^114WFgQ9].

> Let me first confirm the foundational determinant: hormone receptor status. If the tumor is estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor positive, adjuvant endocrine therapy is indicated; if hormone receptor negative, endocrine therapy is not beneficial and should not be used, so I need to ensure accurate pathology reporting of ER/PR before proceeding [^1129q98C] [^114NivtP]. Wait, I should double-check the threshold: any nuclear staining ≥ 1% is considered HR-positive, though the magnitude of benefit correlates with ER expression level, and very low ER (1–10%) may behave more like ER-negative disease in some contexts, which should temper expectations and prompt individualized discussion [^1178paRx] [^115XUEfP].

> Next, I should review menopausal status because it drives drug selection. For premenopausal patients, tamoxifen is standard; ovarian function suppression can be added in higher-risk settings, whereas for postmenopausal patients, an aromatase inhibitor (AI) is generally preferred, with tamoxifen as an alternative if AI is contraindicated or not tolerated [^114WFgQ9] [^114NivtP]. Hold on, I should verify sequencing options: ASCO and NCCN support either AI monotherapy for 5 years or a tamoxifen-to-AI switch strategy to complete 5–10 total years, with the switch typically after 2–3 or 5 years of tamoxifen depending on risk and tolerance [^116VVPAx] [^112JnaCT].

> I will now examine standard duration. The base case is 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy, which reduces recurrence by about 47% and mortality by about one-third in ER-positive disease; extending therapy beyond 5 years is reserved for those with sufficient residual risk and tolerance, and should not exceed a total of 10 years [^115AK6NM] [^114v8Muy]. Wait, let me verify the absolute benefits of extension: extended AI reduces recurrence and contralateral cancers but has not consistently improved overall survival, so decisions should weigh modest absolute gains against ongoing toxicities in shared decision-making [^112QqrQq] [^114R7199].

> For node-positive disease, I should confirm that extended therapy is recommended. ASCO advises offering extended AI-based therapy for up to a total of 10 years for node-positive, HR-positive patients, given the higher risk of late recurrence and the reduction in second breast cancers with extended AI, while acknowledging no proven OS benefit to date [^112XN5zM] [^114R7199]. Let me reconsider exceptions: even with limited nodal involvement (1–2 nodes), some patients may reasonably forego extension after individualized risk–benefit discussion, which underscores the need for shared decision-making and prognostic tools like CTS5 to estimate late recurrence risk [^112QG5wk] [^117KCZQQ].

> For node-negative disease, I should confirm that extension is individualized. Many node-negative patients may be offered extended AI therapy based on established risk factors, but those with low-risk node-negative tumors should not routinely receive extended therapy; tools such as Breast Cancer Index and CTS5 can refine late-recurrence risk and guide the discussion [^116yJDU9] [^112UXWGB] [^117KCZQQ]. Hold on, I should verify that patient values strongly influence this choice; indeed, worry about recurrence and side-effect burden materially sway decisions to extend, reinforcing the centrality of patient preference in this space [^1116Jqwg].

> Now, premenopausal-specific considerations. Standard is 5 years of tamoxifen, with extension to 10 years if the patient remains premenopausal or if menopausal status is indeterminate; ovarian function suppression can be added for higher-risk disease, but I need to ensure we discuss substantial adverse effects and the lack of definitive comparative data versus 10 years of tamoxifen alone in some settings [^114WFgQ9] [^112BiWNV]. Wait, I should verify the adherence challenge in younger women; nonadherence to tamoxifen is common and linked to worse outcomes, so proactive side-effect management and supportive interventions are critical to realize benefit [^117CLZm5].

> For postmenopausal patients, let me think about sequencing and duration. Options include AI monotherapy for 5 years, or tamoxifen for 2–3 or 5 years followed by AI to complete 5–10 total years; extended AI beyond 5 years is reasonable for those with residual risk and good tolerance, with the understanding that the absolute risk reductions are modest and toxicity, especially bone effects, must be weighed carefully [^116VVPAx] [^112QqrQq]. I should confirm that switching strategies are acceptable after tamoxifen intolerance and that tamoxifen remains appropriate for those who cannot take AIs, including up to 10 total years in selected cases [^111q4DV5] [^112JnaCT].

> Special populations deserve attention. In older adults with favorable-risk, early-stage HR-positive disease, de-escalation to endocrine therapy alone or even omission of endocrine therapy in select cases may be reasonable after discussing competing risks and patient preferences; this requires nuanced shared decision-making and attention to frailty and comorbidity [^112JrmDY]. For men with HR-positive breast cancer, tamoxifen for 5 years is standard, with extension to 10 years for high-risk, tolerant patients, and GnRH analog plus AI if tamoxifen is contraindicated; I should confirm that management otherwise parallels female algorithms in advanced disease [^114Q6wEp] [^111BMsS4].

> I need to ensure we address side effects and adherence because they directly impact outcomes. Hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, musculoskeletal symptoms, and bone loss are common; counseling, dose interruptions, switching agents, and supportive measures can mitigate toxicity and improve persistence, which is crucial since nonadherence increases recurrence risk [^116wcqeQ] [^117CLZm5]. Hold on, I should verify that minor nonadherence during extended therapy may have limited clinical consequence in some trials, but sustained underuse is harmful, so maintaining engagement is key [^112RbLfs] [^117CLZm5].

> But wait, what about menopausal symptom management during or after endocrine therapy. Systemic menopausal hormone therapy is generally contraindicated after HR-positive breast cancer because it can promote tumor growth; instead, prioritize nonhormonal options for vasomotor symptoms and consider local vaginal estrogen only after careful oncologic consultation and shared decision-making, especially in AI-treated patients where systemic estrogen exposure conflicts with treatment goals [^113iHpim] [^1156dK5a]. I should double-check that contemporary menopause guidelines align with this cautious, individualized approach and emphasize lowest-risk local regimens when absolutely necessary [^1173otbM] [^114gS8rC] [^111rBVwU].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation. If the tumor is HR-positive, I would recommend adjuvant endocrine therapy for essentially all patients regardless of age, with the regimen tailored to menopausal status and risk: tamoxifen for 5 years in premenopausal patients with consideration of ovarian suppression in higher-risk settings and extension to 10 years if premenopausal or if status is indeterminate; in postmenopausal patients, an AI for 5 years or a tamoxifen-to-AI sequence to complete 5–10 years, with extension favored in node-positive disease and individualized in higher-risk node-negative disease; for HR-negative disease, I would not offer endocrine therapy, and I would integrate chemotherapy and targeted therapies per subtype and stage [^114WFgQ9] [^114NivtP] [^1129q98C]. I should confirm that all duration decisions include a shared decision-making conversation about absolute benefits, toxicity, and patient values, potentially aided by tools like CTS5 and Breast Cancer Index when available [^112QqrQq] [^117KCZQQ] [^112UXWGB].

---

In general, **offer hormonal therapy** to patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, as it significantly reduces recurrence and improves survival [^115AK6NM]. Do not use hormonal therapy for **HR-negative tumors**, as it is ineffective [^1129q98C]. Therapy selection depends on menopausal status: tamoxifen for premenopausal patients [^114WFgQ9]; tamoxifen, an aromatase inhibitor (AI), or a sequence for postmenopausal patients [^114NivtP] [^112JnaCT]. Extended therapy (up to 10 years) is considered for higher-risk patients after shared decision-making about benefits and side effects [^112QqrQq] [^112xpj5K]. Monitor for and manage side effects to maintain adherence and optimize outcomes [^116wcqeQ] [^117CLZm5].

---

## Indications for hormonal therapy

Hormonal therapy is indicated for patients with **HR+ breast cancer**, characterized by the presence of estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) [^1129q98C]. HR+ tumors account for approximately 70% of all breast cancers [^114rXmjQ]. Hormonal therapy is not effective for **HR-negative tumors** and should not be administered [^1129q98C].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from ASCO, NCCN, and ESMO provide clear recommendations on the use of hormonal therapy in breast cancer:

- **Premenopausal patients**: Tamoxifen is the standard of care [^114WFgQ9]. Ovarian suppression (gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists) may be considered in high-risk patients [^notfound].

- **Postmenopausal patients**: Options include tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane, or a sequence of tamoxifen followed by an AI [^114NivtP] [^112JnaCT].

- **Extended therapy**: For patients at higher risk of recurrence, extended hormonal therapy (up to 10 years) may be recommended after shared decision-making [^112QqrQq] [^1137qqiX].

---

## Benefits of hormonal therapy

Hormonal therapy provides significant clinical benefits, including:

- **Reduction in recurrence**: Hormonal therapy significantly reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence [^115AK6NM].

- **Improvement in survival**: Hormonal therapy improves overall survival, particularly in HR+ patients [^115AK6NM].

- **Prevention of contralateral breast cancer**: Hormonal therapy reduces the risk of developing new breast cancers in the contralateral breast [^112QqrQq].

---

## Risks and side effects

While hormonal therapy is generally well tolerated, it is associated with potential risks and side effects:

- **Tamoxifen**: Increased risk of endometrial cancer, thromboembolic events, hot flashes, and mood changes [^notfound].

- **Aromatase inhibitors**: Joint and muscle pain, osteoporosis, cardiovascular events, and menopausal symptoms [^1137qqiX].

- **Ovarian suppression**: Menopausal symptoms, bone density loss, and potential impact on fertility [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision-making

Several patient-specific factors must be considered when deciding on hormonal therapy:

- **Menopausal status**: Determines the choice of hormonal therapy agents [^114WFgQ9].

- **Tumor characteristics**: Tumor size, grade, lymph node involvement, and biomarkers such as Ki-67 influence the decision [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Pre-existing conditions may contraindicate certain hormonal therapies [^116wcqeQ].

- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential, considering patient values, quality of life, and potential side effects [^114NgDjP].

---

## Alternative treatments and complementary therapies

For patients who cannot tolerate hormonal therapy or have contraindications, **alternative treatments and complementary therapies** may be considered:

- **Chemotherapy**: Recommended for HR-negative tumors or aggressive HR+ tumors [^1163R2F9].

- **Targeted therapies**: CDK4/6 inhibitors (e.g. palbociclib, ribociclib) may be combined with hormonal therapy in advanced or metastatic settings [^116WZp27].

- **Complementary therapies**: Acupuncture, mindfulness, and exercise may help manage side effects and improve quality of life [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to assess treatment response, manage side effects, and ensure adherence. This includes periodic clinical examinations, imaging studies, and laboratory tests, as well as patient education on adherence and side-effect management [^116wcqeQ] [^112RbLfs].

---

Hormonal therapy is a cornerstone of treatment for **HR+ breast cancer**, providing significant benefits in reducing recurrence and improving survival. Decision-making should be individualized, considering **patient-specific factors**, preferences, and clinical guidelines. Regular monitoring and management of **side effects** are essential to optimize outcomes.

### Extended endocrine therapy for early-stage breast cancer: how Do we decide? [^112xpj5K]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

While the majority of hormone receptor-positive breast cancers are diagnosed at an early stage, a significant proportion of patients will develop disease recurrence, especially late disease recurrence, despite current therapeutic approaches. In this review, we examine the data pertaining to the choice of endocrine and extended endocrine therapy, outline how to identify patients that may benefit from extended therapy, and discuss prognostic tools to assist with patient selection.

Recent Findings

The risk of breast cancer recurrence persists after 5 years, is cumulative, and is indefinite. In attempts to mitigate these risks, studies have evaluated the use of extended endocrine therapy. Overall survival benefit has been demonstrated with extended tamoxifen, whereas extended aromatase inhibitors have shown modest disease-free survival benefit. Therapeutic approaches for individual patients will depend on the perceived risk of recurrence, likely benefit of extended therapy, tolerability of current endocrine therapy, and patient preference.

### Influence of menopausal hormone therapy on the breast: counseling your patients before you prescribe [^113Pk2nM]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) aims to improve a woman's quality of life by treating bothersome menopausal symptoms associated with low estrogen levels. Although HT is prescribed to millions of women worldwide, its breast-related adverse effects have always been a concern. Some of the common adverse effects of HT are breast fullness, increased breast density, and increased breast cancer (BC) risk. Health care professionals need to be aware of the influence of HT on breast tissue to provide appropriate counseling as part of informed decision making. Our review summarizes the influence of HT on breast symptoms, breast density, mammograms, and BC risk.

### Menopausal hormone therapy for breast cancer patients: what is the current evidence? [^114gS8rC]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance and Objectives

Many breast cancer survivors struggle with menopausal symptoms due to oncological treatment-induced hormone deficiency, or because they experience menopause some years after completing treatment, but have limited menopause treatment options. Estrogen replacement therapy is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, but is not recommended after breast cancer because it can﻿ increase the risk of relapse. Our objectives were to review the evidence and develop a consensus statement to define the role of menopausal hormone therapy after breast cancer, and to highlight evidence gaps to inform future research.

Methods

A 25-member multidisciplinary panel developed the consensus statements using a modified Delphi methodology. The panel consisted of 18 senior doctors who voted (5 GP menopause specialists, 5 gynecologists, 4 medical oncologists, 3 breast surgical oncologists, and 1 breast radiologist), and 7 members﻿ who did not vote ﻿(4 patient representatives, 1 medical oncologist, 1 urologist and 1 administrator). Consensus was defined as ≥ 70% agreement with low-to-moderate variation in extent of agreement (mean absolute deviation from median of ≤ 0.75). We reviewed current evidence relating to use of vaginal and systemic menopausal hormone therapy ("MHT",﻿ also known as "hormone therapy", "HT" or "hormone replacement therapy", "HRT") after breast cancer diagnosis, and adjuvant endocrine (anti-estrogen) therapy, and developed a narrative synthesis. Finally, four additional breast cancer specialists peer-reviewed the manuscript.

Discussion and Conclusions

The panel agreed that some women may choose to take MHT, (off-label use) and accept an increased risk of relapse in exchange for relief from menopausal symptoms and an improved quality of life, and that preferences may vary according to individual circumstances and the absolute risk of relapse. All respondents agreed or strongly agreed with statements supporting shared decision making and individualized menopause care (MADM 0.29). In our review of the literature, we found mainly moderate quality evidence concerning use of vaginal and systemic estrogen after breast cancer, and high quality evidence concerning the benefits of anti-estrogen therapy for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Based on the available data, we recommend that shared decisions are based on (1) an individual's menopausal symptoms and impact on quality of life, (2) the potential increase in an individual's risk of relapse by use of menopausal hormone therapy, and (3) patient preferences, views and treatment goals. Clinicians and patients can use our findings to make informed menopause treatment choices after breast cancer. We strongly recommend registering all patients considering MHT after breast cancer in a clinical study (eg, MENopausal hormone therapy and Outcomes After Breast Cancer, the MENO-ABC trial).

### Considerations for hormone therapy use in survivors of breast cancer [^111wsHm7]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

The use of hormone therapy in survivors of breast cancer is complex and contentious. Historically, guidelines have strongly advised against using hormone therapy. Its safety likely depends on many factors. However, long-term oncologic data are lacking, leaving women with unresolved quality-of-life and health concerns and practitioners uncertain about their recommendations. In the short term, there will not be definitive data, and decisions must be made based on the existing imperfect evidence.

### Adjuvant endocrine therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: ASCO clinical practice guideline focused update [^112QqrQq]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline Focused Update — adjuvant endocrine therapy duration for hormone receptor–positive breast cancer states that ASCO conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials from 2012 to 2018, and guideline recommendations were based on the Panel's review of the evidence from six trials. The six included studies of aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment beyond 5 years of therapy demonstrated that extension of AI treatment was not associated with an overall survival advantage but was significantly associated with lower risks of breast cancer recurrence and contralateral breast cancer compared with placebo, and bone-related toxic effects were more common with extended AI treatment. The Panel recommends that women with node-positive breast cancer receive extended therapy, including an AI, for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment. Many women with node-negative breast cancer should consider extended therapy for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment based on considerations of recurrence risk using established prognostic factors. The Panel noted that the benefits in absolute risk of reduction were modest and that, for lower-risk node-negative or limited node-positive cancers, an individualized approach to treatment duration that is based on considerations of risk reduction and tolerability was appropriate. A substantial portion of the benefit for extended adjuvant AI therapy was derived from prevention of second breast cancers. Shared decision making between clinicians and patients is appropriate for decisions about extended adjuvant endocrine treatment, including discussions about the absolute benefits in the reduction of breast cancer recurrence, the prevention of second breast cancers, and the impact of adverse effects of treatment.

### Adjuvant endocrine therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: ASCO clinical practice guideline focused update [^1137qqiX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To update the ASCO clinical practice guideline on adjuvant endocrine therapy based on emerging data about the optimal duration of aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment.

Methods

ASCO conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials from 2012 to 2018. Guideline recommendations were based on the Panel's review of the evidence from six trials.

Results

The six included studies of AI treatment beyond 5 years of therapy demonstrated that extension of AI treatment was not associated with an overall survival advantage but was significantly associated with lower risks of breast cancer recurrence and contralateral breast cancer compared with placebo. Bone-related toxic effects were more common with extended AI treatment.

Recommendations

The Panel recommends that women with node-positive breast cancer receive extended therapy, including an AI, for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment. Many women with node-negative breast cancer should consider extended therapy for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment based on considerations of recurrence risk using established prognostic factors. The Panel noted that the benefits in absolute risk of reduction were modest and that, for lower-risk node-negative or limited node-positive cancers, an individualized approach to treatment duration that is based on considerations of risk reduction and tolerability was appropriate. A substantial portion of the benefit for extended adjuvant AI therapy was derived from prevention of second breast cancers. Shared decision making between clinicians and patients is appropriate for decisions about extended adjuvant endocrine treatment, including discussions about the absolute benefits in the reduction of breast cancer recurrence, the prevention of second breast cancers, and the impact of adverse effects of treatment.

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: current status and unanswered questions [^113vg7ma]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Many women take hormone therapy (HT) for menopausal symptom relief. Studies have tried to clarify whether various factors can modify the risk of HT, such as the age at initiation, dose, duration, or type of HT, or characteristics of the individual, such as family history or body mass index. The relative risks of breast cancer associated with HT across various subgroups of women should be considered similar, but absolute risks can vary significantly among women and this may inform individual decision making. For breast cancer survivors, systemic HT should be discouraged.

### Historical perspective on hormonal therapy of advanced breast cancer [^1161o9HN]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Endocrine therapy is the preferred first-line therapy in patients with nonaggressive, receptor-positive, metastatic breast cancer. Endocrine therapies in these patients are as effective as chemotherapy in terms of survival and tumor response. In addition, hormonal therapies produce fewer and less severe adverse effects than does chemotherapy. Classes of endocrine therapy currently on the market include selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), aromatase inhibitors, and progestins. For several decades, tamoxifen has been considered the gold standard of therapy. However, despite its proven efficacy, a high proportion of patients do not respond. Therefore, a need exists for alternative therapies or for agents to use following tamoxifen failure.

Objective

This review article highlights the various endocrine options available for patients with advanced breast cancer and discusses new agents on the horizon.

Conclusions

Although more studies are needed to determine the optimal sequence of hormonal therapy and the ideal agent within each class, the availability of new and multiple options is encouraging for women with advanced breast cancer.

### Diagnosing and treating breast cancer in elderly women: a call for improved understanding [^112sVtPA]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2007). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common nondermatological malignancy in women, and the incidence increases with age until the eighth decade. Breast cancer pathology and biology appear to be different in elderly patients than in younger ones, and therefore treatment recommendations cannot be generalized from one group to the other. Most elderly women can tolerate breast cancer surgery without significant complications and should be offered a definitive surgical procedure. Improved mechanisms to predict which patients will tolerate and benefit from various therapies are under development. Because most breast cancers in the elderly are hormone responsive, hormonal therapy remains the mainstay of systemic treatment in the adjuvant and metastatic settings. Chemotherapy can be used in elderly women, but treatment decisions must be individualized based upon risk-benefit analyses. Elder-specific studies are underway to identify the most-efficacious and best-tolerated therapies for breast cancer in this population. Primary care physicians must be aware of these issues to provide adequate counseling and care to these patients.

### Hormone-replacement therapy and breast cancer [^114iPu97]. The Lancet: Oncology (2002). Medium credibility.

Hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) has been available for many years, but the important question of its place in development and progression of breast cancer remains controversial; provision of reliable risk estimates has been hampered by a lack of controlled data. Observational evidence suggests that the risk of breast cancer may be increased only if HRT is used long term (ie, for longer than 10 years) and that the risk falls when use ceases. Systematic bias and the lack of adequately powered studies prevent any firm clinical recommendations about the prescription of differing HRT regimens and risk, or the effect of HRT on breast-cancer proliferation and mortality. This review aims to summarise current clinical data, justifying the need for prospective controlled trials in healthy women as well as those at higher risk of breast cancer or with a personal history of the disease.

### Adjuvant endocrine therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: ASCO clinical practice guideline focused update [^115H1r5X]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Extended aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy — 2018 focused update: For node-negative disease, "Many women with node-negative breast cancer are potential candidates for and may be offered extended AI therapy for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment based on considerations of recurrence risk using established prognostic factors", and "Women with low-risk node-negative tumors should not routinely be offered extended therapy". For node-positive disease, "Women with node-positive breast cancer should be offered extended AI therapy for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment". The update specifies, "Women who receive extended adjuvant endocrine therapy should receive no more than 10 years of total treatment", and adds, "As prevention of secondary or contralateral breast cancers is a major benefit of extended AI therapy and overall survival is not, the risk of second breast cancers (not based on prior therapy) should inform the decision to pursue extended treatment". Shared decision-making is emphasized: "Extended therapy carries ongoing risks and side effects, which should be weighed against the potential absolute benefits of longer treatment, in a shared decision-making process between the clinical team and the patient". The qualifying statement notes, "To date, none of the studies have shown improvement in overall survival with longer-duration AI therapy", and that recommendations are based on "prevention of distant recurrence and prevention of second breast cancers".

In addition, 30 experts in medical oncology, radiation oncology, biostatistics, epidemiology, surgical oncology, and clinical trials presented data to the panel and to a conference audience of 1000.

Evidence

The literature was searched with the use of MEDLINE(TM) for January 1995 through July 2000, and an extensive bibliography of 2230 references was provided to the panel. Experts prepared abstracts for their conference presentations with relevant citations from the literature. Evidence from randomized clinical trials and evidence from prospective studies were given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience.

Consensus Process

The panel, answering predefined questions, developed its conclusions based on the evidence presented in open forum and the scientific literature. The panel composed a draft statement, which was read in its entirety and circulated to the experts and the audience for comment. Thereafter, the panel resolved conflicting recommendations and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The panel finalized the revisions within a few weeks after the conference. The draft statement was made available on the World Wide Web immediately after its release at the conference and was updated with the panel's final revisions. The statement is available at http://consensus.nih.gov.

Conclusions

The panel concludes that decisions regarding adjuvant hormonal therapy should be based on the presence of hormone receptor protein in tumor tissues. Adjuvant hormonal therapy should be offered only to women whose tumors express hormone receptor protein. Because adjuvant polychemotherapy improves survival, it should be recommended to the majority of women with localized breast cancer regardless of lymph node, menopausal, or hormone receptor status. The inclusion of anthracyclines in adjuvant chemotherapy regimens produces a small but statistically significant improvement in survival over non-anthracycline-containing regimens. Available data are currently inconclusive regarding the use of taxanes in adjuvant treatment of lymph node-positive breast cancer. The use of adjuvant dose-intensive chemotherapy regimens in high-risk breast cancer and of taxanes in lymph node-negative breast cancer should be restricted to randomized trials. Ongoing studies evaluating these treatment strategies should be supported to determine if such strategies have a role in adjuvant treatment. Studies to date have included few patients older than 70 years. There is a critical need for trials to evaluate the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in these women. There is evidence that women with a high risk of locoregional tumor recurrence after mastectomy benefit from postoperative radiotherapy. This high-risk group includes women with four or more positive lymph nodes or an advanced primary cancer. Currently, the role of postmastectomy radiotherapy for patients with one to three positive lymph nodes remains uncertain and should be tested in a randomized controlled trial. Individual patients differ in the importance they place on the risks and benefits of adjuvant treatments. Quality of life needs to be evaluated in selected randomized clinical trials to examine the impact of the major acute and long-term side effects of adjuvant treatments, particularly premature menopause, weight gain, mild memory loss, and fatigue. Methods to support shared decision-making between patients and their physicians have been successful in trials; they need to be tailored for diverse populations and should be tested for broader dissemination.

### Optimizing endocrine therapy for breast cancer [^112MccTs]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

Endocrine therapy has significantly improved outcomes for patients with early- and advanced-stage hormone-receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer. Despite the success of adjuvant endocrine therapy, some patients with early-stage disease will experience relapse. Additionally, all patients with advanced disease will eventually experience disease progression on endocrine therapy due to resistance. Improved understanding of the mechanisms associated with resistance to endocrine agents has recently led to the approval of new therapeutics. Multiple questions remain unanswered, including the optimal duration of adjuvant therapy, the role of ovarian ablation in early-stage breast cancer in premenopausal women, and how to best incorporate targeted agents with endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting. This article reviews the optimization of endocrine therapy in patients with HR-positive breast cancer, focusing on these controversial areas.

### Adjuvant endocrine therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: ASCO clinical practice guideline focused update [^114R7199]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline Focused Update — extended AI therapy recommendations: Many women with node-negative breast cancer are potential candidates for and may be offered extended AI therapy for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment based on recurrence risk, but women with low-risk node-negative tumors should not routinely be offered extended therapy. Women with node-positive breast cancer should be offered extended AI therapy for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment. Women who receive extended adjuvant endocrine therapy should receive no more than 10 years of total treatment. As prevention of secondary or contralateral breast cancers is a major benefit of extended AI therapy, the risk of second breast cancers based on prior therapy should inform the decision to pursue extended treatment, and extended therapy carries ongoing risks and side effects that should be weighed in shared decision-making. To date, none of the studies have shown improvement in overall survival with longer-duration AI therapy, and recommendations are based on prevention of distant recurrence and prevention of second breast cancers.

### Can De-escalation of adjuvant therapy Be considered for older adults with breast cancer? [^112JrmDY]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractThe trimodal approach of lumpectomy, radiotherapy, and endocrine therapy may represent overtreatment for certain older patients with early-stage breast cancer. Treatment guidelines permit adjuvant endocrine monotherapy, based on older randomized trials comparing adjuvant endocrine therapy with radiotherapy versus without radiotherapy. There are limited data on radiotherapy with endocrine therapy versus without endocrine therapy, and therefore, the incremental benefits versus burdens of endocrine therapy, specifically in older (≥ 70 years of age) women with favorable-risk breast cancer are unknown. With the routine use of molecular genomic assays that identify low-risk breast cancer and advances in radiotherapy delivery that have reduced treatment burden, many older women might consider radiotherapy alone without endocrine therapy if offered. This article reviews the relevant literature and proposes a trial to inform the de-escalation of adjuvant therapy in older patients with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-negative breast cancer.

QUESTION: WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH MBC AND UNKNOWN RECEPTOR STATUS?

In Basic settings, if no immunohistochemistry testing is available, clinicians may presume hormone receptor positivity and offer tamoxifen in most cases. This is based on the higher prevalence of hormone receptor–positive tumors worldwide and the relatively low toxicity of tamoxifen. Another alternative is single-agent chemotherapy. Combination regimens may be offered for symptomatic or immediately life-threatening disease for which time may allow only one potential chance for therapy. Clinicians may offer primary surgery for palliative reasons, including local control.

### Summary version of the standards, options and recommendations for nonmetastatic breast cancer (updated January 2001) [^111ir5ZM]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Hormone therapy

Treatment with adjuvant tamoxifen is beneficial, despite its side effects, irrespective of the patients' age, if the tumour expresses oestrogen receptors (standard, level of evidence: A). Tamoxifen should not be prescribed to women with tumours that do not express oestrogen receptors (standard, level of evidence: A). The optimal duration for adjuvant hormone therapy with tamoxifen is 5 years at a dose of 20 mg day −1 (standard, level of evidence: A). Patients treated with tamoxifen should have regular gynaecological clinical examinations (recommendation, expert agreement). Additional examinations are not necessary in the absence of symptoms.

Neoadjuvant treatment with antioestrogens can be used in elderly women with slowly evolving hormone-sensitive tumours (option, level of evidence: B1). This should be followed when possible by optimal locoregional treatment (option, expert agreement). At present, antioestrogens cannot be considered as standard neoadjuvant treatment for initially operable tumours.

Hormone therapy can be administered for different reasons, depending on the patients' age:
suppression of ovarian function in women with ovarian activity and/or as an antioestrogen,
antioestrogenic therapy in postmenopausal women.

In postmenopausal women, the combination of chemotherapy with an antioestrogen significantly improves progression-free survival and overall survival (standard, level of evidence: A). The ratio of efficacy (overall or recurrence-free survival) and risk (toxicity) should be considered when taking the decision to prescribe this combination. The efficacy/risk ratio favours treatment in women with major metastatic risk factors (recommendation, expert agreement).

Other hormone therapy (progestogens, aromatase inhibitors) should not be considered as adjuvant treatments except in the setting of a randomised clinical trial (standard).

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy and the risk of breast cancer: a contrary thought [^1126BQ55]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

The most important unanswered question regarding postmenopausal hormone therapy and the risk of breast cancer is whether hormone therapy initiates the growth of new breast cancers or whether the epidemiologic data reflect a hormonal impact on preexisting tumors. In this perspective I review the evidence favoring hormonal effects on preexisting tumors and suggest that exposure to combined estrogen and progestin is beneficial, causing greater differentiation and earlier detection of breast cancers.

### Chemotherapy and targeted therapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer that is either endocrine-pretreated or hormone receptor-negative: ASCO guideline update [^112E9bPu]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Health disparities in cancer care — factors influencing outcomes and equity actions are stated as follows: Factors such as race and ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation and gender identity, geographic location, and insurance access are known to affect cancer care outcomes, and racial and ethnic disparities in health care contribute significantly in the United States, with racial or ethnic minorities suffering disproportionately from comorbidities, experiencing more substantial obstacles to receiving care, being more likely to be uninsured, and at greater risk of receiving care of poor quality than other Americans. Awareness of these disparities in access to care should be considered in the context of this clinical practice guideline, and health care providers should strive to deliver the highest level of cancer care to these vulnerable populations, and stakeholders should work toward achieving health equity by ensuring equitable access to both high-quality cancer care and research and addressing the structural barriers that preserve health inequities.

### Risks and benefits of therapy with menopausal hormones versus selective estrogen-receptor modulators in peri-and postmenopausal women at increased breast cancer risk [^116G6KGs]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Decision making about menopausal therapies is complex because of the number of clinical factors that must be considered. Menopausal hormone therapy can relieve the vasomotor symptoms of menopause, but the most common preparation, combination estrogen and progesterone, increases the risk of breast cancer. Both tamoxifen and raloxifene can reduce the risk of developing invasive breast cancer, but the adverse effects of these drugs differ substantially. Risk models have been built to identify women at high risk for developing breast cancer, but their application in clinical practice has been develop disappointingly low. We propose an approach for identifying and managing menopausal women at high risk for breast cancer that can be readily implemented in clinical practice. The first step is to identify women at sufficiently high risk for breast cancer to merit treatment. For women aged 45 or older, the presence of one or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer and one or more previous breast biopsies will identify those whose 5-year risk is 2% or higher. For women 55 years or older, the presence of either one of these risk factors is sufficient. Any woman with a family history of breast cancer should be assessed as to whether she is likely to carry a BRCA mutation and referred for genetic counseling and possible genetic testing. Decisions about treatment options should be based on the presence or absence of bothersome vasomotor symptoms, an intact uterus, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. A simple algorithm is presented to streamline identification and management of menopausal women at high risk for breast cancer.

### Breast cancer treatment: a review [^1163R2F9]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Breast cancer will be diagnosed in 12% of women in the United States over the course of their lifetimes and more than 250 000 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the United States in 2017. This review focuses on current approaches and evolving strategies for local and systemic therapy of breast cancer.

Observations

Breast cancer is categorized into 3 major subtypes based on the presence or absence of molecular markers for estrogen or progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor 2 (ERBB2; formerly HER2): hormone receptor positive/ERBB2 negative (70% of patients), ERBB2 positive (15%-20%), and triple-negative (tumors lacking all 3 standard molecular markers; 15%). More than 90% of breast cancers are not metastatic at the time of diagnosis. For people presenting without metastatic disease, therapeutic goals are tumor eradication and preventing recurrence. Triple-negative breast cancer is more likely to recur than the other 2 subtypes, with 85% 5-year breast cancer-specific survival for stage I triple-negative tumors vs 94% to 99% for hormone receptor positive and ERBB2 positive. Systemic therapy for nonmetastatic breast cancer is determined by subtype: patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors receive endocrine therapy, and a minority receive chemotherapy as well; patients with ERBB2-positive tumors receive ERBB2-targeted antibody or small-molecule inhibitor therapy combined with chemotherapy; and patients with triple-negative tumors receive chemotherapy alone. Local therapy for all patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer consists of surgical resection, with consideration of postoperative radiation if lumpectomy is performed. Increasingly, some systemic therapy is delivered before surgery. Tailoring postoperative treatment based on preoperative treatment response is under investigation. Metastatic breast cancer is treated according to subtype, with goals of prolonging life and palliating symptoms. Median overall survival for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer is approximately 1 year vs approximately 5 years for the other 2 subtypes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Breast cancer consists of 3 major tumor subtypes categorized according to estrogen or progesterone receptor expression and ERBB2 gene amplification. The 3 subtypes have distinct risk profiles and treatment strategies. Optimal therapy for each patient depends on tumor subtype, anatomic cancer stage, and patient preferences.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^114hMuyc]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To update the ASCO guideline on pharmacologic interventions for breast cancer risk reduction and provide guidance on clinical issues that arise when deciding to use endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction.

Methods

An Expert Panel conducted targeted systematic literature reviews to identify new studies.

Results

A randomized clinical trial that evaluated the use of anastrozole for reduction of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers in postmenopausal women at increased risk of developing breast cancer provided the predominant basis for the update.

Updated Recommendations

In postmenopausal women at increased risk, the choice of endocrine therapy now includes anastrozole (1 mg/day) in addition to exemestane (25 mg/day), raloxifene (60 mg/day), or tamoxifen (20 mg/day). The decision regarding choice of endocrine therapy should take into consideration age, baseline comorbidities, and adverse effect profiles. Clinicians should not prescribe anastrozole, exemestane, or raloxifene for breast cancer risk reduction to premenopausal women. Tamoxifen 20 mg/day for 5 years is still considered standard of care for risk reduction in premenopausal women who are at least 35 years old and have completed childbearing. Data on low-dose tamoxifen as an alternative to the standard dose for both pre- and postmenopausal women with intraepithelial neoplasia are discussed in the Clinical Considerations section of this article.

QUESTION: WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH MBC WHO ARE PREMENOPAUSAL THAT'S UNIQUE AS COMPARED TO THOSE WHO ARE POSTMENOPAUSAL?

When treating patients who are premenopausal, the same recommendations apply as in the case of postmenopausal patients, with one caveat. Whenever hormonal therapy — besides tamoxifen — is indicated, ovarian ablation is a prerequisite. It is recommended in addition to any modality used for treatment and can be combined with either tamoxifen or an AI, depending on availability and patients' tolerance. Surgical oophorectomy or radiotherapy ablation (when available) should be recommended rather than medical ovarian suppression strategies. For those patients who cannot tolerate ovarian ablation, tamoxifen is a reasonable alternative. Only surgeons with gynecologic surgical expertise should perform oophorectomies.

QUESTION: WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED FRONTLINE TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH HORMONE RECEPTOR–POSITIVE MBC?

Hormonal therapy is the cornerstone of management for patients with hormone receptor–positive cancer. The type of hormonal therapy depends on the menopausal status of the patient. For patients who are premenopausal, therapy includes ovarian ablation, either by medical, surgical, or radiation means (see the section on Recommended Treatment for Premenopausal Patients with MBC for more). For patients who are postmenopausal, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) with or without CDK4/6 inhibitors can be used where available. Patients with high volume of hormone receptor–positive visceral disease where the risk of visceral crisis is a concern may be offered chemotherapy as an initial treatment.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^1129q98C]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy for HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors states that patients with HR positive, HER2-negative tumors, receive adjuvant endocrine therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence and those deemed at high risk for distant recurrence despite adjuvant endocrine therapy, receive adjuvant chemotherapy. The NCCN Guidelines call for the determination of ER and PR content in all primary invasive breast cancers to determine whether a patient is a candidate for endocrine therapies. Given the limited efficacy data on the ER-low-positive group, individualized consideration of risks versus benefits of endocrine therapy and additional adjuvant therapies should be incorporated into decision-making, and patients with ER-negative, PR-positive cancers may also be considered for endocrine therapies; for the purposes of this guideline, any ER and/or PR-positive tumors is referred to as hormone receptor (HR)-positive. The magnitude of risk reduction from adjuvant endocrine therapy is dependent on level of ER-expression and on recurrence score (RS), low ER expression is less likely to benefit, and a high RS will gain less benefit with endocrine therapy alone versus those with low RS. Patients with invasive breast cancers that are HR- positive should be considered for adjuvant endocrine therapy regardless of patient age, lymph node status, or whether adjuvant chemotherapy is to be administered.

QUESTION: WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH MBC WHOSE CANCER IS PD-L1–POSITIVE OR BRCA1 / 2 MUTATION–POSITIVE OR HORMONE RECEPTOR–POSITIVE?

The guideline presents treatment options for patients with MBC and positive PD-L1 or BRCA1 / 2 status. For germline BRCA1 / 2 mutation–positive MBC, if poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) is unavailable, clinicians may use hormonal therapy (hormone receptor–positive MBC; with or without ovarian ablation) and chemotherapy (hormone receptor–negative MBC) in the first-line setting. In second-line setting, patients with triple-negative MBC with germline BRCA1 / 2 mutations who previously received chemotherapy may be offered a PARPi rather than chemotherapy, if available. But clinicians should not offer these unless the patient has a known germline BRCA mutation.

This resource-stratified guideline and related ASCO guidelines present treatment for patients with these diagnoses, when quality-assured pathology results are available to guide the selection of targeted therapy, which are not yet available in many Basic and Limited Settings.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^1178paRx]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy — general principles for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer state that ER testing should be used to determine candidacy and that patients with cancers with 1%–100% ER IHC staining are considered ER+, with limited efficacy data for ER-low-positive (1%–10%). In ER-negative, PR+ cancers endocrine therapies may be considered, but PR should not be interpreted as either positive (if 1%–100% of cells have nuclear staining) or negative (if < 1% or 0% cells have nuclear staining); most hormone-sensitive tumors are ER+/PR+ or ER+/PR-negative and ER and/or PR+ tumors are referred to as HR+. The magnitude of risk reduction from adjuvant endocrine therapy depends on level of ER expression and recurrence score (RS), with low ER+ expression and high RS associated with relatively less benefit from endocrine therapy.

### Extended endocrine therapy use and decision making after breast cancer diagnosis [^1116Jqwg]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Adjuvant endocrine therapy is recommended to extend beyond five years for stage II breast cancer, with less consensus for extension in stage I. We aimed to understand use of and decision-making about extended endocrine therapy.

Patients and Methods

Women aged 20–79 diagnosed with stage I-II breast cancer in 2014–15 and reported to Georgia and Los Angeles County SEER registries were surveyed at seven months and again at six years post-diagnosis (N = 2,361; response rate = 60%). Women with estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive disease were asked about their decision whether to continue therapy.

Results

Of 831 women, 591 had completed or were completing five years of endocrine therapy. Among those who had decided (n = 557), 46.9% decided to continue (39.4% stage I, 62.4% stage II). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with continuation for stage I were worry about recurrence (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.78–6.32); desire for most extensive treatment (aOR 2.15; CI 1.11–4.14); and primary care physician participation (aOR 4.30; CI 2.22–8.32). Side effects were inversely associated with continuation (stage I aOR 0.21: CI 0.11–0.41). Associations were similar for stage II; for stage I only, bilateral mastectomy and chemotherapy were associated with continuation. Decision to continue did not vary by race, ethnicity or demographic factors.

Conclusions

Nearly 40% of women with stage I breast cancer, and two-thirds with stage II, decided to extend endocrine therapy. Decision-making was influenced by patient values and varied little by stage. These results can inform physician-patient discussion about extending endocrine therapy.

### Endocrine therapy for the management and risk reduction of hormone receptor positive breast cancer [^115AK6NM]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Section 3D — Length of endocrine therapy — adjuvant tamoxifen duration and baseline recommendations are outlined: in a meta-analysis of 55 trials of ER+/ER unknown tumors, one year of tamoxifen reduced recurrence by 21%, 2 years by 29%, and 5 years by 47%, with mortality and contralateral breast cancers similarly reduced and no effect in ER negative disease; both node negative and node positive patients benefitted, with the latter benefiting most. In NSABP B-14 (all node negative), 5 years of tamoxifen produced better disease-free survival (DFS), recurrence free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) compared with extended therapy, and "The consensus was to recommend 5 years of tamoxifen outside a clinical trial". Patients at a higher recurrence risk do benefit from extended endocrine therapy, but "There is, however, a paucity of data showing an OS benefit with extended endocrine therapy".

### Endocrine therapy for primary and secondary prevention after diagnosis of high-risk breast lesions or preinvasive breast cancer [^115uwMNU]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice. Patients with high-risk breast lesions (HRLs) or preinvasive breast cancers face an elevated risk of future breast cancer diagnoses. Endocrine therapy in this setting reduces the risk of a future diagnosis but does not confer improved survival, thus the side effects of primary/secondary prevention must be considered relative to the benefits. Here, we discuss the available chemoprevention regimens for patients with HRLs and considerations for selecting a regimen, as well as the decision making surrounding use of adjuvant endocrine therapy for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). For patients with HRLs, available chemoprevention regimens differ by menopausal status, including tamoxifen 20 mg once daily for 5 years and more recently tamoxifen 5 mg once daily for 3 years in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women as well as raloxifene or aromatase inhibitors for postmenopausal women. We recommend a shared decision-making approach with attention to patient preferences related to risk tolerance and side-effect profiles. Low-dose tamoxifen appears to be a particularly favorable choice that is well tolerated, without risk of serious adverse events and offers comparable risk reduction to other regimens. For DCIS, the benefit of endocrine therapy in addition to radiation is small, and appears to be driven mainly by a reduction in contralateral breast diagnoses or new breast cancers. A strategy that reduces the side-effect profile of chemoprevention such as low-dose tamoxifen may be especially appealing in the setting of secondary prevention.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^1125fHTz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Breast cancer — fertility preservation: Premenopausal patients should be informed about the potential impact of chemotherapy on fertility and offered the option of fertility preservation if future childbearing is desired. The NCCN Panel recommends that all treating physicians should have a discussion with their patients of childbearing potential regarding the options for fertility preservation, and patients who desire to bear children after systemic therapy should be referred to a fertility specialist prior to initiating systemic (chemotherapy or endocrine) therapy. The page notes that patients should not be excluded from consideration for discussion of fertility preservation for any reason, including parity, prognosis, age, and socioeconomic status. Randomized trials have demonstrated that GnRH agonists (such as goserelin) administered prior to initiating chemotherapy and then administered concurrently with adjuvant chemotherapy protect against ovarian failure and reduce the risk of early menopause; in one trial goserelin improved the probability of pregnancy from 11% to 21% in patients with HR-negative early-stage breast cancer. Patients should be informed of all the various modalities to minimize gonadal damage and preserve ovarian function and future fertility; the fertility specialist should discuss specifics of fertility preservation options including hormonal interventions, ovarian stimulation, embryo or oocyte cryopreservation, and other investigational options, as well as the probability of successful gestation and childbirth. Combining the various modalities for a specific patient may increase the odds of preservation of future fertility, and it is important for fetal safety that patients actively avoid becoming pregnant during breast cancer treatment.

### Management of male breast cancer: ASCO guideline [^114Q6wEp]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To develop recommendations concerning the management of male breast cancer.

Methods

ASCO convened an Expert Panel to develop recommendations based on a systematic review and a formal consensus process.

Results

Twenty-six descriptive reports or observational studies met eligibility criteria and formed the evidentiary basis for the recommendations.

Recommendations

Many of the management approaches used for men with breast cancer are like those used for women. Men with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who are candidates for adjuvant endocrine therapy should be offered tamoxifen for an initial duration of five years; those with a contraindication to tamoxifen may be offered a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist/antagonist plus aromatase inhibitor. Men who have completed five years of tamoxifen, have tolerated therapy, and still have a high risk of recurrence may be offered an additional five years of therapy. Men with early-stage disease should not be treated with bone-modifying agents to prevent recurrence, but could still receive these agents to prevent or treat osteoporosis. Men with advanced or metastatic disease should be offered endocrine therapy as first-line therapy, except in cases of visceral crisis or rapidly progressive disease. Targeted systemic therapy may be used to treat advanced or metastatic cancer using the same indications and combinations offered to women. Ipsilateral annual mammogram should be offered to men with a history of breast cancer treated with lumpectomy regardless of genetic predisposition; contralateral annual mammogram may be offered to men with a history of breast cancer and a genetic predisposing mutation. Breast magnetic resonance imaging is not recommended routinely. Genetic counseling and germline genetic testing of cancer predisposition genes should be offered to all men with breast cancer.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111P6Njs]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

North American Menopause Society (NAMS) 2022 position statement — key points on breast cancer risk and counseling for hormone therapy: The risk of breast cancer related to hormone therapy is low, with estimates indicating a rare occurrence (less than one additional case per 1,000 women per year of hormone therapy use or three additional cases per 1,000 women when used for 5 years with CEE plus MPA) (Level I). Women should be counseled about the risk of breast cancer with hormone therapy, putting the data into perspective, with risk similar to that of modifiable risk factors such as two daily alcoholic beverages, obesity, and low physical activity (Level III). Different hormone therapy regimens may be associated with increased breast density, which may obscure mammographic interpretation, leading to more mammograms or more breast biopsies and a potential delay in breast cancer diagnosis (Level II), and the effect of hormone therapy on breast cancer risk may depend on the type of hormone therapy, duration of use, regimen, prior exposure, and individual characteristics (Level II).

ASCO clinical practice guideline — extended AI therapy for node-positive disease states that "Women with node-positive breast cancer should be offered extended AI-based therapy for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment", and lists "Preferred options for extended therapy include an AI for up to a total of 10 years or a sequence of tamoxifen for 2 to 3 years followed by 7 to 8 years of an AI or a sequence of tamoxifen for 5 years followed by an AI for 5 years". It adds that "the prognosis in cases of limited nodal involvement (eg, one or two affected nodes) may be sufficiently favorable that clinicians and patients might reasonably opt to forego extended therapy based on individualized assessment", and that "the Expert Panel recommends 10 years of tamoxifen therapy for premenopausal women or for postmenopausal women who have not tolerated or prefer not to take AI-based treatment".

### Time to treatment initiation for breast cancer during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic [^116bAUGz]. JCO Oncology Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Patients with newly diagnosed early-stage breast cancer treated at our institution during the COVID-19 pandemic did not wait longer to start therapy than those treated in previous years. Although similar numbers of patients were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer during this period as compared with previous years, fewer patients were diagnosed with noninvasive disease during COVID-19. We also found that during COVID-19, choice of initial therapy for newly diagnosed HR+ patients shifted from surgery toward hormonal therapy. Collectively, these findings suggest that, at our institution, treatment delays for patients with newly diagnosed early-stage breast cancer were avoided by increasing the use of preoperative hormonal therapy along with multidisciplinary mitigation strategies.

There is concern that the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to care delays and poor outcomes for patients with cancer. Current understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with breast cancer is limited and subject to significant reporting delays with typical state and national reporting outlets.

### Optimal endocrine therapy in premenopausal women: a pragmatic approach to unanswered questions [^115LerUT]. JCO Oncology Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Recent epidemiologic data show an increasing incidence of breast cancer among premenopausal women in many higher-income countries. Among premenopausal women, those diagnosed under age 40 years experience inferior long-term outcomes, particularly in the setting of hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative disease. In addition to more advanced disease presentation and/or less favorable disease biology, suboptimal adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) has emerged as an important driver of this age-related disparity. Historically, young women have been excluded from treatment with aromatase inhibitors (AIs), attained low rates of chemotherapy-related amenorrhea, and exhibited low adherence to ET. Recently, several studies have demonstrated treatment with ovarian function suppression (OFS) during the first 5 years postdiagnosis to be associated with improvements in breast cancer recurrence and mortality, with additional benefits achieved from pairing OFS with an AI. As the first 5 years of ET for premenopausal women has been transformed, extended ET, administered in years 5–10 postdiagnosis, has also become more common. However, the only studies of extending ET in premenopausal women have tested an additional 5 years of tamoxifen following an initial 5 years of tamoxifen and studies of AIs in the second 5 years have been limited to postmenopausal women. Herein, we review available data concerning potential benefits and risks to be considered when counseling premenopausal women on extended ET, including the continuation of OFS. We offer a pragmatic framework to support decision making given the current body of knowledge and call out the need for additional research into this issue.

### Perceptions of transgender and nonbinary persons toward breast and cervical cancer development, screening, and potential impact on gender-affirming hormone therapy [^116NA8bQ]. JCO Oncology Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Approximately 1.6% of adult Americans identify as transgender (TG) or nonbinary (NB) and many take gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). Little data exist to inform breast and cervical cancer risks, gender-specific screening guidelines, and inclusive cancer treatment algorithms that consider GAHT. We aimed to assess TGNB persons' perceptions on breast and cervical cancer development, screening knowledge and practices, and attitude toward GAHT in the setting of a hormone receptor-positive breast cancer diagnosis.

Methods

This single-institution survey study was conducted through an LGBTQ+ focused clinic from 2021 to 2022. Noncisgender patients age ≥ 18 years who were English speaking were eligible to participate. A 5-point Likert scale was used to assess concern of developing breast (all participants) and cervical cancer (those assigned female sex at birth). Demographic and quantitative variables were examined in comparison with responses via chi-squared tests.

Results

Eighty-six participants completed the survey: 43% TG men, 24% TG women, and 20% NB persons. Most (84.9%) were age < 40 years, and 86% were non-Hispanic White. The majority were unaware of breast (77%) or cervical (60%) cancer screening recommendations for their sex assigned at birth or their gender. Approximately 35% reported concern regarding breast cancer development and of those age > 40 years; only 50% had undergone screening mammography. Of those assigned female sex at birth with an intact cervix, 47% were concerned about cervical cancer development and 46.6% had a Papanicolaou smear within the past 5 years. Nearly all (87.2%) were on GAHT, and 35.1% reported they would not consider stopping GAHT if diagnosed with a hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

Conclusion

The findings support the need for patient and provider education on screening options and large prospective cohort data to elucidate optimal gender-specific screening guidelines and treatment algorithms.

### Sequencing of aromatase inhibitors [^114vvX5J]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Given that the use of single agents appears preferable, should tamoxifen or AIs be used as first-line treatment in a hormone-therapy naive patient, or in a patient who has completed adjuvant tamoxifen more than 12 months before relapse (i.e. in a potentially tamoxifen-sensitive patient)? The improved efficacy (time to progression) and side effect profile of AIs compared with tamoxifen suggest that these agents should be used first. This is reinforced by the results of studies comparing AIs and tamoxifen in the neoadjuvant setting. AIs are also considered the agents of first choice for patients with tamoxifen-resistant disease (i.e. those who progress during or within 1 year from adjuvant tamoxifen).

A more problematic choice is faced for a patient who has already received an AI as part of her adjuvant therapy. Is there a role for further treatment with an AI in such a patient? The same question arises at the time of second progression after treatment with AIs in the advanced disease setting.

### Breast cancer survivors' opinion on personalizing endocrine therapy and developing informative tools [^117CLZm5]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women and ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The widespread implementation of screening strategies has resulted in a higher proportion of early-stage breast cancers that are managed with a curative intent. Seventy percent of individuals diagnosed with breast cancer have tumors that express hormone receptors (HR + BC), necessitating endocrine therapy (ET), a cornerstone of the treatment strategy. The meta-analysis performed by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) evaluating individual patient-level data from multiple clinical trials have shown that adjuvant ET almost halved the recurrence rates and reduced by approximately one-third the mortality rates. However, adjuvant ET, prescribed for 5 years or more, is associated with adverse events that impact the patient's quality of life, subsequently reducing adherence to treatment. Non-adherence and early discontinuation of ET occur in 30–50% of breast cancer survivors –. We have previously reported that 16.0% of premenopausal patients with HR + BC were non-adherent to tamoxifen after one year of treatment. Biochemically proven non-adherent patients had a higher risk of distant recurrences (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.05–5.06) shortly after treatment discontinuation or interruption.

Non-adherence is commonly multifactorial and primarily affects patients at the extremes of age, those with low socioeconomic status –, patients with limited knowledge about the benefit of adjuvant ET, and intolerable adverse events, mainly menopausal symptoms –. In a recently reported meta-analysis, lowering medication costs and a subgroup of psychosocial and reminder interventions had a significant impact on promoting adherence. Nevertheless, it remains necessary to understand the levers that could facilitate adherence to ET from the patient's perspective. Therefore, we conducted a survey among HR + BC survivors who were either receiving or had previously received adjuvant ET to explore their views on personalizing ET (schedule, formulation, presentation, and combination with agents targeting ET-related adverse events) and developing dedicated informative tools.

### Endocrine resistance in hormone-responsive breast cancer: mechanisms and therapeutic strategies [^1117Rvte]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

The majority of breast cancers may be considered hormone responsive due to expression of hormone receptors (HR+). Although endocrine therapy is always considered for advanced HR+ breast cancer, the emergence of resistance is inevitable over time and is present from the start in a proportion of patients. In this review, we explore the mechanisms underlying de novo and acquired resistance to endocrine therapy. We comprehensively review newly approved and emerging therapies that have been developed to counteract specific mechanisms of resistance. We discuss the challenges pertinent to this therapeutic arena including the potential relief of negative regulatory feedback inhibition with compensatory pathway activation and the evolution of molecular changes in HR+ breast cancers during treatment. We discuss strategies to address these challenges in order to develop rational therapy approaches for patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer.

### Hormone therapy for breast cancer fact sheet-NCI… [^113iHpim]. NCI (2022). Medium credibility.

Hormone therapy for breast cancer should not be confused with menopausal hormone therapy — treatment with estrogen alone or in combination with progesterone to help relieve symptoms of menopause. These two types of therapy produce opposite effects: hormone therapy for breast cancer blocks the growth of HR-positive breast cancer, whereas MHT can stimulate the growth of HR-positive breast cancer. For this reason, when a woman taking MHT is diagnosed with HR-positive breast cancer she is usually asked to stop that therapy. How is hormone therapy used to treat breast cancer.

There are three main ways that hormone therapy is used to treat hormone-sensitive breast cancer: Adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer: Tamoxifen is FDA approved for adjuvant hormone treatment of premenopausal and postmenopausal women with ER-positive early-stage breast cancer, and the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane are approved for this use in postmenopausal women. Abemaciclib is also approved to be used alone for women and men with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease got worse after treatment with hormone therapy and previous chemotherapy given for metastatic disease. Abemaciclib is also approved to be used with an aromatase inhibitor as first-line hormone therapy in postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
- Some women with advanced breast cancer that is HER2 and HR positive may receive hormone therapy plus trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab. Neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer: The use of hormone therapy to treat breast cancer to reduce tumor size before surgery has been studied in clinical trials. These trials have shown that neoadjuvant hormone therapy — in particular, with aromatase inhibitors — can be effective in reducing the size of breast tumors in postmenopausal women, but it is not yet clear how effective it is in premenopausal women. Hormone therapy is sometimes used for the neoadjuvant treatment of HR-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women who cannot tolerate chemotherapy or when surgery needs to be delayed. Can hormone therapy be used to prevent breast cancer. Yes.

Most breast cancers are ER positive, and clinical trials have tested whether hormone therapy can be used to prevent breast cancer in women who are at increased risk of developing the disease.

Therapy with or without Everolimus in Treating Patients with Breast Cancer This randomized phase III trial studies how well hormone therapy when given together with or without everolimus works in treating patients with breast cancer. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen citrate, goserelin acetate, leuprolide acetate, anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane, may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Everolimus may stop tumor cells from dividing and may block the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. It is not yet known whether hormone therapy is more effective when given with or without everolimus in treating breast cancer.
- Patients must not have metastatic breast cancer; patients with multifocal, multicentric, and synchronous bilateral, and primary inflammatory breast cancers are allowed Multifocal disease is defined as more than one invasive cancer < 2 cm from the largest lesion within the same breast quadrant Multicentric disease is defined as. who had breast-conserving surgery must have completed whole breast radiation; use of regional nodal basin radiation will be at the discretion of the investigator according to institutional guidelines Patients with ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes must have completed breast/chest wall and nodal basin radiation therapy according to standard of care guidelines before randomization; omission of radiation therapy is not allowed in this high-risk population of patients Patients must be registered at least 21 days after completion of radiation therapy and must have recovered from any of the effects of radiation.
- Patients must have undergone axillary staging by sentinel node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection For patients with 1–3 positive lymph nodes, sentinel node biopsy alone is allowed provided that the patient completed either whole breast or chest wall radiation and the primary tumor is < 5 cm All patients with ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes must have completed ALND.
- Patients must have completed standard neoadjuvant or adjuvant taxane and/or anthracycline based chemotherapy prior to randomization; completion of chemotherapy will be determined by the treating oncologist, but should include a minimum of 4 cycles;.

### Kisqali plus hormone therapy for metastatic breast cancer-NCI… [^113TpAPk]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

A Safer, Better Treatment Option for Some Younger Women with Breast Cancer, by Sharon Reynolds The initial treatment used for some younger women with an aggressive form of breast cancer may be about to change, based on results of a new clinical trial. In the trial, the combination of the targeted drug ribociclib and hormone therapy was much better at halting the growth of aggressive tumors that have spread in the body than standard treatment with a combination of chemotherapy drugs. Women who received the ribociclib–hormone therapy combination lived for twice as long without their cancer getting worse, a measure called progression-free survival. They also had far fewer side effects. "I believe this is practice changing, " said Yen-Shen Lu, M. D., of the National Taiwan University Hospital, who presented the results from the RIGHT Choice study at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium on December 6.

"These data provide clear evidence that is safe, it is efficacious, and it can avoid a lot of toxicity, " he said. Ribociclib has become a commonly used treatment for ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer that requires treatment beyond surgery and radiation therapy. It is a targeted therapy called a CDK4/6 inhibitor that shuts down certain processes that cancer cells need to divide. The combination of ribociclib with a drug to block hormones has recently become a standard treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer that isn't immediately life threatening. But younger women who haven't yet gone through menopause make up a substantial proportion of people diagnosed with breast cancer every year. The team randomly assigned the participants to receive either combination chemotherapy or ribociclib plus hormone therapy.

The hormone therapy consisted of goserelin, which blocks the production of hormones by the ovaries, and either letrozole or anastrozole, both of which are drugs called aromatase inhibitors. The chemotherapy combinations could include docetaxel plus capecitabine, paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, or capecitabine plus vinorelbine, depending on the drugs normally used at the hospitals where the participants were treated. Women in both groups could continue treatment as long as tumor growth was kept at bay and the side effects were tolerable.

### Radiation therapy, palbociclib, and hormone… [^113uMNFN]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

Therapy, Palbociclib, and Hormone Therapy in Treating Breast Cancer Patients with Bone Metastasis. This phase II trial studies how well radiation therapy given with standard care palbociclib and hormone therapy work in treating patients with breast cancer that has spread from one part of the body to the bone. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Palbociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane lowers the amount of estrogen made by the body. This may help stop the growth of tumor cells that need estrogen to grow. Fulvestrant and tamoxifen blocks the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy, palbociclib, and hormone therapy may work better in treating breast cancer patients with bone metastasis.
- Must be actively receiving palbociclib plus one of the following hormone therapies for at least 28 days: * Fulvestrant once daily on days 1–21.

At the discretion of treating physician, patients also receive letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, or tamoxifen PO QD on days 1–28, or fulvestrant intramuscularly on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
