## Question

How should a patient be managed who feels bloated regardless of meal size, has pain after eating with a heavy sensation and occasional cramping; had blood in the stool 2 years ago with no recurrence; has a bowel movement about once every days with formed stools and intermittent straining; and experiences intermittent heartburn with heavier meals but no change with spicy or fried foods?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a patient with persistent bloating regardless of meal size, postprandial abdominal pain with a heavy sensation and occasional cramping, a remote episode of blood in the stool without recurrence, bowel movements about once every days with formed stools and intermittent straining, and intermittent heartburn with heavier meals but no change with spicy or fried foods. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the symptom cluster and confirming whether this fits Rome IV functional dyspepsia versus IBS. Then, I should verify alarm features, including the significance of a remote GI bleed and how age modifies thresholds for endoscopy. Next, I will review initial noninvasive testing strategies such as H. pylori, celiac serologies, and when GERD or gastroparesis should be considered. Finally, I will outline empiric therapy, criteria for endoscopic evaluation, and follow-up contingencies, while double-checking medication contributors and diet-related mechanisms that might alter management.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame. Functional dyspepsia per Rome IV is a clinical syndrome of bothersome epigastric pain or burning, early satiation, and/or postprandial fullness in the absence of structural disease on endoscopy; in practice, clinicians can use the clinical Rome IV criteria when these symptoms are present and bothersome for more than 8 weeks, recognizing that endoscopy is often normal and required by formal criteria to exclude organic disease [^116xfwW3] [^114UTqsE].

> Wait, let me verify the key differentiator from IBS. In FD, pain is typically epigastric and not related to defecation, whereas IBS involves abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits and often related to defecation; ensuring the pain location and its relationship to bowel movements is crucial to avoid misclassification [^116xfwW3] [^11194Hy9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety. I should screen for alarm features, especially given the history of a remote GI bleed 2 years ago; weight loss, anemia, progressive dysphagia, persistent vomiting, or GI bleeding shift the threshold toward earlier endoscopic evaluation despite the generally low cancer yield in uninvestigated dyspepsia, which is approximately 0.4% in primary care cohorts [^111AwcgC] [^113hHJ11].

> I need to check the IBS angle carefully. If there is pain with stool form or frequency change, urgency, or mucus, with subtyping into IBS-D, IBS-C, or IBS-M by predominant stool pattern, that supports IBS; symptoms often occur in episodes, so I should ask about clustering and inter-episode variability to avoid over-weighting single-day impressions [^111iUFFT] [^113VXMeJ].

> Next, I should review initial noninvasive tests. For uninvestigated dyspepsia, a test-and-treat strategy for Helicobacter pylori is cost-effective and guideline-concordant; if IBS-type symptoms are present, I should test for celiac disease, particularly with diarrhea, and selectively use noninvasive tools to exclude inflammatory disease to narrow the differential prudently [^114GVbRV] [^1113botT] [^11232DYU] [^114CnLju].

> But wait, what if this is GERD overlap rather than FD. I should confirm the presence of typical heartburn or regurgitation and consider a time-limited PPI trial, while remembering a PPI response is neither sensitive nor specific for GERD, and PPIs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest time once GERD is confirmed or highly likely [^111scUUW] [^113mQmdd] [^113AnTt4].

> I will now examine the possibility of gastroparesis if early satiety, postprandial fullness, nausea, or vomiting predominate. I should double-check glucose control and thyroid function, review medications that delay gastric emptying such as opioids, anticholinergics, GLP-1 agonists, and amylin analogs, and, if clinical suspicion remains, obtain objective gastric emptying testing because symptoms alone cannot distinguish normal from delayed emptying [^116mzVoY] [^116nEhoV] [^117Pgb3J].

> Let me consider diet-related mechanisms next. Food-triggered symptoms and bloating reflect heterogeneous pathways including nutrient sensing, visceral hypersensitivity, altered transit, and microbiota interactions; pragmatic management can include targeted dietary modification and mechanism-guided therapies recognizing frequent overlap with FD and IBS [^112H96fF] [^1125sthy].

> I should confirm medication contributors that mimic or exacerbate upper GI symptoms. Oral bisphosphonates can cause esophagitis, ulceration, and severe retrosternal pain or heartburn; if present, strict administration technique and, if symptomatic, discontinuation and evaluation are indicated to prevent complications [^113unPR4] [^1145VxJf].

> Hmm, wait a minute, the original trace ended at "Age" without finishing the thought; that is incomplete. Let me correct and be explicit: older age increases concern for organic pathology in dyspepsia, and historical practice used age thresholds with alarm features to triage endoscopy, although cancer yield remains low in uninvestigated dyspepsia, so age should be integrated with the presence of alarm signs rather than used in isolation [^111AwcgC] [^113hHJ11].

> I should double-check the remote GI bleeding detail. If the prior hematochezia or melena was never evaluated, the diagnostic threshold changes; a focused history, exam, and labs are needed to reassess severity and likely source, and colonoscopy or anorectal evaluation should be considered to exclude structural causes before attributing current symptoms solely to a functional disorder [^1175KzQd].

> Let me reconsider the sequencing of endoscopy. In the absence of alarm features, many patients with dyspepsia can be managed noninvasively first with H. pylori test-and-treat and a limited empiric trial, recognizing that most will have FD and that endoscopy rarely changes the diagnosis, though a normal EGD is ultimately required by criteria if a formal FD label is applied or if symptoms persist despite appropriate initial management [^114UTqsE] [^113hHJ11].

> Finally, I need to ensure a clear follow-up plan. If symptoms remain bothersome beyond 8 weeks despite appropriate initial steps, if alarms emerge, or if there is recurrence of bleeding, escalation to targeted investigations including endoscopy and mechanism-focused testing is warranted, while revisiting the differential among FD, IBS, GERD, and gastroparesis based on evolving clinical data [^116xfwW3] [^114UTqsE].

---

This patient's chronic bloating, postprandial pain [^116xfwW3], intermittent heartburn, and constipation with a remote episode of hematochezia most likely reflect functional dyspepsia [^114UTqsE] with overlapping IBS-C [^111iUFFT]. The single remote episode of blood is reassuring but warrants a colonoscopy [^1175KzQd] if not previously done to exclude polyps or malignancy. Initial workup should include CBC, CMP, TSH, celiac serology [^1113botT], and fecal calprotectin [^11232DYU]; if heartburn persists, a PPI trial is reasonable [^111scUUW], and if symptoms are refractory, consider gastric emptying studies [^117Pgb3J] or SIBO testing [^114CjpTM]. Management should focus on dietary measures (low FODMAP, fiber, small frequent meals) [^1125sthy], osmotic laxatives [^114GVbRV], and neuromodulators if needed [^114UTqsE] [^111iUFFT]; refer to gastroenterology if alarm features develop or symptoms persist despite therapy [^114CjpTM].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Given the chronicity and symptom pattern, **consider the following differential diagnoses**.

- **Functional dyspepsia (FD)**: Characterized by postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, and bloating without structural disease [^114UTqsE].

- **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**: Chronic abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits (constipation-predominant in this case) [^111iUFFT].

- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Intermittent heartburn, especially after heavier meals [^111scUUW].

- **Gastroparesis**: Delayed gastric emptying causing bloating, early satiety, and postprandial pain [^117Pgb3J].

- **Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)**: Bloating, abdominal discomfort, and altered bowel habits [^114CjpTM].

- **Celiac disease**: Bloating, abdominal pain, and altered bowel habits [^1113botT].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Less likely given the absence of recurrent hematochezia, but should be considered [^11232DYU].

- **Colorectal neoplasia**: Given the remote episode of hematochezia, although unlikely, it should be excluded [^1175KzQd].

---

## Initial diagnostic evaluation

A **structured diagnostic approach** is recommended.

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate for anemia or inflammation [^114GVbRV].

- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**: Assess liver and renal function [^114GVbRV].

- **Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**: Screen for hypothyroidism [^1139rLft].

- **Celiac serology**: Tissue transglutaminase IgA and total IgA [^1113botT].

- **Fecal calprotectin**: Screen for intestinal inflammation [^11232DYU].

---

### Imaging and endoscopy

Imaging and endoscopy should include **colonoscopy** [^1175KzQd] to exclude polyps, malignancy, or IBD given the remote episode of hematochezia. Consider upper endoscopy (EGD) if upper GI symptoms persist or alarm features develop [^113hHJ11], and use abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for gallstones or other structural abnormalities.

---

### Specialized tests

Specialized tests include a **gastric emptying study** for suspected gastroparesis [^114Y3Mkr] and a **hydrogen breath test** for suspected SIBO [^114CjpTM].

---

## Management strategies

Management should be **individualized** based on the working diagnosis.

---

### Dietary modifications

Dietary modifications include a **low FODMAP diet** for bloating and IBS symptoms [^1125sthy] and **small, frequent meals** to support functional dyspepsia and gastroparesis [^112AcLqM]. **Increased dietary fiber** is recommended for constipation-predominant IBS [^1139rLft].

---

### Pharmacological therapy

- **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**: For GERD symptoms [^113AnTt4].

- **Prokinetic agents**: For gastroparesis (e.g. metoclopramide, domperidone) [^114Y3Mkr].

- **Osmotic laxatives**: For constipation (e.g. polyethylene glycol) [^1139rLft].

- **Neuromodulators**: Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants or SSRIs for functional dyspepsia or IBS [^114UTqsE].

---

### Behavioral and lifestyle interventions

Behavioral and lifestyle interventions include **cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)** for functional GI disorders [^1125sthy] and **regular physical activity** to improve GI motility and symptoms [^114GVbRV].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

In the following situations, **refer to a gastroenterologist** [^114CjpTM].

- **Alarm features**: Weight loss, recurrent hematochezia, anemia, or dysphagia.

- **Refractory symptoms**: Persistent symptoms despite initial management.

- **Complex diagnostic evaluation**: Need for specialized testing (e.g. manometry, pH monitoring).

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

Functional GI disorders **significantly impact quality of life** [^114WKmZj], causing physical discomfort, emotional distress, and social limitations. Effective management strategies, including dietary modifications, pharmacological therapy, and behavioral interventions, can improve symptoms and quality of life [^1125sthy].

---

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^116xfwW3]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

In the absence of alarm symptoms or signs, functional dyspepsia (FD) is highly probable when epigastric pain or burning, early satiation, and/or postprandial fullness are reported, in line with the Rome IV criteria. Endoscopy is unlikely to change the diagnosis even though a normal endoscopy is required as part of these diagnostic criteria. In routine clinical practice, clinicians can use the recently proposed Rome IV clinical criteria, which require the presence of one or more of these four cardinal symptoms if reported as bothersome for more than 8 weeks. Other symptoms can coexist but should not be predominant.

Information about the characteristics of pain should be recorded. Usually, in FD, pain is in the upper abdomen or epigastrium and may be present in fasting conditions, and/or precipitated or exacerbated by meal ingestion. Unlike in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), abdominal pain in FD is unrelated to the need to defecate. This differentiation may help identify patients with FD from those with IBS or with overlapping IBS, which can be of any subtype and is reported to occur in up to 50% of patients. In this situation, the patient will report the presence of two different types of abdominal pain, one related and one unrelated to defecation.

Other functional bowel disorders, including functional diarrhea, functional constipation, or functional abdominal bloating and distension, can also overlap with FD. Gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms also coexist in approximately one-third of patients with FD. In this situation, evidence suggests that clinicians tend to favor a particular management approach.

### New insights into irritable bowel syndrome: From pathophysiology to treatment [^111iUFFT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with IBS are classified into subtypes according to their predominant bowel habit. These include IBS-D, IBS-C, and mixed IBS (IBS-M), a combination of the previous two. Usually, IBS-D and IBS-C have similar prevalence. Common signs and symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain, bloating, straining during defecation, sensation of incomplete evacuation, mucus with stools, urgency, postprandial symptoms, depression, and anxiety.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^114UTqsE]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

Over the last 35 years, definitions of dyspepsia have evolved from a broad one, which included any symptom felt to be attributable to the stomach and duodenum, including heartburn, nausea, or vomiting, to one that includes only the cardinal symptoms of epigastric pain or burning, postprandial fullness, or early satiation (the feeling of fullness during ingestion of a meal, which acts as a terminating factor). Recent definitions recognize that belching, nausea, or upper abdominal bloating can also be present, but heartburn alone is not a symptom of dyspepsia, although it can coexist. Vomiting is atypical and, if present, should prompt consideration of another disorder. Functional dyspepsia (FD) is diagnosed in the absence of a structural abnormality to explain the symptoms. Patients must be investigated to exclude evidence of organic, systemic, or metabolic disease to make a diagnosis by definition.

Symptoms alone are not reliable in distinguishing functional from organic causes of dyspepsia. Nevertheless, 80% of people with dyspepsia will be diagnosed with FD following endoscopy. FD is defined according to symptom-based diagnostic criteria developed by the Rome Foundation and is classified into two distinct subtypes: postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS). Clinically, the EPS subtype distinguishes those with epigastric pain or burning, often present regardless of meals, from those with PDS who report early satiation and postprandial fullness, mainly triggered by meals.

The AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering testing for celiac disease earlier in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) or hypermobility spectrum disorders who report a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, not only those with diarrhea. There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine testing for disaccharidase deficiencies or other diet-mediated mechanisms as causes of gastrointestinal symptoms in hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders.

Regarding medical management for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically the management of gastrointestinal symptoms, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend focusing on the most prominent gastrointestinal symptoms and abnormal gastrointestinal function test results in hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome/mast cell activation syndrome. Treatment should also include symptoms attributable to postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and/or mast cell activation syndrome, in addition to general disorders of gut-brain interaction and gastrointestinal motility disorder treatment.

### Structured gastroenterological intervention and improved outcome for patients with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms following pelvic radiotherapy [^1161aDHa]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Fifty percent of patients develop chronic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms following pelvic radiotherapy that adversely affect quality of life. Fewer than 20% are referred to a gastroenterologist. We aimed to determine if structured gastroenterological evaluation is of benefit to this patient group.

Sixty patients with GI symptoms at ≥ 6 months after radical pelvic radiotherapy were identified prospectively from oncology clinics in this service evaluation. Those requiring urgent investigation were excluded. Patients were assessed at baseline using patient-reported questionnaires: inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ), Vaizey incontinence questionnaire, and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) pelvis questionnaire. Participants were referred for gastroenterological evaluation using an algorithmic approach. Further assessments were made at 3 and 6 months.

Twenty men and 36 women with primary gynecological (31), urological (17), or lower GI (8) tumors were included (mean age, 58.5 years). The median time from radiotherapy to baseline assessment was 3.0 years. Multiple GI symptoms were reported (median, 8; range, 4–16) including frequency, urgency, loose stool, fecal incontinence, flatulence, bloating/distension, and rectal bleeding. Common diagnoses included radiation proctopathy, bile acid malabsorption, diverticulosis, and colonic polyps. Statistically significant improvements in all questionnaire scores between baseline and 6 months were found: IBDQ (p = 0.014), Vaizey (p < 0.0005), and CTCAE rectum-bowel subset (p < 0.0005).

Regarding medical management for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically in the context of managing gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering treatment for suspected mast cell activation syndrome using histamine receptor antagonists and/or mast cell stabilizers. It is advised to avoid triggers such as certain foods, alcohol, strong smells, temperature changes, and mechanical stimuli (such as friction). Additionally, emotional distress, pollen, mold, or specific medications like opioids, NSAIDs, and iodinated contrast should be avoided.

### Revisiting Montreal: New insights into symptoms and their causes, and implications for the future of GERD [^113mQmdd]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Are typical symptoms indicative of acid reflux?

Even the "typical" symptoms of GERD, defined in the Montreal Consensus as heartburn and regurgitation, may not be that typical, with their diagnostic value questioned in the Diamond study. In this study, consecutive patients presenting to their family practitioner with upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were asked to identify their most troublesome symptom. These data were then analyzed according to whether or not patients had GERD based on objective investigation, defined as either the presence of reflux esophagitis, pathologic esophageal acid exposure (pH > 4 for > 5.5% of the time over a 24-hour period), or a positive symptom association probability (SAP) for acid reflux. Tellingly, only 49% of patients with objectively defined GERD selected heartburn or regurgitation as their most troublesome symptom.

Furthermore, the use of esomeprazole was found to be neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of GERD in this study, clearly challenging the previously held adage that a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) response test could help to distinguish patients with GERD from those with other conditions. This is disappointing, though not necessarily surprising. Evidence from a recent study of 2,665 individuals from Russia, Brazil, the UK, and USA, in which patients were asked to describe symptoms in their own words, suggests that heartburn (as interpreted by clinicians) may encompass at least two distinct symptoms, potentially with different etiologies. Indeed, the complex etiology of presumed reflux-induced symptoms is at the heart of the matter.

### Clinical guideline: Management of gastroparesis [^114Y3Mkr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for gastroparesis, specifically with respect to the evaluation for underlying causes, the ACG 2013 guidelines recommend inquiring about a history of viral infection preceding the onset of symptoms, which may suggest postviral gastroparesis. It is important to recognize that this condition may improve over time in some patients.

### Gas, bloating, and belching: Approach to evaluation and management [^114GVbRV]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Gas, bloating, and belching are associated with a variety of conditions but are most commonly caused by functional gastrointestinal disorders. These disorders are characterized by disordered motility and visceral hypersensitivity that are often worsened by psychological distress. An organized approach to the evaluation of symptoms fosters trusting therapeutic relationships. Patients can be reliably diagnosed without exhaustive testing and can be classified as having gastric bloating, small bowel bloating, bloating with constipation, or belching disorders. Functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic idiopathic constipation are the most common causes of these disorders. For presumed functional dyspepsia, noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori and eradication of confirmed infection (i.e. test and treat) are more cost-effective than endoscopy. Patients with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome should be tested for celiac disease. Patients with chronic constipation should have a rectal examination to evaluate for dyssynergic defecation. Empiric therapy is a reasonable initial approach to functional gastrointestinal disorders, including acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors for functional dyspepsia, antispasmodics for irritable bowel syndrome, and osmotic laxatives and increased fiber for chronic idiopathic constipation. Nonceliac sensitivities to gluten and other food components are increasingly recognized, but highly restrictive exclusion diets have insufficient evidence to support their routine use except in confirmed celiac disease.

### Comparison of symptoms, healthcare utilization, and treatment in diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome [^112Vjhp3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A significantly greater percentage of diagnosed patients had gastrointestinal symptoms for ≥ 10 years compared with undiagnosed individuals (55% vs. 18%, respectively; P < 0.05). Conversely, a significantly greater percentage of undiagnosed individuals had symptoms for < 3 years compared with diagnosed patients (51% vs. 14%, respectively; P < 0.05).

Diagnosed patients were twice as likely to have severe gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. severity score, 6 or 7) than undiagnosed individuals (16% vs. 8%, respectively; P < 0.05), whereas undiagnosed individuals were significantly more likely to have mild symptoms (i.e. severity score, 1 or 2) compared with diagnosed patients (6% vs. 3%, respectively; P < 0.05).

A greater percentage of diagnosed patients experienced more severe symptoms compared with individuals in the undiagnosed group for discomfort/pain (diagnosed, 36% vs. undiagnosed, 24%), diarrhea (52% vs. 29%), loose/mushy stools (49% vs. 29%), urgency (61% vs. 41%), and bloating (26% vs. 20%); P < 0.05 for all comparisons.

Diagnosed patients had more disruptive IBS-associated symptoms than individuals in the undiagnosed group, including discomfort/pain (32% vs. 27%), diarrhea (61% vs. 40%), loose/mushy stools (44% vs. 27%), and urgency (64% vs. 46%); P < 0.05 for all comparisons. Bloating occurred in a comparable percentage of individuals between the groups (19% vs. 18%). Yet, undiagnosed individuals had more "confounder" symptoms (i.e. heartburn, gastric reflux, constipation) than diagnosed patients.

### Mechanisms underlying food-triggered symptoms in disorders of gut-brain interactions [^112H96fF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

There has been a dramatic increase in clinical studies examining the relationship between disorders of gut-brain interactions and symptoms evoked by food ingestion in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, but study design is challenging to verify valid endpoints. Consequently, mechanistic studies demonstrating biological relevance, biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets are greatly needed. This review highlights emerging mechanisms related to nutrient sensing and tasting, maldigestion, physical effects with underlying visceral hypersensitivity, allergy and immune mechanisms, food–microbiota interactions, and gut-brain signaling, with a focus on patients with functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. Many patients suffering from disorders of gut-brain interactions exhibit these mechanism(s), but which ones and which specific properties may vary widely from patient to patient. Thus, in addition to identifying these mechanisms and the need for further studies, biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets are identified that could enable enriched patient groups to be studied in future clinical trials examining the role of food in the generation of gut and non-gut symptoms.

Regarding medical management for immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity, specifically for gastrointestinal toxicity evaluation, the AGA 2021 guidelines recommend considering early stool testing for inflammatory markers, such as lactoferrin and calprotectin, in patients with grade ≥ 2 colitis/diarrhea (defined as more than 4 bowel movements daily above baseline) according to CTCAE version 5. This recommendation is also applicable to selected patients with less-severe diarrhea to help stratify high-risk patients for endoscopic evaluation.

### ACG clinical guidelines: Diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^1113botT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic diarrhea, specifically concerning the evaluation for celiac disease, the ACG 2013 guidelines recommend testing for celiac disease in patients exhibiting symptoms, signs, or laboratory evidence suggestive of malabsorption. These symptoms may include chronic diarrhea with weight loss, steatorrhea, postprandial abdominal pain, and bloating.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British Society of Gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^114CnLju]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Reported changes in stool frequency or form are characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and form part of its definition, which relies on symptom-based criteria and negative physical examination. Although stool weight does not usually increase in IBS, symptom reporting is the basis for diagnosis, and stool weight is rarely measured early in the course of investigation. Consequently, a considerable overlap between functional bowel disease and true 'diarrhoea' occurs. As IBS may affect 10–13% of the population, there is potential for inappropriate investigation of patients reporting diarrhoeal symptoms. Conversely, a new onset of diarrhoea may reflect serious organic diseases, such as colonic neoplasia. The wide diagnostic potential given similar reported symptoms makes the introduction of specific guidelines challenging.

The broad range of conditions that lead to diarrhoea also complicates the establishment of prescriptive investigative pathways. Diarrhoea may result from: (a) colonic neoplasia; (b) inflammation; (c) small bowel inflammation; (d) small bowel malabsorption; (e) maldigestion due to pancreatic insufficiency; or (f) motility disorders. It can be difficult to differentiate these conditions on clinical grounds alone. The decision on whether to focus investigations on any one of these areas remains largely a matter of clinical judgement.

### The patient with irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms: When to investigate and how [^11232DYU]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common disorder whose clinical presentation varies considerably between patients as well as within the same individual over time. Many of its symptoms, such as pain, diarrhea, constipation, and bloating, may be manifestations of a host of other gastrointestinal diseases; some accompanied by increased mortality. This presents the clinician with a real dilemma: how to sensibly investigate the patient in which one suspects IBS but there is a nagging doubt that "it could be something else"? Could one miss "something serious"? This short review attempts to provide both an evidence-based response to these vexing questions and a practical guide to detecting alternative diagnoses in the subject with IBS-type symptoms.

- **Recent findings**: Clinical features, patient demographics, and the clinical context can help to significantly narrow the differential diagnosis of the individual with IBS-type symptoms and may permit a positive diagnosis of IBS. The advent of noninvasive serological and stool tests has greatly facilitated differentiation from celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, respectively. In the older, female diarrhea sufferer, microscopic colitis should be considered. The role of bile acid diarrhea in the individual with diarrhea-predominant IBS is emphasized; the status of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in IBS remains uncertain.

- **Summary**: Attention to detail in the clinical evaluation of the individual with IBS-like symptoms will facilitate a selective and targeted approach to investigation.

### Assessment of reflux symptom severity: Methodological options and their attributes [^112gjryQ]. Gut (2004). Low credibility.

Despite major advances in our understanding of reflux disease, the management of this disorder still presents many challenges. Reduction of heartburn is the most readily apparent objective for patients with reflux disease. Thus, the ability to measure heartburn accurately is of fundamental importance to clinical research in reflux disease. Here, the available data on the assessment of reflux symptoms — predominantly heartburn — in clinical trials of symptomatic reflux disease are examined.

### Gastric sensorimotor function and its clinical measurement [^117QWBom]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Low credibility.

Gastroduodenal symptoms are highly prevalent, with underlying sensorimotor dysfunction contributing in many patients. Common symptoms include early satiation, postprandial fullness, epigastric bloating, pain or burning, nausea, and vomiting, which collectively affect over 7% of adults. However, the clinical evaluation of these symptoms remains challenging, with tests of gastric function limited in their ability or availability to separate specific patient subgroups or guide targeted care.

In the edition of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, Silver et al. present new data showing correlations between patterns of intragastric meal distribution and symptom profiles in a large series of patients undergoing gastric emptying scintigraphy. Studies of this type are important as they motivate understanding beyond existing disease labels and orient focus toward deeper mechanistic profiling. This brief review provides an overview of gastric sensorimotor function and profiles several emerging methods of clinical evaluation. Perspectives are provided on accommodation testing, gastric emptying, measuring gastric myoelectrical activity (including new approaches), and antroduodenal manometry. Although gastric physiology is complex, recent progress has been encouraging, with the heterogeneous pathophysiology of gastric symptoms continuing to be unraveled and new techniques for evaluating gastric function and symptoms emerging.

### The management of adult patients with severe chronic small intestinal dysmotility [^115JoXaM]. Gut (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, specifically in relation to the initial evaluation, BSG 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining workups judiciously. These workups should include radiology, radioisotope studies, manometry, autoimmune screens, and histology, in accordance with guidelines. When interpreting results, take into account the presence of certain drugs (such as opioids, cyclizine, or anticholinergic drugs), severe malnutrition, or an eating disorder.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: Straightening the road from the Rome criteria [^115WB1rB]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Low credibility.

A sequence of consensus-based Rome criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been published since 1989. The fundamental definition, based on abdominal pain in association with bowel dysfunction, has been consistent. However, two major changes occurred in the Rome II and IV criteria. The former change involved "splitting off" symptoms that were not consistently associated with pain, such as functional constipation, diarrhea, and bloating. In Rome IV, the main changes were the exclusion of discomfort (in contrast to pain) and the more stringent frequency criteria for the pain to be eligible for a diagnosis of IBS; specifically, on average, at least one day per week in the last three months.

Validation studies of the consensus, symptom-based criteria have identified multiple deficiencies that question the rationale for "splitting" the different syndromes. These studies favor simpler identification of the classical symptoms: abdominal pain, bowel dysfunction, and bloating, along with exclusion of alarm symptoms. Advances in the identification of actionable biomarkers related to the symptoms suggestive of functional gastrointestinal disorders have the potential to usher in a change in practice. This change would shift from a positive diagnosis of symptom complexes followed by empirical treatment to the identification of the mechanisms causing the symptoms and targeted therapy.

### Involvement of digestive system in COVID-19: Manifestations, pathology, management and challenges [^1132VZhr]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a significant threat to global health. Although most COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, some exhibit gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as diarrhea, loss of appetite, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain as the primary complaints. These features may be attributable to the following factors:

- **Viral infection mechanism**: COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is highly expressed in GI epithelial cells, providing a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
- **Viral presence in stool specimens**: SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been found in stool specimens of infected patients. Notably, 20% of patients showed a prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples even after the virus converted to negative in the respiratory system.

These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of actively infecting and replicating in the GI tract. Furthermore, GI infection could be the initial manifestation preceding respiratory symptoms; cases have been reported where patients experienced only digestive symptoms without respiratory symptoms as their clinical presentation. Thus, understanding the implications of digestive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is of great importance.

In this review, we summarize recent findings on the epidemiology of GI tract involvement, potential mechanisms of fecal-oral transmission, GI and liver manifestations, and pathological/histological features in patients with COVID-19. We also address the diagnosis and management of patients with pre-existing GI and liver diseases, as well as precautions for effective treatment.

### Minor digestive symptoms and their impact in the general population: A cluster analysis approach [^114WKmZj]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The impact of digestive symptoms is multifaceted. As shown in Figure 4, the most recent minor digestive symptoms had a strong emotional and social impact, primarily affecting physical conditions with 90.5% of women reporting issues such as feeling heavy or big, feeling physically ill, and experiencing stress, discomfort in clothing, disturbed daily life, and sleeping problems. Additionally, self-image was affected in 72.5% of women, with statements like "I feel bad about my body" and "I have a bad image of my body". Vitality was also impacted in 67.3% of women, who experienced tiredness and a lack of reactivity or vitality.

- **Figure 4**: Emotional and social impact of minor gastrointestinal disorders. The 10 most frequently reported effects are shown as the percentage of the whole population reporting that particular item.

Causation is a significant factor. Figure 5 illustrates that causation was mainly linked to food type (73.6% of women), including uncooked vegetables or fruits, and behaviors like "I drink water while eating". Food habits were reported by 53.5% of women who mentioned that they "eat too quickly" or "do not chew food enough". Physiology was also notable, with 75.5% attributing causes to factors like "my intestine is too sensitive", "my intestine doesn't work properly", "I am old", and "I have a slow digestion". Lifestyle elements such as stress, tiredness, and anger were reported by 77.0%.

- **Figure 5**: Perceived causation of minor gastrointestinal disorders. The 11 most frequently reported causes are shown as the percentage of the whole population reporting that particular item.

The identification of different clusters, impact, and frequency was part of the study focus. Amongst women, the combination of symptom phraseology and pictures of feelings resulted in the identification of 11 minor digestive symptom clusters characterized by symptoms, time and place of occurrence, causation, and impact. Tables 1 and 2 detail these clusters, such as the constipation-like cluster, affecting 17.9% of the population.

### Plausibility criteria for putative pathophysiological mechanisms in functional gastrointestinal disorders: A consensus of experts [^113d5VF6]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are extremely common conditions associated with a considerable personal, social, and health economic burden. Managing FGIDs in clinical practice is challenging due to the uncertainty of symptom-based diagnosis, the high frequency of overlap between these conditions, and the limited efficacy of available therapies. It has often been argued that successful drug development and management of FGIDs require knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology. Numerous and highly variable candidate pathophysiological mechanisms have been implicated in the generation of FGID symptoms, but there is no consensus on how to best define the relevance of these disturbances.

- **Methods**: A group of international experts on FGIDs developed plausibility criteria that should be fulfilled by relevant pathophysiological mechanisms in FGIDs.

- **Results**: Five criteria are proposed: (1) the presence of the abnormality in a subset of patients, (2) temporal association between the proposed mechanism and symptom(s), (3) correlation between the level of impairment of the mechanism and symptom(s), (4) induction of the symptom(s) by provoking the pathophysiological abnormality in healthy subjects, and (5) treatment response by a therapy specifically correcting the underlying disorder or a congruent natural history of symptoms and dysfunction in the absence of specific therapy. Based on the strength of evidence for these five criteria according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, a plausibility score was derived.

### Causes, symptoms and prevention of food allergy [^116nhCQP]. Postępy Dermatologii i Alergologii (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on food allergy:

- **Definition**: Food allergy is an adverse food-stimulated immune response initiated on exposure to a given food.

- **Pathophysiology**:
	- **IgE-mediated responses**: Type 1 or early; 48%
	- **IgE-independent immune responses**: Type IV (18%), type III (10%), type II (6%)
	- **Common allergens**:
		- **Dairy and grains**: Milk, eggs, wheat
		- **Seafood and legumes**: Fish, soy, peanuts, shellfish
		- **Fruits**: Cherries, peaches, plums, apricots
		- **Nuts and seeds**: Nuts, seeds
	- **Influencing factors**: Genetic and environmental factors such as improved hygiene, lifestyle, diet, nutrition

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy in the US is estimated at 10,000 in 100,000 adults.

- **Disease course**:
	- **Immediate reaction symptoms**: Anaphylactic shock, urticaria, angioedema
	- **Late reaction symptoms**:
		- **Psychological and neurological**: Fatigue, irritability, depression, hyperactivity, insomnia, headache, poor concentration
		- **Skin and respiratory**: Paleness, itching limbs, asthma, colds, skin lesions
		- **Gastrointestinal**: Indigestion, colic, diarrhea, bloating
		- **Other**: Involuntary bedwetting
	- **Quality of life impact**: Impairs quality of life (QoL), necessitating lifelong prevention of the specific food

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The mortality risk associated with fatal anaphylaxis is less than 1%.

Regarding the medical management of acute diarrhea, particularly in relation to the selection of an antibiotic agent, the IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend empirical treatment of patients showing clinical features of sepsis and suspected to have enteric fever. This treatment should involve the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy following the collection of blood, stool, and urine cultures.

### Management of chronic abdominal distension and bloating [^1125sthy]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal bloating and distension are two of the most commonly reported gastrointestinal symptoms. Abdominal bloating is characterized by symptoms such as trapped gas, abdominal pressure, and a feeling of fullness. Abdominal distension is defined as a measurable increase in abdominal girth. These symptoms frequently co-exist, although they can occur separately. According to the Rome IV criteria, functional abdominal bloating and distension commonly coincide with other functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and functional constipation.

Abdominal bloating and distension can develop for multiple reasons, including food intolerances, a previous infection that perturbed the intestinal microbiota, disordered visceral sensation, delayed intestinal transit, or an abnormal viscero-somatic reflex. Treatment can be challenging to both patients and providers, as no regimen has been consistently successful. Successful treatment involves identifying the etiology, assessing severity, educating and reassuring patients, and setting expectations. Therapeutic options include dietary changes, probiotics, antibiotics, prokinetic agents, antispasmodics, neuromodulators, and biofeedback.

This paper reviews the epidemiology and effects of chronic bloating and distension, discusses the pathophysiology, examines appropriate diagnostic strategies, and assesses available treatment options.

### Evaluation of nausea and vomiting [^111GcL98]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally result from infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathological response to a variety of conditions. Gastrointestinal etiologies include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases. Central nervous system etiologies are primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure and typically cause other neurologic signs.

Pregnancy is the most common endocrinologic cause of nausea and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age. Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses also may cause nausea and vomiting. Evaluation should first focus on detecting emergencies or complications that require hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies.

When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms from an epidemiological perspective [^114aQiU9]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Four manuscripts on gastrointestinal problems or disorders of gut-brain interaction are discussed from an epidemiological perspective. A literature review with strict inclusion criteria highlighted the dearth of evidence-based knowledge on gastrointestinal symptoms following treatment for anorexia nervosa. An epidemiological follow-up study demonstrating the relevance of childhood abdominal pain for fasting to control weight in adolescence is used to emphasize the need to refine our approach to risk factor research in eating disorders. Two additional studies highlight the high prevalence of gastrointestinal problems in eating disorders, underscoring a need for improved consideration of these symptoms in clinical practice and eating disorder research.

### Epidemiology and burden of chronic constipation [^1139rLft]. Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on constipation:

- **Definition**: Constipation is a symptom-based disorder defined as fewer than 3 bowel movements per week.

- **Pathophysiology**: Constipation is caused by pelvic floor dysfunction, slow colonic transit, metabolic disorders (such as hypercalcemia and hypothyroidism), medications (including opiates, CCBs, and antipsychotics), neurological disorders (such as diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and spinal cord injury), IBS, and primary colonic disorders (such as strictures, cancer, anal fissure, and proctitis).

- **Epidemiology**: The overall prevalence of constipation in the US is 16%.

- **Disease course**: Anomalous regulation of neuromuscular components within the colon and anorectum, along with disruption in the corresponding ascending and descending pathways in the brain-gut axis, results in infrequent bowel movements, excessive straining, a sense of incomplete evacuation, failed or lengthy attempts to defecate, digital manipulation to evacuate stools, abdominal bloating, and hard consistency of stools.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Chronic constipation decreases quality of life and ability to function; however, only approximately 25% of patients consult physicians or use medications to manage associated symptoms.

### Episodic nature of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome [^113VXMeJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to determine whether the symptoms of diarrhea (defined as loose or watery stools), constipation (hard or lumpy stools), abdominal pain, and bloating occur in episodes rather than sporadically in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); to identify rules for defining the onset and termination of symptom episodes; and to assess the overlap of these episodes.

IBS patients kept a symptom log in which they rated the consistency of each bowel movement (BM) on the Bristol Stool Scale for 3 months. Each night, they transferred these data to an internet website and also rated abdominal pain and bloating for that day. Data were analyzed for 124 patients who completed at least 21 consecutive diary days (mean of 73 days) without taking laxative, antidiarrheal, or IBS-specific medications. For each symptom in each patient, the correlation between consecutive observations (autocorrelations) in the diary was computed to determine whether the symptom tended to occur in clusters of several instances, as would happen in episodes, versus happening randomly.

Next, different patterns by which diarrhea and nondiarrhea stools alternate were compared to identify episode definitions that captured at least 75% of loose/watery stools. A similar pattern analysis was performed for constipation. Pain and bloating episodes were defined as days with an intensity rating > 3 on a 0–10 scale. These patterns were converted into rules for defining the onset and termination of symptom episodes. Lastly, these episode definitions were used to examine the overlap of episodes.

### Binosto [^113unPR4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions**: Binosto, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Due to these possible irritant effects and the potential for worsening underlying disease, caution should be used when Binosto is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers.

Esophageal adverse experiences such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates, including alendronate sodium. In some cases, these experiences have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction. Patients should be instructed to discontinue Binosto and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain, or new or worsening heartburn.

The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates, including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to and understood by the patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Involvement of digestive system in COVID-19: Manifestations, pathology, management and challenges [^112yyxKM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has developed as a tremendous threat to global health. Although most COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, some exhibit gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like diarrhea, loss of appetite, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain as major complaints. These features may be attributable to the following facts:

- **COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)**: Its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is highly expressed in GI epithelial cells, providing a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

- **Viral presence in gastrointestinal tract**: SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been found in stool specimens of infected patients, and 20% of patients showed prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples after the virus converted to negative in the respiratory system. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to actively infect and replicate in the GI tract.

Moreover, GI infection could be the first manifestation before respiratory symptoms appear; patients suffering only digestive symptoms, without respiratory symptoms as clinical manifestations, have also been reported. Thus, the implications of digestive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 are of great importance. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the epidemiology of GI tract involvement, potential mechanisms of fecal–oral transmission, GI and liver manifestation, pathological/histological features in patients with COVID-19, and the diagnosis and management of patients with pre-existing GI and liver diseases as well as precautions.

### Effectiveness of management strategies for uninvestigated dyspepsia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113hHJ11]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia, however defined, is a frequent reason for consultation with primary care providers and gastroenterologists. Dyspeptic symptoms can cause substantial anxiety for patients who might fear that they have a serious underlying condition to account for their symptoms. This anxiety is despite the fact that upper gastrointestinal malignancy is identified at endoscopy in less than 1% of patients. Of note, the rate of upper gastrointestinal malignancy in this meta-analysis was only around 0.4%, which suggests that, among 1000 patients presenting to a primary care provider with uninvestigated dyspepsia, 996 would be cancer free on endoscopy.

This finding makes the strategy of prompt endoscopy for the evaluation of uninvestigated dyspepsia highly questionable, at least in the absence of potentially important alarm features that, arguably, would merit endoscopy in any case. A previous study in the United States estimated that the cost of detecting one upper gastrointestinal cancer in patients aged 50 or older with dyspepsia without alarm features in primary care was over $80,000 (£62,000; €72,300). Prompt endoscopy might be justifiable on the basis of providing reassurance to patients about the absence of a sinister underlying cause of their symptoms, but studies suggest this effect is relatively short-lived.

Although "test and treat" was ranked first in terms of effectiveness, and significantly limited the use of endoscopy, lower levels of dissatisfaction were found among participants randomized to prompt endoscopy. Given the lack of blinding in all of the included studies, this could influence the outcomes.

### Pathophysiology as a basis for understanding symptom complexes and therapeutic targets [^112LWBjK]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2004). Low credibility.

Sensorimotor disorders of the stomach, small intestine, and colon have a limited repertoire of clinical manifestations, and there is the potential for more than one mechanism to lead to symptoms. In many recent clinical trial programs of novel agents in neurogastroenterology, the emphasis has been primarily on symptom assessment of broad groups of patients identified by the Rome criteria. Drugs of potential value have fallen by the wayside with this approach.

We propose the paradigm is partly to blame; physiological testing should provide the basis for identifying more homogeneous populations and therapeutic targets within functional bowel disease, and this applies to the upper and lower gut. Here we summarize the evidence that certain biomarkers can, in a limited fashion, be used to predict the success of an experimental medicine in common disorders of gastrointestinal function, including the irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia.

Although the evidence is limited and is most convincingly demonstrated with examples of transit measurements for loperamide, alosetron, tegaserod, and piboserod, we perceive this paradigm that studies using validated and responsive biomarkers have an important role to play in drug development.

### Diet, food intake, and disturbed physiology in the pathogenesis of symptoms in functional dyspepsia [^112AcLqM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Functional dyspepsia (FD) remains a relatively poorly characterized gastrointestinal disorder of unknown etiology that is frequently difficult to manage. A systematic review of the literature relating to food intake and FD is summarized here. Many patients with FD report symptoms after meal ingestion, including fullness, bloating, epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting, which has been interpreted as indicative of an underlying "motor disorder of the stomach or small intestine". Such hypotheses are, however, still largely unsubstantiated, and the data that do exist are inconclusive, particularly as few studies have directly examined the temporal relationships between dyspeptic symptoms, meal ingestion, and disordered gastric motility.

Moreover, studies attempting to relate symptoms to specific disturbances in gastric motor function have, in most cases, not evaluated symptoms concurrently with the function test or have used suboptimal symptom scoring to quantify symptoms. Furthermore, the term "early satiety" has been used loosely as a symptom, rather than a quantitative measure of food intake. Currently, the most widely accepted mechanism underlying FD is visceral hypersensitivity, which may contribute to both enhanced motor and symptomatic responses to food ingestion. However, the possible contribution of food and dietary habits to the induction and/or exacerbation of dyspeptic symptoms represents a relatively new area — despite frequent reports by patients that their symptoms are often related to food ingestion, this association has not been formally assessed.

### Management advice for patients with reflux-like symptoms: an evidence-based consensus [^113QKyn6]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Heartburn and regurgitation are common symptoms, experienced regularly by 20–50% of individuals. Individuals with mild heartburn frequently use over-the-counter antacids, while those with more severe symptoms often resort to long-term use of acid-suppressant medications. This acid-centered approach is highly effective for healing reflux oesophagitis; however, it ignores the more complex aetiology of oesophageal symptoms, where dietary habits, reflux hypersensitivity, psychosocial factors, and obesity, may also play a role. The impracticality of exploring this complex symptom aetiology, compared with the pragmatic approach of using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), has led to widespread, open-ended PPI use. Unfortunately, this means reflux-like symptoms, the severity of which exhibits only a weak relationship with pathological oesophageal acid exposure, continue to impact the day-to-day lives of many individuals.

The concept that dietary and lifestyle factors can influence the likelihood of reflux-like symptoms is well accepted. However, patients are generally given minimal and inconsistent advice about implementing diet, lifestyle, and behavioral changes, despite these being low-harm, pragmatic approaches to self-management. One reason for this is a historical lack of emphasis in evidence-based clinical guidelines, which stems from a paucity of high-quality interventional studies. Ideally, guidelines and clinical advice should be based on rigorous evidence, for which randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard.

Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, excluding the esophagus, can be associated with various symptoms and conditions. These may include atopy, bowel wall thickening, bloating, peritoneal findings, weight loss, food allergies, loss of appetite, delayed puberty, ascites, abdominal pain, asthma, abdominal cramps, atopic dermatitis, and malabsorption. Additional signs include positive fecal occult blood tests (FOBT), increased blood eosinophil count, decreased serum albumin, diarrhea, allergic rhinitis, anemia, dyspepsia, vomiting, amenorrhea, faltering growth, nausea, bowel obstruction, and abdominal distension.

### Patient-reported gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with peritoneal dialysis: The prevalence, influence factors and association with quality of life [^115nz6fJ]. BMC Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

End stage renal disease (ESRD) is a complex condition where gastrointestinal symptoms related to uraemia, medications, and other comorbidities are common. Endoscopic evaluation and mucosal biopsies are ideal diagnostic methods for gastrointestinal diseases; however, their invasiveness limits their widespread use in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Several scales exist to evaluate functional gastrointestinal symptoms in dialysis patients, including Rome I, Rome II, Rome III, and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS). The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in PD patients, as assessed by different scales, varies greatly, ranging from 14.2% to 90.3%.

- **Pathogenesis and evidence base**: The underlying pathogenesis of gastrointestinal symptoms in PD patients remains unclear. The evidence base for these symptoms in dialysis patients is limited, necessitating further investigation into preventable causes and potential interventions in future research.

- **Influence of PD treatment**: Since dextrose dialysate is indwelled into the peritoneal cavity of PD patients, the particularity of PD treatment might affect gastrointestinal function through delayed gastric emptying, increased intraperitoneal pressure, and decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Further study is warranted to understand the influence factors of gastrointestinal symptoms in PD patients.

- **Impact on quality of life (QOL)**: Gastrointestinal symptoms may significantly impact the QOL of PD patients. Although previous studies have explored the relationship between these symptoms and QOL in dialysis patients, further research is required for comprehensive understanding.

### Gastric sensorimotor function and its clinical measurement [^116J56ZA]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Low credibility.

Gastroduodenal symptoms are highly prevalent, with underlying sensorimotor dysfunction contributing in many patients. Common symptoms include early satiation, postprandial fullness, epigastric bloating, pain or burning, nausea, and vomiting, which collectively affect over 7% of adults. However, the clinical evaluation of these symptoms remains challenging, with tests of gastric function remaining limited in their ability or availability to separate specific patient subgroups or guide targeted care.

In the edition of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, Silver et al. present new data showing correlations between patterns of intragastric meal distribution and symptom profiles in a large series of patients undergoing gastric emptying scintigraphy. Studies of this type are important, as they motivate understanding beyond existing disease labels and orient focus toward deeper mechanistic profiling. This brief review provides an overview of gastric sensorimotor function and profiles several emerging methods of clinical evaluation. Perspectives are provided on accommodation testing, gastric emptying, measuring gastric myoelectrical activity including new approaches, and antroduodenal manometry. Although gastric physiology is complex, recent progress has been encouraging, with the heterogeneous pathophysiology of gastric symptoms continuing to be unraveled, and new techniques for evaluating gastric function and symptoms emerging.

### Ibandronate sodium [^1145VxJf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions**: Ibandronate sodium, similar to other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Due to these potential irritant effects and the possibility of exacerbating underlying conditions, caution is advised when administering ibandronate sodium to patients with active upper gastrointestinal issues, such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers.

Esophageal adverse experiences, including esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, and esophageal erosions — occasionally with bleeding and, rarely, followed by esophageal stricture or perforation — have been reported in patients receiving oral bisphosphonates. In some cases, these conditions have been severe and required hospitalization. Therefore, physicians should be vigilant for any signs or symptoms indicating a potential esophageal reaction. Patients should be instructed to discontinue ibandronate sodium and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain, or new or worsening heartburn.

The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be heightened in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates, fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6 to 8 oz) of water, or continue taking oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Hence, it is critically important that complete dosing instructions are thoroughly explained to, and understood by, the patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION [2.2]).

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^1169Hx9a]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Disturbances of gastric and intestinal motor functions such as gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, enteric dysmotility, IBS, and constipation affect a large proportion of the population worldwide, impair quality of life, and cause considerable health-care costs. Assessment of gastrointestinal motility in these patients can serve to establish diagnosis and to guide therapy. Comprehensive consensus papers published in 2008 and 2011 detailed how to evaluate and interpret gastric, small intestinal, and colonic motility by intraluminal measurements and transit tests in clinical practice.

Advances in diagnostic techniques for the evaluation of gastrointestinal motor function necessitate an update about indications for the selection and performance of currently available tests, how motility disorders can be differentiated and classified based on these tests, and how the results guide treatment decisions, as noted in this Consensus Statement. A panel of international motility experts has re-examined these issues and provides concise information on test principles, practical performance, and interpretation of individual tests. Further details on these topics will be provided in technical position statements that will be published separately.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^112QzyJT]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Disturbances of gastric, intestinal, and colonic motor and sensory functions affect a large proportion of the population worldwide, impair quality of life, and cause considerable healthcare costs. Assessment of gastrointestinal motility in these patients can serve to establish diagnosis and guide therapy. Major advances in diagnostic techniques during the past 5–10 years have led to this update about indications for and selection and performance of currently available tests. As symptoms have poor concordance with gastrointestinal motor dysfunction, clinical motility testing is indicated in patients in whom there is no evidence of causative mucosal or structural diseases such as inflammatory or malignant disease.

Transit tests using radiopaque markers, scintigraphy, breath tests, and wireless motility capsules are noninvasive. Other tests of gastrointestinal contractility or sensation usually require intubation, typically represent second-line investigations limited to patients with severe symptoms, and are performed at only specialized centers. This Consensus Statement details recommended tests as well as useful clinical alternatives for investigation of gastric, small bowel, and colonic motility. The article provides recommendations on how to classify gastrointestinal motor disorders based on test results and describes how test results guide treatment decisions.

### International consensus on the diagnosis and management of dumping syndrome [^116CuTHM]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Early dumping syndrome is characterized by:

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: abdominal pain, cramps, bloating, borborygmi, nausea, diarrhea
- **Vasomotor symptoms**: fatigue, a desire to lie down after meals, flushing, palpitations, perspiration, tachycardia, hypotension, syncope (rarely)

This statement is endorsed with an overall agreement of 100%: A+ 95%, A 5%, A− 0%, D− 0%, D 0%, D+ 0%, graded B.

Late dumping syndrome usually occurs 1–3 hours following a meal and is characterized by reactive hypoglycemia. The statement is endorsed with an overall agreement of 95%: A+ 85%, A 10%, A− 5%, D− 0%, D 0%, D+ 0%, graded A.

Symptoms of early dumping syndrome are attributed to the rapid passage of nutrients to the small intestine, which activates a cascade of pathophysiological events. The arrival of hyperosmolar contents in the small intestine triggers:

- **Pathophysiological changes**: shift of fluid from the intravascular component to the intestinal lumen, decreased circulating blood volume, duodenal or jejunal distention, release of several gastrointestinal peptide hormones

These changes trigger symptoms such as tachycardia, hypotension, syncope (rarely), and abdominal cramps. Provocative tests for assessing dumping syndrome, such as a modified oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), have shown that most of these symptoms, or their consequences (increased pulse rate and rise in the hematocrit level), are already present at 30 minutes after the meal. Late dumping syndrome can be attributed to the development of hyperinsulinemic, or reactive, hypoglycemia.

### Dyspepsia [^111AwcgC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia refers to pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen. This symptom is remarkably common, with 1-year prevalence rates averaging 25% in the community. Symptoms suggestive of the irritable bowel syndrome and reflux disease frequently overlap but do not form part of the definition of dyspepsia. Electrical and other stimuli can cause similar or different symptoms in various patients, and even the site to which symptoms are referred varies considerably. Dyspeptic symptoms are therefore a relatively poor guide to the origin or nature of any disturbances in the gut.

Identification of patients who require further investigation to rule out serious structural disease, such as peptic ulcer disease or cancer, is a key issue because unaided clinical diagnosis is unreliable. The use of an age threshold (typically 45 years) and the identification of alarm features, including weight loss, repeated vomiting, and signs of bleeding, seem to be valid based on the limited evidence available. Dyspeptic symptoms fall into distinct subgroups resembling the perceived clinical entities of ulcer-like and dysmotility-like dyspepsia. Unfortunately, because of overlap with reflux symptoms and between the subgroups, the clinical significance of these groups remains highly questionable. A focus on symptom predominance may be more rewarding.

The lack of validated outcome measures has hampered clinical studies and led to the development of complex outcome measures that integrate and weigh different symptoms or other indirect indicators of outcome into a general score.

### Digestive manifestations in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 [^116ukDWJ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

The prevalence and significance of digestive manifestations in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain uncertain. We aimed to assess the prevalence, spectrum, severity, and significance of digestive manifestations in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified across a geographically diverse alliance of medical centers in North America. Data pertaining to baseline characteristics, symptomatology, laboratory assessment, imaging, and endoscopic findings from the time of symptom onset until discharge or death were abstracted manually from electronic health records to characterize the prevalence, spectrum, and severity of digestive manifestations. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between digestive manifestations and severe outcomes related to COVID-19.

- **Results**: A total of 1992 patients across 36 centers met eligibility criteria and were included. Overall, 53% of patients experienced at least one gastrointestinal symptom at any time during their illness, most commonly diarrhea (34%), nausea (27%), vomiting (16%), and abdominal pain (11%). In 74% of cases, gastrointestinal symptoms were judged to be mild. In total, 35% of patients developed an abnormal alanine aminotransferase or total bilirubin level; these were increased to less than 5 times the upper limit of normal in 77% of cases.

After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at any time (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.76–1.15) or liver test abnormalities on admission…

### Revisiting Montreal: New insights into symptoms and their causes, and implications for the future of GERD [^112wfT7t]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-related symptoms, their relative likelihood of response to acid-suppressive therapy based on the literature, and the presumed importance of acid reflux for symptom generation based on these findings are discussed. Smaller arrows underneath each symptom indicate the direction of the shift in response to acid suppression when patients are selected based on the presence (RE+) or absence (RE−) of reflux esophagitis, or the presence (pH+) or absence (pH−) of pathologic esophageal acid exposure. The relative position of each symptom and the size of the arrows is not to scale.

In summary, heartburn is assumed to be the quintessential acid-related symptom and, as such, correlates most frequently with pathologic esophageal acid exposure and response to acid-suppressive therapy. The response of heartburn (and regurgitation) to acid suppression is higher in RE+ patients than in RE− patients, consistent with RE being a good proxy for pathologic esophageal acid exposure in lieu of pH-testing. The relative response of symptoms to acid suppression decreases as their dependence on pathologic esophageal acid exposure decreases. However, even for symptoms such as chest pain and cough, response rates to acid suppression can be enhanced by identifying patients who have pathologic esophageal acid exposure (pH+), albeit with a diminishing effect as symptom etiology becomes increasingly multifactorial.

Given the above, it is not surprising that the proportion of reflux-related symptoms associated with non-acid reflux jumps drastically to around 80% in patients.

### Comparison of symptoms, healthcare utilization, and treatment in diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome [^11194Hy9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain associated with altered bowel function. This may include pain related to defecation and changes in stool frequency or appearance. Additional symptoms of IBS may involve straining, fecal urgency, and bloating. IBS can be further subdivided based on stool consistency: constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), or mixed bowel habit pattern (IBS-M). Importantly, patients with IBS report reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL) compared to individuals without IBS.

As many as 48 million individuals in the United States are believed to be affected by IBS annually, yet up to 75% of patients with IBS may lack a formal medical diagnosis. Although diagnostic symptom criteria for IBS exist, they are primarily employed in clinical research studies and not routinely in clinical practice. In a U.S. study utilizing a large health insurance database, patients with IBS were most commonly diagnosed by an internist (68%) rather than a gastroenterologist (13%). In a European study conducted by Hungin et al, which surveyed 3,880 participants with IBS symptoms, it was suggested that primary care physicians might play an even greater role in IBS diagnosis and management. The authors found that the majority of patients with medically diagnosed IBS sought medical care from primary care physicians (90%) rather than gastroenterologists (28%). Of symptomatic individuals without a medical diagnosis of IBS, Hungin et al. found, for a European cohort, that…

### Revisiting Montreal: New insights into symptoms and their causes, and implications for the future of GERD [^112yF5dS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

The relationship between sub-types of GERD and non-GERD conditions, reflux acidity, esophageal hypersensitivity (discussed later), and response to PPIs is illustrated. Reflux is more often acidic in patients with reflux esophagitis than in those without, consistent with the strong causal link between reflux esophagitis and esophageal acid exposure. Reflux esophagitis is also, as one might expect, the most responsive of all GERD manifestations to acid suppression with PPIs, with healing rates of over 80% and possibly higher with prolonged treatment. Selecting patients with reflux esophagitis strongly selects for those with pathologic esophageal acid exposure. As such, the symptoms experienced by patients with reflux esophagitis are more often related to acid and thus more responsive to PPIs than symptoms in patients without reflux esophagitis.

In addition, lower esophageal sensitivity to acid in patients with reflux esophagitis (particularly high grade) than in those with NERD may lower the degree of acid suppression required to alleviate heartburn, also contributing to better PPI response. However, when patients without reflux esophagitis who have pathologic esophageal acid exposure are selected, the estimated complete symptom response rate with PPIs is comparable to that for reflux esophagitis.

### Boniva [^116ySJXk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Boniva, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when Boniva is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers.

Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction. Patients should be instructed to discontinue Boniva and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain, or new or worsening heartburn.

The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6–8 oz) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to and understood by the patient (see dosage and administration [2.2]).

### Clinical measurement of gastrointestinal motility and function: who, when and which test [^114CjpTM]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Symptoms related to abnormal gastrointestinal motility and function are common. Oropharyngeal and oesophageal dysphagia, heartburn, bloating, abdominal pain, and alterations in bowel habits are among the most frequent reasons for seeking medical attention from internists or general practitioners and are also common reasons for referral to gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons. However, the nonspecific nature of gastrointestinal symptoms, the absence of a definitive diagnosis on routine investigations (such as endoscopy, radiology, or blood tests), and the lack of specific treatments make disease management challenging.

Advances in technology have driven progress in the understanding of many of these conditions. This review serves as an introduction to a series of consensus statements on the clinical measurements of gastrointestinal motility, function, and sensitivity. A structured, evidence-based approach to the initial assessment and empirical treatment of patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms is discussed, followed by an outline of the contribution of modern physiological measurement on the management of patients in whom the cause of symptoms has not been identified with other tests.

Discussions include the indications for and utility of high-resolution manometry, ambulatory pH-impedance monitoring, gastric emptying studies, breath tests, and investigations of anorectal structure and function in day-to-day practice and clinical management.

### Manifestations and prognosis of gastrointestinal and liver involvement in patients with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116z58wk]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

The prevalence and prognosis of digestive system involvement, including gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury in patients with COVID-19, remain largely unknown. We aimed to quantify the effects of COVID-19 on the digestive system.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published between January 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020. The websites of WHO, CDC, and major journals were also searched. We included studies that reported the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 and the prevalence of gastrointestinal findings in infected patients. Preprints, duplicate publications, reviews, editorials, single case reports, studies pertaining to other coronavirus-related illnesses, and small case series (fewer than ten cases) were excluded. Extracted data included author information, date, study design, country, patient demographics, number of participants in severe and non-severe disease groups, prevalence of clinical gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and belching, as well as digestive system comorbidities including liver disease and gastrointestinal diseases. Raw data from the studies were pooled to determine effect estimates.

- **Findings**: We analyzed findings from 35 studies, including 6,686 patients with COVID-19, that met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine studies (n = 6,064) reported gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 at diagnosis, and the pooled prevalence of digestive system comorbidities was 4% (95% CI 2–5; range 0–15; I² = 74%).

Our results underscore the importance of recognizing gastrointestinal manifestations in the clinical prognosis and management of COVID-19 patients.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^111NMd8u]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

However, NERD is an umbrella term, including at least four different patient subgroups, of whom only those where acid is implicated in symptom generation (i.e. true NERD and patients with acid hypersensitive esophagus) are clearly responsive to PPIs. This is not the case for patients who are hypersensitive to nonacidic reflux or those with functional heartburn. According to Rome IV criteria, both acid hypersensitive esophagus (now called reflux hypersensitivity) and functional heartburn are functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, which should no longer be included in GERD. The lack of abnormal acid exposure and symptom-reflux association makes patients with functional heartburn not responsive to PPIs. This subgroup of subjects may benefit from visceral analgesics (e.g. antidepressants).

Although not as frequent as previously suggested, PPI-refractory heartburn, occurring more commonly in NERD than in erosive disease, does nevertheless exist. Some 20% (range 15–27%) of correctly diagnosed and appropriately treated patients do not respond to PPI therapy at standard doses. To ascertain whether they are "truly" PPI-resistant, compliance and adherence to treatment should be checked. Indeed, PPIs are often taken inappropriately, with only 27% of GERD patients dosing their PPI correctly and only 12% dosing it optimally in a USA survey. Although a standard PPI dose can occasionally control symptoms, nocturnal intragastric acidity often remains elevated (with nocturnal acid breakthrough, NAB) in these patients. A split regimen (either standard or double dose) of PPIs b.i.d.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^117Pgb3J]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of gastroparesis requires objective evidence of clearly delayed gastric emptying in symptomatic patients. Because accelerated, normal, and delayed gastric emptying cannot be differentiated reliably based on the type or severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, objective measurement using well-validated techniques such as gastric emptying scintigraphy is required for the diagnosis of gastroparesis. To obtain a more specific symptom pattern and a better separation from functional dyspepsia with delayed emptying, gastroparesis has been proposed to require a stricter definition, for example, more than three standard deviations above the mean value in healthy volunteers.

The merit of gastric emptying studies for clinical management has been questioned due to variations in reports regarding the association between gastric emptying rates and symptoms. Several studies published during the past seven years have shown a positive association between symptoms of gastroparesis and gastric emptying times. Measurement of gastric emptying can also predict responsiveness to different therapeutic options. For instance, the presence of slow gastric emptying in patients with functional dyspepsia was associated with poor response to antidepressant medications that target visceral hypersensitivity.
