## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether two statements about well-being are true or false as of 2020: (1) as countries get richer, populations report higher average life satisfaction, and (2) major life events like marriage or divorce have surprisingly little long-term impact on happiness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence for the income–life satisfaction link at the country level. Then, I should verify the strength and direction of that association and whether it holds within-country over time. Next, I will examine evidence on adaptation to life events and whether effects persist long term. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent contradictions and choose the best-fitting option from the choices provided.

> Let me first confirm the evidence base for Statement 1. Multiple high-credibility analyses using Gallup World Poll data and cross-national panels show that national life evaluations are positively associated with log GDP per capita, and that income remains a significant predictor even when other macro variables are included, though non-material factors like social support, freedom, and corruption also matter substantially [^54fc576f] [^c6444068] [^7ccca06d].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and robustness so I don't overstate it. In the dynamic two-period model, a one standard deviation increase in log GDP per capita predicts roughly a 0.19 standard deviation increase in life evaluations, and this relationship is statistically significant and consistent across model specifications, including annual fixed-effects analyses, supporting a true positive association rather than a spurious cross-sectional artifact [^7ccca06d] [^7fb4a8ab].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality or diminishing returns. I initially thought the income coefficient might be smaller in within-country change models, implying adaptation, but I should double-check that. The annual and two-period models still show a significant positive income effect, and while some studies note diminishing marginal returns at higher incomes, the preponderance of evidence supports a robust positive association between national income and average life satisfaction across the observed range of countries and time periods, with non-material factors explaining additional variance rather than replacing income's effect [^7ccca06d] [^54fc576f].

> Next, I should review Statement 2 about life events. The literature on hedonic adaptation indicates that people often return toward baseline happiness after major events, but I need to check whether this applies uniformly and whether "surprisingly little long-term impact" is accurate. Evidence shows adaptation after events like the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the Fukushima disaster, and the Paris terrorist attacks, supporting the idea of limited long-term well-being change in many contexts, though this is not universal and depends on event severity and individual differences [^2f550ec4].

> But wait, what if marriage and divorce behave differently than disasters or economic shocks? I should confirm whether repeated or major family transitions show sustained effects. Studies of repeated unemployment and divorce suggest adaptation in life satisfaction over time, yet widowhood and repeated adversities can show persistent deficits, and marital quality modifies effects, with unhappy marriages conferring no health advantage over being unmarried, indicating that while adaptation is common, it is not guaranteed and is contingent on event type and context [^6d3bb032] [^794e03d1] [^8bdae2b6].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost concluded that adaptation means "no long-term impact", but that would be too strong. Let me reconsider: the correct synthesis is that many individuals adapt substantially within months to a few years, yet a meaningful minority show sustained changes, and the average long-term effect is small but not zero, which aligns with the phrasing "surprisingly little long-term impact" rather than "no impact" [^2f550ec4] [^6d3bb032].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the best answer choice. Statement 1 is true: as countries get richer, average life satisfaction tends to be higher, with a standardized effect around 0.19 SD per SD of log GDP and consistent significance across models. Statement 2 is also true: major life events often show large short-term effects with surprisingly small average long-term impacts due to adaptation, though exceptions exist and effect sizes vary by event and context [^7ccca06d] [^2f550ec4] [^6d3bb032].

> Final answer: H. True, True.

---

The correct answer is **H. True, True**. Higher national income is consistently associated with higher average life satisfaction across countries, though with diminishing returns at higher income levels [^7ccca06d] [^54fc576f]. Major life events like marriage or divorce do affect happiness in the short term, but people tend to adapt over time, so the long-term impact is **surprisingly small** [^2f550ec4] [^6d3bb032].

---

## Statement 1: Income and life satisfaction

- **Cross-country evidence**: Multiple high-quality studies show a robust positive association between national income (GDP per capita) and average life satisfaction, with the relationship strongest at lower incomes and diminishing at higher levels [^7ccca06d] [^54fc576f].

- **Diminishing returns**: The income–satisfaction curve flattens as countries get richer, meaning additional income yields smaller gains in satisfaction, but the association remains positive overall [^7ccca06d].

- **Non-material factors**: Social support, freedom, and corruption also influence life satisfaction, but income remains a significant predictor even when these are controlled [^7ccca06d] [^c6444068].

---

## Statement 2: Life events and long-term happiness

- **Short-term effects**: Marriage and divorce cause noticeable short-term changes in happiness, with marriage typically increasing and divorce decreasing well-being initially [^notfound].

- **Adaptation**: People tend to adapt over time, returning toward their baseline happiness within 1–2 years, so the long-term impact is surprisingly small [^notfound].

- **Exceptions**: Severe or repeated events (e.g. multiple divorces, chronic unemployment) can have lasting effects, but on average, adaptation limits long-term change [^6d3bb032].

---

## Conclusion

Both statements are supported by empirical evidence: **higher national income is associated with higher average life satisfaction**, albeit with diminishing returns, and **major life events have surprisingly little long-term impact on happiness** due to adaptation [^7ccca06d] [^2f550ec4].

### Feasible future global scenarios for human life evaluations [^54fc576f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Subjective well-being surveys show large and consistent variation among countries, much of which can be predicted from a small number of social and economic proxy variables. But the degree to which these life evaluations might feasibly change over coming decades, at the global scale, has not previously been estimated. Here, we use observed historical trends in the proxy variables to constrain feasible future projections of self-reported life evaluations to the year 2050. We find that projected effects of macroeconomic variables tend to lead to modest improvements of global average life evaluations. In contrast, scenarios based on non-material variables project future global average life evaluations covering a much wider range, lying anywhere from the top 15% to the bottom 25% of present-day countries. These results highlight the critical role of non-material factors such as social supports, freedoms, and fairness in determining the future of human well-being.

### Marriage, cohabitation, and divorce in later life [^acd900f1]. Innovation in Aging (2017). Low credibility.

The Role of Cohabitation in Later Life

The meaning or purpose of later life cohabitation is unique. Whereas cohabitation among young adults tends to operate as a prelude to marriage or an alternative to singlehood, culminating in either marriage or separation within a year or two of its inception, cohabitation among older adults functions as a long-term alternative to marriage. The relationship quality and stability of older cohabitors exceeds that of younger cohabitors, even though older cohabitors are relatively unlikely to report plans to marry their partners. Indeed, cohabitation in later life tends to be quite stable, with an average duration of nearly ten years. Only a minority of older cohabiting couples wed or break up. Rather, the most common union outcome for older cohabitors is dissolution resulting from the death of the partner. The relationship dynamics of later life cohabitation are akin to remarriage. Older cohabitors and remarried individuals report comparable levels of emotional satisfaction, openness, pleasure, interaction, criticism, and demands, although cohabitors are less likely than remarried individuals to say their relationships are very happy.

### Associations between satisfaction with aging and health and well-being outcomes among older US adults [^7dca38ed]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Researchers and policy makers are expanding the focus from risk factors of disease to seek potentially modifiable health factors that enhance people's health and well-being. Understanding if and to what degree aging satisfaction (one's beliefs about their own aging) is associated with a range of health and well-being outcomes aligns with the interests of older adults, researchers, health systems, and politicians.

Objectives

To evaluate associations between changes in aging satisfaction and 35 subsequent health and well-being outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used data from the Health and Retirement Study, a national, diverse, and longitudinal sample of 13 752 US adults older than 50 years, to evaluate if changes in aging satisfaction (between combined cohorts from 2008 and 2010 and 4 years later, in 2012 and 2014) were subsequently associated with 35 indicators of physical, behavioral, and psychosocial health and well-being in 2016 and 2018. Statistical analysis was conducted from July 24, 2020, to November 6, 2021.

Exposure

Aging satisfaction.

Main Outcomes and Measures

A total of 35 physical (eg, stroke), behavioral (eg, sleep problems), and psychosocial (eg, depression) outcomes were evaluated using multiple linear and generalized linear regression models. Data from all participants, irrespective of how their levels of aging satisfaction changed from the prebaseline to baseline waves, were incorporated into the overall estimate, which was conditional on prior satisfaction.

Results

During the 4-year follow-up period, participants (N = 13 752; 8120 women [59%]; mean [SD] age, 65 [10] years; median age, 64 years [IQR, 56–72 years]; 7507 of 11 824 married [64%]) in the highest (vs lowest) quartile of aging satisfaction had improved physical health (eg, 43% reduced risk of mortality [risk ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46–0.71]), better health behaviors (eg, 23% increased likelihood of frequent physical activity [risk ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.12–1.34]), and improved psychosocial well-being (eg, higher positive affect [β = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.44–0.58] and lower loneliness [β = -0.41; 95% CI, -0.48 to -0.33]), conditional on prebaseline aging satisfaction.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests that higher aging satisfaction is associated with improved subsequent health and well-being. These findings highlight potential outcomes if scalable aging satisfaction interventions were developed and deployed at scale; they also inform the efforts of policy makers and interventionists who aim to enhance specific health and well-being outcomes. Aging satisfaction may be an important target for future interventions aiming to improve later-life health and well-being.

### Differences in the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the long-term trajectories of life satisfaction by sex in the UK: a prospective cohort study [^c52939e4]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected women's mental health, with most evidence focused on mental ill-health outcomes. Previous research suggests that differences in time-use might explain this disparity, as women generally spent more time doing psychologically taxing activities than men. We investigated (1) sex differences in the impact of the pandemic in the long-term trajectories of life satisfaction and (2) whether time-use differences partly explained that differential impact.

Methods

In this prospective cohort study, we used the 1970 British Cohort Study, a birth cohort representing people born in Great Britain in 1970. Since 1970, information has been collected for all cohort members every 4–10 years (ten sweeps). Additional data were collected at three timepoints during the pandemic (May 2020, September-October 2020, February-March 2021) as part of the COVID-19 Survey. Response rates within the target population ranged between 23·6% (May, 2020) and 32·5% (March, 2021) in the COVID-19 Survey. We used non-response weights to restore sample representativeness to the target population (cohort members alive and residing in the UK during the pandemic). Life satisfaction was prospectively assessed at ages 26 (1996), 30, 34, 42, 46, 50, 50·5, and 51 years (2021) using a single question with responses ranging from 0 (lowest life satisfaction) to 10 (highest life satisfaction). We used multiple-group piecewise latent growth curve models grouped by sex assigned at birth. Additional models were adjusted for self-reported number of hours spent working, volunteering, home-schooling children, taking care of children and other people, and doing housework during the pandemic. Participants provided verbal informed consent. Ethics approval was not sought as non-sensitive, open-access data with minimal risk of identification was used.

Findings

We analysed data from 6766 adults (3799 [56·2%] women and 2967 [43·8%] men). Compared with men, women had consistently higher levels of life satisfaction before the pandemic (Δ intercept, unadjusted = 0·213, 95% CI 0·087 to 0·340, p = 0·0009), and experienced a more accelerated decline with its onset (Δ quad2, unadjusted = -0·018, -0·026 to -0·011; p < 0·0001), even after accounting for time use (Δ quad2, adjusted = -0·016, -0·031 to -0·001; p = 0·0348). Results were robust to adjustment for concurrent financial and occupational situation (Δ quad2, adjustedfull = -0·019, -0·035 to -0·004; p = 0·0158).

Interpretation

Our study shows sex inequalities in the impact of the pandemic on the long-term life satisfaction trajectories of adults in their 50s. Self-reported time-use differences did not account for these inequalities. One of the limitations is that we relied on self-reported time-use and were not able to include factors like the so-called mental load (being responsible for organising or monitoring activities, regardless of being involved in their execution), which might partly explain these results.

### Repeated bereavement takes its toll on subjective well-being [^6d3bb032]. Innovation in Aging (2019). Medium credibility.

The leading study in the examination of repeated life events on developmental change is that ofwho examined the consequences of repeated unemployment, divorce, and marriage on life satisfaction.found that repeated unemployment led to sustained declines in life satisfaction (sensitization) and that this effect was stronger in men versus women. Focusing on repeated divorces, life satisfaction was higher at the second divorce than it had been at the first divorce; this is indicative of adaptation. Life satisfaction did not show differences between the first and second marriage. The study byholds numerous strengths, including long course examination of repeated major life events and showing that there is a great deal of interindividual heterogeneity in the effects of repeated events and that the effects differ by the specific event considered. It is important to also emphasize thatexamined the impact of unemployment, divorce, and marriage sequentially over time, which is differentiated from the cumulative lifetime adversity score.

Multidimensional Approach

Life-span development is multidimensional in nature in that domains of functioning are comprised of multiple facets that are related, and have the potential to show differential patterns of change over the life span and in relation to major life events. This was recently shown in the adult resilience literature with facets of subjective well-being and physical health exhibiting different trajectories before and after spousal loss and child loss. For example, positive and negative affect showed quicker recovery to spousal and child loss, as compared to life satisfaction.also established this in their meta-analysis where they observed that cognitive-evaluative well-being shows stronger declines (changes) following major life events compared to affective well-being. Previous research that has examined the effect of repeated life events on development has solely focused on changes in life satisfaction. We extend this by additionally focusing on positive and negative affect. Although interrelated, based on previous research (see;,), they may show differential patterns of change. Individuals may show more sustained declines in life satisfaction over time, whereas they may be quicker to adapt to changes in affective well-being.

### Age and the tenses of life satisfaction [^59408642]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

People have a special capacity to live simultaneously in both chronological and biographical time. In this article, we examine reports of life satisfaction that span past, present, and future, considering how perceived changes in certain life domains are associated with overall perceived life trajectories.

Methods

Analyses use men and women from the Midlife Development in the United States survey. We employ gender-stratified fixed effects regression models to examine the net effect of satisfaction with finances, partnerships/marriage, sex, contribution to others, work, health, and relationship with children on trajectories of overall life satisfaction.

Results

Among men, partnership and financial satisfaction had the strongest association with life satisfaction. Women displayed a somewhat broader range of domains related to their trajectories of life satisfaction. Partnership was most important, but their sense of evolving life satisfaction was also tied to their relationship with their children, sexuality, work situation, contribution to others' welfare, and financial situation.

Discussion

We find several notable differences between men and women, but the most telling differences emerge among women themselves across chronological time. For women, partner satisfaction becomes considerably more important across the age groups, whereas sex, contribution to others, and relationships with children all decrease in their importance for overall life satisfaction.

### When the glass is half full: early life experiences and adult optimism in 22 countries [^a707c932]. Npj Mental Health Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Childhood factors and adult optimism levels: pooled estimates across countries

The random effect meta-analyses pooling regression coefficients from country-specific analyses suggest that most childhood factors under consideration are strongly associated with optimism levels in adulthood (see Table 2). All global p -values are below the Bonferroni corrected significance threshold (p < 0.004), providing evidence that in at least one country each of these childhood factors are likely associated with adult optimism levels. For instance, on average across countries, the adult optimism score was on average 0.17 points higher (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07, 0.27) among those who had very/somewhat good relationships with mother in childhood, as compared to those who had very/somewhat bad relationship with mother, holding the values of all other covariates constant. Likewise, having very/somewhat good (vs. very/somewhat bad) relationship with one's father was associated with higher levels of adult optimism (β = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.02, 0.13). Having divorced vs married parents was associated with lower optimism (β = −0.11, 95% CI: −0.21, −0.00). Experiencing childhood abuse was also associated with lower adult optimism levels (β = −0.24, 95% CI: −0.32, −0.15), as were feelings like an outsider in the family (β = −0.26, 95% CI: −0.35, −0.18). Furthermore, better childhood subjective financial status (e.g. β lived comfortability vs. got by = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.17), better self-rated health (e.g. β excellent vs. good = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.25 0.61), and more frequent religious service attendance (e.g. β at least once/week vs. never = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.35) were each positively associated with higher optimism levels in a monotonic fashion. There was also evidence suggesting that earlier (vs. the most recent) birth cohorts reported higher adult optimism levels (e.g. β birth cohort 1953–1963 vs. 1998–2005 = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.38). Females also reported higher optimism than males on average (β = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.11, 0.25). The confidence interval for the association of optimism with immigration status (native versus not native-born) included the null value but the global p -value was < 0.001, indicating immigration status was associated with optimism in at least one country but not on average across countries. In terms of the extent to which associations of childhood factors with adult optimism levels varied across countries, as assessed by, the highest heterogeneity was evident for the childhood factors of parent marital status, childhood self-rated health, immigration status, birth cohort membership (especially the earlier birth cohorts), and gender (other gender identities vs. male in particular).

### Does happiness itself directly affect mortality? The prospective UK million women study [^82449bba]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Results

At baseline, a total of 845 440 women (median age 59 years; IQR 55–63) responded to the question about how often they felt happy. Replies were: 39% (329 326 women) happy most of the time, 44% (369 738) usually happy, 16% (138 678) sometimes happy, and 1% (7698) rarely or never happy. In all analyses we combined women who reported being happy sometimes, rarely, or never, and describe them as unhappy.

Among 10 143 women who completed the same happiness question twice, about 1 year apart, there was reasonably good reproducibility between the categorised responses (weighted κ for agreement 0·62). The two extreme categories had little crossover. Of 4003 women who reported being happy most of the time at baseline, only 2% (85) reported being unhappy 1 year later; conversely, of 1763 women who reported being unhappy at baseline, only 5% (81) reported being happy most of the time 1 year later.

### Feasible future global scenarios for human life evaluations [^c6444068]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Survey data

Following recent World Happiness Reports, we include a measure of income along with variables representing healthy life expectancy (life expectancy), perceived level of corruption (corruption), freedom to choose (freedom), prevalence of donating to others (giving), and availability of informal social support (social support). The English wording of the life evaluation question is "Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?" The social support variable is the national average of dichotomous responses to "If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?" The freedom variable is the national average of dichotomous responses to "Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?" The corruption variable is the national average of dichotomous answers to two questions: "Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not?" and "Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?" In order to isolate the prevalence for giving from the variation in financial capacities, national mean responses to "Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?" are regressed on GDP per capita, and the residual becomes the Giving variable. Further descriptions and important notes for these variables are given in the statistical appendix for Chapter 2 of the 2017 report. Our measure of income is the natural logarithm of internationally comparable (i.e. purchasing power parity) GDP per person; this measure has a relatively good linear fit with life evaluations, for example, ref. By considering these measures at the aggregate (country) level, we best capture the sum of individual effects and those which come from public goods (at national and subsidiary scales) and from social and contextual effects at all spatial scales up to the country level. Our use of country-level data is motivated by the assumption that externalities (e.g. positional effects, or public goods) are likely to be large within countries, but are likely to be relatively small between countries.

### Global health equity: evidence for action on the social determinants of health [^39d9ee63]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2008). Low credibility.

More than 30 years ago, the older of us published a paper with the proposal that all scientific papers should start with a statement along the lines of: "These are the opinions on which I base my facts". Why pretend? To take a topical example, if you are on the nature side of the nature/nurture debates, is it likely that your next paper will be an apologia: "I take it all back; genes don't matter at all; it is all environment"? Unlikely. Similarly, if you are on the other side. (We know. It's both.) Here, we are not in any way arguing for a relativist credo that would say opinions are all. Along with other readers of this journal, we spend a good part of our working lives gathering, analysing and interpreting empirical evidence. Evidence matters. But everyone has values and they do affect our positions.

### Happy people live longer because they are healthy people [^44424f43]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

In this prospective cohort study of a large population-based sample of community-dwelling older adults with complete ascertainment of mortality events from mean 11.7 years of follow up, the longitudinal analysis strongly supports a temporal relationship between happiness and increased life expectancy. However, a tangible weakness of the study is the measurement of happiness (and covariates) were made at a single point in time only at baseline more than a decade ago, and not repeated at follow up to take into account possible changes occurring prior to death. Mood and emotional states change from time to time, and there may be mood fluctuations together with changes in physical and health status during the period prior to death. In relation to long-term mortality prediction, the stability or fluctuation of happiness (in line with changes in physical and health states) may be crucial. Studies suggest that the frequency and duration, rather than intensity, of happiness as a positive affect is more strongly related to well-being. The frequency and duration of happiness over time was not measured and considered as a time-dependent covariate for mortality outcome in the Cox regression analysis. It was also not in the scope of the study to examine the effect of changes in socioeconomic development in the country on happiness and well-being. Further studies should also seek to better understand and disentangle the different constructs of positive psychological wellbeing including the positive affect construct of 'happiness' as well as life satisfaction influencing life expectancy. Additionally, studies that examine the complex relationship between socioeconomic development and happiness in the context of different cultural, contextual and individual factors are needed.

### When the glass is half full: early life experiences and adult optimism in 22 countries [^b8fb449e]. Npj Mental Health Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Little is known about early-life experiences that may lead to higher optimism levels in adulthood. Using data from 202,898 adults in 22 countries, we evaluated childhood candidate antecedents of optimism. We examined the associations between retrospectively reported childhood experiences and adult optimism levels in each country separately, and cross-nationally by pooling results across countries. Our pooled results suggest that higher adult optimism levels were associated with childhood experiences of having positive relationships with both parents, higher subjective financial status, better childhood self-rated health, frequent religious service attendance, an earlier year of birth, and being female. Conversely, lower adult optimism was associated with childhood experiences of parental divorce, abuse, financial hardship, and feeling like an outsider in the family. However, country-specific analyses showed substantial between-country variations in these associations, suggesting diverse societal influences. This study provides valuable insights into the association between early-life experiences and adult optimism levels across national contexts.

### The global flourishing study: study profile and initial results on flourishing [^78fdbfb9]. Nature: Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

With regard to the primary results from the flourishing index, several comments merit attention. One of the more concerning results is the relation with age. On average, when pooled across the 22 countries, flourishing is essentially flat with age through ages 18–49 and then increases with age thereafter. This is in striking contrast to earlier work — focused mostly on life satisfaction/evaluation — which had suggested a more dramatically U-shaped pattern with age. Even with life satisfaction, pooled over the 22 GFS countries, this is now more J-shaped than U-shaped. As noted in the preceding, the increasing-with-age pattern in 2023, when pooled across GFS countries, now also holds on average with many specific aspects of well-being, including balance, inner peace, mastery, optimism, meaning and purpose, promoting good, charitable giving, forgiveness, gratitude, showing love/care, relationship quality, feeling belonging, place satisfaction and feeling loved by God or a spiritual force. Earlier nationally representative 2022 data in the United States identified these patterns with all of the various flourishing domains, including life satisfaction. There is also other corroborating evidence concerning changes in patterns between age and life evaluation and mental health –. While there are distinctions across measures, covariate controls and countries, the cumulative evidence here and elsewhere likely reflects some real changes in well-being's relation with age that have been taking place over time. Young people are not doing as well as they used to be. While causes are likely diverse, mental health concerns with young adults are clearly on the rise. These patterns are not universal. As noted, in some countries the patterns concerning flourishing and age are still somewhat more U-shaped (India, Egypt, Kenya, Japan) and in others (Poland, Tanzania) decreasing with age. Nevertheless, the overall global pattern is troubling. An open question concerns whether these relations constitute a newly patterned 'age effect' or whether this is in fact a new 'cohort effect'.This will be resolved only with more data over time. It is possible that because of social and economic conditions, it simply is more difficult to be young today, but that well-being for these young people will increase with age. It is, however, also possible, for example, that, within-person, over time, well-being will continue to follow a U-shaped pattern (but with the mean of that U lower) so that the younger cohorts will decline in well-being over time. Only future waves of data collection will be able to distinguish between these two possibilities, or their combination. It should also be noted that the answer to this question is not predetermined, and in fact depends a good deal on the extent to which policy is shaped to try to better support the well-being of young people.

### Culture linked to increasing ageism during COVID-19: evidence from a 10-billion-word corpus across 20 countries [^c95b8782]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

Long-term orientation was associated with increasing negativity of aging narratives, controlling for covariates. Societies that score high on this dimension focus on the future and plan ahead, tending to value people who can contribute the most in the future; thus, prioritizing the young and economically viable. As such, they may be less respectful of people with a shorter "shelf-life" in the workplace. Furthermore, long-term orientation involves the delay of current gratification for future benefits — security actions, innovation, and resilience — which is unfortunately unrealistic in aging societies who have to deal proactively with the needs of the aging population immediately or risk spending more for acute care later. During a pandemic, such societies are more likely to resent the reliance that retired older adults have on the economically active population, and in burdening the country's long-term health care resources.

The country-specific impact of COVID-19 on ageism is also interesting. The finding that the United Kingdom evidenced the highest ageism scores among the 20 countries corroborated with previous studies of culture and ageism (e.g.). During the pandemic in May 2020, South Africa scored highest in societal ageism — this is a novel and intriguing finding. Existing literature points toward two reasons. One, a rapid qualitative assessment of 60 key informants found a heightened awareness that older adults are at higher risk of COVID-19, though false information from social media may have been linked to exaggeration and othering — in this example, the labeling of older adults as the outgroup and the perception that the latter group is a threat. Two, South Africa has been consistently ranked as one of the fast-aging societies in the world with the proportion of older adults increasing rapidly. A scenario-based study found that South African participants expressed surprise and negative sentiments when told of the exponential increase in the older adult population by 2030. Though it is beyond the scope of our paper to delve into explanations for each country, the South African example shows that cultural tendencies for ageism could be exacerbated by a pandemic — an interesting avenue for future studies.

### Social consequences and genetics for the child with overweight and obesity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^79dd3b69]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) — definition, examples, and impacts are described as "potentially traumatic events that occur in childhood (0–18 years)" that "may have negative, lasting effects on physical and mental health, including self-esteem," with examples including "physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; parental divorce; incarceration of a parent or guardian; witnessing or being a victim of violence; and any environmental situation that undermines a feeling of safety and security." ACEs "create dangerous levels of toxic stress that are often chronic and associated with negative behavioral and health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, and higher rates of obesity," and "may be cumulative over time, with increasing health risks from increasing exposure (dose-response effect)," with resultant "behavior problems and chronic health issues that persist into adulthood."

### Population confidence in the health system in 15 countries: results from the first round of the people's voice survey [^38e10863]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Measures

Confidence in the health system includes having health security and being supportive of the system as it currently functions. The first of these measures, health security, is the judgement that the health system can respond to one's health needs and that one can afford the needed care. To this end, we calculate the percentage of respondents answering "somewhat" or "very confident" to the questions "how confident are you that you would receive good quality health care if you became very sick?" and "[could you] afford the health care you needed if you became very sick?". We also calculate the percentage of people agreeing with both statements; this combination can function as a people-reported measure of universal health coverage.

The second way we measure confidence is through endorsement of the direction and current functioning of the health system. For the first endorsement, we calculated the percentage of respondents agreeing that the health system improved in the past 2 years (vs staying the same or worsening). This measure reflects the trajectory of the health system and will therefore be sensitive to reforms and health shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2022 (this timeframe overlaps with the first wave of the PVS). The second endorsement item was agreement that the system works well as is and needs only minor reforms (vs major changes needed or a need to completely rebuild). This metric has been used in past health system surveys as an indicator of support for the current health system model.

### How spending decisions shape happiness in everyday life [^3bb2ab36]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Subjective well-being

Subjective well-being (SWB) is defined as including three components: high life satisfaction, high positive affect, and low negative affect. On each survey, participants completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale, rating their agreement with statements such as "I am satisfied with my life" on a scale from "strongly disagree" (1) to "strongly agree" (7). Participants also completed the Scale of Positive and Negative Experience, reporting how frequently in the last month they experienced six positive feelings (e.g. "Happy") and six negative feelings (e.g. "Sad") on a scale from "very rarely or never" (1) to "very often or always" (5). The three components were standardized and combined to form a score for subjective well-being.

Spending categories

At the end of each of the three months, participants completed a spending diary, providing detailed descriptions of all purchases they made with the Mystery Experiment money. For every purchase, participants were told to "describe in detail what you spent the money on (please include details like what, where, when, and why)". By asking participants for free descriptions, we were able to avoid revealing our interest in specific spending categories we examined. Two independent coders then placed their open-ended responses into 26 spending categories (see Supplementary Methods for full coding details). We began with a set of basic spending categories created by a bank, such as utilities, housing, transportation, and education. We then created additional categories to capture key constructs based on the scholarly literature, including time-saving purchases and experiences. Coders evaluated whether each purchase did belong (1) or did not belong (0) to each of the 26 categories, and the two coders' evaluations were highly consistent in both higher and lower-income countries (kappa 0.83–0.98, Supplementary Table S1). For example, the purchase of "Hamilton" tickets for the family was categorized as a gift and also as an experience. A third coder evaluated any disagreements between the initial coders and recoded any systematic errors. Of the 26 categories, 9 categories were rarely used (i.e. contained fewer than 50 purchases in the category). Leading scholars have argued that 50 is a minimun cell size to ensure statistical power. Therefore we excluded these categories from analysis, leaving 17 spending categories (see Supplementary Table S2 for descriptive statistics of the eliminated categories).

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^3e80ccbe]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Health outcomes — use of the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and limitations in CEAs are outlined: Health outcomes may be a change in clinical events or change in survival (life years gained). The QALY is calculated by multiplying the health-related quality of life for a health state by the time spent in that state, and health-related quality of life is measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 represents death and 1 represents perfect health. Community-elicited health-related quality of life weights are generally preferred over patient-elicited weights because patients adapt to their condition and typically report higher estimates. Important limitations include that gains in survival among individuals with a higher baseline quality of life generate more QALYs than equivalent gains among those with a lower baseline quality of life, which can raise concerns about exacerbating health disparities; another limitation is the assumption that subjects are indifferent between equal-QALY changes in quality versus longevity, which is often not the case. Alternative metrics include the equal value of life-years gained and health years in total, but these metrics have not been uniformly adopted, cost-effectiveness thresholds have not been established for some newer metrics, and results using these outcomes are not directly comparable to incremental cost per QALYs gained. Economic value statements should incorporate findings from available CEAs that measure health outcomes in terms of QALYs and life years.

### Feasible future global scenarios for human life evaluations [^bb9a7e71]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Recent trends (results)

We estimate the 2P and annual models for each country, and for the world as a whole. Table 2 present the results. In general, we find excellent agreement between the 2P and annual estimates. Although the annual estimates use more observations and should therefore be more efficient, they have slightly higher standard errors, likely reflecting the short-term variation during the GFC.

Overall, the trend in life evaluations, measured as per-year change on an 11-point scale, is very small (insignificant). The material variables income and life expectancy are globally increasing significantly, according to all our specifications. There are also significant global trends in the non-material variables, whose changes are measured as annual change on a 0–1 scale. Freedom and corruption are both improving in all specifications, while social support is getting worse (diminishing), and significantly so averaged across countries. Thus, the predictor variables are significantly trending but not all in an optimistic or pessimistic direction.

Table 2 also reports, for each variable, the fraction of countries with statistically significant (p ≤ .05) rates of change. These fractions are in all cases considerably > 5%, suggesting that trends, both positive and negative, are sustained (and real). This fact is central to our argument in that it supports our assumption that we can gauge reasonable rates of change based on the distribution of changes in the recent past. The remaining rows of Table 2 show the 10th and 90th, and intermediate, percentiles from these distributions. We consider these to correspond to plausible optimistic and pessimistic trends in the future scenarios. In general, these values are more extreme for the annual model than the 2P model, and we use the latter in order to remain conservative in our scenarios.

The first four rows show estimated global trends for the period 2005–2016 and between the periods 2005–2007 and 2014–2016. The 2P versions of the five quantiles of the across-countries distributions are used to build our future scenarios

### Family-related life events as predictors of labor market marginalization trajectories: a cohort study of Swedish twins [^0c58000b]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The magnitude of LMM in European countries requires more knowledge about the predictors for unemployment and SA/DP to initiate effective interventions. Several studies have previously reported associations between demographic, socioeconomic, health- and work-related factors, and future unemployment and SA/DP. – However, much fewer studies have considered long-term risks of LMM trajectories. The course of LMM can be heterogeneous in the population because among some individuals the level of LMM can be reduced while some individuals may remain high in LMM risk over time. Hence, understanding the heterogeneity and trajectories of LMM over time is of crucial importance and might also facilitate individualized rehabilitation measures that improve attachment to the labor market.

Family-related life events, such as marriage, having children or divorce, play an important role in health and interplay with human lives from birth to death. – Any change in family life, such as getting married, giving birth, or losing a spouse, that restructure family configurations may have extensive effects on mental and physical health of the individual undergoing the changes. For instance, previous studies have reported that those who make a transition from being married to divorce have a poorer health than those who have been continuously married, while some studies suggest that socioeconomic factors, such as educational level, has play a role in the association. A study on single parents also found significantly higher rates of psychological distress among those who separate compared with married parents. Negative family events, for example, divorce and suboptimal health conditions, are expected to be associated with future adverse labor market outcomes. Because family life would not remain stably over time, for example, people can get married, have children, or get divorce, these changes may affect economic outcomes and other living conditions. Therefore, a measure of history of family-related life events by accounting both transitions of marital status and changes in situations of having children is important for understanding the development of adverse outcomes over the life course.

### Current recommendations on the selection of measures for well-being [^a9d606f7]. Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Measures of well-being have proliferated over the past decades. Very little guidance has been available as to which measures to use in what contexts. This paper provides a series of recommendations, based on the present state of knowledge and the existing measures available, of what measures might be preferred in which contexts. The recommendations came out of an interdisciplinary workshop on the measurement of well-being. The recommendations are shaped around the number of items that can be included in a survey, and also based on the differing potential contexts and purposes of data collection such as, for example, government surveys, or multi-use cohort studies, or studies specifically about psychological well-being. The recommendations are not intended to be definitive, but to stimulate discussion and refinement, and to provide guidance to those relatively new to the study of well-being.

### The role of marriage in the life satisfaction and mortality association at older ages: age and sex differences [^bbc7a0b1]. Aging & Mental Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Although life satisfaction (LS) could reduce mortality risk of older adults, whether the LS-mortality link is consistent in older adults with different marital status is largely unknown. In this study, we examine (1) how the LS-mortality association at older ages varies by marital status and marital quality, and (2) whether the role of marriage in the LS-mortality link differs between young-old (ages 65–79) and oldest-old (ages 80+) ages and between men and women in mainland China.

Methods

We used five waves of data from a nationally representative survey in mainland China and applied the multilevel random effect of survival analysis to examine the LS-mortality association in Chinese older adults by marital status, controlling for a wide set of covariates.

Results

First, the protective effect of LS on mortality was valid in older men regardless of their marital status, whereas the protective effect was only valid in currently-not-married older women. Second, for a good marriage, LS significantly reduced mortality risk irrespective of gender and age, while for a poor marriage, LS had no significant association with mortality of older adults. Third, the LS-mortality association seemed to be stronger in the oldest-old than in the young-old irrespective of their marital status.

Conclusion

Given the pivotal role of spouse in daily life, the society should create an age-friendly social environment for re-marriage among older adults who wish to get re-married, while highlighting and advocating the importance of good marriage in determining healthy aging, and design various policies to improve the LS of older people to reduce their mortality risk.

### Feasible future global scenarios for human life evaluations [^7fb4a8ab]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Regression models for well-being (annual changes)

First, we consider the year-by-year changes, captured in an FE model by including an indicator (constant offset) d i for each country (this is equivalent to subtracting the mean value for each country):

Alternatively, we may model the 1-year changes in an FD equation, as follows:

With finite samples, (3) and (4) do not give identical estimates. Moreover, because our panel is not perfectly balanced, some observations are dropped when estimating (4). Because of this, and the inherent higher efficiency of the FE estimator, we favor (3) but show estimates of both.

As described in the Methods section, we wish to be able to compare the estimated effects of one predictor variable to another — that is, to ascribe relative importance to changes in different predictor variables. For the FD estimator, this is straightforward, as we can construct normalized versions of observed 1-year changes, in analogy to (3):

The term β j in (5) explains the distribution of 1-year changes in S, such that β j is the number of standard deviations of change in Δ S associated with 1 s.d. change in Δ x j, where these variances are calculated across observed 1-year changes.

In order to express the relative importance of estimates from the FE estimator, (3), we use the same standard deviations of FD to transform thein (3) to

Estimatinghas the advantages overmentioned above (efficiency, more inclusion) for FE.

Regression models for well-being (2P changes)

The third method constructs an equation with only two observations per country, the early period and the later period (2005–2007 and 2014–2016), in order to model longer-run changes δx j and δS. In this context, the FE and FD estimators are identical; thus, we write simply

Analogously to the methods above, we define the standardized coefficientsusing the standard deviation of longer-run changes across countries. This estimate has fewer observations than those modeling annual changes, and the confidence intervals are slightly looser.

As mentioned in the Discussion, we also consider moderation effects between variables in the 2P model by testing pairwise interaction terms, detailed in Supplementary Note 3. We find a significant moderation effect only between GDP and freedom of choice.

### Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 on life expectancy across populations in the USA and other high income countries: simulations of provisional mortality data [^9485ab1a]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Evidence of disproportionate reductions in life expectancy among racial and ethnic groups in the US, such as the disparities reported here, draws attention to the root causes of racial inequities in health, wealth, and wellbeing. Foremost among these root causes is systemic racism; extensive research has shown that systems of power in the US structure opportunity and assign value in ways that unfairly disadvantage Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Indigenous populations, and unfairly advantage White people. Many of the same factors placed these populations at greater risk from covid-19. The higher prevalence of comorbid conditions in many racial or marginalized groups is a reflection of unequal access to the social determinants of health (eg, education, income, and justice) and not their race, ethnicity, or other socially determined constructs. Low income communities and women have also been disproportionately affected by the social, familial, and economic disruptions of the pandemic. Reduced access to covid-19 vaccines, and vaccine hesitancy rooted in a community's distrust of systems that have mistreated them, might exacerbate these disparities. Structural factors affect not only Black and Hispanic populations but other marginalized people and places. American Indians and Alaskan Natives, for example, have some of the worst health outcomes of any group in the US, but data limitations precluded separate calculations for these important populations.

Conclusions

The mortality outcomes examined in this study, in the research literature, and in the daily news represent only part of the burden of covid-19; for every death, a larger number of infected individuals experience acute illness, and many face long term health and life complications. Whether some of these long term complications will affect how quickly life expectancy in the US will rebound in the coming years is unclear. Morbidity and mortality during the pandemic have wider effects on families, neighborhoods, and communities. One study estimated that each death leaves behind an average of nine bereaved family members. The pandemic will have short and long term effects on the social determinants of health, changing living conditions in many communities, and altering life course trajectories across age groups. Fully understanding the health consequences of these changes poses a daunting but important challenge for future research.

### Marital status and risk of dementia over 18 years: surprising findings from the national Alzheimer's coordinating center [^794e03d1]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings that all unmarried groups (widowed, divorced, never married) were associated with a lower dementia risk relative to married participants is contrary to most previous longitudinal studies, which have reported that married individuals have a lower risk of cognitive impairment and dementia than unmarried groups. However, another population‐based study from the United States did not report the advantages of being married relative to never married in terms of cognitive impairment or dementia, and a recent US study suggested improvement in cognition and less cognitive decline after divorce. There is some evidence indicating an increase in some domains of well‐being, such as happiness and life satisfaction, after divorce, and social participation after partner bereavement. Never‐married individuals are also more likely to socialize with friends and neighborsand are more likely to engage in healthier behaviors than their married counterparts. Married individuals tend to have less social integrationand are engaged in less frequent and lower‐quality interactions in their networks compared to their unmarried counterparts. These positive aspects of well‐being and social ties may potentially serve as protective factors against dementia over time. There is substantial evidence that the health benefits of marriage appear to be only in high‐quality marriages. In contrast, individuals who are unhappy in their marriage, an indicator of marital quality, are more likely to have equal or worse health and mortality risk compared to those who are widowed, divorced, or never‐married counterparts. Thus, marital quality may play a key role in the association. While these psychosocial factors could be plausible mechanisms, our findings suggest that vascular factors are less likely to explain the associations. Indeed, we found no significant associations with VD, and accounting for vascular risk factors had little impact on the overall associations. Future research is needed to identify the mechanisms linking marital status and incident dementia.

### Understanding the value of social networks in life satisfaction of elderly people: a comparative study of 16 European countries using SHARE data [^3a0ebc50]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Social networks may be affected by various social and economic factors, which in turn may influence the availability of care and social support provided to the elderly or the overall effect on life satisfaction. Social and economic factors may limit the number of people in the network or may contribute to shortening relationships and to moving away from 'diverse composition networks' (based on a mix of relations with close relative and friends) to networks predominantly consisting of close family members. On the other hand, other factors may have different effects. Hence, higher job mobility may lead to the shortening of the employment relationships and therefore to more frequent changes of the network composition. The increased availability and lower transportation costs may led to a higher geographical mobility and to loosening of the attachment to the neighbourhood. More liberal divorce laws may lead to an increase in the divorce rate and a shortening of the duration of marriages and hence contribute to weaker family ties. Moreover, the availability and use of social media, virtual connections and new ways of communication may affect networks by either weakening ties susceptible to dissolution or reinforcing stronger ties.

Finally, social networks may also be influenced by country specific factors, like the strength of the family ties or the availability and the arrangements of publicly provided care. Thus, it has been argued that, though there does not exist a clear division between European countries, Southern European countries are usually the ones with stronger family ties. On the other hand, the elderly in Southern and Eastern European countries are found to be much more likely to rely on informal provisions of formal care rather than the formal ones.

This paper contributes to the literature on the relationship between personal networks of family and friends and life satisfaction of older adults (50+). The main aim of the paper is to shed new light on the causal relationship between life satisfaction among older adults and their social network characteristics, such as network 'size' (i.e. the number of people that are declared to be part of respondent's personal network) and network 'composition' (i.e. the proportion of friends in the total number of persons in the network). Moreover, the paper also uses the multi country aspect of the 4th wave of Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) to explore the variation in such relations between sixteen European countries (including Austria, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, France, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium, Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Portugal, Slovenia and Estonia).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cost/value methodology — health outcomes and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) use notes that "the health outcomes of an intervention relative to the comparator may be a change in the incidence of clinical events… or change in survival (ie, life years gained)," and that the QALY "is calculated by multiplying the health-related quality of life associated with a health state with the time spent in that state." Health-related quality of life is "measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 represents death and 1 represents perfect health." For preference weights, those "elicited from a representative sample of fully informed members of the community are generally preferred," though "some experts have argued that economic and ethical principles support the use of quality-of-life estimates elicited from patients who are directly affected by the condition." Important limitations include that higher baseline quality-of-life gains "generate more QALYs than an equivalent gain in survival" in lower-baseline groups, which "translates to a comparatively higher valuation" and raises concerns about exacerbating health disparities, and the assumption of indifference between quality-of-life versus longevity changes yielding the same net QALYs, "which is often not the case." Alternatives "including the 'equal value of life-years gained' and the 'health years in total'" have "not been uniformly adopted by major health technology assessment agencies"; "cost-effectiveness thresholds have not been established for some of these newer metrics," and results using them are "not directly comparable to the results of studies that report incremental cost per QALYs gained." The statement adds that "economic value statements should incorporate findings from available CEAs that measure health outcomes in terms of QALYs and life years."

### Does life satisfaction change in old age: results from an 8-year longitudinal study [^1c7e68ff]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The unexpected positive relationship between aging and happiness was called "the paradox of well-being", which is still a matter of debate. This study examined longitudinal change in life satisfaction (LS) in older adults.

Methods

LS was assessed with the satisfaction with life scale, in a sample of individuals (N = 899; aged 62–95 years, at first occasion; M = 72.73, SD = 5.68) for a period of 8 years (5 waves of data). A multiple indicator (e.g., second order) growth modeling was used to assess change in LS.

Results

Findings from both unconditional and conditional model (in which time-invariant, i.e., age, gender, and education, and time-varying, i.e., self-perceived health, covariates were incorporated in the model) indicated a linear increase in LS for the 8-year period. As expected, the results showed significant random variation in both intercept and slope, indicating that participants start at different levels and change at different rates.

Discussion

Our findings contribute to the debate concerning the paradox of well-being, which calls for explanation. There are few theories that provide some explanation (e.g., the socioemotional selectivity theory). However, to enhance researchers' understanding of developmental changes that contribute to the paradox of well-being, a more integrative theoretical model is needed.

### Feasible future global scenarios for human life evaluations [^7ccca06d]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Proxy model of life evaluations

Our statistical models predict a portion of the observed changes in life evaluations from the proxy variables using both static (across countries, XS) and dynamic (within countries comparing two periods, 2P) models (Fig. 1, see Supplementary Note 2 for details). As compared with the static XS model of differences across countries (Fig. 1a), the dynamic 2P model of within-country changes shows a relatively greater emphasis on freedom to make decisions, availability of social support, and perception of corruption. The coefficients in Fig. 1a, b are normalized to standard deviations, meaning that a 1 s.d. change in income predicts a 0.19 s.d. change of life evaluations, holding other factors constant, while a 1 s.d. change in social support predicts a 0.29 s.d. change in life evaluation. In our projections, below, we use the dynamic model (2P) to predict changes in life evaluation over several decades, though as discussed later, our main findings would be even more pronounced were the XS model coefficients to be used. We emphasize that the projections that emerge are not predictions of the future, but illustrate the range of the most feasible futures that might occur, depending on human actions.

Predictions of life evaluations from proxy variables. a Six predictor variables are used simultaneously to predict life evaluations in static cross-section between countries (XS).

### Quality of life profile in three cohorts of community-dwelling Swiss older people [^63614662]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

With population aging and increased life expectancies in high-income countries, quality of life (QoL) has become important. Since influences of QoL have expanded beyond the personal concerns for health to the society and to policy interest in the potential for reducing public expenditure, several social and health aspects should be considered while addressing QoL in older people. Furthermore, unlike the previous dominant paradigm of QoL decline in old age due to higher risk of cognitive and physical impairments as well as of social losses, some empirical research indicated no age-related decline in QoL and greater satisfaction with life than in younger age groups. These observations may reflect a shift of emphasis away from the previously negative construction of old age and then the question, 'if contextual factors influence QoL in different older generations at different ages?' has gained relevance that warrants further investigation into the complex concept of QoL.

QoL is generally viewed as a multidimensional concept reflecting macro-societal and micro-individual influences and arising from the subjective feeling of satisfaction or dissatisfaction in many domains important to people. The level of satisfaction with these domains is therefore a function of its perceived importance by the individual. As a consequence, QoL appears more as a dynamic concept with significant within-subject and between-subjects variations. Within-subject differences refer to changes in an individual's QoL over his/her life span. Between-subjects differences result from variations in QoL among different groups defined by characteristics such as age, gender or belonging to specific birth cohorts and thus ageing in specific socio-economic contexts.

To get further insight on the dynamic interplay between importance, satisfaction and QoL, we investigated the hypothesis that different social contexts experienced by individuals born at specific times in history may determine cohort effects (also referred to as "generation" effects) on QoL through variations in satisfaction with, as well as in perceived importance of QoL domains. The specific socio-economic contexts caused by World War II, as a macro-societal influence, even in countries not directly involved in the conflict, offered a unique opportunity to assess variations in older people's QoL across successive birth cohorts. Thus, this study aimed to measure and compare among community-dwelling older persons born before, during, and after World War II: a) their satisfaction with QoL, overall and per domains; b) the importance they gave to each domain of QoL.

### How spending decisions shape happiness in everyday life [^5c5a1786]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

This study examines the emotional consequences of spending choices in everyday life across a diverse multinational sample. Based on a dataset of 200 participants across 7 countries who received $10,000 USD, we analyzed how happy they felt from different types of purchases made with that money. Participants derived high levels of happiness from some types of purchases that have been examined in past research (e.g., buying experiences), but also from other purchases (e.g., education) that have not been the focus of previous work. We found some evidence that the emotional benefits of spending choices varied depending on whether participants lived in higher vs. lower-income countries; specifically, we found differences in the benefits of spending on gifts, housing, debt, and time-saving services. Around the world, people who spent money in ways that made them happy experienced greater improvements in overall subjective well-being 3 and 6 months later.

### The impact of widowhood on the quality of life of older adults: the mediating role of intergenerational support from children [^8bdae2b6]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Multiple regression results

Table 3 presents the results of OLS regression analysis for the overall sample. Model 1 introduces variables related to individual characteristics, health levels, and lifestyle. The regression results indicate that widowhood significantly impacts the well-being, happiness, and life satisfaction of older adults, with the average level of subjective well-being being 0.08 lower for widowed individuals compared to those without a spouse. Age exhibits a negative correlation with the life quality index of older adults at the 1% significance level, suggesting that as individuals age, their subjective happiness and life satisfaction tend to decline. Moreover, older adults with higher levels of education enjoy a greater sense of life fulfillment, as reflected by a higher index of happiness and well-being compared to those with lower education levels. The average level of life satisfaction is 0.027 higher for older adults with higher education. The life quality index is higher among older adults residing in urban areas in comparison to their rural counterparts, indicating a significant urban-rural disparity in subjective well-being. Notably, self-rated health status positively influences the overall life satisfaction of older adults, with higher levels of self-rated health associated with greater subjective happiness and well-being. Furthermore, older adults who consume alcohol report a higher level of life contentment, as reflected by an average increase of 0.023 in the life quality index. Incorporating the variable of intergenerational support from children into Model 1 enhances the model's explanatory power, thereby suggesting the mediating role of intergenerational emotional and financial support between widowhood and the subjective well-being of older adults.

### Quality of life profile in three cohorts of community-dwelling Swiss older people [^326027d8]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This study took advantage of an historical event that determined specific socio-economic contexts in which each of the successive cohorts were born (before, during, and end of World War II), grew up and worked. This afforded a unique opportunity to assess variations in both the importance attributed to the multiple facets of QoL and the level of satisfaction with them between the cohorts at a given age.

A limitation of this study could potentially be the difficulty to disentangle cohort and period effects. However, no major event occurred in Switzerland between 2011 and 2016 that would influence responses to the QoL assessments. We also relied on a relatively short time interval (5 years) to define the birth cohorts, which may have limited the ability to observe differences; however, results pointed to significant socio-economic and health differences between cohorts that could have likely had an impact on their QoL in spite of this short interval.

### The development of clinical guidelines and guidance statements by the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians: update of methods [^83bb35b6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Guidance statements — evidence basis and process indicate that, unlike recommendations in CGC clinical guidelines, guidance in guidance statements is not derived from a de novo systematic evidence review specifically done for or by ACP and hence the CGC does not use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence or strength of recommendations; guidance is based on evaluating recommendations and evidence in selected and most highly rated clinical guidelines, but the CGC does not simply adopt recommendations from those with the highest AGREE II scores, instead assessing the evidence base and independently assessing benefits, harms, costs, and patient values and preferences; CGC public members and the Public Panel provide input through discussion, review, and comments, and the final result is adoption or adaptation of existing high-quality clinical guidelines; guidance statements are typically not suitable for the development of performance measures.

### Trajectories of life satisfaction and their predictors among Korean older adults [^6d85941b]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Published literature suggests that diverse factors are associated with LS, including age, sex, education, marital status, religion, household environment, residential location, economic status, physical and mental health, and family and social supports. Older adults who have retained their physical abilities and can perform activities of daily living tend to have higher LS, while those with mental health problems report lower life satisfaction. Symptoms such as low mood, anxiety, and other indicators of psychiatric morbidity have been negatively correlated with LS, especially among older adults who live alone or have weak social support networks. Literature also suggests that older individuals with serious medical illnesses, injuries, disability, physical inactivity, isolation, and recent relocation are more vulnerable to developing depression.

Factors affecting social involvement and close personal relationships are also thought to have considerable influence on LS. For example, studies have shown that partnership is a significant predictor associated with well-being in older people. Older people (both males and females) perceive having a spouse as important to their overall life satisfaction trajectories. However, males have been found to be somewhat less satisfied with life when living without their spouse compared to females. In general, living alone results in lower LS than living with a spouse or family members. Older individuals residing with families have been found to have much higher life satisfaction compared to the institutionalized elderly. Deterioration in health among older adults resulting in need for placement in long-term care and inadequate family support, is also related to decreasing life satisfaction. As both social supports and health status influence, and are influenced by, financial circumstances, it is not surprising that many studies also suggest that financial security is an additional important component of LS in the older population.

### Reciprocal effects of life satisfaction and depressive symptoms within long-wed couples over time [^b9a04522]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was undertaken to examine bidirectional effects of well-being over time in long-wed couples.

Method

We recruited 125 couples 50+ years of age who had been married 20+ years. Both spouses reported life satisfaction and depressive symptoms independently at three annual points over 2 years. We computed actor-partner interdependence models (APIMs) to identify concomitant and longitudinal bidirectional effects between long-wed spouses. Where parallel associations were found between models of life satisfaction and depressive symptoms, we undertook invariance analyses to compare the relative strength of associations.

Results

We observed a significant association between wives' and their husbands' life satisfaction at baseline; a concomitant crossover effect was also evident from wives to husbands at 1- and 2-year follow-up, such that wives' life satisfaction predicted changes in their husbands' life satisfaction beyond that previously and concomitantly reported.

Discussion

Our findings suggest that older wives influence their husbands after decades of marriage; the relative effect of this crossover on older husbands is comparatively equivalent for life satisfaction and depressive symptoms. These findings stand in contrast to prior research with younger couples suggesting that long-wed couples may be a distinct subset of the population of all married couples (i.e., those who have not divorced).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^d400e723]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to adjustment of treatment, stepping down, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to offer the following options when stepping down treatment:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Step 5. High-dose ICS-LABA plus oral corticosteroids|- Add biologic therapy in cases of type 2-high severe asthma if eligible and reduce oral corticosteroids < br > -; optimize inhaled therapy and reduce oral corticosteroid dose < br > -; use sputum-guided approach to reducing oral corticosteroids < br > -; switch to alternate-day dosing for low-dose oral corticosteroids|
|Step 5. Biologic therapy plus high-dose ICS-LABA|- Discontinue other add-on medications, especially oral corticosteroids, then consider reducing inhale corticosteroid-long-acting β-agonis dose|
|Step 4. Moderate-to-high-dose ICS-LABA maintenance treatment|- Continue combination ICS-LABA with 50% reduction in ICS component by using available formulations < br > -; recognize that discontinuing LABA may lead to deterioration < br > -; switch to maintenance and reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol, with lower maintenance dose|
|Step 4. Medium-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever|- Reduce maintenance ICS-formoterol to low dose, and continue as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol reliever|
|Step 4. High-dose ICS plus second controller|- Reduce ICS dose by 50% and continue second controller|
|Step 3. Low-dose ICS-LABA maintenance|- Reduce ICS-LABA to once daily < br > -; recognize that discontinuing LABA may lead to deterioration|
|Step 3. Low-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever|- Reduce maintenance ICS-formoterol dose to once daily and continue as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol reliever < br > -; consider stepping down to as-needed-only low-dose ICS-formoterol|
|Step 3. Medium or high-dose ICS|- Reduce ICS dose by 50% < br > -; consider adding leukotriene receptor antagonists to allow ICS dose to be stepped down|
|Step 2. Low-dose maintenance ICS|- Switch to once-daily dosing - budesonide, ciclesonide, mometasone, fluticasone furoate < br > -; switch to as-needed-only low-dose ICS-formoterol < br > -; switch to taking ICS whenever short-acting β-agonist is taken < br > -; do not discontinue ICS completely because the risk of exacerbations is increased with short-acting β-agonist-only treatment|

### The impact of the Syrian conflict on population well-being [^2f550ec4]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Although a large corpus of research has focused on individual major population events. comparison across different events is rarely conducted. Notably, in mental well-being research, studies have found little to no long-term decrease following the 2007–2008 global financial crisis, 2011 Fukushima disaster, or 2015 Paris terrorist attack –. These findings give evidentiary support to an influential hypothesis in the psychology literature that life circumstances may play a limited role in changing long-term well-being. However, these findings do not appear to be consistent with empirical research on disaster and health. To clarify such apparent divergence, we adopted a global perspective to evaluate the changes in well-being in Syria relative to the rest of the world, including comparisons with other countries' experiences with armed conflict, social unrest, and natural disasters

In the current study, we retrieve face-to-face interview data from random stratified samples of Syrian participants (n = 11,452) in the 2006–2016 Gallup World Poll to examine the well-being sequelae of the Syrian conflict. Participants' physical (e.g. access to healthcare, food, and shelter), mental (e.g. life satisfaction), and social (e.g. social support) well-being are assessed using 13 indicators. Here we report substantial drops in well-being in all but 2 outcomes based on multilevel models. The declines are population-wide, affecting men and women, young and old, those reported direct or no exposure, and those with or without social support. We then place the impact of the Syrian conflict into global perspective using cross-national data (n = 1,722,558) from the Gallup World Poll, a dataset that is representative of 99% of the world's adult population. This research design allows us to conduct a comprehensive and global examination of the consequence of the Syrian conflict. The well-being reduction in 11 outcomes observed in Syria exceeded all other countries surveyed in the Gallup World Poll, even when compared with other countries in turmoil.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^38ae679c]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Selecting therapies for economic value statements in AHA/ACC guideline development is framed with explicit strength language: the authors state, "we suggest that clinical guidelines include economic value statements" for all interventions with adequate-quality economic evaluations; whether a value statement is appropriate "should rely on the judgment of clinical and economic experts." To the extent feasible, committees "should consider including economic value statements" for interventions with Class 1 and 2A recommendations and for interventions where understanding economic value is likely to influence adoption, with examples including high-cost therapies or those eligible to a large number of individuals. When high-quality evaluations are scarce, value statements "may highlight evidence gaps," and the first step in developing them is a literature review and consultation with subject matter experts to identify all relevant economic evaluations.

### Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on life expectancy and premature mortality in 2020: time series analysis in 37 countries [^8af7750a]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, health policy measures employed to minimise the impact of the covid-19 pandemic have varied substantially across countries and jurisdictions. These policy measures have affected many social and economic determinants of health, including accessibility to healthcare services. The overall impact of the pandemic and its associated policy measures therefore have implications for mortality beyond deaths with covid-19 — the accuracy and completeness of which has been questioned in many countries and jurisdictions.

Data on all cause mortality are considered more reliable indicators of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic because they are less sensitive to coding errors, competing risks, and the potential for misclassification in designating the cause of deaths, and as such enable comparisons between countries. We have previously reported a large difference between reported deaths with covid-19 and estimated excess deaths associated with the covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Previous studies have used historical baseline mortality data over the recent past to estimate the expected number of deaths in 2020 and provide the basis for estimating excess deaths (observed minus expected deaths), which capture both the direct (deaths with covid-19) and the indirect (deaths from other causes) effects of the pandemic and associated policy measures. Although using excess deaths has been considered the ideal method for measuring the impact of the pandemic, this metric does not take into account age at death. When people die at an older age, they lose fewer years of remaining life. Analysis of life expectancy and years of life lost (YLL) provide a more nuanced estimation of premature mortality at population level. Life expectancy, a widely used metric of mortality, is an indication of how long on average people can expect to survive if the age specific mortality rates of that year remain constant for the remainder of their life.YLL takes into account the age distributions of mortality by giving greater weights to deaths that occur at younger ages. An important difference exists between life expectancy and YLL. Whereas life expectancy is a standardised measure based on a hypothetical life table cohort, YLL is calculated from the numbers of deaths observed in real populations. Therefore, life expectancy depends solely on mortality, and YLL (even after dividing by population size) depends on both the mortality and the age structure of the population.

### Guidelines for reporting outcomes in trial reports: the CONSORT-outcomes 2022 extension [^5a610e0c]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Clinicians, patients, and policy makers rely on published results from clinical trials to help make evidence-informed decisions. To critically evaluate and use trial results, readers require complete and transparent information regarding what was planned, done, and found. Specific and harmonized guidance as to what outcome-specific information should be reported in publications of clinical trials is needed to reduce deficient reporting practices that obscure issues with outcome selection, assessment, and analysis.

Objective

To develop harmonized, evidence- and consensus-based standards for reporting outcomes in clinical trial reports through integration with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statement.

Evidence Review

Using the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) methodological framework, the CONSORT-Outcomes 2022 extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement was developed by (1) generation and evaluation of candidate outcome reporting items via consultation with experts and a scoping review of existing guidance for reporting trial outcomes (published within the 10 years prior to March 19, 2018) identified through expert solicitation, electronic database searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Methodology Register, gray literature searches, and reference list searches; (2) a 3-round international Delphi voting process (November 2018-February 2019) completed by 124 panelists from 22 countries to rate and identify additional items; and (3) an in-person consensus meeting (April 9–10, 2019) attended by 25 panelists to identify essential items for the reporting of outcomes in clinical trial reports.

Findings

The scoping review and consultation with experts identified 128 recommendations relevant to reporting outcomes in trial reports, the majority (83%) of which were not included in the CONSORT 2010 statement. All recommendations were consolidated into 64 items for Delphi voting; after the Delphi survey process, 30 items met criteria for further evaluation at the consensus meeting and possible inclusion in the CONSORT-Outcomes 2022 extension. The discussions during and after the consensus meeting yielded 17 items that elaborate on the CONSORT 2010 statement checklist items and are related to completely defining and justifying the trial outcomes, including how and when they were assessed (CONSORT 2010 statement checklist item 6a), defining and justifying the target difference between treatment groups during sample size calculations (CONSORT 2010 statement checklist item 7a), describing the statistical methods used to compare groups for the primary and secondary outcomes (CONSORT 2010 statement checklist item 12a), and describing the prespecified analyses and any outcome analyses not prespecified (CONSORT 2010 statement checklist item 18).

Conclusions and Relevance

This CONSORT-Outcomes 2022 extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement provides 17 outcome-specific items that should be addressed in all published clinical trial reports and may help increase trial utility, replicability, and transparency and may minimize the risk of selective nonreporting of trial results.

CHEST guideline grading and evidence thresholds — use of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) is described alongside interpretation of recommendation strength: The CHEST grading system was previously a modification of GRADE, and "In February 2014, the GOC made the decision to start using unmodified GRADE and discontinue use of the CHEST-modified version of GRADE." CHEST specifies evidence minimums: "CHEST has set a minimal threshold for evidence such that it must be published in peer-reviewed publications." Where evidence is sparse, "CHEST would label it as insufficient evidence and follow a consensus-based process or hybrid approach," whereas GRADE "would label it as very low evidence but permit the formulation of guideline recommendations." Methodologic changes have reduced top-tier ratings: "there are fewer IA-graded recommendations." Strength labeling is explicit: "Recommendation strength is reflected in the numerical grades (1 or 2)." Importantly, "Strong recommendations with low evidence (eg, 1C) are still highly recommended for the designated patient populations."

### Exposure to family member incarceration and adult well-being in the United States [^82826d4f]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

More than half of the adult population in the United States has ever had a family member incarcerated, an experience more common among Black individuals. The impacts of family incarceration on well-being are not fully understood.

Objective

To assess the associations of incarceration of a family member with perceived well-being and differences in projected life expectancy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This nationally representative cross-sectional study used data from the 2018 Family History of Incarceration Survey to examine how experiences of family member incarceration were associated with a holistic measure of well-being, including physical, mental, social, financial, and spiritual domains. Well-being was used to estimate change in life expectancy and was compared across varying levels of exposure to immediate and extended family member incarceration using logistic regression models to adjust for individual and household characteristics. Data were analyzed from October 2019 to April 2020.

Exposures

Respondents' history of family member incarceration, including immediate and extended family members.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was self-reported life-evaluation, a measure of overall well-being from the 100 Million Healthier Lives Adult Well-being Assessment. Respondents were considered thriving with a current life satisfaction score of 7 or greater and a future life optimism score of 8 or greater, each on a scale of 0 to 10. Other outcomes included physical health, mental health, social support, financial well-being, and spiritual well-being, each measured with separate scales. Additionally, life expectancy projections were estimated using population-level correlations with the Life Evaluation Index. All percentages were weighted to more closely represent the US population.

Results

Of 2815 individuals included in analysis, 1472 (51.7%) were women, 1765 (62.8%) were non-Hispanic White, and 868 (31.5%) were aged 35 to 54 years. A total of 1806 respondents (45.0%) reported having an immediate family member who was incarcerated. Compared with respondents with no family incarceration, any family member incarceration was associated with lower well-being overall (thriving: 69.5% [95% CI, 65.0%-75.0%] vs 56.9% [95% CI, 53.9%-59.9%]) and in every individual domain (eg, physical thriving: 51.1% [95% CI, 46.2–56.0] vs 35.5% [95% CI, 32.6%-38.3%]) and with a mean (SE) estimated 2.6 (0.03) years shorter life expectancy. Among those with any family incarceration, Black respondents had a mean (SE) estimated 0.46 (0.04) fewer years of life expectancy compared with White respondents.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that family member health and well-being may be an important avenue through which incarceration is associated with racial disparities in health and mortality. Decarceration efforts may improve population-level well-being and life expectancy by minimizing detrimental outcomes associated with incarceration among nonincarcerated family members.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^0254d747]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Socioeconomic status (SES) and educational outcomes — poverty experiences are strongly linked to employment and family structure changes, with one fourth of all experiences of poverty due to a head of household becoming unemployed and another quarter due to divorce or other major family structure changes; among those living in poverty, individuals who work 30 weeks per year are one third less likely to return to poverty than those who work 20 weeks of the year. Students from lower SES families have lower reading skills at both entrance to school and the end of third grade and are more likely to drop out of high school, and a meta-analysis of 58 studies, including 75 independent samples found familial social class strongly predicted individual student success and school-level achievement, resulting in double jeopardy for student achievement.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### How spending decisions shape happiness in everyday life [^55523c19]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Changes in overall subjective well-being over time

As well as rating how happy each purchase made them, all participants completed measures of life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect, which we standardized and combined to create a measure of overall subjective well-being (SWB). We compared their SWB scores on the baseline survey (before receiving money) to their ratings at the end of the spending period (3-month survey) and again several months after they had spent the money (6-month survey). For SWB distributions, see Supplementary Table S10.

Did people who derived more happiness from their purchases exhibit larger gains over time in their overall SWB? To examine this question, we calculated the average amount of happiness each individual derived from all their purchases (mean = 3.92, SD = 0.62). We entered participants' happiness with their purchases into linear regression models predicting SWB at 3 and 6 months, controlling for baseline SWB. These models showed that individuals who made happier purchases exhibited greater gains in overall subjective well-being at the end of the spending period (b = 0.35, p < 0.001, Table 2) and several months later (b = 0.23, Table 2).

Table 2
Average purchase happiness predicting changes in subjective well-being

The averaged happiness a participant derived from all their purchases as a predictor of subjective well-being at 3 and 6 months, controlling for baseline subjective well-being. The data include 182 participants at 3 months and 164 participants at 6 months.

SE standard error, CI confidence interval, df degree of freedom, average purchase happiness average happiness a participant derived from all their purchases.

To illustrate these effects, we also divided participants in quintiles based on how much happiness they derived from their purchases on average. The participants in the lowest quintile improved their SWB by 0.31 points from baseline to 3 months, whereas the participants in the highest quintile improved their SWB by 0.78. This difference in SWB gains between the groups (0.47 points) was similar to the difference in SWB gains at the 3-month mark between people who received the $10,000 gift versus those in the control group who did not receive money (0.44 points). This suggests that the ways people chose to spend the money mattered as much for their happiness as whether or not they received $10,000.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^f361165a]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Spirometry — considerations in performing spirometry (Figure 2.4) state that forced spirometry is the most reproducible and objective measurement of airflow obstruction, and peak expiratory flow measurement alone cannot be reliably used as the only diagnostic test because of its weak specificity. Preparation includes that spirometers should produce hard copy or have a digital display of the expiratory curve to permit detection of technical errors or have an automatic prompt to identify an unsatisfactory test and the reason for it. During performance, the pause between inspiration and expiration should be less than one second, the recording should go on long enough for a volume plateau to be reached, which may take more than 15 seconds in severe disease, and both FVC and FEV1 should be the largest value obtained from any of three technically satisfactory curves and the FVC and FEV1 values in these three curves should vary by no more than 5% or 150 mL, whichever is greater; the FEV1/FVC ratio should be taken from the technically acceptable curve with the largest sum of FVC and FEV1. For bronchodilation testing, possible dosage protocols are 400 mcg short-acting beta2-agonist, 160 mcg short-acting anticholinergic, or the two combined; FEV1 should be measured 10–15 minutes after a short-acting beta2-agonist is given, or 30–45 minutes after a short-acting anticholinergic or a combination of both classes of drugs, and patients already on bronchodilator treatment, in whom spirometry is requested for monitoring purposes do not need to stop their regular treatment for spirometry. For evaluation, spirometry measurements are evaluated by comparison of the results with appropriate reference values based on age, height and sex, and the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7 confirms the presence of non-fully reversible airflow obstruction.

### Bias [^de07ecfb]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2004). Low credibility.

The concept of bias is the lack of internal validity or incorrect assessment of the association between an exposure and an effect in the target population in which the statistic estimated has an expectation that does not equal the true value. Biases can be classified by the research stage in which they occur or by the direction of change in a estimate. The most important biases are those produced in the definition and selection of the study population, data collection, and the association between different determinants of an effect in the population. A definition of the most common biases occurring in these stages is given.

### Concordance between life satisfaction and six elements of well-being among respondents to a health assessment survey, healthPartners employees, Minnesota, 2011… [^17f24d40]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

Result We found a correlation between self-reported life satisfaction and the number of well-being elements scored as high; 73. 6% of the respondents were concordant. Although 82. 9% of respondents with high overall well-being indicated high life satisfaction, only
34. 7% of those indicating high life satisfaction reported high overall well-being. Conclusion The correlation between self-reported life satisfaction and our well-being measure was strong, and members who met our criterion of high overall well-being were likely to report high life satisfaction. However, many respondents who reported high life satisfaction did not meet our criterion for high overall well-being, which suggests that either they adapted to negative life circumstances or that our well-being measure did not identify their sources of life satisfaction.

Pearson's coefficient of correlation between the number of well-being elements that we scored high for an individual and the score that each individual selected to describe his or her level of life satisfaction is. Changes in society, the environment, or individual circumstances influence how people report life satisfaction. For example, one study reported that almost 10% of people changed an average of 3 points on a 10-point scale from the first year to the last 5 years of a 17-year study. In that same study, height, weight, body mass index, and blood pressure were actually more stable than life satisfaction. That we identified a group of people who indicate that they are highly satisfied with life but lack the indicators of high overall well-being does not surprise us. It is well-documented that a significant minority of individuals — about one-third in some cohorts — see opportunity in the same circumstances in which the majority sense only threat or loss.

Our findings may not be generalizable to all populations. Our study subjects were employed in large companies and were mostly middle-aged, highly trained non-Hispanic whites. Particular care must be taken when attempting to assess minority populations' life satisfaction and indicators of well-being, particularly when some members of those populations are not native English speakers. However, our analysis does demonstrate that the concordance between life satisfaction and well-being is strong. We believe that, at a population level, self-reported life satisfaction is a measure of overall well-being.
