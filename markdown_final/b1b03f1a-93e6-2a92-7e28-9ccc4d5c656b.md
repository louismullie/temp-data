## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and choose among treatments using evidence-based medicine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame a clinical question using PICO. Then, I should verify the evidence hierarchy and how to appraise study quality. Next, I will examine how to interpret effect sizes and confidence intervals, including NNT and NNTH. After that, I need to check how to apply population-level evidence to individual patients, including shared decision-making. Finally, I will consider special contexts like living guidelines, network meta-analyses, and implementation barriers, and close with a concise decision framework.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: evidence-based medicine integrates the best available research, clinical expertise, and patient values, so I need to ensure each decision reflects all three pillars rather than relying on any one alone [^0108ec7a] [^a3c2387a].

> I will now examine how to frame the question. A well-structured PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) is essential to guide search and appraisal; for example, in adults with episodic migraine, I should compare acute pharmacologic options versus placebo or each other for pain relief at 2 hours and sustained 24-hour response, and I should explicitly define what constitutes a clinically important difference up front [^869937eb] [^46b51a03].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of high-quality RCTs sit at the top, followed by individual RCTs, then observational designs, with mechanistic or expert opinion at the bottom; I need to check whether a living guideline or a recent high-quality meta-analysis already answers the question before diving into primary studies [^0108ec7a] [^22e313de].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any single study. I should double-check risk of bias using standardized tools and consider factors like allocation concealment, blinding, selective reporting, and attrition; small-study effects and publication bias can inflate benefits, so I should verify whether the meta-analysis includes unpublished trials and whether sensitivity analyses alter conclusions [^486ec501] [^dbaeb5ec].

> I need to ensure I interpret effect sizes correctly. Relative risk reductions can be misleading, so I should calculate absolute risk reduction and number needed to treat, and I should confirm whether confidence intervals cross the null and whether the magnitude of benefit exceeds the minimal clinically important difference for the chosen outcome [^0108ec7a] [^cb96e219].

> But wait, what if multiple treatments are reasonable? Network meta-analysis allows ranking of interventions when head-to-head trials are sparse; I should verify assumptions like transitivity and consistency, and I should be cautious about indirect comparisons that depend on similar distributions of effect modifiers across trials [^438cbb13] [^ff2e5d6e].

> Let me consider applicability to the individual patient. I should confirm whether the trial population matches my patient's age, comorbidities, severity, and preferences; if not, I need to downweight the certainty and discuss uncertainty transparently during shared decision-making, using tools that present benefits and harms in plain language [^0b9dc402] [^d01bf077].

> I should confirm how guidelines frame recommendations. High-quality guidelines use GRADE to distinguish strong from conditional recommendations and explicitly weigh benefits, harms, certainty, values, and costs; when evidence is low quality, a conditional recommendation with shared decision-making is appropriate [^9863a7c0] [^d7db192b].

> Next, I should review special contexts. Living guidelines, such as IDSA's COVID-19 guidance, are updated as new evidence emerges; I need to check the latest version before acting, and I should be prepared to deprescribe or pivot if the balance of benefits and harms shifts with new data [^22e313de] [^5d16bdbe].

> I will now examine implementation barriers. Even strong evidence often fails to change practice due to workflow, inertia, or misaligned incentives; I should double-check whether local pathways, education, and feedback loops are aligned to support the evidence-based choice, and I should anticipate adherence issues that could blunt effectiveness [^bbb21454] [^2dc6767e].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. First, define the clinical question with PICO and specify patient-important outcomes. Second, identify the highest-level evidence and appraise quality and bias. Third, quantify benefits and harms using absolute measures and consider NNT/NNTH. Fourth, assess applicability and patient preferences. Fifth, align with guideline strength and local feasibility. Finally, monitor outcomes and iterate as new evidence arrives [^0108ec7a] [^0b9dc402].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that RCTs always trump observational data; hold on, I should verify exceptions. For some questions, especially harms or rare outcomes, well-conducted observational studies can provide crucial signals, and in the absence of RCTs, guideline panels may issue consensus statements with appropriate caveats, so I need to ensure I do not overstate RCT exclusivity [^7d8c1214] [^09096e5f].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan is documented and communicated. I should record the evidence source, the certainty of evidence, the magnitude and direction of benefits and harms, and how patient values influenced the choice, so that the decision is transparent and revisable as the evidence evolves [^d7db192b] [^0b9dc402].

Treatments should be selected using **evidence-based medicine** [^0108ec7a] that integrates the best available research, clinical expertise, and patient values [^a3c2387a]. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses are the **highest-quality evidence** [^29d24ae0]; when direct comparisons are lacking, network meta-analyses can rank options [^438cbb13] [^ff2e5d6e]. Guidelines translate evidence into practical recommendations [^d7db192b], but clinicians must individualize decisions, consider comorbidities, and use shared decision-making [^0b9dc402] [^9d472269]. Evidence quality varies [^486ec501], so always appraise study design, bias, and applicability [^d45fbf66]; when evidence is limited, expert consensus or observational data may guide care [^7d8c1214] [^09096e5f].

## Hierarchy of evidence

The **evidence hierarchy** ranks study designs by their ability to minimize bias and provide reliable estimates of treatment effects [^0108ec7a]:

| **Evidence level** | **Study design** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Level 1 | Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs | Highest-quality evidence synthesizing multiple RCTs [^29d24ae0] |
| Level 2 | Individual RCTs | Gold standard for evaluating interventions [^7d8c1214] |
| Level 3 | Non-randomized controlled studies | Useful when RCTs are not feasible [^7d8c1214] |
| Level 4 | Case-control and cohort studies | Observational designs for hypothesis generation [^notfound] |
| Level 5 | Expert opinion and case reports | Lowest level, useful when other evidence is absent [^notfound] |

---

RCTs and meta-analyses are the **cornerstone of treatment evaluation** [^29d24ae0], providing the most reliable estimates of efficacy and safety [^d45fbf66]. Network meta-analyses extend this by comparing multiple treatments simultaneously, even when head-to-head trials are lacking [^438cbb13] [^ff2e5d6e].

---

## Clinical practice guidelines

Guidelines synthesize evidence into **actionable recommendations** [^d7db192b]. They use standardized grading systems (e.g. GRADE) [^9863a7c0] to rate evidence quality and strength of recommendations [^8fa4772e]. Guidelines are essential for standardizing care, reducing variability, and improving outcomes [^2075a9ba] [^81ae7f26].

---

## Individualized patient care

While guidelines provide general recommendations, **individualized care** is essential [^0b9dc402]. Clinicians must consider:

- **Patient preferences and values**: Shared decision-making improves adherence and satisfaction [^9d472269].
- **Clinical expertise**: Experience guides application of evidence to unique patient contexts [^a3c2387a].
- **Comorbidities and contraindications**: Treatments must be tailored to patient-specific factors [^09096e5f].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite advances, several **challenges persist**:

- **Publication bias**: Positive results are more likely to be published, distorting evidence [^ddca3a30].
- **Heterogeneity**: Variability in populations, interventions, and outcomes complicates synthesis [^af9e7924].
- **Generalizability**: Trial populations may not reflect real-world patients [^b036cb1c].
- **Rapidly evolving evidence**: Guidelines must be updated frequently to remain current [^22e313de].

---

## Emerging trends

Recent developments include **living guidelines** that update continuously as new evidence emerges [^22e313de], and **precision medicine** approaches that tailor treatments to genetic, biomarker, or phenotypic profiles [^f359a23b]. Digital health tools and AI are also being integrated to support evidence-based decision-making [^notfound].

---

Treatments should be grounded in the **best available evidence**, integrated with clinical expertise and patient values [^0108ec7a]. RCTs and meta-analyses provide the most reliable evidence, but clinicians must individualize decisions and navigate limitations such as bias and heterogeneity [^d45fbf66]. Emerging trends like living guidelines and precision medicine are shaping the future of evidence-based treatment selection [^22e313de] [^f359a23b].

The evidence-based practice movement rests on the premise that the scientific evidence regarding treatment should be used judiciously to inform treatment decisions. This article focuses on the most fundamental question regarding evidence-based practice: What is evidence? To address this question, the authors first review several of the definitions, criteria, and strategies that have been used to define scientific evidence. Second, a number of critical issues that have been raised regarding the nature of treatment evidence are discussed. Finally, suggestions for further consideration in the process of synthesizing evidence for clinicians are offered.

### What is evidence-based medicine and why should I care? [^0108ec7a]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

The principles of evidence-based medicine provide the tools to incorporate the best evidence into everyday practice. Evidence-based medicine is the integration of individual clinical expertise with the best available research evidence from systematic research and the patient's values and expectations. A hierarchy of evidence can be used to assess the strength of evidence upon which clinical decisions are made, with randomized studies at the top of the hierarchy. The efficient approach to finding the best evidence is to identify a systematic review or evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Calculated metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, receiver-operating-characteristic curves, and likelihood ratios, can be used to examine the evidence for a diagnostic test. High-level studies of a therapy are prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, have a concealed allocation, have a parallel design, and assess patient-important outcomes. Metrics used to assess the evidence for a therapy include event rate, relative risk, relative risk reduction, absolute risk reduction, number needed to treat, and odds ratio. Although not all tenets of evidence-based medicine are universally accepted, the principles of evidence-based medicine nonetheless provide a valuable approach to respiratory care practice.

### What constitutes reasonable evidence of efficacy and effectiveness to guide oncology treatment decisions? [^19b9ff29]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

The need to practice evidence-based medicine is the current prevailing paradigm within the medical community. Evidence to guide practice can and should come from a variety of sources, including clinical trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses of both or either. This paper discusses the relative strengths and weaknesses of data that arise from these various sources. The different types of evidence required to demonstrate "efficacy" versus "effectiveness", a critical and often overlooked distinction, are discussed. In the genomic age, in which targeted therapies with or without specific biomarkers are emerging in cancer care, new approaches are necessary to generate the evidence required for decision making.

### Grading the evidence: levels of evidence and grades of recommendation [^219515b6]. Injury (2006). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine is using the best available evidence in order to make accurate and knowledgeable treatment decisions. It is not the automatic gainsay of "low quality" evidence and acceptance of randomized controlled trials (RCT's). To be able to make a sound recommendation for a therapy based on the best available evidence, it is necessary to follow steps in acquiring literature, appraising it for study design and quality, and to assess its results, as well as look at the net benefits and net harms.

### Network meta-analysis explained [^438cbb13]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

What is network meta-analysis?

Healthcare decisions should be based on all relevant evidence. Usually, this is provided by randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing two or more interventions for a condition affecting a target population of interest, although other forms of evidence can be considered. When more than one study is available, meta-analysis can be used to combine multiple treatment effects and obtain an overall estimate of the effect in the target population. To assess clinical effectiveness, evidence from RCTs is typically used and relative treatment effects estimated in individual trials are pooled using methods that preserve within-trial randomisation. However, for the majority of health conditions, there are more than two interventions of interest. In such cases, performing multiple pairwise meta-analyses (comparing interventions two at a time) or lumping every active intervention to be compared with a 'control' is of limited use for decision-making and does not allow for coherent and transparent decisions. Decisions involving > 20 interventions are not uncommon. The number of pairwise comparisons required to make a decision between 3 interventions is 3, with 5 interventions it is 10, with 10 interventions it is 45 and with 41 interventionsit is 820. Clearly, not all comparisons will have been carried out in RCTs but looking at multiple separate pairwise analyses carried out using different sets of trials makes it impossible to decide which intervention is best.

Network meta-analysis (NMA), also termed multiple treatment meta-analysis or mixed treatment comparisons, was developed as an extension of pairwise meta-analysis to allow comparisons of more than two interventions in a single, coherent analysis of all the relevant RCTs. Its main advantages are that it produces consistent estimates of the relative effects of all interventions compared with every other in a single analysis using both direct and indirect evidence, while also correctly incorporating the relative effects from trials with more than two arms (ie, avoiding double counting of patients). This results in greater precision of treatment effect estimates and the ability to rank all the interventions in a coherent way. As for standard meta-analysis, NMA can be performed for most types of RCT outcomes, continuous, dichotomous, event rates and from survival models, using an appropriate scale (mean difference (MD), OR, relative risk, HR, etc).

### Moving toward evidence-based practice [^2dc6767e]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

"Evidence-based practice" involves applying the best available evidence to the care of individuals. Explicit, systematic methods have developed for determining what is the best available evidence. However, often even the highest-level evidence is not thoroughly or effectively used in practice, even if it is widely known. We must rigorously and critically analyze study results to understand their strengths, limitations, and generalizability, and bear in mind that our knowledge will evolve and thereby change our practice. The clinical question is not always how to apply the evidence but whether the available evidence applies to a particular patient. We should always ask whether the right provider is doing the right thing for the right patient at the right time in the right setting with the right resources.

PRINCIPLE 1: PATIENTS ARE AT THE CENTER OF CLINICAL EVIDENCE GENERATION AND GUIDE EVERY STEP

Clinical evidence is generated for patients' needs and public health. Through their engagement, patients provide critical insight into their medical needs and what really matters to them at every level of healthcare decisions. Clinical evidence generation should revolve around these needs. Patients have been increasingly involved in healthcare decisions, including those related to the evaluation of the benefit–risk of medicines by regulators, where patients bring their personal experience, knowledge, and expertise both on the conditions and the available treatment options, and also on the impact of regulatory decisions on their lives.

Efforts are ongoing to guide the generation, collection, and use of patient experience data to support decisions on the development and benefit–risk evaluation of medicines. To further build on these efforts, multi‐stakeholder collaboration in this field is encouraged.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — scope and update process — states that IDSA has recognized the necessity of developing a rapid guideline for the treatment of COVID-19 and that the guideline panel is using a methodologically rigorous process for evaluating the best available evidence and providing treatment recommendations. These guidelines will be frequently updated and accessible online, and ongoing trials evaluating therapeutic agents are monitored; if a preponderance of evidence suggests the use of a therapeutic agent even in the context of clinical trials is no longer warranted it will be removed from future updates, and agents with emerging efficacy or safety evidence will be included in future updates. The recommendations are intended to inform patients, clinicians, and other health professionals by providing the latest available evidence.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^ad51f1e7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

These British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines cover the range and aims of treatment for anxiety disorders. They are based explicitly on the available evidence and are presented as recommendations to aid clinical decision making in primary and secondary medical care. They may also serve as a source of information for patients and their carers. The recommendations are presented together with a more detailed review of the available evidence. A consensus meeting involving experts in anxiety disorders reviewed the main subject areas and considered the strength of evidence and its clinical implications. The guidelines were constructed after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. The strength of supporting evidence for recommendations was rated. The guidelines cover the diagnosis of anxiety disorders and key steps in clinical management, including acute treatment, relapse prevention and approaches for patients who do not respond to first-line treatments.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^5d16bdbe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

There are many pharmacologic therapies that are being used or considered for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with rapidly changing efficacy and safety evidence from trials. The objective was to develop evidence-based, rapid, living guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. In March 2020, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise to regularly review the evidence and make recommendations about the treatment and management of persons with COVID-19. The process used a living guideline approach and followed a rapid recommendation development checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. A systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted at regular intervals. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. Based on the most recent search conducted on 31 May 2022, the IDSA guideline panel has made 32 recommendations for the treatment and management of the following groups/populations: pre- and postexposure prophylaxis, ambulatory with mild-to-moderate disease, and hospitalized with mild-to-moderate, severe but not critical, and critical disease. As these are living guidelines, the most recent recommendations can be found online at: https://idsociety.org/COVID19guidelines. At the inception of its work, the panel has expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials. Since then, many trials were conducted that provided much-needed evidence for COVID-19 therapies. There still remain many unanswered questions as the pandemic evolved, which we hope future trials can answer.

### Introduction: how evident is the evidence? [^29d24ae0]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Medium credibility.

Randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses are the pinnacle of evidence-based medicine, enabling identification of the best available diagnostic, interventional, and therapeutic options. These tools help clinicians and policy-makers to set clinical guidelines, but they also represent a double-edged sword: the meaningfulness of RCTs and meta-analyses relies on their quality, performance, and integrity. The present Views and Reviews collection prepared by 18 renowned experts and coordinated by Ben Mol aims to inform and educate our readers about RCTs and meta-analyses in reproductive medicine. The collection begins with the basic features that guarantee the quality of a trial, including protocols, registrations and monitoring, study design and analysis, and reporting standards. Next are discussed the status of planning and coordination of RCTs in different global settings, current unmet needs, and how future studies can better meet these needs, as well as methodologic issues facing different types of RCTs. Finally, insight is provided into the issue of data fabrication and falsification, offering possible solutions to ensure the integrity of RCTs. The challenges and benefits of these crucial evidence-generating tools deserve our attention and education because the findings of RCTs and meta-analyses can directly affect the health of our patients, and when performance and integrity problems exist, the "magic" of these tools disappears-with harmful consequences.

### What is evidence-based medicine and why should it be practiced? [^25f39299]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Responding to the limitations of traditional expert recommendations as a guide to clinical practice, evidence-based medicine has presented a paradigm shift in the way clinicians learn and practice medicine. The practice of evidence-based medicine requires careful examination of the evidence, using a set of formal rules applied in an explicit manner. The clinician then judiciously applies the evidence to decision-making, with an understanding of the patient context and values. Using examples pertinent to respiratory therapists, we discuss evidence-based decision-making as a clinical problem-solving strategy, its basis on a hierarchy of evidence, and the interplay of values, preferences, expertise, and circumstances that affect its application. We briefly describe some resources available to obtain evidence reports and to learn to critically appraise and apply them.

### Network meta-analysis-highly attractive but more methodological research is needed [^41d0c98b]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Systematic reviews use explicit, pre-specified methods to identify, appraise, and synthesize all available evidence related to a clinical question. When appropriate, systematic reviews may include a meta-analysis, that is, the statistical combination of results from two or more separate studies. Some systematic reviews compare only two interventions, in which a conventional pair-wise meta-analysis may be conducted, while others examine the comparative effectiveness of many or all available interventions for a given condition. When the comparative effectiveness of a range of interventions is of interest, appropriate statistical methodology must be used for analysis.

Also called mixed treatments comparison or multiple treatments comparison meta-analysis, network meta-analysis expands the scope of a conventional pair-wise meta-analysis by analyzing simultaneously both direct comparisons of interventions within randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and indirect comparisons across trials based on a common comparator (e.g. placebo or some standard treatment). In the simplest case, one may be interested in comparing two interventions A and C. Indirect evidence can be obtained from RCTs of either A or C versus a common comparator B (Figure 1), keeping intact the randomized comparisons within the RCTs. When both direct and indirect evidence are available, the two sources of information can be combined as a weighted average when appropriate. Data structure of this type can be extended to k-comparisons to facilitate simultaneous inference regarding all available treatments, and to provide evidence for selecting the best of several treatment options. Many assumptions behind network meta-analysis methods appear to be similar to those made in standard pair-wise meta-analysis. But as for a conventional pair-wise meta-analysis, the methodology for network meta-analysis must be carefully developed and rigorously evaluated before the technique is applied widely.

### Conceptual and technical challenges in network meta-analysis [^af9e7924]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The increase in treatment options creates an urgent need for comparative effectiveness research. Randomized, controlled trials comparing several treatments are usually not feasible, so other methodological approaches are needed. Meta-analyses provide summary estimates of treatment effects by combining data from many studies. However, an important drawback is that standard meta-analyses can compare only 2 interventions at a time. A new meta-analytic technique, called network meta-analysis (or multiple treatments meta-analysis or mixed-treatment comparison), allows assessment of the relative effectiveness of several interventions, synthesizing evidence across a network of randomized trials. Despite the growing prevalence and influence of network meta-analysis in many fields of medicine, several issues need to be addressed when constructing one to avoid conclusions that are inaccurate, invalid, or not clearly justified. This article explores the scope and limitations of network meta-analysis and offers advice on dealing with heterogeneity, inconsistency, and potential sources of bias in the available evidence to increase awareness among physicians about some of the challenges in interpretation.

### Is network meta-analysis as valid as standard pairwise meta-analysis? It all depends on the distribution of effect modifiers [^490514e0]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered as the gold standard of whether a health intervention works and/or whether it is better than another. Although often placed at the top of evidence hierarchies, single RCTs rarely provide adequate information for addressing the evidence demands of patients, clinicians and policymakers. Instead, each trial provides a piece of evidence that, when taken together with others, addresses important questions for patients, clinicians, and other healthcare decision-makers. Traditional pairwise meta-analyses of RCTs are increasingly used to synthesize the results of different trials evaluating the same intervention(s) to obtain an overall estimate of the treatment effect of one intervention relative to the control.

In the last decade, network meta-analysis has been introduced as a generalization of pairwise meta-analysis. When the available RCTs of interest do not all compare the same interventions but each trial compares only a subset of the interventions of interest, it is possible to develop a network of RCTs where all trials have at least one intervention in common with another. Such a network allows for indirect comparisons of interventions not studied in a head-to-head fashion. For example, the treatment effects from trials comparing treatments B relative to A (AB trials) and trials comparing treatments C relative to A (AC trials) can be pooled to obtain an indirect estimate for the comparison between treatments B and C. Even when a trial comparing treatments C and B (BC trial) exists, combining the direct estimates with the results of indirect comparisons can result in refined estimates as a broader evidence base is considered. In general, if the available evidence base consists of a network of interlinked multiple RCTs involving treatments compared directly, indirectly, or both, the entire body of evidence can be synthesized by means of network meta-analysis.

Although assumptions underlying standard pairwise meta-analyses of direct comparisons are well understood, those concerning network meta-analysis for both direct and indirect comparisons might be perceived to be more complex, and might be prone to misinterpretation. In this paper, we aim to compare pairwise meta-analysis with network meta-analysis with a specific focus on the primary role of effect modifiers as the common cause of heterogeneity and bias. We discuss effect modification first within individual trials, then in standard pairwise meta-analyses of multiple randomized trials, and finally in network meta-analyses.

### Analysis of the systematic reviews process in reports of network meta-analyses: methodological systematic review [^ca14d132]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Assessing the comparative effectiveness of many or all available interventions for a clinical indication is challenging. Direct evidence from head to head trials is often lacking. Indirect comparison between two interventions can still be estimated from the results of randomised controlled trials, without jeopardising the randomised comparisons within each trial, if each intervention is compared with an identical common comparator. When both direct and indirect comparisons are available, the two sources of information can be combined by using network meta-analyses — also known as multiple treatments meta-analyses or mixed treatment comparison meta-analyses. These methods allow for estimating all possible pairwise comparisons between interventions and placing them in rank order.

In the past few years, network meta-analyses have been increasingly adopted for comparing healthcare interventions. Network meta-analyses are attractive for clinical researchers because they seem to respond to their main concern: determining the best available treatment. Moreover, national agencies for health technology assessment and drug regulators increasingly use such methods.

Several reviews previously evaluated how indirect comparisons have been conducted and reported. These reviews focused on checking validity assumptions (based on homogeneity, similarity, and consistency) and did not assess the key components of the systematic review process. Network meta-analyses are primarily meta-analyses, and should therefore be performed according to the explicit and rigorous methods used in systematic reviews and meta-analyses to minimise bias. We performed a methodological systematic review of published reports of network meta-analyses to examine how they were reported and conducted. In particular, we assessed whether the reports adequately featured the key methodological components of the systematic review process.

### From evidence based medicine to medicine based evidence [^c88b348e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence based medicine, using randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses as the major tools and sources of evidence about average results for heterogeneous groups of patients, developed as a reaction against poorly designed observational treatment research and physician reliance on personal experience with other patients as a guide to decision-making about a patient at hand. However, these tools do not answer the clinician's question: "Will a given therapeutic regimen help my patient at a given point in her/his clinical course?" We introduce fine-grained profiling of the patient at hand, accompanied by comparative evidence of responses from approximate matches to this patient on whom a contemplated treatment has/has not been administered. This represents medicine based evidence that is tuned to decision-making for the particular patient.

### Finding and evaluating the evidence: a critical step in evidence-based medicine [^869937eb]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Practitioners of evidence-based medicine are expected to review the evidence for treatment effectiveness with their patients as part of the shared decision-making process. This requires practitioners to know the evidence or to know how to find and evaluate it. To find the evidence, the practitioner must craft the search question by considering the domains of population, intervention, and outcome as a means to individualize the search for each patient. To evaluate the evidence, the practitioner needs to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various types of scientific evidence. Most practitioners will consult EBP guidelines first. If guidelines do not answer the search question, the practitioner will turn to systematic reviews, ensuring that their methods of selection and evaluation are explicit and appropriate. Searching the scientific literature for single studies is also possible, but evaluating primary sources is more difficult. Given the constraints of time and expertise, the authors anticipate that computerized expert systems, based on current evidence, will become increasingly prominent.

### Treatment guidelines in psoriatic arthritis [^2075a9ba]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose of guidelines

As pathophysiology of disease and therapy effectiveness, particularly in specific scenarios, is better understood, physicians may struggle to keep up with the latest evidence. Treatment guidelines are designed with several goals in mind: to educate providers, particularly in a changing therapeutic landscape; to describe 'best care' through processing of the best available scientific evidence and broad consensus and to simultaneously point out where there is little information to guide treatment decisions; to reduce inappropriate variation in care and set standards for quality control; to promote efficient use of resources; and to highlight the research that needs to be done to inform future care.

### Complementary medicine in chronic pain treatment [^e75a89ec]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

This chapter looks at therapies that are considered "alternative" to conventional medical approaches. A definition of "complementary and alternative" medicine is considered in the context of the complex and clinically challenging field of pain medicine. A rationale for studying unorthodox treatments of chronic pain is presented. The challenges of an evidence-based approach to incorporating complementary therapies are explored, and a brief survey of several commonly available complementary medicine therapies is provided.

### Interpretation and use of a decision support tool for multiple treatment options: a combined randomised controlled trial and survey of medical students [^d01bf077]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2024). High credibility.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Clinicians need point-of-care decision support tools to understand and balance benefits and harms, including multiple treatment options based on complex evidence from network meta-analysis.
Practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) has shifted from critical appraisal of the literature towards efficient use of EBM resources and tools.
Little is known about how healthcare professionals and trainees can understand and employ such tools.

### Treatment of chronic non-cancer pain [^ac934243]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Chronic pain is a pervasive problem that affects the patient, their significant others, and society in many ways. The past decade has seen advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain and in the availability of technically advanced diagnostic procedures; however, the most notable therapeutic changes have not been the development of novel evidenced-based methods, but rather changing trends in applications and practices within the available clinical armamentarium. We provide a general overview of empirical evidence for the most commonly used interventions in the management of chronic non-cancer pain, including pharmacological, interventional, physical, psychological, rehabilitative, and alternative modalities. Overall, currently available treatments provide modest improvements in pain and minimum improvements in physical and emotional functioning. The quality of evidence is mediocre and has not improved substantially during the past decade. There is a crucial need for assessment of combination treatments, identification of indicators of treatment response, and assessment of the benefit of matching of treatments to patient characteristics.

### Position paper for the treatment of nightmare disorder in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position paper [^4f0750ac]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) position paper — scope and grading for adult nightmare disorder treatments states that nightmare disorder affects approximately 4% of adults and provides positions on behavioral, psychological, and pharmacologic therapies based on a literature search from March 2009 to August of 2017. In this paper, "recommended" and "not recommended" indicate a treatment option is determined to be clearly useful or ineffective/harmful for most patients, respectively, while "may be used" indicates that the evidence or expert consensus is less clear; the interventions in the position statements are listed in alphabetical order rather than clinical preference, and the ultimate judgment regarding any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of individual circumstances and available options and resources.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^9863a7c0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — evidence to recommendations: The panel considered core elements of the GRADE evidence, including certainty of evidence and the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, and acknowledged additional domains where applicable (feasibility, resource use, acceptability). For all recommendations, expert panelists reached consensus, with voting rules agreed on prior to the panel meetings for situations when consensus could not be reached; if deciding between a strong or a conditional recommendation in the same direction, "80% of the panel must vote for a strong recommendation", and when deciding between a conditional recommendation or no recommendation, "50% of the panel must vote for the same option with less than 20% voting for the alternative option". Recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional"; "we recommend" indicates strong recommendations and "we suggest" indicates conditional recommendations. Where comparators are not formally stated, the comparison of interest is implicitly "not using the intervention", and the recommendations acknowledge the current "knowledge gap" and aim at avoiding premature favorable recommendations and the rapid diffusion of potentially ineffective or harmful interventions.

### Gene therapy for sickle cell disease: where we are now? [^4f6e0a71]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

The landscape of sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment continues to evolve rapidly, with new disease-modifying therapies in development and potentially curative options on the horizon. Until recently, allogeneic stem cell transplant has been the only proven cure for SCD. Gene therapy is rising to the forefront of the discussion as a potentially curative or highly disease- modifying option for abating the complications of the disease. Understanding the different types of gene therapy in use, the differences in their end points, and their potential risks and benefits will be key to optimizing the long-term use of this therapy.

### How to use an article reporting a multiple treatment comparison meta-analysis [^ff2e5d6e]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Multiple treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis uses both direct (head-to-head) randomized clinical trial (RCT) evidence as well as indirect evidence from RCTs to compare the relative effectiveness of all included interventions. The methodological quality of MTCs may be difficult for clinicians to interpret because the number of interventions evaluated may be large and the methodological approaches may be complex. Clinicians and others evaluating an MTC should be aware of the potential biases that can affect the interpretation of these analyses. Readers should consider whether the primary studies are sufficiently homogeneous to combine; whether the different interventions are sufficiently similar in their populations, study designs, and outcomes; and whether the direct evidence is sufficiently similar to the indirect evidence to consider combining. This article uses the existing Users' Guides format to address study validity, interpretation of results, and application to a patient scenario.

### How to use a clinical practice guideline [^80866dfa]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Leading organizations increasingly recognize clinical practice guidelines as an important approach in promoting an evidence-based clinical practice of urology. In light of their considerable clinical, economic and medicolegal impact, guideline users should be confident that the guidelines were rigorously developed and address relevant patient questions. In this article we outline a practical approach for critically appraising a clinical practice guideline.

Materials and Methods

We outline a 3-step approach to the assessment of a clinical practice guideline that answers the questions of whether the recommendations are valid, what the recommendations are and whether they will help in the treatment of an individual patient.

Results

To determine the adequacy of a clinical practice guideline, urologists should carefully review the rigor of the development process and its content. Important questions that relate to the validity of a guideline are whether, for specific questions, all important management options and outcomes were considered, and whether there was an explicit and sensible process to identify, select and combine all relevant evidence. Clinical practice guidelines should formally grade the quality of the available evidence for a given clinical question and outline a formal process of how the recommendations were derived. Value judgments made in the guideline development process about the relative importance of the potential benefits and harms of a given health care intervention should be made transparent to the reader. The recommendations made should be practical and should address important clinical issues. Furthermore, their strength should be graded to reflect the underlying uncertainty about the evidence and the values applied in the guideline development process.

Conclusions

The systematic approach presented in this article will allow urologists to critically appraise clinical practice guidelines. Determining the validity of the recommendations, understanding the recommendations and assessing their applicability to patients are 3 fundamental steps toward an evidence-based approach to using clinical practice guidelines.

### Do we really apply evidence-based-recommendations to spine surgery? Results of an international survey [^47e2afeb]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the application of clinical methodology and decision-making thoroughly tested by duly controlled peer-reviewed studies. With the exponentially increasing number of publications, EBM aims to shift the traditional paradigm of making decisions based purely on the judgment of the physician or the experience of senior doctors to the use of results obtained from systematic and unbiased research in a patient-centered diagnosis and treatment model with the highest available evidence. The definition of EBM has evolved, but the most widely accepted definition was from Sackett et al. in 1996 and revised in 2000. In summary, it stated that clinicians should use the best, unbiased, clinically sound, and up-to-date data available on a patient basis in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Neurosurgery and Orthopedic Surgery are the pioneers of spine surgery throughout the world. Neurosurgeons have utilized EBM and clinical guidelines to make sound decisions for the last three decades. However, the increasing number of guidelines have questioned the validity of these recommendations as they may stray away from the rigorous process outlined by The Institute of Medicine (IOM). Orthopedic Surgery also recognized the importance of EBM in the early 2000s, and journal sections reserved for "Evidence-Based Orthopedics" emerged. The classical paradigm of trying non-operative treatment first and operative treatment, if the first step fails, has shifted towards surgical treatment vs. other treatment options.

Evidence-Based Spine Surgery (EBSS) has also emerged parallel to the development of EBM. The North American Spine Society (NASS) and Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) frequently publish guidelines with evidence-based suggestions to provide the highest evidence-based decisions in spinal pathologies. For example, EBSS supported by randomized controlled trials has shown discectomy for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation (LDH), decompression of spinal stenosis, and decompression with fusion of degenerative spondylolisthesis offer clinical benefit in relieving lower back and radicular pain compared to conservative treatment. However, pursuing EBSS as the sole deciding factor for diagnosing and treating spinal pathologies is unrealistic. Most of the publications on spine surgery are case-controlled retrospective cohorts or case series. Thus, the number of high-quality evidence parallel to spine surgery development is lacking. Considering the value of EBM and the probability of further implementation into decision-making, this study sheds light on the reception and application of EBM by spinal surgeons and the use of evidence-based modalities in their clinical practice.

### Renal denervation in the antihypertensive arsenal-knowns and known unknowns [^75312e63]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

GUIDELINES

Summarizing what International Hypertension guidelines say about renal denervation for the treatment of hypertension is straight forward, they do not say very much. The evaluation of treatment of hypertension with drug therapy, through randomized clinical trials is one of the most studied areas in clinical medicine. Guideline developers have benefited from a wealth of data from clinical outcome trials, demonstrating the effectiveness of drug treatments at reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Consequently, this has become the gold standard for recommending a new treatment. This is a high bar for new device-based treatments such as renal denervation because the studies with device-based treatments have been relatively small and of short duration, thus, assessing the impact of the intervention on morbidity and mortality has so far, been impossible, and is unlikely to happen. It could be argued that BP lowering per se, is a powerful surrogate for future benefit, irrespective of the means of achieving it. This concept has been applied to treatment recommendations in existing guidance for most lifestyle interventions advocated for hypertension, and also for the drug treatment of resistant hypertension. However, drug therapy for hypertension is now largely generic and low cost and economic considerations assume increasing importance in guidelines. To this end, the BP lowering efficacy of renal denervation appears modest, and the predictability (i.e. who will respond?) and durability of any BP lowering response remains uncertain. The inconsistency in the findings of some of the early RCTs also fueled concern about the efficacy, at the time major guidelines in the US and Europe were being developed for release in 2017 and 2018 respectively. This has been compounded by the recognition that much of the so called 'unmet need' to address poor BP control rates, relates to untaken medication, i.e. problems of adherence to multipill drug treatment, and that the recommendation in current guidelines advocating for wider use of single pill combinations of therapy should begin to address deficiencies in BP control. Mindful of all these considerations, none of the existing hypertension treatment guidelines across the world formally recommend renal denervation for routine clinical use to treat hypertension, outside of the context of clinical trials. Most of the current international hypertension guidelines have not even considered or commented on renal denervation for the treatment of hypertension. The position of various guidelines covering all regions of the world are summarized the table below. Whether this will change when new guideline committees begin considering their guideline updates, remains open to question because the challenges outlined above

### Myasthenia gravis: Association of British Neurologists' management guidelines [^932cf127]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction for which many therapies were developed before the era of evidence based medicine. The basic principles of treatment are well known, however, patients continue to receive suboptimal treatment as a result of which a myasthenia gravis guidelines group was established under the aegis of The Association of British Neurologists. These guidelines attempt to steer a path between evidence-based practice where available, and established best practice where evidence is unavailable. Where there is insufficient evidence or a choice of options, the guidelines invite the clinician to seek the opinion of a myasthenia expert. The guidelines support clinicians not just in using the right treatments in the right order, but in optimising the use of well-known therapeutic agents. Clinical practice can be audited against these guidelines.

### Principles of evidence-based medicine [^38891654]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine integrates clinical expertise, patients' values and preferences, and the best available evidence from the medical literature. Evidence-based orthopedics is a model to assist surgeons to improve the process of asking questions, obtaining relevant information efficiently, and making informed decisions with patients. With an increasing appreciation for higher levels of evidence, orthopedic surgeons should move away from lower forms of evidence. The adoption of randomized trials and high-quality prospective studies to guide patient care requires 2 prerequisites: (1) greater appreciation for the conduct of randomized trials in orthopedics and (2) improved education and training in evidence-based methodologies in surgery.

### What do clinical practice guidelines say about deprescribing? A scoping review [^9c0b11b9]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

Methods

A scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodsand the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews statement, by researchers and healthcare professionals with expertise in deprescribing, guideline development and scoping review methodology. The review protocol is hosted on Open Science Framework.

Operational definitions

Clinical practice guideline: A guidance document developed by a multidisciplinary team that includes recommendations (or equivalent based on different terminology used internationally) that can be applied by a healthcare professional to inform patient care. Recommendations must be informed by a systematic literature review (or termed an 'extensive evidence review' for National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines). For the purpose of this review, clinical practice guidelines are either;

Treatment guidelines

A clinical practice guideline that primarily focuses on the treatment of a condition and contains prescribing recommendations, but may also contain deprescribing recommendations.

Deprescribing-focused guidelines

A clinical practice guideline that primarily focuses on deprescribing medications.

Recommendations

Actionable statements contained within a clinical practice guideline, intended to optimise patient care. Recommendations can be;

Evidence-based

Guidance informed by a systematic review of the evidence in addition to an assessment of the benefits/harms of alternative treatment options.

Good practice statements

Guidance informed by indirect evidence outside the scope of a systematic search strategy that a guideline panel feels are important to include but are not appropriate for formal ratings of the quality of evidence. Also referred to as 'best practice statements' or 'practice points'.

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials: principles and pitfalls [^d45fbf66]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses allow for a more transparent and objective appraisal of the evidence. They may decrease the number of false-negative results and prevent delays in the introduction of effective interventions into clinical practice. However, as for any other tool, their misuse can result in severely misleading results. In this article, we discuss the main steps that should be taken when conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses, namely the preparation of a review protocol, identification of eligible trials, and data extraction, pooling of treatment effects across trials, investigation of potential reasons for differences in treatment effects across trials, and complete reporting of the review methods and findings. We also discuss common pitfalls that should be avoided, including the use of quality assessment tools to derive summary quality scores, pooling of data across trials as if they belonged to a single large trial, and inappropriate uses of meta-regression that could result in misleading estimates of treatment effects because of regression to the mean or the ecological fallacy. If conducted and reported properly, systematic reviews and meta-analyses will increase our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the available evidence, which may eventually facilitate clinical decision making.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^cb96e219]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

Methodology and evidence concepts for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) clinical practice guidelines define key terms: a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is an experiment comparing interventions by random allocation; relative effects include a risk ratio (RR) comparing outcome risk between intervention and control groups and an odds ratio (OR) using odds rather than risk; and risk of bias refers to flaws in design or execution that could bias estimates. Study quality pertains to a study's design, execution, and avoidance of bias, with internal validity indicating the degree results are likely true and free of bias. A systematic review (SR) is a rigorous approach to synthesizing data on benefits, harms, and effectiveness for a clinical population and uses prespecified criteria for screening, selecting, appraising, grading, and synthesizing outcomes. Transparency means methods are explicitly defined, consistently applied, and publicly available for review. Strength of evidence is the confidence that effect estimates are adequate to support a decision or recommendation, whereas strength of recommendation reflects confidence that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes across applicable patients.

### Clinical practice guidelines in China [^81ae7f26]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are statements that include recommendations for the optimisation of patient care. They are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative options. Such guidelines are an extremely important tool for healthcare delivery in China. Firstly, implementation of cost effective treatment and care will help to optimise resource use and patient outcomes for the country with the largest population in the world. Secondly, substantial variability in clinical practice exists among hospitals and in different districts across China, which can be minimised by the use of guidelines. Thirdly, China is the only country where Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine are practised alongside each other at every level of the healthcare system; traditional Chinese treatments account for about 40% of the total. Healthcare providers can use guidelines to identify and apply evidence based recommendations across both types of medicine in a complementary and safe manner. We analyse the situation and challenges for clinical practice guidelines in China and provide recommendations for their development and implementation.

Recommendation 14 (NEW 2/22/2023): Among immunocompromised patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel suggests against the routine use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Patients, particularly those who do not qualify for other treatments, who place a higher value on the uncertain mortality reduction and a lower value on the potential adverse effects of convalescent plasma would reasonably select convalescent plasma.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline key questions — acute episodic migraine pharmacologic treatment focuses on six key questions: comparative benefits and harms of initial pharmacologic treatments in adult patients with acute attacks of episodic migraine; comparative benefits and harms of second-step pharmacologic treatments for patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial pharmacologic treatment attempt for an acute migraine attack; patients' values and preferences regarding initial pharmacologic treatments; patients' values and preferences regarding second-step pharmacologic treatments; cost-effectiveness of initial pharmacologic treatments in adult patients; and cost-effectiveness of second-step pharmacologic treatments in patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial attempt. Across these, variation by demographic characteristics (age, sex, gender, race/ethnicity) and by the presence of menstrual or menstrual (cyclical) migraine is explicitly queried for benefits/harms and for outcomes.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^ddd674d3]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

PTSD clinical practice guideline evidence synthesis methods — control comparators, intervention grouping, and effect size handling — are described as follows: In efficacy, effectiveness, and comparative effectiveness research, the nature of the control condition is the foundation for building a comparison, and how control conditions were defined and grouped in the systematic reviews made clarity about the comparator condition a challenge. Systematic reviews sometimes distinguished inactive from active comparators with labels such as "waitlist", "assessment only", "treatment as usual", "psychoeducation", and "advocacy", yet some "inactive" control conditions incorporated active therapy components; because what counts as "inactive" was inconsistent, the Panel examined waitlist conditions separately from treatment as usual or other control conditions where possible. Interventions were commonly combined when they shared therapeutic features but not always combined similarly; for example, cognitive therapy techniques might be grouped together or separated into specific interventions (e.g. CPT) or techniques (e.g., cognitive restructuring). When specific and brand-name interventions were grouped within larger categories, this raised questions about distinct recommendations and impinged on the level of detail the Panel could make in coverage of/comments on these therapies; to address this, whenever there was a sizable literature base for a brand-name therapy not examined individually in meta-analyses, the Panel included a discussion of the specific evidence base in the guideline narrative. Recommendations were made separately based on the comparator used for a specific intervention for efficacy (e.g., waitlist, TAU, placebo) and comparative effectiveness (e.g., another active intervention), and there was occasional variation between showing efficacy and comparative effectiveness (superiority or noninferiority). Finally, standardized effect size estimates depend on review methods and can be problematic when RCT sample sizes are small or when network meta-analyses include low sample size studies; based on this and other limitations of network meta-analyses, the Panel used direct but not indirect effect size estimates from the network meta-analysis.

### Treatment of cutaneous warts: an evidence-based review [^8a444c9e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Cutaneous warts are common skin lesions caused by human papillomavirus infection. Treatment is aimed at relieving the patient's physical and psychological discomfort and at preventing the spread of infection by autoinoculation. Among the available medical and destructive therapeutic options for cutaneous warts, none is uniformly effective or virucidal. Moreover, in most cases their safety and efficacy has not been assessed in double-blind, controlled clinical trials, so that the reproducibility of many of the listed treatments is difficult to evaluate and a possible placebo effect cannot be ruled out. The aim of this article is to describe the outcome of current therapies for each clinical wart type according to evidence-based medicine studies published in the literature. For each clinical form, the existing treatments are classified as first-, second-, and third-line therapy. First-line therapy includes medical treatments (salicylic acid, silver nitrate, glutaraldehyde) that are useful to treat a single wart or a few and/or small common warts of short duration (less than 1 year). If these treatments have failed or are contraindicated, cryotherapy may be considered as second-line therapy. For recurrent or difficult-to-treat lesions, third-line therapy includes a variety of alternative therapeutic options (topical, intralesional, systemic, and physical destruction) that are generally off-label (not US FDA approved), and whose use is limited by drawbacks or adverse effects. From pooled evidence-based medicine data, it is possible to conclude that significantly higher remission rates may be expected only with cryotherapy and salicylic acid used in combination.

### Adherence to clinical practice guidelines [^bbb21454]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are designed to synthesize and disseminate the best available evidence to guide clinical practice. The goal is to increase high-quality care and reduce inappropriate interventions. Clinical practice guidelines that systematically review evidence and synthesize it into recommendations are important because the available scientific evidence is normally neither rapidly nor broadly incorporated into practice. It is important to understand and improve the impact of our American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation clinical practice guidelines on this uptake of scientific knowledge. Considering the barriers to guideline adherence is a central part of this. This understanding can guide clinicians, future guideline authors, and researchers when using guidelines, writing them, and planning clinically relevant research.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^0ddf2155]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Need for rigorous comparisons of treatments and treatment modality — more rigorous treatment comparisons of psychological interventions are needed, including developing methods to evaluate the contribution of specific aspects of psychotherapy models compared with the shared or nonspecific aspects. Fewer studies have compared the efficacy of individual modalities of treatment versus group modalities, and given how frequently group is the modality of treatment in certain settings (i.e. Veteran's Administration and psychiatric hospitals), better data on its comparability to traditional individual therapy is imperative. The panel also highlights assessing new models of delivering previously supported approaches, including delivery in new environments and the introduction of new technologies.

### When are treatment blinding and treatment standardization necessary in real-world clinical trials? [^3b3b9cd2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

QUESTIONS TO INFORM CHOICES REGARDING CONCEALMENT OR BLINDING OF TREATMENT ALLOCATION

Question 1: Will the providers, participants, and raters have expectations regarding likely benefits and adverse effects of study interventions?

Even when investigators perceive equipoise between alternative treatments, study participants or treating clinicians may have strong preferences or expectations regarding differences (Table 1). In comparisons of new products with treatments in common use, both patients and clinicians may anticipate that a new treatment will be superior. In comparisons of treatments in common use, expectations may be influenced by media reports or direct‐to‐consumer marketing. As seen during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, patient and clinician perceptions regarding highly publicized treatments may be strongly influenced by media reports and high‐profile endorsements. A priori, investigators should consider to what extent evaluations and opinions expressed in popular media, regardless of backing by robust evidence, may influence behaviors or study patients, clinicians, or raters.

Table 1
Considerations regarding blinding or allocation concealment

Example: The CURVES trialcompared efficacy and evaluated dosing of atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin. Based on an expectation that participants and clinicians would not have strong preferences or expectations regarding differences among these similar treatments, neither participants nor clinicians were blinded to treatment assignment.

Question 2: How might preferences or expectations influence intervention adherence, the fidelity or intensity of the treatment delivered, or the reporting of beneficial or adverse effects?

Participants' or clinicians' expectations, perceptions of treatments, or preferences could affect treatment delivery, adherence to study treatment, as well as the assessment of outcomes. The potential influence of preferences and expectations on treatment delivery or adherence would be expected to increase with treatment duration, treatment complexity, and the need for personalization or adjustment of treatment based on perceived beneficial or adverse effects. Preferences and expectations would be expected to have greater potential to bias assessment of outcomes requiring subjective assessments by participants or clinicians. Those biases could influence reporting or assessment of both benefits and adverse effects or potential harms.

As an example, in the CURVES trialcomparing alternative statins using fixed dosing regimens, the efficacy end points were mean percent change in enzymatically measured plasma LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations over 8 weeks of treatment. Given the simple dosing profile for each of the study medications and the laboratory‐based determination of study outcome, the opportunity for expectations to affect treatment delivery, patient medication adherence, or outcome assessment was limited. Consequently, neither participants nor clinicians were blinded to treatment assignment.

### Shared decision-making in cosmetic medicine and aesthetic surgery [^9d472269]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Shared decision-making (SDM) invokes the bidirectional communication between physicians and patients required to involve the patient's preference in the eventual treatment choice. This paper will explain what SDM is, why it is important, and how it is performed in clinical practice. It is an essential part of evidence-based medicine, as it helps determine whether the available evidence on the possible benefits and harms of treatment options match the patient's characteristics and preferences. Cosmetic medicine and aesthetic surgery seem to be obvious fields of medicine in which SDM should be applied to achieve high-quality care.

### Assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma treatment response with LI-RADS: a pictorial review [^48fac03c]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

A number of locoregional HCC treatments are available and their use varies according to the tumor burden, tumor location, patient's comorbidities, and institutional preference and expertise. Assessment of treatment response needs to consider expected imaging findings that may vary with the type of treatment, the magnitude of treatment response, and the timing of imaging after treatment. Having a basic knowledge of the existing treatment modalities and their expected appearance facilitates assessment of treatment response. LI-RADS Treatment Response is a practical way to assess and report treatment response. The four LR-TR categories are: LR-TR Nonevaluable, Nonviable, Equivocal, and Viable.

### Treatment of COVID-19: old tricks for new challenges [^4cef3fe9]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the absence of definitive management protocols, many treatment regimes have been explored in the treatment of COVID-19. Some of these treatments may have been tried out of desperation, and among these, some show initial promise. However, it is too early to see any published results of rigorous clinical trials.

Using the serum of recovered patients is a tried and tested approach, and trials are underway to study its effectiveness. This treatment appears to be helpful in the short term until definitive and effective treatments are found.

### Global guidelines in dermatology mapping project (GUIDEMAP), a systematic review of atopic dermatitis clinical practice guidelines: are they clear, unbiased, trustworthy and evidence based (CUTE)? [^8fdaaa06]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are essential for delivering optimum healthcare for patients, regardless of which healthcare provider delivers such care: their intention is to describe the available options of care, with their benefits and possible harms.CPGs provide healthcare providers with diagnostic and treatment options, based on the best available external evidence, and permit integration of clinical expertise and patients' values and preferences, as per the definition of evidence‐based medicine (EBM) of Sackett et al. Shared decision making allows the best personalized diagnostic path or treatment strategy to be chosen. In accordance with that paradigm, CPGs should incorporate the following aspects of evidence‐based medicine: a diverse guideline development group combining all the necessary expertise (clinical and methodological), clinical questions based on patients' needs, an underpinning systematic review and rating of the evidence, and local patient and/or stakeholder involvement to represent their views and values. Combining all these aspects should result in practical, clinical, graded and nuanced recommendations.

CPGs come in various formats and designs, as was demonstrated recently in a scoping review of available guidelines for the 12 most burdensome dermatological diseases. In a follow‐up of that scoping review, teams were formed per skin disease to (re)identify these (possibly updated) CPGs and subsequently appraise their quality. In the present review we assessed the CPGs on atopic dermatitis (AD). Among the nonfatal diseases worldwide, AD ranks number 14, measured in disability‐adjusted life‐years and prevalence. For skin diseases specifically, AD ranks number 1, due to its prevalence and overall burden of disease. Therefore, CPGs on AD are an important tool in caring for the wellbeing of people with AD.

The core question of this review is: are CPGs on AD clear, unbiased, trustworthy and evidence based (CUTE)? In order to answer that, this study summarizes and reports on the number of CPGs, their origin, their availability and, most importantly: how CUTE they actually are.

### Evidence based medicine: a movement in crisis? [^0b9dc402]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Return to real evidence based medicine

To address the above concerns, we believe it is time to launch a campaign for real evidence based medicine (box 2).

Individualised for the patient

Real evidence based medicine has the care of individual patients as its top priority, asking, "what is the best course of action for this patient, in these circumstances, at this point in their illness or condition?"It consciously and reflexively refuses to let process (doing tests, prescribing medicines) dominate outcomes (the agreed goal of management in an individual case). It engages with an ethical and existential agenda (how should we live? when should we accept death?) and with that goal in mind, carefully distinguishes between whether to investigate, treat, or screen and how to do so.

To support such an approach, evidence must be individualised for the patient. This requires that research findings be expressed in ways that most people will understand (such as the number needed to treat, number needed to harm, and number needed to screen) and that practitioners, together with their patients, are free to make appropriate care decisions that may not match what "best (average) evidence" seems to suggest.

Importantly, real shared decision making is not the same as taking the patient through a series of if-then decision options. Rather, it involves finding out what matters to the patient — what is at stake for them — and making judicious use of professional knowledge and status (to what extent, and in what ways, does this person want to be "empowered"?) and introducing research evidence in a way that informs a dialogue about what best to do, how, and why. This is a simple concept but by no means easy to deliver. Tools that contain quantitative estimates of risk and benefit are needed, but they must be designed to support conversations not climb probability trees.

### Reporting of results from network meta-analyses: methodological systematic review [^bbee6b08]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

When several healthcare interventions are available for the same condition, the corresponding network of results from randomised controlled trials must be considered (that is, which of the considered interventions have been compared against each other or against a common comparator such as placebo). A network meta-analysis allows for a quantitative synthesis of the network by combining direct evidence from comparisons of interventions within randomised trials and indirect evidence across randomised trials on the basis of a common comparator.

Networks of trials and network meta-analyses are increasingly used to evaluate healthcare interventions. Compared with pairwise meta-analyses, network meta-analyses allow for visualisation of a larger amount of evidence, estimation of the relative effectiveness among all interventions (even if some head to head comparisons are lacking), and rank ordering of the interventions.

The conduct of network meta-analyses poses multiple challenges. Several reviews have explained how to approach these challenges in practice; others have evaluated how indirect comparison meta-analyses and network meta-analyses have been conducted and reported. Most reviews have focused on checking the validity of key assumptions required in network meta-analyses (homogeneity, similarity/transitivity, consistency, or an overarching assumption of exchangeability); others have assessed the presence of essential methodological components of the systematic review process (for example, conducting a literature search and assessing the risk of bias of individual studies). These reviews did not evaluate the presentation of findings in reports of network meta-analyses.

Although reporting guidelines have been developed for systematic reviews and pairwise meta-analyses, we lack reporting guidelines for network meta-analyses. An international group is preparing an extension of the PRISMA statement for network meta-analyses. Inadequate reporting of findings and inadequate evaluation of the required assumptions may impede confidence in the findings and conclusions of network meta-analyses. Reports of network meta-analyses should allow the reader to assess the amount of evidence in the network of randomised trials and the relative effect sizes between interventions, along with their uncertainty.

On the basis of a previous methodological systematic review of published reports of network meta-analyses, we aimed to examine how network meta-analysis results are reported.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^65cb9368]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been an epidemic for many years. Our biggest challenge in treating CDI is preventing recurrence, which is seen in approximately 25% of patients with initial infection and in 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes. Given the major disease burden of this infection, appropriate data-driven treatment remains essential. Clinical treatment guidelines provide an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating the quality of the available data to make recommendations. As CDI has been evolving and more research has become available, the frequency of guideline issue from various global societies has increased, as has the detail of the recommendations to fit more relevant clinical scenarios. In this review, we will discuss clinical guideline recommendations over three time periods: The Initial Guidelines 1995–1997, The Second Wave 2009–2013, and The Modern Era 2014–present. We see the changing recommendations from metronidazole or vancomycin for initial infection during earlier times to preferential treatment with fidaxomicin within the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020. The recommended treatments for first recurrence were initially with the same antimicrobial as the first episode but have since changed to having multiple options for one or more recurrences. We have also seen the addition of immune boosting treatments, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab in the more modern recommendations. As the guidelines are evolving with the times, it remains important to understand the differences among them so we can apply this information clinically and optimize patient outcomes.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the evidence-based use of integrative therapies during and after breast cancer treatment [^8a25ec16]. CA (2017). Medium credibility.

Evidence appraisal for integrative therapies in breast oncology emphasizes shared decision making, cautious use of lower-grade options, and significant research gaps. The limited numbers of integrative modalities with grades of A or B emphasize the need for early provider–patient dialogue, and patients and clinicians should engage in shared decision making based on the best available evidence while reflecting patient values and preferences. In the meantime, clinicians and patients need to be cautious about therapies that received a grade of C or D and fully understand risks and benefits, and many other forms are used with little or no supporting evidence, prompting a compelling call for further research. Generalizability is limited because the majority of trial participants were non-Hispanic white women with high socioeconomic status, none of the trials examined age-related responses or premenopausal versus postmenopausal differences, and there is a clear need to design well powered, controlled trials using the best standard treatment control or an appropriate placebo.

### The contribution of RCTs to quality management and their feasibility in practice [^b036cb1c]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

External validity of RCTs

Many spine surgeons find it difficult to put the RCTs in context of the clinical needs and realities which may reduce the external validity of RCTs and hamper the implementation of treatment strategies from evidence-based medicine. By example, patients may not be representative because selection criteria are inappropriate, the experience and skill of the surgeon are difficult to standardize, and the principle of intention to treat is difficult to understand. If back surgeons do not find the evidence from RCTs helpful, it will be difficult to improve the level of evidence from "in my experience".

It is easy to forget that bias and confounding always play an important role for "in my experience", and that RCTs are designed in order to reduce these factors. The spine surgeon may argue that if the patient is really suffering and in a free healthcare environment, she wants to know what is best for her. That is what evidence-based medicine is about; to give the patient the best treatment available or to inform about the alternatives, the risks, and the prognosis with or without surgery. The spine surgeon himself would most likely prefer to have evidence-based treatment for back pain — and if surgery is the best choice he would prefer to select the surgeon.

RCTs are not only helpful just to compare two devices, but also to study the effectiveness of spine surgery per se. Certain surgical treatments, such as vertebroplasty for osteoporotic fractures, provide the option of being compared with sham surgery. The results from the first RCT designed to compare sham surgery and spine surgery are expected to be widely discussed among researchers and clinicians (. If the surgical technique applied is no better than sham surgery it may not be ethical to provide surgery.

Considering all the limitations, the knowledge gained from studies with a proper scientific design is considered to be far more reliable than the clinical experience of an individual surgeon. The aim is to combine evidence-based medicine and clinical skills in order to provide the best or most cost-effective treatment for the individual patient in an unbiased healthcare environment.

### Association between analytic strategy and estimates of treatment outcomes in meta-analyses [^486ec501]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

A persistent dilemma when performing meta-analyses is whether all available trials should be included in the meta-analysis.

Objectives

To compare treatment outcomes estimated by meta-analysis of all trials and several alternative analytic strategies: single most precise trial (ie, trial with the narrowest confidence interval), meta-analysis restricted to the 25% largest trials, limit meta-analysis (a meta-analysis model adjusted for small-study effect), and meta-analysis restricted to trials at low overall risk of bias.

Data Sources

One hundred sixty-three meta-analyses published between 2008 and 2010 in high-impact-factor journals and between 2011 and 2013 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews: 92 (705 randomized clinical trials [RCTs]) with subjective outcomes and 71 (535 RCTs) with objective outcomes.

Data Synthesis

For each meta-analysis, the difference in treatment outcomes between meta-analysis of all trials and each alternative strategy, expressed as a ratio of odds ratios (ROR), was assessed considering the dependency between strategies. A difference greater than 30% was considered substantial. RORs were combined by random-effects meta-analysis models to obtain an average difference across the sample. An ROR greater than 1 indicates larger treatment outcomes with meta-analysis of all trials. Subjective and objective outcomes were analyzed separately.

Results

Treatment outcomes were larger in the meta-analysis of all trials than in the single most precise trial (combined ROR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.07–1.19]) for subjective outcomes and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.01–1.05) for objective outcomes). The difference in treatment outcomes between these strategies was substantial in 47 of 92 (51%) meta-analyses of subjective outcomes (meta-analysis of all trials showing larger outcomes in 40/47) and in 28 of 71 (39%) meta-analyses of objective outcomes (meta-analysis of all trials showing larger outcomes in 21/28). The combined ROR for subjective and objective outcomes was, respectively, 1.08 (95% CI, 1.04–1.13) and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00–1.06) when comparing meta-analysis of all trials and meta-analysis of the 25% largest trials, 1.17 (95% CI, 1.11–1.22) and 1.13 (95% CI, 0.82–1.55) when comparing meta-analysis of all trials and limit meta-analysis, and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.86–1.04) and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00–1.06) when comparing meta-analysis of all trials and meta-analysis restricted to trials at low risk of bias.

Conclusions and Relevance

Estimation of treatment outcomes in meta-analyses differs depending on the strategy used. This instability in findings can result in major alterations in the conclusions derived from the analysis and underlines the need for systematic sensitivity analyses.

A clinical scenario is used to illustrate how the principles outlined in the previous articles in the series could be applied to help improve patient care. A practical demonstration of the art of formulating answerable clinical questions, finding evidence, critically appraising evidence, and putting evidence into practice is provided. The importance of integrating evidence with patient's preferences, and taking account of issues such as availability of interventions, costs, and so on is discussed. Finally, some of the issues involved in the development of evidence based policies within clinical teams are outlined.

### New horizons in clinical practice guidelines for use with older people [^09096e5f]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

As ageing-associated changes impact the balance of benefit/harm/burdens of treatment, it may seem sensible to apply age-specific guidance as has been done by NICE for secondary fracture prevention, but as chronological age is less discriminating within the older population, it is clinically more credible to incorporate other factors such as comorbidities, frailty, functional ability and cognitive function, as has been suggested for treatment target levels for hypertension. A consensus-based set of recommendations has been proposed to support CPG developers to make recommendations more applicable to multimorbid patient populations. The recommendations cover all the stages up to formulating recommendations and grading their strength.

Many of the systems used for describing strength of CPG recommendations also ask for consideration of 'indirectness', i.e. does the included evidence relate to the populations, interventions or outcomes of interest. For CPGs with an older adult focus, recommendations that rely on extrapolation from trials in middle-aged participants are necessarily downgraded on this characteristic. It may be that no evidence-based recommendation specific to older adults can be made. In the absence of empirical data, there is still value in collating clinical experience and wisdom, and some guidelines complement evidence-based recommendations with expert opinion statements. These are often based on consensus across a broad multidisciplinary group, and guidance on the conduct and reporting of such consensus opinion exercises is available.

Whatever approaches are taken to address the challenges described above, the CPG should explain the mechanism used for upgrading or downgrading levels of evidence into recommendations (Figure 2). External peer review of draft recommendations with relevant experts or stakeholders is recommended. Inclusion of the public and patients in this review varies and the optimal approach is not yet clear.

Considerations in formulating a guideline recommendation. Factors that influence the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation are distinct but complementary and combine to give a standard text. Further reading:

Inconsistencies in clinical practice guidelines

Differences between CPG recommendations may reflect the distinct uses that the sponsors or guideline panel have in mind. This is illustrated by osteoporosis treatment guidelines for which recommendations from the National Osteoporosis Guidelines Group UK (NOGG), which integrate available evidence on clinical efficacy, effectiveness and safety, differ from those of NICE, which applies a cost-effectiveness threshold for drug treatments. Differences may also arise from variable applicability to specific patient groups, for example, treatment guidelines for hypertension, where both treatment thresholds and drug choices differ.

### A clinical guide to the treatment of cellulite and comprehensive review of the etiology, pathophysiology, and utility of intervention [^00c29870]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cellulite is a common esthetic concern affecting most women. Despite its prevalence, there is no consensus on the optimal treatment approach for cellulite, partly due to the complex and multifactorial nature of its pathophysiology. Understanding the underlying biological processes along with available treatment options is important to be able to effectively counsel patients on effective management of this condition. This review aims to focus on high-quality evidence behind pathophysiology of cellulite, severity and grading, and its available treatment options.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the literature was performed using PubMed and Embase databases. Manuscripts that provided objective data with respect to pathophysiology, grading scales, and applications of treatment options were utilized.

Results

Using the existing CSS classification, an evidence-based algorithm is proposed for treatment of cellulite. Mild cellulite is best served with lifestyle modifications such as healthy diet, hydration, and exercise. Use of topicals in mild cellulite patients as adjuncts to lifestyle modifications have the highest efficacy, although there are inconsistent data on topical treatments. Moderate cellulite is best targeted with noninvasive treatment options including laser therapy, radiofrequency, and ultrasound. Radiofrequency demonstrates the strongest efficacy in the current peer-reviewed literature. Severe cellulite is recommended to be treated with minimally invasive approaches such as subcision and injectables.

Conclusion

Cellulite is a challenging cosmetic problem to treat, and thus multimodal treatment options should be considered in an attempt to achieve optimal outcomes and patient satisfaction. As the pathophysiology of cellulite is further elucidated, more targeted treatments may be developed in the future.

### Editorial: JBJS, the bone&joint journal, and clinical orthopaedics and related research require prospective registration of randomized clinical trials-why is this important? [^ddca3a30]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) represent the best study design for minimizing bias when investigating the effectiveness of a form of treatment. RCTs also are the building blocks of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which allow more generalizable conclusions to be drawn about therapeutic efficacy, provided that the trials themselves are well-designed and implemented, and provided that all of the data are available for such analyses.

Unfortunately, meta-analyses can only include those data that the authors can find. Many prospective trials are started but never finished, and many more are completed but never published. The RCTs that are published therefore only represent a proportion of those that are undertaken, and there is compelling evidence that if a study has a positive outcome it is more likely to be published.

Selective publication of this sort, sometimes called publication bias or positive-outcome bias, is harmful for at least two reasons. First, if two studies — one showing positive results and one showing no difference between interventions — have been performed, and the study with the positive outcome is more likely to be published and therefore available for meta-analysis, meta-analyses will tend to inflate the apparent benefits of a treatment and de-emphasize its harms. This may lead to the inappropriate adoption of new interventions that are less effective than they seem and that almost always are more expensive. Second, when studies that record no difference between interventions are performed but not published, a wasteful duplication of resources is likely to ensue when clinicians subsequently conduct trials that unbeknownst to them have already been carried out.

"Meta-analysis" is "The use of quantitative statistical methods in a systematic review to integrate the results of included studies". "Publication bias" is "A bias caused by only a subset of all relevant data being available", which can lead reviews that omit unpublished studies to "overestimate the true effect of an intervention".

### Network meta-analysis-highly attractive but more methodological research is needed [^2dc9a38e]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Network meta-analysis, in the context of a systematic review, is a meta-analysis in which multiple treatments (that is, three or more) are being compared using both direct comparisons of interventions within randomized controlled trials and indirect comparisons across trials based on a common comparator. To ensure validity of findings from network meta-analyses, the systematic review must be designed rigorously and conducted carefully. Aspects of designing and conducting a systematic review for network meta-analysis include defining the review question, specifying eligibility criteria, searching for and selecting studies, assessing risk of bias and quality of evidence, conducting a network meta-analysis, interpreting and reporting findings. This commentary summarizes the methodologic challenges and research opportunities for network meta-analysis relevant to each aspect of the systematic review process based on discussions at a network meta-analysis methodology meeting we hosted in May 2010 at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Since this commentary reflects the discussion at that meeting, it is not intended to provide an overview of the field.

### Evidence-based pathology: systematic literature reviews as the basis for guidelines and best practices [^974a17da]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Evidence-based medicine has been proposed as a new paradigm for the identification and evaluation of medical information. Best available evidence or data are identified and used as the basis for the diagnosis and treatment of individual patients. Evidence-based pathology has adapted basic evidence-based medicine concepts to the specific needs of pathology and laboratory medicine.

Objectives

To briefly review the history and basic concepts of evidence-based medicine and evidence-based pathology, describe how to perform and interpret systematic reviews, and discuss how to integrate best evidence into guidelines.

Data Sources

PubMed (National Library of Medicine, Washington, DC) and Web of Science (Thompson Reuters, New York, New York) were used.

Conclusions

Evidence-based pathology provides methodology to evaluate the quality of information published in pathology journals and apply it to the diagnosis of tissue samples and other tests from individual patients. Information is gathered through the use of systematic reviews, using a method that is less biased and more comprehensive than ad hoc literature searches. Published data are classified into evidence levels to provide readers with a quick impression about the quality and probable clinical validity of available information. Best available evidence is combined with personal experience for the formulation of evidence-based, rather than opinion-based, guidelines that address specific practice needs.

### Discordant and inappropriate discordant recommendations in consensus and evidence based guidelines: empirical analysis [^94110975]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Both consensus and evidence based approaches require judicious consideration of the relevant evidence, expert interpretation of the evidence, and ultimately. panel consensus. In other words, guideline panels must always carefully consider the available evidence, regardless of quality, and must always rely on expert insights to arrive at consensus recommendations; in this sense, denoting evidence based and consensus based recommendations as separate categories is misleading. Intention-to-treat consensus based guidelines as a separate category of guidelines seem to purposefully relax the necessary requirement that the strength of the recommendations should align with the underlying quality of evidence, which in turn, might result in inappropriate discordant recommendations.

If this is the case, one would expect a greater number of discordant recommendations, particularly inappropriate discordant recommendations, in consensus based guidelines than in evidence based guidelines. To date, however, empirical support for this expected findingis lacking. We provide an empirical assessment of how often consensus versus evidence based guidelines issued strong recommendations based on low quality evidence (discordant) and how many of them are inappropriate (inappropriate discordant recommendations). Because these are the world's leading professional organisations developing recommendations for people with cardiovascular diseases and cancer, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in much of the world, we evaluated ACC/AHA and ASCO guidelines. Recommendations by these organisations affect the decisions of thousands of physicians and outcomes for millions of patients worldwide.

Scenario 1: high-evidence bar situation

RCTs are generally considered the gold standard for generating evidence about the efficacy of medical interventions as they are designed to test treatment effects while essentially balancing for all other factors (known and unknown) that may affect their response to treatment. For some decision making problems, such as a new product likely to significantly increase drug spending or a product label expansion supporting a superiority claim, the evidence generation needs are high and RCTs are the preferred source of estimating comparative treatment effect estimates. However, in some circumstances described previously, there may still be a desire to augment the evidence from RCTs with results from NRS without directly performing cross-study design meta-analysis. This strategy may be instrumental when RCT evidence is very imprecise (eg, results are only reported for surrogate outcomes), not reflective of the patient population of interest or not covering important patient groups, even when the evidentiary needs for the decision problem are high.

In this circumstance, a natural approach is to treat the NRS data as prior evidence for the RCT analyses, adopting a Bayesian estimation framework. Here, the NRS data are summarised using a (network) meta-analysis and, if necessary, adjusted for a predefined amount of bias. The bias adjustment can be performed in different ways depending on the source of bias and the granularity of available data. For instance, it is possible to directly adjust for (differences in) measurement error or missing data with imputation methods. Alternatively, it is possible to apply corrections to the study results by eliciting expert opinion or using the credibility ceiling correction. The latter approach (credibility ceiling correction) assumes that no single NRS can provide a maximum credibility ceiling above a certain percentage. The results of the NRS analysis are then used as the prior distribution for the (network) meta-analysis of the RCT data. In other words, this approach will 'pull' the treatment-effect estimates from the RCTs toward the (adjusted) summary effects from the NRS. By default, the prior distribution(s) has the precision of the summary effect estimate(s) from the NRS. However, it is possible to decrease the precision of the prior distribution(s) by considering additional sources of uncertainty, such as the presence of between-study heterogeneity in the NRS results. A sensitivity analysis should also be conducted to adjust each NRS in the meta-analysis for various ceiling percentages and to observe the direction of effects and consistency in the conclusions obtained (step 6).

There is high certainty that the net benefit is substantial", with the suggestion, "Offer or provide this service". Grade B states, "Our committee recommends this treatment, test, or strategy to improve outcomes. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial", with the suggestion, "Offer or provide this service". Grade C states, "Our committee recommends selectively offering or providing this treatment, test, or strategy to improve outcomes to individual patients based on professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small", with the suggestion, "Offer or provide this service for selected patients depending on individual circumstances". Grade D states, "Our committee recommends against the intervention. There is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits", with the suggestion, "Discourage the use of this service". The I Statement says, "Our committee concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the intervention. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined", with the suggestion, "Read the clinical considerations section of the Recommendation Statement. If the treatment or service is offered, patients should understand the uncertainty about the balance of benefits and harms".

### The need to systematically evaluate clinical practice guidelines [^5043fbf5]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines abound. The recommendations contained in these guidelines are used not only to make decisions about the care of individual patients but also as practice standards to rate physician "quality". Physicians' confidence in guidelines is based on the supposition that there is a rigorous, objective process for developing recommendations based on the best available evidence. Though voluntary standards for the development of guidelines exist, the process of guideline development is unregulated and the quality of many guidelines is low. In addition, the few tools available to assess the quality of guidelines are time consuming and designed for researchers, not clinicians. Few guidelines are evaluated, either before or after their dissemination, for their impact on patient outcomes. Just as with pharmaceuticals and other products that can affect patients for better or worse, perhaps it is time to develop more standardized ways to evaluate the development and dissemination of clinical practice guidelines to ensure a similar balance between risk and benefit.

The biological agent(s) can cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.
Based on the totality of the available scientific evidence (including data from adequate and well controlled clinical trials, if available), it is reasonable to believe that:
the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing the serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and
the known and potential benefits of the product - when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat such disease or condition - outweigh the known and potential risks of the product, taking into consideration the material threat posed by the biological agent(s).
There is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating the serious or life-threatening disease or condition.

### Targeted therapies for cancer [^f359a23b]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The past few decades have seen extraordinary progress in developing novel treatment options that target tumors with specific molecular perturbations. These novel treatment options, known as targeted therapies, have shifted the treatment paradigm for a subset of cancer types, such as lung cancer. Emerging evidence has supported the rationale of the combination of targeted therapies with traditional therapies or immunotherapy to achieve optimal benefit while limiting the undesirable side effects. It takes a village to develop an approved targeted therapy from scratch. However, most cancer patients were unaware of the eligibility for targeted therapies upon diagnosis, which might have otherwise improved the overall prognoses. The development of next-generation sequencing has demonstrated a valuable asset for tailoring individualized treatment strategy. Nowadays, more and more patients could benefit from these targeted therapies. Even though, treatment resistance will inevitably develop, highlighting an urgent need to develop more innovative therapies that could target the evolving vulnerabilities.

### The American Society of Addiction Medicine clinical practice guideline development methodology [^8fa4772e]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations — Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are one way to translate evidence into clinical practice, and ideally a CPG is based on a systematic review of the evidence conducted by a group with experience in evidence synthesis. The CPG Writing Group is to use its expertise and perspective to translate evidence into practical recommendations that can be used by clinicians, policymakers, and the public. Elements to consider when translating evidence from the systematic review into recommendations include "Benefits and harms of the intervention or diagnostic test in question", "Certainty of evidence about these benefits and harms", "Values and preferences of the populations affected by the guideline", and "Costs and/or burden of the intervention or diagnostic test". The systematic review will outline estimates of the benefits and harms of a given intervention or diagnostic test for each outcome of interest and will also qualify how convincing the body of evidence is that underlies each effect estimate, with the degree to which a body of evidence is convincing or unconvincing most commonly referred to as the "certainty of evidence". The most commonly used framework to assess the certainty of a body of evidence was initially developed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group in 2000, and there is also a GRADE framework for assessing the strength of recommendation.

### Treatment options to manage wound biofilm [^a974b35f]. Advances in Wound Care (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Bioburden is an accepted barrier to chronic wound healing. Defining the significance, phenotype, clinical classification, and treatment guidelines has been historically lacking of evidence and based on paradigms that do not represent the scientific or clinical reality.

The Problem

Chronic wound bioburden is typically abundant, polymicrobial, and extremely diverse. These microbes naturally adopt biofilm phenotypes, which are quite often viable but not culturable, thereby going undetected. The failures of culture-based detection have led to abandonment of routine bioburden evaluation and aggressive treatment or, worse, to assume bioburden is not a significant barrier. Predictably, treatment regimens to address biofilm phenotypes lagged behind our diagnostic tools and understanding.

Basic/Clinical Science Advances

Microbial DNA-based diagnostic tools and treatment regimens have emerged, which provide and leverage objective information, resulting in a dramatic impact on outcomes.

Relevance To Clinical Care

Modern medicine demands decisions based on objective evidence. The diagnostic and treatment protocols reviewed herein empower clinicians to practice modern medicine with regard to bioburden, with DNA level certainty.

Conclusion

Bioburden is a significant barrier to healing for all chronic wounds. Molecular diagnostics provide the first objective means of assessing wound bioburden. The accuracy and comprehensive data from such diagnostic methodologies provide clinicians with the ability to employ patient-specific treatment options, targeted to each patient's microbial wound census. Based on current outcomes data, the most effective therapeutic options are topical (TPL) antibiofilm agents (ABF) combined with TPL antibiotics (ABX). In specific patients, systemic ABX and selective biocides are also appropriate, but not exclusive of ABF combined with TPL ABX.

### Summary of the recommendations on sexual dysfunctions in men [^4ad59d03]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sexual health is an integral part of overall health. Sexual dysfunction can have a major impact on quality of life and psychosocial and emotional well-being.

Aim

To provide evidence-based, expert-opinion consensus guidelines for clinical management of sexual dysfunction in men.

Methods

An international consultation collaborating with major urologic and sexual medicine societies convened in Paris, July 2009. More than 190 multidisciplinary experts from 33 countries were assembled into 25 consultation committees. Committee members established scope and objectives for each chapter. Following an exhaustive review of available data and publications, committees developed evidence-based guidelines in each area. Main Outcome Measures. New algorithms and guidelines for assessment and treatment of sexual dysfunctions were developed based on work of previous consultations and evidence from scientific literature published from 2003 to 2009. The Oxford system of evidence-based review was systematically applied. Expert opinion was based on systematic grading of medical literature, and cultural and ethical considerations.

Results

Algorithms, recommendations, and guidelines for sexual dysfunction in men are presented. These guidelines were developed in an evidence-based, patient-centered, multidisciplinary manner. It was felt that all sexual dysfunctions should be evaluated and managed following a uniform strategy, thus the International Consultation of Sexual Medicine (ICSM-5) developed a stepwise diagnostic and treatment algorithm for sexual dysfunction. The main goal of ICSM-5 is to unmask the underlying etiology and/or indicate appropriate treatment options according to men's and women's individual needs (patient-centered medicine) using the best available data from population-based research (evidence-based medicine). Specific evaluation, treatment guidelines, and algorithms were developed for every sexual dysfunction in men, including erectile dysfunction; disorders of libido, orgasm, and ejaculation; Peyronie's disease; and priapism.

Conclusions

Sexual dysfunction in men represents a group of common medical conditions that need to be managed from a multidisciplinary perspective.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS level of evidence (LOE) — quality definitions and pairing rules — are defined as: Level A includes High-quality evidence from more than 1 RCT, Meta-analyses of high-quality RCTs, and One or more RCTs corroborated by high-quality registry studies; Level B-R (Randomized) includes Moderate-quality evidence from 1 or more RCTs and Meta-analyses of moderate-quality RCTs; Level B-NR (Nonrandomized) includes Moderate-quality evidence from 1 or more well-designed, well-executed nonrandomized studies, observational studies, or registry studies and Meta-analyses of such studies; Level C-LD (Limited Data) includes Randomized or nonrandomized observational or registry studies with limitations of design or execution, Meta-analyses of such studies, and Physiological or mechanistic studies in human subjects; Level C-EO (Expert Opinion) is Consensus of expert opinion based on clinical experience. COR and LOE are determined independently (any COR may be paired with any LOE). The outcome or result of the intervention should be specified, and for comparative-effectiveness recommendations (COR I and IIa; LOE A and B only), supporting studies should involve direct comparisons of the treatments or strategies being evaluated.

### Impact of searching clinical trial registries in systematic reviews of pharmaceutical treatments: methodological systematic review and reanalysis of meta-analyses [^dbaeb5ec]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Inclusion of the RCT results in meta-analyses

We recorded the number of meta-analyses reported in the systematic review, the number of meta-analyses that could include the additional RCTs, and the number of meta-analyses for which all the RCTs identified had results available and could be included in the meta-analysis.

Finally, we determined the impact of including the RCTs on treatment effect estimates. For this purpose, we used an algorithm to select one meta-analysis in which at least one RCT with results available could be included.

For each systematic review we recorded all the outcomes of the meta-analyses reported in the systematic review report. For each eligible RCT with results available, we determined whether the RCT could be included in the meta-analyses previously recorded — ie, the RCT reports included:

Continuous outcomes — sample size, mean, and one measure of dispersion (standard deviation, standard error, or confidence interval) by group. Standard errors and confidence intervals were converted into standard deviations to perform the meta-analyses. When results were given for separate subgroups, we pooled the results, the pooled sample size being the sum of the subgroup sample sizes and the pooled mean being the weighted mean of the subgroups and the pooled standard deviation combined.

Binary outcomes — sample size and number of events by group.

Time-to-event outcomes — hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval or median survival times and confidence intervals by group.

Finally, when RCTs could be included in several meta-analyses, we selected only one meta-analysis according to the following order of outcomes analysed: the primary efficacy outcome of the systematic review, the primary harms outcome, and the patient important outcome, such as mortality, quality of life, or morbidity. If several of these outcomes could be used to include new RCTs, we selected the first meta-analysis reported. If none of these outcomes could be used to include a new RCT, we selected the first meta-analysis reported.

For each meta-analysis selected, we extracted the outcome data from the RCTs identified (eg, number of events and number of patients in each group, means, standard deviations). When the outcome data were available from several sources, we extracted a single source according to a prespecified order; data reported in the registry, data reported in a published report, and data reported on the sponsor's website.
