prognosis, risk factors, clinical course of childhood obesity

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prognosis, risk factors, and clinical course of childhood obesity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define childhood obesity and its severity. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and trajectory into adulthood. Next, I will examine the clinical course and immediate comorbidities, followed by long-term cardiometabolic and mortality implications. After that, I need to identify and stratify risk factors by modifiability and timing. I will then consider special populations and disparities. Finally, I should integrate evidence-based prognostic tools and synthesize a practical clinical takeaway with staging and intervention implications, making sure I double-check any conflicting data along the way.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework so I don't anchor on outdated definitions. Childhood obesity is defined as BMI at or above the 95th percentile for age and sex, and severe obesity as BMI at or above 120% of the 95th percentile or BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², whichever is lower; this aligns with the 2023 AAP guideline and contemporary pediatric obesity literature [^11118nTE] [^113hTPst]. Wait, I should verify the rationale for using longitudinal versus cross-sectional classification; emerging data suggest that longitudinal BMI class better reflects cardiometabolic risk than single-timepoint BMI, which supports incorporating persistence into prognosis and staging decisions [^114HFVm3].

> Next, I should review the epidemiology and trajectory. The prevalence of pediatric obesity has more than tripled in the U.S. since the 1960s, and modeling suggests that if 2017 trends persist, 57% of today's children will have obesity by age 35; I need to ensure I'm citing the AAP 2023 epidemiology section for that projection, which I am [^11118nTE]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about persistence; tracking studies show that BMI in childhood tracks strongly into adulthood, with approximately 84% of children with BMI in the 95th–99th percentile remaining obese as adults, and the odds of adult obesity rise progressively with the number of obese parents and with older age at obesity onset, underscoring the importance of early intervention windows [^116Jodjy] [^113seZVH].

> I will now examine the clinical course and immediate comorbidities. Severe obesity in youth is an "epidemic within an epidemic", with high rates of cardiometabolic risk factors already present in childhood; estimates suggest 67–86% of severely obese children have at least one cardiometabolic risk factor, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and NAFLD, which is now the most common pediatric liver disease and can progress to NASH and fibrosis [^113hTPst] [^1162caA1] [^116w89E3]. Wait, let me verify respiratory and endocrine complications; obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, GERD, early puberty, PCOS in girls, and hypogonadism in boys are well-described, and early puberty is particularly salient in girls with obesity, reinforcing the need to screen and counsel proactively [^116w89E3] [^116qwxaR].

> Next, I should review long-term cardiometabolic and mortality implications. I need to check whether childhood obesity independently predicts adult CVD or whether adult BMI mediates this relationship; longitudinal data indicate that persistent or worsening BMI trajectories from childhood associate with markedly higher adult CVD risk, while resolution of elevated child BMI attenuates risk, though some vascular changes may persist, supporting both tracking and early intervention hypotheses [^113tNFD2]. But wait, what if I overstate independence from adult BMI? A systematic review suggests much of the association between childhood obesity and adult metabolic syndrome is mediated by adult BMI, so I should be cautious and frame risk as jointly determined by childhood adiposity and its persistence into adulthood [^1121GTHv]. I should also confirm mortality data; youth with severe obesity face substantially elevated risks of cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and premature mortality, with mortality risk approximately threefold higher before age 30 in some cohorts, emphasizing the urgency of early risk reduction [^1162caA1] [^111RQR9j].

> Now, I need to identify and stratify risk factors by modifiability and timing. Let me think about non-modifiable and early-life factors first: parental obesity, especially maternal obesity, confers strong genetic and environmental risk, with heritability estimates of 40–70% and monogenic contributors like MC4R in a minority; early BMI rebound before age 5, large-for-gestational-age status, and prenatal exposures such as gestational diabetes and excess gestational weight gain also elevate risk, and preterm birth increases later obesity risk via altered growth patterns [^111zXUQY] [^116teHHH] [^117Bvvt3] [^116Jp2PC]. Hold on, I should verify the strength of maternal obesity; yes, parental obesity — particularly maternal — substantially increases offspring odds of persistent obesity, and early BMI rebound is a recognized predictor of later adiposity [^113seZVH] [^116teHHH].

> Turning to modifiable and behavioral factors, I should confirm that energy imbalance from high caloric intake and low physical activity are central, with sedentary screen time linked to risk factor clustering; dietary patterns, sleep duration and quality, and psychosocial stressors including adverse childhood experiences also contribute meaningfully to weight trajectories and comorbidity risk [^113k4KqU] [^111MqtMS]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ACEs were only weakly associated; more recent data reinforce their persistent association with both childhood and adult obesity, so I should correct that impression and incorporate ACE-informed care into risk stratification and counseling [^111MqtMS].

> I should also consider social determinants and health equity explicitly. Racism, poverty, under-resourced communities, and immigration status are associated with higher obesity prevalence and worse outcomes; Black and Hispanic youth experience higher rates of severe obesity and lower remission rates even after accounting for socioeconomic status, which mandates culturally responsive, structurally informed care plans and advocacy for policy change to address upstream drivers [^117FazNU] [^113RDDom] [^1151asyj]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines explicitly call for SDOH assessment; yes, the AAP and Canadian guidelines both emphasize routine assessment of SDOH and tailoring interventions accordingly [^115pzUAP] [^116z2W2G].

> Next, I should review special populations and secondary contributors. Hypothalamic obesity after craniopharyngioma or other hypothalamic injury occurs in up to half of treated children and often follows a severe, treatment-resistant course; early recognition and specialized management are essential [^113rdzvG]. I need to ensure I also note that children with obesity have worse outcomes in certain acute illnesses, including higher relapse risk in ALL and more severe COVID-19 manifestations, which should inform anticipatory guidance and acute care planning [^112E7U42] [^111ShGSQ].

> Let me consider prognostic tools and markers that refine risk prediction beyond BMI alone. I should double-check that waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio capture visceral adiposity and insulin resistance risk, and that pediatric metabolic syndrome, while debated diagnostically, signals risk factor clustering that warrants intensified lifestyle therapy and comorbidity screening; nonetheless, BMI persistence and severity remain powerful predictors and should anchor staging and follow-up frequency [^114sUrDN] [^111yrqRi] [^1174TaZn]. Wait, I should verify whether longitudinal BMI classification improves risk discrimination; yes, recent work shows longitudinal BMI class outperforms cross-sectional BMI for predicting cardiometabolic risk, supporting periodic reassessment and risk reclassification over time [^114HFVm3].

> I will now synthesize the clinical course into a practical trajectory. Early-onset obesity with upward BMI trajectories tends to persist into adulthood and is associated with earlier onset of T2D, CVD, and NAFLD; risk escalates with severity and duration, while weight loss — especially before puberty — confers substantial risk reduction, though disease-specific benefits vary and some vascular remodeling may be incompletely reversible despite BMI normalization [^111RQR9j] [^113tNFD2]. Hold on, I should verify that even partial remission reduces long-term morbidity; real-world data indicate that beneficial response to pediatric obesity treatment significantly reduces later morbidity and mortality, though the need for bariatric surgery in some patients underscores disease complexity and relapse risk [^117Ks6Bp].

> Finally, I need to translate this into a clinical takeaway with staging and intervention intensity. Given the chronic, relapsing nature of obesity and its escalating comorbidity burden, guidelines recommend a stepped-care approach with longitudinal, individualized assessment of risk factors and SDOH, family-centered behavioral treatment as first-line, escalation to pharmacotherapy for adolescents with persistent obesity and comorbidities, and consideration of metabolic and bariatric surgery for those with class 2 obesity and refractory comorbidities despite comprehensive therapy; early, sustained weight reduction is critical to altering long-term prognosis, and care must be non-stigmatizing and equity-focused [^113RDDom] [^114iBRwb] [^112vFA5v]. I should confirm that the ADA supports metabolic surgery in adolescents with T2D and class 2 obesity after lifestyle and pharmacotherapy failure, which it does, aligning endocrine and surgical guidance with pediatric obesity care pathways [^114iBRwb].

Childhood obesity is a chronic, relapsing condition with **high persistence into adulthood** [^116Jodjy] and **early onset of serious comorbidities** [^112Mycu1], including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, NAFLD, and cardiovascular disease [^1162caA1]. Prognosis is worst in severe obesity, early-onset cases, and those with metabolic syndrome or persistent obesity into adulthood [^113tNFD2]; risk is amplified by genetic predisposition, socioeconomic adversity, and obesogenic environments [^114aGXmF]. Clinical course typically shows **tracking of adiposity and risk factors** from childhood to adulthood [^116Jodjy], with early intervention (lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, or surgery) [^117Ks6Bp] improving outcomes, though relapse is common without sustained care [^111uFw4J].

---

## Prognosis of childhood obesity

- **Persistence into adulthood**: Childhood obesity strongly tracks into adulthood [^116Jodjy]; 84% of children with BMI 95th–99th percentile remain obese as adults [^116Jodjy], and early-onset obesity increases lifelong risk [^116teHHH].

- **Early comorbidities**: Obese children frequently develop type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, NAFLD, and cardiovascular disease [^1162caA1] during childhood or adolescence [^1162caA1].

- **Mortality risk**: Childhood obesity is associated with increased premature mortality, including cardiovascular and all-cause mortality [^111RQR9j].

- **Severity and duration**: Severe obesity (BMI ≥ 120% of 95th percentile) [^11118nTE] carries higher risk of persistent obesity and severe comorbidities than milder obesity [^1162caA1].

## Risk factors influencing prognosis

| **Risk factor category** | **Specific risk factors** | **Impact on prognosis** |
|-|-|-|
| Genetic and biological factors | - Genetic predisposition (e.g. MC4R mutations) [^111zXUQY] <br/> - Family history of obesity <br/> - Early adiposity rebound [^116teHHH] | Strongly increase risk of persistent obesity and metabolic complications [^113k4KqU] |
| Socioeconomic and environmental factors | - Low socioeconomic status <br/> - Food insecurity <br/> - Sedentary lifestyle <br/> - High screen time [^113k4KqU] <br/> - Obesogenic environment [^114aGXmF] | Significantly increase risk of obesity persistence and comorbidities [^114aGXmF] |
| Behavioral and dietary factors | - Poor dietary habits <br/> - High sugar-sweetened beverage intake <br/> - Irregular meal patterns <br/> - Low physical activity [^113NxsXE] | Major modifiable drivers of obesity progression and relapse [^112Ksgpw] |
| Medical and psychological factors | - Metabolic syndrome [^113k4KqU] <br/> - Insulin resistance <br/> - Psychological distress <br/> - Depression <br/> - Anxiety [^116w89E3] | Increase risk of persistent obesity and severe comorbidities [^112Mycu1] |

---

## Clinical course and progression

- **Early childhood**: Rapid weight gain in infancy and early childhood predicts later obesity and metabolic risk [^1155s7ev].

- **Adolescence**: Obesity often intensifies during adolescence, with emergence of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension [^112Mycu1].

- **Adulthood**: Persistent obesity into adulthood markedly increases risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, and reduced life expectancy [^111QVQyy].

- **Relapse**: Weight regain is common after interventions, underscoring the need for sustained, long-term management [^117Ks6Bp].

---

## Impact of early intervention

Lifestyle interventions — dietary modification, increased physical activity, and behavioral therapy — can **reduce BMI and improve metabolic health**, though sustained adherence is critical to prevent relapse [^112Ksgpw]. Pharmacotherapy (e.g. GLP-1 receptor agonists) may be considered for adolescents with severe obesity or refractory comorbidities [^notfound]. Bariatric surgery achieves **substantial weight loss and comorbidity resolution** in carefully selected adolescents but requires long-term follow-up and monitoring [^113hTPst].

---

## Long-term health outcomes

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Increased risk of hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular events [^112HEanM].

- **Type 2 diabetes**: Higher incidence and earlier onset, with greater severity than in adult-onset diabetes [^111RQR9j].

- **Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease**: Common in obese children, with risk of progression to cirrhosis and liver failure [^116w89E3].

- **Psychosocial consequences**: Persistent stigma, depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life [^116w89E3].

---

Childhood obesity has a **poor prognosis** without sustained intervention, characterized by persistence into adulthood and early onset of serious comorbidities. Early, comprehensive, and sustained treatment improves outcomes, but relapse is common without ongoing care [^117Ks6Bp].

1 Introduction

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a truly global pandemic. As of August 2021, there had been more than 197 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 4.2 million deaths worldwide. Findings of a previous study have shown that children with COVID-19 had on average milder clinical symptoms and better prognosis than adults. However, as the number of children with COVID-19 continues to rise globally, so does the number of children with severe course of disease. Children also sometimes need hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or a ventilator to help them breathe, and may be at increased risk of death. Therefore, despite children being less affected by COVID-19 than adults, finding the risk factors for poor prognosis is crucial to identify the children at highest risk as early as possible. Given the growing number of preventive and therapeutic possibilities, a hierarchical prognostic classification can help to identify patient groups suitable for earlier and/or more aggressive intervention. Identification of the children at greatest risk can help to decrease mortality in the affected children, and also reduce the resources needed for intensive care.

Only few guidelines that focus on prognosis in children with COVID-19 exist. The guidelines of the Centers for Disease Controlindicate that the risk of developing severe COVID-19 for children was higher if pre-existing conditions, for example, obesity, diabetes, asthma, chronic lung disease or immunosuppression, were present. One consensus statementmentions, amongst other factors, age less than 3 months, poor mental response or lethargy, progressive elevation of lactate levels, and rapid progression of pulmonary lesions in the short term as predictors for severe disease course. However, none of the above recommendations were formulated according to the principles of evidence-based medicine. Although studies on risk factors for poor prognosis in children and adolescents with COVID-19 exist and they sometimes have come to similar conclusions, there remain several controversies or divergences with respect to some factors. For example, Fisler et al. proposed that age above 12 years was associated with a higher risk of ICU admission, but Abrams et al. failed to find an association.

### Childhood obesity: how long should we wait to predict weight? [^116FJEK1]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Obesity is highly prevalent in children under the age of 5 years, although its identification in infants under 2 years remains difficult. Several clinical prediction models have been developed for obesity risk in early childhood, using a number of different predictors. The predictive capacity (sensitivity and specificity) of these models varies greatly, and there is no agreed risk threshold for the prediction of early childhood obesity. Of the existing models, only two have been practically utilized, but neither have been particularly successful. This commentary suggests how future research may successfully utilize existing early childhood obesity prediction models for intervention. We also consider the need for such models, and how targeted obesity intervention may be more effective than population-based intervention.

### Pediatric obesity [^114L681C]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Childhood obesity is a tremendous burden for children, their families, and society. Obesity prevention remains the ultimate goal but rapid development and deployment of effective nonsurgical treatment options is not currently achievable given the complexity of this disease. Surgical options for adolescent obesity have been proven to be safe and effective and should be offered. The development of stratified protocols of increasing intensity should be individualized for patients based on their disease severity and risk factors. These protocols should be offered in multidisciplinary, cooperative clinical trials to critically evaluate and develop optimal treatment strategies for morbid obesity.

### Childhood metabolic syndrome: must we define it to deal with it? [^1172bH8s]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

COMPLEXITY OF DEFINITIONS OF THE METABOLIC SYNDROME IN CHILDHOOD

Several definitions of the metabolic syndrome in children have been proposed by various research groups and expert consensus, and the use of different definitions in the same patient cohort may result in different prevalence or prediction outcomes. All of the definitions share common features: First, all definitions include an obesity element (waist circumference or BMI), two "dyslipidemia" elements (elevated triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol), elevated blood pressure, and a component representing glucose metabolism (impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance). All of these definitions are based on population-derived percentile thresholds for each component. Importantly, the choice of these elements in various definitions is in some cases a result of simplicity and cost (such as using a fasting blood sample) and the presence of good reference values (using BMI) and thus not necessarily the optimal choice one would have made for better diagnosis or prediction. Second, all definitions use each component of the cluster as a dichotomous variable defined by a threshold and share the concept that all components have an equal "value" in the cumulative score. The latter two principles simplify the use of such definitions in everyday practice yet seem problematic in the sense that cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated fasting glucose and triglycerides or the degree of obesity represent continuous variables that signify risk, not necessarily in a linear fashion. Thus, for example, whereas increasing BMI during childhood represents a continuous risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease in adulthood even within the normal BMI range, severely obese children may have a significantly worse metabolic phenotype compared with moderately obese children. A seemingly "upper normal" fasting glucose in the context of obesity may signify future risk. Similarly, the fasting triglyceride level in late adolescence and its change within a brief follow-up of ∼5 years can predict the development of diabetes and of coronary heart disease even when both measurements are below the threshold used in all of the proposed definitions. Thus, some have suggested that a "hypertriglyceridemic waist" phenotype can serve as a risk predictor for clinical purposes regardless of other components, highlighting a potential stronger metabolic impact of abdominal obesity and plasma triglyceride levels compared with other components of the definition. Although no such data exist in pediatric studies, it has been shown in adults that the presence of some combinations of components of the syndrome confers a worse prognosis than others. Specifically, over an 8-year follow-up, patients having a combination of central obesity, high blood pressure, and hyperglycemia had a 2.36-fold increase of incident cardiovascular events and a threefold increased risk of mortality. Thus, particular combinations of factors included in the definitions of the metabolic syndrome confer greater risks and raise questions regarding the equal value given in the overall score to each of the components.

### Executive summary: clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^114aGXmF]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Childhood obesity — chronic disease and social determinants — childhood obesity results from a multifactorial set of sociocoeiogical, environmental, and genetic influences, and the CPG describes risk factors for overweight and obesity, many of which are SDOHs. These SDOHs include factors related to broader policies and systems; institutions and organizations (ie, schools); neighborhoods and communities; and family, socioeconomic, environmental, ecological, genetic, and biological factors, and these risk factors often overlap and/or influence one another and can operate chronically throughout childhood and adolescence, initiating weight gain and escalating degrees of existing obesity. The subcommittee recommends that pediatricians and other PHCPs perform initial and longitudinal assessment of individual, structural, and contextual risk factors to provide individualized and tailored treatment of the child/adolescent with overweight/obesity.

### Childhood obesity and cardiovascular disease: links and prevention strategies [^117HX4wt]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

The prevalence and severity of pediatric obesity have dramatically increased since the late 1980s, raising concerns about a subsequent increase in cardiovascular outcomes. Strong evidence, particularly from autopsy studies, supports the concept that precursors of adult cardiovascular disease (CVD) begin in childhood, and that pediatric obesity has an important influence on overall CVD risk. Lifestyle patterns also begin early and impact CVD risk. In addition, obesity and other CVD risk factors tend to persist over time. However, whether childhood obesity causes adult CVD directly, or does so by persisting as adult obesity, or both, is less clear. Regardless, sufficient data exist to warrant early implementation of both obesity prevention and treatment in youth and adults. In this Review, we examine the evidence supporting the impact of childhood obesity on adult obesity, surrogate markers of CVD, components of the metabolic syndrome, and the development of CVD. We also evaluate how obesity treatment strategies can improve risk factors and, ultimately, adverse clinical outcomes.

### Childhood obesity: causes, consequences, and management [^112ULPEt]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

One-third of North American children are overweight or obese. Pathologic obesity accounts for only a small percentage of these cases. The vast majority are the result of a complex interaction of genetic and hormonal, nutritional, physical activity, and physical and social environmental factors. Obesity increases the risk for various cardiometabolic, pulmonary, and psychosocial complications for children, which often continues into adulthood. Multidisciplinary care, focusing on family-centered behavior change, is an evidence-based, essential part of the treatment, along with pharmacologic and surgical options for more complex cases. Prevention and early intervention strategies are key to reversing the obesity epidemic.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^113k4KqU]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Risk factor clustering and the metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents is described with genetic, lifestyle, prognostic, and treatment evidence as follows. The metabolic syndrome cluster of risk factors is more common in children with a parental history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or metabolic syndrome, and African Americans have a significantly higher prevalence of components beginning at puberty; sedentary behavior measured as hours of screen time per day is linked to increased odds of the cluster, and increased childhood obesity prevalence has been associated with increased clustering over the past decade. Longitudinal cohorts in which the cluster was present in childhood identify increased incidence of both T2DM and clinical cardiovascular (CV) events over a follow-up of up to 25 years. Obesity with elevated insulin from early childhood and the combination of obesity and elevated insulin strongly predicted future metabolic syndrome, and when obesity is accompanied by hypertension in childhood the risk of future metabolic syndrome is increased; waist circumference and body mass index (BMI) in children and adolescents both predict future development of the metabolic syndrome. Emerging data suggest that use of the metabolic syndrome diagnosis in children and adolescents may increase the ability to predict subclinical target organ damage in adulthood, although cross-sectional studies of relationships with vascular dysfunction are less clear, and additional longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether childhood metabolic syndrome predicts CV outcomes beyond individual risk components. Treatment of CV risk factor clustering in youth has not been thoroughly evaluated; maintenance of low levels of CV risk factors starting in childhood is associated with a lower prevalence of end organ damage as assessed by carotid intima-media thickness in adults. Several nonrandomized, single-arm diet and exercise trials show improvement in metabolic syndrome-associated CV risk factors but involve small numbers of subjects and follow-up, and a small number of randomized controlled trials address treatment of the metabolic syndrome cluster with medication in obese adolescents with insulin resistance; all used metformin as an insulin-sensitizing agent and, in each, metformin was associated with greater weight loss, an improvement in endocrine-metabolic measures and some decrease in abdominal fat mass compared with the control group. Additional large randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up in children are needed before insulin-sensitizing agents can be routinely recommended for either treatment of obesity or prevention of diabetes in youth with metabolic syndrome.

A. Health equity considerations — Differences in disease prevalence and outcomes are often labeled disparities, but disparity only defines differences between groups and does not address inequities that cause these differences, which include economic, civil-political, cultural, or environmental conditions required for parity and equity. Because inequities intertwine across the life course, health disparities occur from maternal pregnancy outcomes through adolescence and can impact childhood obesity. This distinction is important in chronic disease because obesity risk factors are embedded in the socioecological and environmental fabric of children's lives, and there is a danger of stigmatizing children with obesity and their families on the basis of race and ethnicity, age, and gender based on disparities of outcome without recognizing systemic challenges that cause and maintain inequities. Inequities are often associated with each other and result in disparities in obesity risk and outcomes.

Obesity is currently considered a global epidemic, and its implications in mortality and morbidity in a paediatric patient and in adulthood are increasingly important. The objective of this article is to review in detail the definition of obesity according to age group, and, in turn, the epidemiology of this entity worldwide and in South America. Available evidence about pathophysiology and, additionally, associated comorbidities are reported in some of the most important and clinically relevant body systems. The recommendations on pharmacological and nonpharmacological management through changes in lifestyle and relevant aspects of bariatric surgery in the paediatric population are also described.

### Metabolic complications of childhood obesity: identifying and mitigating the risk [^1146kaM5]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The growing number of obese children and adolescents across the world creates a diagnostic challenge to caregivers. The early clinical manifestations of abnormalities related to childhood obesity, attributed to obesity-driven insulin resistance, are impaired glucose metabolism and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Both have no symptoms and demand a high index of suspicion and the proper choice of tests for establishing the diagnosis. The clinician should gather information derived from thoroughly taken history and a focused physical examination to stratify patients by their risk. Focused lifestyle modification-aimed interventions are showing promising results in improving the metabolic profile of obese children. Early diagnosis may help allocate resources for intensive interventions that may benefit individuals at greatest risk for early obesity-related morbidity.

### A risk score for childhood obesity in an urban latino cohort [^1155s7ev]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether individual obesity risk factors, present during gestation, and the first 6 months of life, can be combined into a simple prognostic model that has the ability to accurately predict childhood obesity at age 5 years in a high-risk cohort.

Study Design

A total of 201 Latina women were recruited during pregnancy, and their infants followed longitudinally. Ten risk factors for childhood obesity were included in an initial logistic model; a second reduced model was created via stepwise deletion (confirmed with nonparametric conditional random forest classifier), after which 5 risk factors remained. From each model, an obesity risk equation was derived, and an obesity risk score was generated for each patient. Derived algorithms were assessed using discrimination, calibration, and via predictive statistics.

Results

Of the 166 children followed through age 5 years, 56 (32%) met criteria for childhood obesity. Discrimination accuracy for both derivation models was excellent, and after optimism-corrected bootstrapping, both models showed meaningful clinical performance. Both models were adequately calibrated, showed strong sensitivity and negative predictive value at conservatively set obesity risk thresholds, and displayed excellent specificity among those classified as highest risk. Birth weight z-score and change in weight-for-age z-score between birth and 6 months were the risk factors with the strongest contribution to the obesity risk score.

Conclusions

Obesity risk algorithms are reliable in their prediction of childhood obesity and have the potential to be integrated into the electronic medical record. These models could provide a filter for directing early prevention resources to children with high obesity risk but should be evaluated in a larger external dataset.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^113RDDom]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

II. Approach — Childhood obesity results from a multifactorial set of socioecological, environmental, and genetic influences, with risk increased among children exposed to adversity and social determinants of health (SDOHs) such as racism; overweight and obesity are more common in children who live in poverty, underresourced communities, immigrated families, or those who experience discrimination or stigma, and obesity does not affect all population groups equally, highlighting the need to understand SDOHs and the social context in care. Children with overweight and obesity benefit from health behavior and lifestyle treatment as a child-focused, family-centered, coordinated approach to care, coordinated by a patient-centered medical home, which may involve pediatricians; registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs); psychologists; nurses; exercise specialists; social workers; families; schools; communities; and health policy. Because obesity is a chronic disease with escalating effects over time, a life course approach to identification and treatment should begin as early as possible and continue longitudinally through childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with transition into adult care; obesity is long-lasting with persistent negative health effects, attributable morbidity and mortality, and social and economic consequences impacting quality of life.

### Childhood metabolic syndrome: must we define it to deal with it? [^112fhTBr]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The metabolic syndrome, also known as "syndrome X", describes a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors that have been shown to predict the development of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Some suggest that the cluster is driven by the consequences of peripheral insulin resistance, whereas others believe that obesity-related inflammation is the culprit. Many putative molecular mechanisms can provide excellent explanations for both theories regarding the primary driving mechanism of the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors and how each one accelerates atherogenesis. Yet teasing inflammation and peripheral insulin resistance apart in individual patients or even in large cohorts is difficult because of their coexistence and possible vicious exacerbation of each other. The general paradigm regarding the evolvement of the syndrome is that adipocyte dysfunction in some obese individuals who are genetically prone or exposed to specific environmental signals leads to peripheral insulin resistance and subclinical inflammation culminating in accelerated atherosclerosis and overt clinical manifestations. The clinical utility of defining this syndrome in children and adolescents has been debated, since some propose that from a clinical standpoint, addressing each component of the cluster individually has comparable clinical and predictive outcomes, whereas others suggest such definitions are inappropriate for the pediatric age group. This debate has important implications from an epidemiological and public health standpoint. Yet it is imperative to indicate that the underlying pathophysiology that leads to the typical metabolic milieu characteristic of individuals with obesity-driven peripheral insulin resistance and/or subclinical inflammation has common features in all ages and is postulated to be the "driving force" of the development of accelerated atherogenesis and altered glucose metabolism in susceptible individuals.

### Risk factors and predictive biomarkers of early cardiovascular disease in obese youth [^117UdBYz]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Obesity in childhood and adolescence continues to be a major health issue due to significant health implications and to the economic burden that arise from treating this disease and its complications. Current data show that childhood obesity is no longer just a concern for developed countries, but more significantly affecting developing countries. In adult population, cardiovascular disease is the main cause of mortality and morbidity among obese patients. It is therefore believed that risk factors found in adult patients could also be observed in obese youth. These risk factors will then persist and become progressively worse if obese youth remain obese as they reach adulthood. However, risk reduction is achievable through various prevention and management strategies of obesity and obese children who become nonobese in adulthood have a significant reduction in their risk of developing cardiovascular disease. New biomarkers to improve risk assessment in obese youth are an open research field, which will eventually lead to a more targeted approach in prevention and treatment. Nevertheless, there is still a need for continuous research in understanding the roles of these biomarkers and their potential in risk prediction. Cardiovascular risk modification of childhood obesity depends on a more concerted effort among the various parties involved and particularly a global collaboration to stop the rising prevalence of the epidemic in developing countries.

### Nontraditional risk factors and biomarkers for cardiovascular disease: mechanistic, research, and clinical considerations for youth: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111Wjzj1]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

The rapid increase in the prevalence and severity of obesity in children is likely to lower the age of onset and increase the incidence of cardiovascular disease worldwide. Understanding the pathophysiology and improving the clinical management of cardiovascular disease involve a knowledge of novel risk factors and biomarkers. The clinical and mechanistic roles of these novel biological factors during childhood are currently being investigated. The goals of this scientific statement are to present the existing knowledge and theoretical framework of nontraditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease as they relate to children and adolescents, to describe the relevance and weight of available experimental and clinical evidence and the therapeutic implications pertaining to nontraditional risk factors in the pediatric population, and to stimulate further research with a goal of developing valid and reliable approaches to identify and validate novel risk factors that will aid in the clinical evaluation and perhaps prediction of cardiovascular disease in the pediatric population. Although several biomarkers are promising, substantial research is required before nontraditional risk factors can be used to identify and reduce cardiovascular disease risk in children and adolescents.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^1163m1Ti]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

AAP childhood obesity guideline — evidence gaps and scope — highlights that current research provides insufficient information on heterogeneity of treatment effects and that many studies use restrictive inclusion criteria excluding children with comorbidities, disabilities, physical activity limitations, or medication use. It notes limited reporting of intervention dose, duration, and specific components; that comorbidity studies are mostly cross-sectional, limiting guidance on the appropriate age to begin laboratory evaluation; that epidemiologic and longitudinal studies are needed to identify age and BMI ranges and to guide monitoring and reevaluation frequency; and that consistent laboratory thresholds are needed. Few primary care studies evaluate outcomes other than BMI, evidence is lacking on whether comorbidity assessment or diagnosis affects engagement, the role of SDoHs and culture is limited, and harms are seldom assessed despite behavioral interventions generally carrying low risk. The evidence review did not include primary prevention or assessment and treatment of children 0 to 2 years of age, and early prevention is emphasized because 1 in 7 preschool-aged children already have obesity.

### Childhood metabolic syndrome: must we define it to deal with it? [^111xnAmJ]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CLINICAL UTILITY OF METABOLIC SYNDROME DEFINITIONS IN CHILDHOOD

The observations reviewed in this article highlight the importance of primary and secondary prevention of the progression of early cardiovascular risk factors in children and adolescents. Identification of the children who are at high a priori risk to develop the syndrome, based on a thorough family history and objective data related to pregnancy, labor, and the postnatal period, can be performed by any caregiver. Because components of the metabolic syndrome tend to track from childhood to adulthood, primary prevention of their development or early reversal of their presence in childhood are of paramount importance. Interventions such as early implementation of appropriate dietary and lifestyle practices aimed at primary prevention should be suggested during or even before pregnancy. Diet-induced weight loss and bariatric surgery have been attempted in obese children with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors or overt disease such as type 2 diabetes. Such interventions have shown that the level of cardiovascular risk factors related to the metabolic syndrome can be reduced and that the presence of type 2 diabetes can be eliminated. Because these interventions are expensive, labor intensive, and potentially invasive and nonreversible in nature, selection of those obese youth who may benefit most from them is crucial. Measures such as risk factor clustering (metabolic syndrome definitions) and its dynamics over time can serve as selection and follow-up tools for the assessment of such interventions.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^116wU9ot]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Risk factor clustering and the metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents — prediction and management evidence — are summarized as follows: longitudinal studies of cohorts in which the metabolic syndrome cluster was present in childhood identify an increased incidence of both T2DM and clinical CV events over a follow-up of 25 years. Many observational studies have demonstrated a strong association between obesity in early childhood and subsequent development of the metabolic syndrome constellation in adulthood, and obesity associated with elevated insulin levels from early childhood strongly predicted future metabolic syndrome. When obesity is associated with hypertension in childhood, the risk of future metabolic syndrome is also significantly increased, and waist circumference as a measure of abdominal obesity and BMI in children and adolescents both predict future development of the metabolic syndrome. Emerging data suggest that use of the metabolic syndrome as a diagnosis in children and adolescents may increase the ability to predict subclinical target organ damage in adulthood, although cross-sectional studies of the relationship between metabolic syndrome risk factors and vascular dysfunction in youth are less clear. Maintenance of low levels of CV risk factors starting in childhood is associated with a lower prevalence of end organ damage as assessed by carotid intima-media thickness in adults. Treatment of CV risk factor clustering in youth has not been thoroughly evaluated, but a small number of randomized controlled trials in obese adolescents with insulin resistance used metformin as an insulin-sensitizing agent and in each metformin was associated with greater weight loss, an improvement in endocrine-metabolic measures and some decrease in abdominal fat mass compared with the control group. Additional large RCTs with long-term follow-up in children are needed before insulin-sensitizing agents can be routinely recommended for either treatment of obesity or prevention of diabetes in youth with metabolic syndrome.

### Childhood obesity: public-health crisis, common sense cure [^112FMSHc]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

During the past two decades, the prevalence of obesity in children has risen greatly worldwide. Obesity in childhood causes a wide range of serious complications, and increases the risk of premature illness and death later in life, raising public-health concerns. Results of research have provided new insights into the physiological basis of bodyweight regulation. However, treatment for childhood obesity remains largely ineffective. In view of its rapid development in genetically stable populations, the childhood obesity epidemic can be primarily attributed to adverse environmental factors for which straightforward, if politically difficult, solutions exist.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of risk factors for childhood overweight identifiable during infancy [^116St9dr]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical implications

Unlike prior reviews, we have comprehensively investigated the risk factors for childhood overweight in the first year of life using only prospective studies. Our review included both overweight and obesity outcomes in contrast to previous reviews which mostly investigated obesity alone. Previous comprehensive reviewshave studied childhood predictors with adult obesity as the endpoint but have not fully investigated infant factors. Other reviews on breastfeeding, infant growth, hereditary factorsand maternal smokinghave only focused on these specific areas. In our study we have also reviewed factors in the first year of life that have not previously been fully examined: parity, socioeconomic status, maternal education, maternal depression, infant ethnicity, delivery type, maternal postpartum weight loss, gestational weight gain and infant temperament. In addition, most previous reviews incorporated observational evidence. As the use of only prospective studies in this study ensures excellent observational evidence, the findings could be used to develop screening guidelines or checklists for HCPs for identifying infants at greatest risk. Most of the identified risk factors are static (non-modifiable), but potentially dynamic (modifiable) risk factors such as maternal response to infant temperament, could be explored further with a contemporary cohort of children. However, recent researchhas found that using a purely statistical approach for developing a risk factor checklist from birth cohort data may not provide acceptable levels of specificity and sensitivity in a clinical setting, and so clinical input is needed from practitioners, service providers and parent groups. In addition, there are many practical and ethical considerations including the acceptability of such a checklist by parents and the feasibility of implementing it in the existing health service. Any risk factor checklist requires testing in the field and needs to be accompanied by clinical guidance for HCPs on how to approach parents of infants identified as being at risk, which should be supported by evidence-based intervention.

### Childhood obesity, diabetes. and cardiovascular disease risk [^114Dsp94]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

This mini-review aims to briefly summarize the pathophysiology of childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in children and adolescents. Recent data on efficacy of lifestyle interventions, medications, and metabolic surgery for obesity, T2DM, and CVD risk factors are also reviewed. We conducted a PubMed search of English-language original and review articles relevant to childhood obesity, T2DM, and CVD risk factors, and biomarkers in children with an emphasis on recent publications. Childhood obesity arises from an intricate interaction between genetic, physiologic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. The rise in the prevalence of childhood obesity is associated with the development of comorbidities including T2DM and CVD at an early age. A multipronged approach is central to the detection, monitoring, and management of childhood obesity and associated adverse metabolic consequences.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112Ksgpw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Cosponsoring Associations

The European Society of Endocrinology and the Pediatric Endocrine Society. This guideline was funded by the Endocrine Society.

Objective

To formulate clinical practice guidelines for the assessment, treatment, and prevention of pediatric obesity.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of 6 experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force commissioned 2 systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Endocrine Society committees and members and co-sponsoring organizations reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of this guideline.

Conclusion

Pediatric obesity remains an ongoing serious international health concern affecting ∼17% of US children and adolescents, threatening their adult health and longevity. Pediatric obesity has its basis in genetic susceptibilities influenced by a permissive environment starting in utero and extending through childhood and adolescence. Endocrine etiologies for obesity are rare and usually are accompanied by attenuated growth patterns. Pediatric comorbidities are common and long-term health complications often result; screening for comorbidities of obesity should be applied in a hierarchal, logical manner for early identification before more serious complications result. Genetic screening for rare syndromes is indicated only in the presence of specific historical or physical features. The psychological toll of pediatric obesity on the individual and family necessitates screening for mental health issues and counseling as indicated. The prevention of pediatric obesity by promoting healthful diet, activity, and environment should be a primary goal, as achieving effective, long-lasting results with lifestyle modification once obesity occurs is difficult. Although some behavioral and pharmacotherapy studies report modest success, additional research into accessible and effective methods for preventing and treating pediatric obesity is needed. The use of weight loss medications during childhood and adolescence should be restricted to clinical trials. Increasing evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in the most seriously affected mature teenagers who have failed lifestyle modification, but the use of surgery requires experienced teams with resources for long-term follow-up. Adolescents undergoing lifestyle therapy, medication regimens, or bariatric surgery for obesity will need cohesive planning to help them effectively transition to adult care, with continued necessary monitoring, support, and intervention. Transition programs for obesity are an uncharted area requiring further research for efficacy. Despite a significant increase in research on pediatric obesity since the initial publication of these guidelines 8 years ago, further study is needed of the genetic and biological factors that increase the risk of weight gain and influence the response to therapeutic interventions. Also needed are more studies to better understand the genetic and biological factors that cause an obese individual to manifest one comorbidity vs another or to be free of comorbidities. Furthermore, continued investigation into the most effective methods of preventing and treating obesity and into methods for changing environmental and economic factors that will lead to worldwide cultural changes in diet and activity should be priorities. Particular attention to determining ways to effect systemic changes in food environments and total daily mobility, as well as methods for sustaining healthy body mass index changes, is of importance.

### Severe obesity in children and adolescents: identification, associated health risks, and treatment approaches: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111uFw4J]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

Severe obesity afflicts between 4% and 6% of all youth in the United States, and the prevalence is increasing. Despite the serious immediate and long-term cardiovascular, metabolic, and other health consequences of severe pediatric obesity, current treatments are limited in effectiveness and lack widespread availability. Lifestyle modification/behavior-based treatment interventions in youth with severe obesity have demonstrated modest improvement in body mass index status, but participants have generally remained severely obese and often regained weight after the conclusion of the treatment programs. The role of medical management is minimal, because only 1 medication is currently approved for the treatment of obesity in adolescents. Bariatric surgery has generally been effective in reducing body mass index and improving cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors; however, reports of long-term outcomes are few, many youth with severe obesity do not qualify for surgery, and access is limited by lack of insurance coverage. To begin to address these challenges, the purposes of this scientific statement are to (1) provide justification for and recommend a standardized definition of severe obesity in children and adolescents; (2) raise awareness of this serious and growing problem by summarizing the current literature in this area in terms of the epidemiology and trends, associated health risks (immediate and long-term), and challenges and shortcomings of currently available treatment options; and (3) highlight areas in need of future research. Innovative behavior-based treatment, minimally invasive procedures, and medications currently under development all need to be evaluated for their efficacy and safety in this group of patients with high medical and psychosocial risks.

### Cardiovascular morbidity, diabetes and cancer risk among children and adolescents with severe obesity [^1162caA1]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Severe obesity among children and adolescents is a significant global public health concern. The prevalence has markedly increased over the last decades, becoming common in many countries. Overwhelming rates of obesity among youth have prompted efforts to identify an evidence-based immediate- and long-term cardiometabolic risk factor profile in childhood-onset severe obesity, and to highlight gaps that require further investigation. The PubMed database was systematically searched in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The search yielded 831 results, of which 60 fulfilled stringent criteria and were summarized in this review. The definition of severe obesity was variable, with only one half the publications using the definition BMI > 120% of the 95th percentile. Point estimates of the prevalence of at least one cardiometabolic risk factor in children with severe obesity reportedly range from 67 to 86%. Cross-sectional studies indicate that children and adolescents with severe obesity are at greater risk than those with mild obesity for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver disease and dyslipidemia, already at childhood and adolescence. Robust epidemiological data on the long-term risk and actual point estimates in adulthood are lacking for these diseases as well as for other diseases (coronary heart disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease and cancer). Recent longitudinal studies indicate an increased risk for cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality in adulthood for adolescents with severe obesity compared to those with mild obesity. Given the alarming increase in the prevalence of severe obesity, the persistence of adiposity from childhood to adulthood and the precarious course of young adults with chronic comorbidities, the economic and clinical services burden on the healthcare system is expected to rise.

### The effect of body mass index at diagnosis on clinical outcome in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^112E7U42]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The 5-year survival rate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common childhood cancer, has risen over the past 4 decades to exceed 90%. This is the result of improved risk-directed protocol treatment and supportive care.

In children with acute myeloid leukemia, obesity at diagnosis has been associated with worse outcomes. However, in childhood ALL, the association between body weight at diagnosis and outcome is controversial. In a Children's Oncology Group study, children who were aged 10 years or older at diagnosis and were classified as obese because of a body mass index (BMI) in the 95th percentile or higher had a significantly higher relapse rate and worse event-free survival (EFS) when compared with non-obese children. Another study reported worse EFS for children who were obese (BMI ⩾95th percentile) or underweight (BMI < 5th percentile) at diagnosis or for at least 50% of the time between the end of induction and the start of maintenance therapy, although BMI normalization during this period mitigated the risk. Obese or underweight status was also associated with increased risk of toxicity. Furthermore, a single-institution study of patients with B-ALL showed an association between obese or overweight (BMI ⩾85th percentile) status with positive end-of-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) and worse EFS. In contrast to the relation between BMI and treatment response observed in these three studies, an early study at St Jude Children's Research Hospital (St Jude) showed that BMI at diagnosis did not affect outcome or treatment-related toxicity.

Nearly 17% of children and adolescents in the United States are currently considered obese. Therefore, we reassessed the impact of BMI on treatment response and survival in our recent patient cohort, consisting of children and adolescents with ALL treated on the St Jude Total XV protocol, which prospectively used MRD for risk assignment.

### A practical screening tool to predict early childhood obesity risk: examining a birth cohort [^116XcU6Q]. Clinical Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Children obese at the age of 5 years are at greater risk of lifelong obesity. Because certain risks of obesity can be identified in early infancy, a tool for obesity risk prediction in early life would be clinically useful. We investigated predictors of obesity risk in a novel, prospectively collected healthy birth cohort recruited for demographic risks to develop iron deficiency at 1 year, a cohort leveraged because risk factors for iron deficiency and obesity overlap. Obesity at the age of 5 years was defined as age- and sex-specific body mass index Z -score (z BMI) > 2SD. For each child, obesity risk factors were summed. Of 10 total risk factors, the following 4 key risks were identified: maternal obesity, maternal diabetes, large for gestational age, or breastfeeding < 6 months. Childhood obesity was predicted by either ≥ 3 total number of risks (P < .033), any key risk (P < .002), or summing key risks (P < .0001). In clinical practice, summing early life risk factors may be a useful strategy for preemptive counseling.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^114xW3Hp]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clinical practice guideline — introduction and scope — notes burden, chronic-disease recognition, and population coverage. The current and long-term health of 14.4 million children and adolescents is affected by obesity, and prior acknowledgments include the National Institutes of Health designating obesity as a chronic disease in 1998 and the American Medical Association recognizing it as a complex, chronic disease in 2013. This is the AAP's first clinical practice guideline outlining evidence-based evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with overweight and obesity. The guideline does not cover the prevention of obesity and does not include guidance for overweight and obesity evaluation and treatment of children younger than 2 years; children under the age of 2 were not part of the inclusion criteria for the evidence review because it is difficult to practically define and measure excess adiposity in this age group. Related prior work referenced includes the "Algorithm for the Assessment and Management of Childhood Obesity" in 2016.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^116XiLfU]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

The pathway to recommending clinical practice–based prevention emphasizes that pediatric cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention occurs in clinical practice and public health, and for risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and dyslipidemia, public health measures will affect prevalence, but without medical recognition and treatment, effective risk reduction cannot occur. The report describes that the most direct way to establish preventive evidence would be to randomize young individuals with defined risks to treatment or no treatment to assess whether events are prevented without undue morbidity; however, it states this approach is as unachievable as it is attractive, would require decades-long adherence and retention, and risks potential withholding of effective therapy to youths who do not receive treatment. Recognizing that such direct evidence is unlikely, it proposes an alternate stepwise evidence chain linking studies from risk beginning before birth, to risk acquisition during childhood, to risk modification by reduction strategies, and finally to clinical disease in adulthood. Epidemiology studies provide links showing that atherosclerosis begins in childhood, results from risk factors identifiable in childhood, and that the presence of these factors in a given child predicts an adult with risk factors. Intervention evidence addresses whether risk-reduction interventions have a health benefit and whether their risks and costs are outweighed by reductions in CVD morbidity and mortality, with the best evidence deriving from randomized trials in adults, randomized trials in children with changes in subclinical measures and patient safety, genetic studies, and long-term observational studies demonstrating benefits of maintaining low risk on health and all-cause mortality. Recommendations to intervene must consider not only the relationship of the risk factor to future disease.

### Lifetime risk: childhood obesity and cardiovascular risk [^113nnxqA]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

In a recent report, the worldwide prevalence of childhood obesity was estimated to have increased by 47% between 1980 and 2013. As a result, substantial concerns have been raised about the future burden of cardiovascular (CV) disease that could ensue. The purpose of this review is to summarize and interpret (i) the evidence linking early life obesity with adverse changes in CV structure and function in childhood, (ii) the lifetime risk for CV disease resulting from obesity in childhood, and (iii) the potential effects of lifestyle interventions in childhood to ameliorate these risks.

### Childhood obesity and the associated rise in cardiometabolic complications [^112Mycu1]. Nature Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Childhood obesity is one of the most serious global public-health challenges of the twenty-first century. Over the past four decades, the number of children and adolescents with obesity has risen more than tenfold. Worldwide, an increasing number of youth are facing greater exposure to obesity throughout their lives, and this increase will contribute to the early development of type 2 diabetes, fatty liver and cardiovascular complications. Herein, we provide a brief overview of trends in the global shifts in, and environmental and genetic determinants of, childhood obesity. We then discuss recent progress in the elucidation of the central role of insulin resistance, the key element linking obesity and cardiovascular-risk-factor clustering, and the potential mechanisms through which ectopic lipid accumulation leads to insulin resistance and its associated cardiometabolic complications in obese adolescents. In the absence of effective prevention and intervention programs, childhood obesity will have severe public-health consequences for decades to come.

### Lifetime cardiovascular risk of childhood obesity [^113zrQY8]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

An increase in the incidence and an earlier onset of coronary artery disease is expected because of the increased prevalence of childhood obesity. Comorbidities of obesity, such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance syndrome, hypertension, associated nutritional deficiencies, and a sedentary lifestyle or associated lifestyle factors such as tobacco smoke exposure, are likely to account for this increase because these are all independent risk factors for accelerated atherosclerosis. Because clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease does not manifest in obese children, assessment of the subclinical markers of atherosclerosis may help in the evaluation of the progression of atherosclerosis, in further stratification of risk, and in monitoring the effects of intervention. Furthermore, because multiple risk factors with poorly understood interplay might be present in obese children, assessment of the vasculature directly, and perhaps the assignment of a "vascular age", may be a useful method to quantify the "end organ" effect of exposure to these various risks. Obese children may show favorable changes in their behaviors that result in an improvement in clinically measurable risk factors with various clinic-based and behavior modification therapies, but the vascular benefits of such interventions need to be studied further. Broad social, cultural, legislative, and policy changes that support healthy lifestyles within families and communities need to be implemented to decrease the prevalence of childhood obesity and its cardiovascular consequences in communities. The effect of risk factor modification on the vasculature will continue to be a resource for the direction of evidence-based therapy in obese children.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116teHHH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity — epidemiology and prediction across childhood: As of 2014, the prevalence of obesity in subjects 2 to 19 years old is 17%. The odds ratio of adult obesity increases for obese adolescents as they approach 18 years of age, and the odds ratio of adult obesity rises progressively with the number of parents who are obese, but the greatest predictive effect of parent obesity is found in infancy regardless of the infant's weight. There is an increase in BMI in the first year followed by a fall and then a second rise in BMI at about 6 years of age; an early BMI rebound before 5 years of age carries a higher risk for adult obesity, and recent analysis suggests that BMI at 7 years of age may provide equally robust predictive ability. Longitudinal data from 7738 participants demonstrated the greatest incidence of obesity and overweight between the first to third grades and a fourfold higher risk for obesity at age 14 years in the subjects overweight in kindergarten; these data support a focus on prevention before 9 years of age. However, a longitudinal study of 4884 subjects showed that screening for obesity at 5 years of age would miss 50% of those who became obese by 18 years of age, whereas screening at 15 years of age would miss only 9%.

### Early clinical markers of overweight / obesity onset and resolution by adolescence [^111i4fCA]. International Journal of Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We examined how combinations of clinical indicators at various ages predict overweight/obesity development, as well as resolution, by 10–11 and 14–15 years of age.

Methods

Data were derived from Birth (N = 3469) and Kinder (N = 3276) cohorts of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, followed from ages 2–3 and 4–5 years, respectively. Every two years, 25 potential obesity-relevant clinical indicators were quantified. Overweight/obesity was defined using International Obesity Taskforce cutpoints at 10–11 years and 14–15 years.

Results

In both cohorts, three factors predicted both development and resolution of overweight/obesity in multivariable models. Among normal weight children, increased odds of developing overweight/obesity were associated with higher child (odd ratio (OR) 1.67–3.35 across different study waves) and maternal (OR 1.05–1.09) BMI, and inversely with higher maternal education (OR 0.60–0.62, when assessed at age 2–7 years). Lower odds of resolving existing overweight/obesity were related with higher child (OR 0.51–0.79) and maternal (OR 0.89–0.95) BMI, and inversely with higher maternal education (OR 1.62–1.92, when assessed at age 2–5 years). The prevalence of overweight/obesity at the age of 14–15 years was 13% among children with none of these risk factors at age 6–7 years, compared with 71% among those with all 3 risk factors (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

From early childhood onwards, child and maternal BMI and maternal education predict overweight/obesity onset and resolution by adolescence. A simple risk score, easily available to child health clinicians, could help target treatment or prevention.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity stands out as a significant and pressing public health issue. Along with the escalating global prevalence of obesity amongst adults, a noticeable rise is also observed amongst children and adolescents. Based on the World Obesity Atlas, the 2020 overall prevalence of obesity amongst children and adolescents aged 5–19 years was 19% in boys and 12% in girls. The progression of obesity is a continuous process involving a complex system of genetic, environmental and behavioural factors that influence an individual's susceptibility to excess adiposity. This trajectory begins in prenatal stages and continues through infancy, childhood, adolescence and adulthood, and all those phases of life represent potential targets for public health interventions. The relationships between factors can also develop and change dynamically over the life course.

In 2016, the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity presented a set of recommendations to address childhood obesity, incorporating preconception and pregnancy care, promoting healthy food intake and physical activity in early childhood and school‐age children, and weight management. Consistently to these recommendations, previous interventions focused mainly on inappropriate eating behaviours or insufficient physical activity in children, mothers and families. However, this approach might be insufficient in light of recent knowledge and recommended practices for individuals living with obesity. The Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Obesity conducted by the American Academy of Pediatrics postulated that obesity should be considered a chronic disease determined by an interconnected system of factors at national, community, family and individual levels. The multifactorial origin of paediatric obesity establishes a need for a broader perception of risk factors. In particular, it is necessary to focus on factors beyond the scope of individual behaviours.

Determinants beyond the level of individual factors can be collectively referred to as upstream determinants. Upstream determinants originate from various societal, economic, environmental and structural elements that influence health outcomes and behaviours. The social inequalities present in these upstream determinants play a pivotal role in driving disparities in childhood obesity. Children from disadvantaged environments characterized by low parental education, financial difficultiesor single parentingare particularly vulnerable to obesity development. This increased vulnerability may occur due to the lack of resources in families suffering from economic deprivation. Besides, disadvantaged social environments are more likely to result in negative life occasions, such as adverse childhood experiences (ACE), including physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, as well as parental mental health illnesses or family dysfunction. ACEs have been previously determined as risk factors for obesity in childhood, but at the same time, their effect persists into later years, increasing the risk of obesity in adulthood.

### The dilemma of the metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents: disease or distraction? [^114Pb1r9]. Pediatric Diabetes (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The alarming increase of obesity in children occurring globally is raising concern about the implications for development, at earlier ages, of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease and is driving efforts to evaluate and predict risk in the young. A major component of this undertaking has been directed to adapting for children the criteria described in adults as the metabolic syndrome (MS).

Methods

This article briefly examines the status of and controversy about definition of the MS in adults and its value, and then it moves on to review the descriptions of the MS in the pediatric age group. This is done primarily from the point of view of its usefulness to the clinician. The ranges of the criteria used by different investigators, the differences in their prevalence and their effectiveness in predicting cardiovascular risk are discussed. Current information about cardiovascular risk factors in children, their progression into adulthood and their correlation with atherosclerosis in children and young adults is outlined. Finally, the current information and recommendations for treatment, in children, of cardiovascular risk factors including those composing the MS are reviewed.

Conclusions

One conclusion is that there needs to be consensus about the criteria for defining the MS in children if its use as a diagnosis is to be helpful in this age group. A second conclusion questions the value of using this syndromic collection of risk factors in children rather than concentrating on the risk factors themselves, evaluating their importance in early cardiovascular risk and assessing the safety and efficacy of intervention in early life.

2.1 Remarks

Although not ideal, the BMI is the internationally recognized standard for the definition of overweight and obesity, and the CDC standard curves are the most readily available standards for American children. The Task Force elected not to recommend another standard without higher quality evidence.

Stunted populations may have an increased BMI without increased body fat. Taller individuals may have a high BMI even if their body proportions are equivalent to those of shorter individuals. In individuals who are not unusually short or tall, a high BMI is likely to predict abnormally high body fat content. However, a normal BMI does not always exclude the presence of increased body fat or increased risk of obesity-associated comorbidities (see 2.2 Remarks). Fat tissue and BMI increase naturally with pubertal progression in girls, so that matching the value to chronological age may be misleading if the child progresses through puberty outside the average age range.

Much research has focused on using the waist circumference or waist-to-height ratio as a marker of obesity, as well as an additional marker for IR (,–). This approach has the advantage of taking into account body fat distribution and the greater cardiovascular risk associated with visceral fat. Waist circumference standards for American children of various ethnic groups are available. Waist circumference should be recorded because future research may prove this measure to reflect fatness or morbidity better.

BMI (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is plotted according to the standardized CDC growth charts for the United States. Waist circumference is measured at the level of the iliac crest and interpreted according to age, sex, and racial standards.

2.2 Recommendation

We recommend that a child be diagnosed as overweight if the BMI is at least in the 85th percentile but < the 95th percentile and obese if the BMI is at least in the 95th percentile for age and sex (1 ⊕○○○).

2.2 Evidence

Adults experience increased morbidity and mortality when the BMI rises over 30 kg/m 2, which is about the 95th percentile of BMI at 19½ yr of age. Clinicians caring for children can use curves generated by tracing the progression of BMI values for age back from the various percentiles at this older age to determine, in an age-adjusted manner, what BMI is equivalent to 25 or 30 kg/m 2 for an adult. Although these cutoffs are not derived from pediatric data, some experts consider them to be relevant indicators of health and morbidity, but others do not.

### Childhood obesity and risk of the adult metabolic syndrome: a systematic review [^1121GTHv]. International Journal of Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

In developed countries, circulatory disease is the most common cause of death, accounting for 33% of UK deaths in 2008, and in Europe 48% of deaths are due to CVD. The burden of disease is increasing owing to ageing populations and the rising prevalence of obesity and its associated co-morbidities. It is imperative to understand how events at important stages across the lifespan influence long-term risk of disease, so that interventions can be targeted to the most appropriate time point. There is a widely held assumption that childhood obesity is an independent risk factor for adult metabolic and CVD. However, our previous review indicated that the relationships are largely dependent on the tracking of BMI from childhood to adulthood. Importantly, the evidence suggested that the risk of raised blood pressure was highest in those who were at the lower end of the BMI scale in childhood and overweight in adulthood. The current review has extended these findings to investigate the relationship between childhood obesity and a range of metabolic risk factors. Using an unbiased review methodology, we found insufficient evidence to support the idea that childhood obesity independently increases risk of dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance in adulthood. Conversely, and in support of our previous analysis of blood pressure data, the review demonstrates that those who were lean as children seemed to be most susceptible to the metabolic risk associated with adult obesity.

Our previous reviewfocused on studies assessing CVD end points and two major clinical risk factors for CVD, blood pressure and carotid intima–media thickness. The quality assessment of the studies included raised significant issues regarding the quality of the data presented. In particular, the studies assessing CVD end points were all retrospective in nature, focused on non-contemporary populations and failed to adjust for adult BMI. In contrast, the studies assessing blood pressure and carotid intima–media thickness were more likely to have adjusted for adult BMI, but often involved adult cohorts with an average age considered too young for the outcome to be assessed adequately. The current review aimed to overcome these limitations to some extent by assessing a range of intermediary risk factors.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of risk factors for childhood overweight identifiable during infancy [^115sWa2n]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Study selection

Studies were only considered if they were prospective studies and there was a minimum follow-up of 2 years from birth to allow for a diagnosis childhood overweight (as there is no standard definition of overweight in children under 2 years of age). We used 16 years of age as the cut-off for the follow-up of children. Although most children will have obtained close to their final height by 14 years of age, we used a more inclusive upper limit to account for varying pubertal development, so that children who had not yet reached their final height by 14 years of age would not be excluded.

Selection of some of the exposure terms was based on theoretical considerations discussed in the literature on early life risk factors for childhood overweight. In addition, inclusion criteria included any potential risk factors that had occurred prenatally, in the first year of life or when the child was 1 year of age. Studies that only included children with specific medical conditions or children from rare groups were excluded as these children may have a different set of risk factors and often are not comparable with the general population of children.

For anthropometric outcome, we used body mass index (BMI) as reported by the study author. BMI (adjusted for age and sex) is identifiedby the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines as a preferred outcome measure in children aged 2 years or older. Overweight in childhood was defined as follows: by the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF)as corresponding to an adult BMI ≥ 25 or ≥ 30 kg/m 2; by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)as a BMI ≥ 85th or ≥ 95th percentile; by the UK 1990 referenceas a BMI ≥ 95th or ≥ 98th percentile; by the French referenceas a BMI ≥ 90th or ≥ 97th percentile; and by the German referenceas a BMI ≥ 90th or ≥ 97th percentile. Studies that defined children as obese were considered to also include overweight children for the purpose of this review.

Objective

Radiologists can play an active role in children's health by increasing awareness of diseases associated with obesity. This article reviews key imaging findings in obesity-related diseases, current issues in imaging obese children, and treatment strategies.

Conclusion

There has been a well-documented pediatric obesity epidemic and a dramatic increase in clinical diseases associated with it. These serious health consequences affect nearly every organ system. Despite the increasing prevalence of obesity and the associated health hazards, pediatric obesity as a diagnosis is often overlooked by health care providers.

### Effect of pediatric obesity treatment on long-term health [^117Ks6Bp]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

This study also evaluated the risk reduction of undergoing bariatric surgery, a marker of a persistent high degree of obesity or obesity with complications. As expected, the highest incidence was observed for the group with poor treatment response in childhood. The greatest risk reduction was observed in the obesity remission group. Meanwhile, the magnitude of reduction in the group with good and intermediate treatment responses was similar. Despite the marked risk reduction, it is critical to acknowledge that the necessity for bariatric surgery persisted to some extent across all treatment response groups. This underscores the complexity of obesity as a disease, which proves challenging to manage through lifestyle modifications alone.

The weight trajectory following the treatment period in this study remains unknown. However, it is widely recognized that weight regain is common in the years following substantial weight loss. Despite this, we observed that beneficial response to pediatric obesity treatment significantly reduces long-term morbidity and mortality. This highlights the critical importance of obtaining substantial reduction in degree of obesity during childhood for optimal future health, independent of potential weight regain in young adulthood.

Given the real-world setting of the present study, it is crucial to recognize that the response to treatment cannot be attributed solely to the patient and their family. Various factors could contribute to the lack of beneficial reduction in degree of obesity, including the possibility that the treatment provided by the medical unit was not adequately tailored to the patient's specific needs.

### Special considerations for the adolescent with obesity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2024 [^1151asyj]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Adolescent obesity — U.S. prevalence and progression risks — has markedly increased, as the prevalence of adolescent obesity has tripled in the past 30 years with over 20% of U.S. adolescents affected, with historical surveillance reporting 5.5% of children ages 2 to 19 meeting criteria for overweight and 1.3% meeting criteria for severe obesity, and 2018 data noting 19.3% (obesity) and 6.1% (severe obesity). National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) findings show obesity prevalence increased from 17.7% in 2011–2012 to 21.5% in 2017–2020 among youth ages 2–19 years, with significant increases in children aged 2–5 years, adolescents 12–19 years, and all children aged 2–19 years. Early intervention is crucial and adolescents with body mass index (BMI) > 95%tile have a higher risk of obesity persisting into adulthood than younger children; every increase in BMI percentile is associated with an increased risk of developing obesity, with children who remit back to normal weight being closest to 85th percentile, and Black and Hispanic children having lower rates of remission and higher rates of progression even when socioeconomic status is controlled.

### A recent update on childhood obesity: aetiology, treatment and complications [^115kCXeJ]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a complex, chronic condition characterised by excess adiposity. Rates of obesity in childhood and adolescence are increasing worldwide, with a corresponding increase in adulthood. The aetiology of obesity is multifactorial and results from a combination of endocrine, genetic, environmental and societal factors. Population level approaches to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity worldwide are urgently needed. There are wide-ranging complications from excess weight affecting every system in the body, which lead to significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy. Treatment of obesity and its complications requires a multi-faceted, biopsychosocial approach incorporating dietary, exercise and psychological treatments. Pharmacological treatments for treating childhood obesity have recently become available, and there is further development of new anti-obesity medications in the pipeline. In addition, bariatric surgery is being increasingly recognised as a treatment option for obesity in adolescence providing the potential to reverse complications related to excess weight. In this review, we present an update on the prevalence, aetiology, complications and treatment of childhood obesity.

### Childhood obesity and risk of the adult metabolic syndrome: a systematic review [^111QVQyy]. International Journal of Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Overweight and obesity are associated with a range of chronic disease states, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes and certain cancers. The World Health Organisation has estimated that around a third of coronary heart disease and ischaemic stroke cases are attributable to excess adiposity. Current prevalence of overweight and obesity therefore has significant implications for population morbidity and mortality, and in this regard the rising prevalence of childhood obesity is of particular concern. In the United Kingdom, 2004 figures showed the prevalence of obesity in children aged 5–17 years to be 29%, and most estimates suggest a doubling in prevalence over the course of the preceding decade. Similarly in the United States, 32% of children and adolescents were observed to be at or above the 85th percentile of the 2000 body mass index (BMI)-for-age growth charts. Such data are predictive of adult overweight and obesity rates in the future, as adiposity has been shown to track from childhood into adult life. It is generally assumed that an earlier onset and longer duration of obesity is associated with a greater cardiovascular risk, increasing concern about childhood obesity trends.

### Childhood obesity [^113NxsXE]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of childhood obesity is rising, and pediatric obesity has become an important public health issue. It can be defined as BMI more than 95th percentile for age and sex, whereas overweight is defined as BMI more than 85th percentile. Using these cut points, more than one quarter of all children and adolescents are either overweight or obese. The recent increases in the prevalence of childhood obesity result from the interaction between a strong genetic predisposition that facilitates storage of fat, easy access to calorically dense foods, and the low levels of physical activity that characterize modern societies. Childhood obesity has pervasive psychosocial and medical consequences in the short term and the long term. Many of these consequences may not be apparent for decades, but the metabolic complications of obesity and the insidious effects of early psychosocial stigmatization are sometimes observed even in young children. For pediatric obesity, behavioral approaches seem moderately efficacious in younger children. Comprehensive programs generally include modification of dietary and activity habits and some degree of parental involvement. Medication for pediatric obesity cannot be recommended currently outside the context of clinical trials. Gastric bypass surgery is effective but should be considered a last resort for the child with life-threatening complications of obesity.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^111zXUQY]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Genetic factors in pediatric obesity — heritability, polygenic and monogenic contributions — are outlined as follows: Heritability studies suggest that there is a 40% to 70% genetic contribution to an individual's obesity risk, and genome-wide association studies have identified 32 loci of significance to obesity predisposition. MC4R, a heterozygous mutation, is described as the most common form of monogenic obesity and accounts for only 2% to 5% of severe obesity in children. Polygenic inheritance refers to a single inherited phenotypic trait that is controlled by 2 or more different genes, and polygenic variants, on their own, have little effect on an individual's phenotype, with the phenotypic effect manifesting only in the presence of, or in combination with, other predisposing factors. Children with genetic causes of obesity may present with characteristic clinical features including short stature, dysmorphic features, developmental delay, skeletal defects, deafness, retinal changes, or intellectual disability.

Implications of Childhood Obesity

The WHO Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity found that childhood obesity, including obesity in preschool children and adolescents, is reaching alarming proportions in many countries and poses an urgent and severe health challenge.

Medical Implications

Extremely high BMI values considerably increase risks to children's physical and mental health. Children with obesity are at an elevated risk of developing a range of obesity-related comorbidities, as obesity-induced inflammation contributes to endothelial dysfunction, thereby increasing the risk of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and insulin insensitivity in adulthood. Such children may also develop non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is currently the most common cause of liver disease in children. NAFLD can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and even cirrhosis, leading to long-term liver damage. Other medical complications include musculoskeletal problems, obstructive sleep apnea, asthma and gastrointestinal disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Childhood obesity is also linked to hormonal imbalances, leading to early puberty, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in girls and hypogonadism in boys. Insulin resistance associated with obesity also exacerbates the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The psychological repercussions of childhood obesity are equally profound. Children with obesity are at a higher risk of developing low self-esteem, body dissatisfaction and social isolation. They are more likely to experience bullying and weight-related stigma, leading to anxiety, depression and eating disorders, including binge eating and emotional eating. The emotional burden and social consequences can impair academic performance and social development. In severe cases, the psychological distress associated with obesity may result in suicidal ideation and self-harm.

Reduced Quality of Life

Children with overweight and obesity also experience significant reductions in quality of life as they are often subjected to weight bias and obesity stigma. These children have poorer psychological well-being and are at a greater risk of teasing, bullying and social isolation. These conditions are in turn associated with poor body image and body dissatisfaction; low self-esteem and self-confidence; feelings of worthlessness and loneliness; suicidal thoughts and acts; depression, anxiety and other psychological disorders (e.g. maladaptive eating patterns); avoidance of physical activity; stress-induced pathophysiology; and avoidance of medical care.

### Health consequences of obesity [^116EqB6E]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

The recent epidemic of childhood obesity(1) has raised concern because of the possible clinical and public health consequences.(2,)(3) However, there remains a widespread perception among health professionals that childhood obesity is a largely cosmetic problem, with minor clinical effects. No systematic review has yet focused on the diverse array of possible consequences of childhood obesity, though older non-systematic reviews are available.(4,)(5) In addition, no review to date has considered the vast body of evidence on the health impact of childhood obesity which has been published recently. The aim of the present review was therefore to provide a critically appraised, evidence based, summary of the consequences of childhood obesity in the short term (for the child) and longer term (in adulthood).

Obesity and early puberty associations in girls — risk factors and populations — include a strong association between prepubertal weight and early puberty, higher leptin levels in children with obesity that may relate to earlier puberty onset, and links between early rapid weight gain in infancy and earlier pubertal maturation in girls; Black and Hispanic girls start puberty at a younger age than non-Hispanic White females. Premature adrenarche is associated with obesity and occurs in females prior to age 8 years, and because obesity is a risk factor for early puberty, several risk factors for childhood obesity should be addressed as soon as at-risk patients are identified.

Childhood obesity risk factors — prenatal and genetic contributors are highlighted. Gestational weight gain and maternal prenatal factors including obesity, gestational diabetes, and maternal smoking during pregnancy have well-established links to risk of childhood obesity, and proposed etiologies suggest that excess gestational weight gain can affect epigenetic change and metabolic imprinting in key organs for metabolism and appetite control. Excess weight gain during pregnancy, as measured by the Institute of Medicine's pregnancy weight gain recommendations, was associated with a relative risk of 1.91 for childhood obesity. Genetic causes such as congenital leptin deficiency and mutations in leptin signaling and the melanocortin pathway can lead to early onset childhood obesity characteristically associated with hyperphagia.

### Predicting the earliest deviation in weight gain in the course towards manifest overweight in offspring exposed to obesity in pregnancy: a longitudinal cohort study [^1135gfNT]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity in pregnancy and related early-life factors place the offspring at the highest risk of being overweight. Despite convincing evidence on these associations, there is an unmet public health need to identify "high-risk" offspring by predicting very early deviations in weight gain patterns as a subclinical stage towards overweight. However, data and methods for individual risk prediction are lacking. We aimed to identify those infants exposed to obesity in pregnancy at ages 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years who likely will follow a higher-than-normal body mass index (BMI) growth trajectory towards manifest overweight by developing an early-risk quantification system.

Methods

This study uses data from the prospective mother-child cohort study Programming of Enhanced Adiposity Risk in CHildhood–Early Screening (PEACHES) comprising 1671 mothers with pre-conception obesity and without (controls) and their offspring. Exposures were pre- and postnatal risks documented in patient-held maternal and child health records. The main outcome was a "higher-than-normal BMI growth pattern" preceding overweight, defined as BMI z -score > 1 SD (i.e. World Health Organization [WHO] cut-off "at risk of overweight") at least twice during consecutive offspring growth periods between age 6 months and 5 years. The independent cohort PErinatal Prevention of Obesity (PEPO) comprising 11,730 mother-child pairs recruited close to school entry (around age 6 years) was available for data validation. Cluster analysis and sequential prediction modelling were performed.

Results

Data of 1557 PEACHES mother-child pairs and the validation cohort were analyzed comprising more than 50,000 offspring BMI measurements. More than 1-in-5 offspring exposed to obesity in pregnancy belonged to an upper BMI z -score cluster as a distinct pattern of BMI development (above the cut-off of 1 SD) from the first months of life onwards resulting in preschool overweight/obesity (age 5 years: odds ratio [OR] 16.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.98–26.05). Contributing early-life factors including excessive weight gain (OR 2.08; 95% CI 1.25–3.45) and smoking (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.27–2.95) in pregnancy were instrumental in predicting a "higher-than-normal BMI growth pattern" at age 3 months and re-evaluating the risk at ages 1 year and 2 years (area under the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC] 0.69–0.79, sensitivity 70.7–76.0%, specificity 64.7–78.1%). External validation of prediction models demonstrated adequate predictive performances.

Conclusions

We devised a novel sequential strategy of individual prediction and re-evaluation of a higher-than-normal weight gain in "high-risk" infants well before developing overweight to guide decision-making. The strategy holds promise to elaborate interventions in an early preventive manner for integration in systems of well-child care.

Children at increased risk for overweight and obesity — evidence overview: Certain populations of children who are of normal weight are at risk for developing overweight and obesity as they grow older, and epidemiologic associations suggest that primary care providers should be alert to increasing BMI trends and excessive weight gain beyond what is anticipated for height increase or pubertal change and should consider intervention before the child becomes overweight. From observational studies summarized for these Guidelines, sample populations at special risk include children with BMI between the 85th and 95th percentiles and children in whom there is a positive family history of obesity in one or both parents.

### Treatment options for severe obesity in the pediatric population: current limitations and future opportunities [^111qpAoD]. Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Severe obesity is the only obesity classification increasing in prevalence among children and adolescents. Treatment options that produce meaningful and sustained weight loss and comorbidity resolution are urgently needed.

Methods

The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of the current treatment options for pediatric severe obesity and offer suggestions regarding future opportunities for accelerating the development and evaluation of innovative treatment strategies.

Results

At present, there are three treatment options for youth with severe obesity: lifestyle modification therapy, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. Lifestyle modification therapy can be useful for improving many chronic disease risk factors and comorbid conditions but often fails to achieve clinically meaningful and sustainable weight loss. Pharmacotherapy holds promise as an effective adjunctive treatment but remains in the primordial stages of development in the pediatric population. Bariatric surgery provides robust weight loss and risk factor/comorbidity improvements but is accompanied by higher risks and lower uptake compared to lifestyle modification therapy and pharmacotherapy. New areas worth pursuing include combination pharmacotherapy, device therapy, identification of predictors of response aimed at precision treatment, and interventions in the postbariatric surgical setting to improve long-term outcomes.

Conclusions

Treating pediatric severe obesity effectively and safely is extremely challenging. Some progress has been made, but substantially more effort and innovation are needed in the future to combat this serious and ongoing medical and public health issue.

Context

Although the prevalence rates of childhood obesity have seemingly been stable over the past few years, far too many children and adolescents are still obese. Childhood obesity, and its associated metabolic complications, is rapidly emerging as one of the greatest global challenges of the 21st century. About 110 million children are now classified as overweight or obese.

In this review we first describe the most recent data on the prevalence, severity, and racial/ethnic differences in childhood obesity. Obesity is associated with significant health problems in the pediatric age group and is an important early risk factor for much of adult morbidity and mortality.

Evidence Synthesis

We review the metabolic complications associated with childhood obesity. Particular emphasis is given to the description of studies regarding the impact of varying degrees of obesity on the cardiometabolic risk factors in youth. We further describe studies in obese adolescents that have examined the importance of ectopic lipid deposition in the visceral abdominal depot and in insulin sensitive tissues in relation to the presence of insulin resistance. We end by describing studies that have examined beta-cell function in obese adolescents with normal glucose tolerance.

Conclusions

The growing number of obese children and adolescents worldwide is of great concern. Many obese children and adolescents already manifest some metabolic complications, and these children are at high risk for the development of early morbidity. Understanding the underlying pathogenesis of this peculiar phenotype is of critical importance.

Pediatric obesity prevalence and clustering — United States context — are described with the observation that more than 30 percent of the U.S. pediatric population is above the 85th percentile of the age- and gender-specific BMI for the generation of the 1970s and 1980s, and there is ample evidence from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that obesity-related risk factor clustering exists in childhood and continues into adulthood.

### Predicting the earliest deviation in weight gain in the course towards manifest overweight in offspring exposed to obesity in pregnancy: a longitudinal cohort study [^114XSjGN]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity in pregnancy and related early-life factors place the offspring at the highest risk of being overweight. Despite convincing evidence on these associations, there is an unmet public health need to identify "high-risk" offspring by predicting very early deviations in weight gain patterns as a subclinical stage towards overweight. However, data and methods for individual risk prediction are lacking. We aimed to identify those infants exposed to obesity in pregnancy at ages 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years who likely will follow a higher-than-normal body mass index (BMI) growth trajectory towards manifest overweight by developing an early-risk quantification system.

Methods

This study uses data from the prospective mother-child cohort study Programming of Enhanced Adiposity Risk in CHildhood-Early Screening (PEACHES) comprising 1671 mothers with pre-conception obesity and without (controls) and their offspring. Exposures were pre- and postnatal risks documented in patient-held maternal and child health records. The main outcome was a "higher-than-normal BMI growth pattern" preceding overweight, defined as BMI z-score > 1 SD (i.e. World Health Organization [WHO] cut-off "at risk of overweight") at least twice during consecutive offspring growth periods between age 6 months and 5 years. The independent cohort PErinatal Prevention of Obesity (PEPO) comprising 11,730 mother-child pairs recruited close to school entry (around age 6 years) was available for data validation. Cluster analysis and sequential prediction modelling were performed.

Results

Data of 1557 PEACHES mother-child pairs and the validation cohort were analyzed comprising more than 50,000 offspring BMI measurements. More than 1-in-5 offspring exposed to obesity in pregnancy belonged to an upper BMI z-score cluster as a distinct pattern of BMI development (above the cut-off of 1 SD) from the first months of life onwards resulting in preschool overweight/obesity (age 5 years: odds ratio [OR] 16.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.98–26.05). Contributing early-life factors including excessive weight gain (OR 2.08; 95% CI 1.25–3.45) and smoking (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.27–2.95) in pregnancy were instrumental in predicting a "higher-than-normal BMI growth pattern" at age 3 months and re-evaluating the risk at ages 1 year and 2 years (area under the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC] 0.69–0.79, sensitivity 70.7–76.0%, specificity 64.7–78.1%). External validation of prediction models demonstrated adequate predictive performances.

Conclusions

We devised a novel sequential strategy of individual prediction and re-evaluation of a higher-than-normal weight gain in "high-risk" infants well before developing overweight to guide decision-making. The strategy holds promise to elaborate interventions in an early preventive manner for integration in systems of well-child care.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^112HEanM]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Overweight and obesity — background epidemiology and cardiovascular associations — are described as highly prevalent and linked to vascular disease in youth, with 17 percent of children and adolescents with a body mass index (BMI) above the 95th percentile for age and gender. Two major postmortem studies have demonstrated that obesity in childhood and adolescence is associated with increased evidence of atherosclerosis at autopsy, especially in males, and obesity is even more powerfully correlated with atherosclerosis because of its association with elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance (IR). Longitudinal studies have demonstrated tracking of elevated BMI and increased adiposity in childhood to the presence of obesity in adulthood. Improvement in weight status and decrease in body fatness have been shown to be associated with decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BPs), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and/or triglycerides (TG), and inflammatory markers.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^116Jodjy]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Summary of the evidence review on risk factor tracking — Tracking studies from childhood to adulthood exist for all the major risk factors, and obesity tracks more strongly than any other risk factor. In the Bogalusa study, more than 2,000 children were followed from 5 to 14 years of age to adult follow-up at a mean age of 27 years, and 84 percent of those with a BMI in the 95th to 99th percentiles as children were obese as adults. For cholesterol and blood pressure, tracking correlation coefficients in the range of 0.4 have been reported, correlating measures in children 5 to 10 years of age with results 20 to 30 years later. These data suggest that having cholesterol or blood pressure levels in the upper portion of the pediatric distribution makes adult risk likely but not certain, and individuals who develop obesity have been shown to be more likely to develop hypertension or dyslipidemia as adults.

### Early-onset obesity and tirzepatide treatment: a post hoc analysis of the SURMOUNT clinical trials [^116TrMBy]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The prevalence of early‐onset obesity, often defined as a diagnosis before the age of 25 years, is unknown but likely increasing worldwide, with nearly one in five children/adolescents in the US affected by obesity as defined by body mass index (BMI) ≥ 95th percentile for age and sex. The number of children and adolescents with severe obesity (i.e. BMI ≥ 120% of the 95th percentile or ≥ 35 kg/m 2) has quadrupled in the last five decades and further increased with the COVID‐19 pandemic. Furthermore, a disproportionate increase in childhood and adolescent obesity disparities is present, particularly in Hispanic and non‐Hispanic Black children and most childhood obesity persists into adulthood.

Obesity is a complex disease with multiple contributors including genetic, biologic, environmental, behavioral, and social factors. Increasing severity of obesity exacerbates or causes obesity‐related complications such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, and metabolic dysfunction associated with steatotic liver disease. Furthermore, the upsurge of early‐onset obesity raises the risk of earlier occurrence of these obesity‐related complications. Excess weight in adolescents and young adults has been shown to increased risk of mortality. A recent study reported that every decade of earlier diagnosis of diabetes was associated with about 3–4 years of lower life expectancy, highlighting the urgent need to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes and addressing risk factors such as obesity.

### Classification of childhood obesity using longitudinal clinical body mass index and its validation [^114HFVm3]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Persistence of childhood adiposity is known to be associated with long-term adverse cardiometabolic risks. Yet, cross-sectional body mass index (BMI) is often used to classify obesity in clinical care and research. This study aimed to develop and validate a childhood BMI classification system using real life longitudinal clinical data.

Methods

This observational study used electronic health record data from a tertiary care hospital, with replication in an independent cohort. For individuals with ≥ 3 BMI measurements, the median BMI percentile and persistence in the obesity class were used for longitudinal classification. The association between longitudinal BMI class and early onset obesity, socioeconomic status (SES), and adverse cardiometabolic risk was analyzed.

Results

Height, weight, and cardiometabolic risk measures were obtained for 22,352 children from 2014–18 in the primary cohort and 24,444 children in the replication cohort. Obesity (BMI ≥ 95 th percentile [BMI pct95]) was observed in 24.1% and severe obesity (BMI ≥ 120% of BMI pct95) in 10.6%. Individuals with early onset obesity (age ≤ 6 years) remained in the same or higher obesity class; those in the high-SES group had lower odds of obesity. The proportion of individuals with cardiometabolic risk increased with obesity severity (p-value 0.01 - < 0.001). The AUC for cardiometabolic risk by longitudinal BMI class was higher compared to that for cross-sectional BMI (80.0% vs. 75.8%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The Longitudinal BMI classification may better reflect long-term cardiometabolic risk in children. This classification can be useful for focused intervention strategies and for profiling of individuals for genetic testing.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of risk factors for childhood overweight identifiable during infancy [^111MCwSi]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the UK in 2008, 31% of boys and 29% of girls aged 2–15 years were classified as overweight or obese. These figures are supported by data collected in 2010 by the National Child Measurement Programme showing that 23% of children aged 4–5 years and 33% of 10–11 year olds are overweight. Evidence suggests that weight at 5 years of age is a good indicator of the future health of a childand that obesity during childhood increases the risk of adult obesity. Cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity-attributable cancers, osteoarthritis and psychological disturbance generate much of the morbidity and years of life lost associated with increasing levels of obesity.

There is a strong rationale for intervening during early life in infants at risk of developing childhood obesityand to date interventions have focused on nutritional modification through supporting parents regarding, for example, healthy eating and breastfeeding. Both the Canadian Paediatric Societyand the American Academy of Pediatricsadvocate that all typically developing children aged 2 years and older should have their growth monitored to screen for under-development, wasting, overweight and obesity. However, in many countries, early life intervention is not routine clinical practice. Although in the United States, the Institute of Medicine has recently introduced early childhood obesity prevention guidancesuggesting that healthcare professionals (HCPs) should undertake regular growth monitoring and consider obesity risk factors during infancy, there is evidence in both the UK and the United States that HCPs are reluctant to diagnose obesity in infants. Furthermore, HCPs who routinely provide advice to parents have been found to have low levels of knowledge concerning the risks of obesity. This is partly due to the implementation gap between published research and clinical practice. Currently, there have been no systematic reviews that have comprehensively investigated all infant risk factors for both overweight and obesity in childhood using only prospective studies.

The aim of this systematic review is to identify those risk factors for overweight in childhood which could be identified by HCPs during an infant's first year of life.

Evidence standards and feasibility for cardiovascular (CV) risk factor screening — "the highest quality evidence" comes from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of screening versus no screening that compare outcomes among children allocated to each approach, but for dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity "it is unlikely that such a large, long-term study will ever exist" due to time, costs, adherence, and follow-up challenges; an RCT with shorter term follow-up to examine changes in risk factors or surrogate outcomes "may be more feasible", though subclinical measures "do not perfectly predict clinical CVD outcomes".

The guideline notes that the medical costs of untreated childhood obesity are well-documented and add urgency to provide payment for treatment, describes a role for AAP policy and advocacy with other organizations to accelerate progress through policy change within and beyond the health care sector, and states that targeted policies are needed to purposefully address structural racism driving disparities in childhood obesity and obesity-related comorbidities.

### Distinct child-to-adult body mass index trajectories are associated with different levels of adult cardiometabolic risk [^113tNFD2]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

The relationship between life-course body mass index (BMI) trajectories and adult risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is poorly described. In a longitudinal cohort, we describe BMI trajectories from early childhood to adulthood and investigate their association with CVD risk factors [Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), high-risk lipid levels, hypertension, and high carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT)] in adulthood (34–49years).

Methods and Results

Six discrete long-term BMI trajectories were identified using latent class growth mixture modelling among 2631 Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study participants (6–49years): stable normal (55.2%), resolving (1.6%), progressively overweight (33.4%), progressively obese (4.2%), rapidly overweight/obese (4.3%), and persistent increasing overweight/obese (1.2%). Trajectories of worsening or persisting obesity were generally associated with increased risk of CVD outcomes in adulthood (24–49years) [all risk ratios (RRs) > 15, P < 0.05 compared with the stable normal group]. Although residual risk for adult T2DM could not be confirmed [RR = 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.14–8.23], participants who resolved their elevated child BMI had similar risk for dyslipidaemia and hypertension as those never obese or overweight (all RRs close to 1). However, they had significantly higher risk for increased cIMT (RR = 3.37, 95% CI = 1.80–6.39).

Conclusion

The long-term BMI trajectories that reach or persist at high levels associate with CVD risk factors in adulthood. Stabilizing BMI in obese adults and resolving elevated child BMI by adulthood might limit and reduce adverse cardiometabolic profiles. However, efforts to prevent child obesity might be most effective to reduce the risk for adult atherosclerosis.

### Obesity is a potential risk factor contributing to clinical manifestations of COVID-19 [^1117cnnw]. International Journal of Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Since December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-induced pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread throughout China. COVID-19 patients demonstrated significantly different outcomes in clinic. We aimed to figure out whether obesity is a risk factor influencing the progression and prognosis of COVID-19.

Methods

95 patients with COVID-19 were divided into obesity group and non-obesity group according to their body mass index (BMI). The demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory examination, and chest computed tomography (CT) were collected, analyzed and compared between two groups.

Results

Our data showed that COVID-19 patients with obesity had more underlying diseases and higher mortality rate compared to those without obesity. Furthermore, patients with obesity also demonstrated more severe pathological change in lung and higher blood lymphocytes, triglycerides, IL-6, CRP, cystatin C, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which may greatly influence disease progression and poor prognosis of COVID-19.

Conclusions

It suggest that obesity contributes to clinical manifestations and may influence the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 and it is considered as a potential risk factor of the prognosis of COVID-19. Special medical care and appropriate intervention should be performed in obesity patients with COVID-19 during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially for those with additional other comorbidities.

Prenatal risk factors — perinatal environment and preterm birth: The perinatal environment plays an important role in a child's later development of overweight or obesity, with proposed mechanisms including gene–environment interactions or epigenetic changes attributable to maternal diet, physical activity, and/or other environmental contaminants; preterm infants have a greater likelihood of developing childhood obesity, with postulated contributors including feeding patterns leading to accelerated weight gain in preterm infants.

### Transitions in metabolic risk and long-term cardiovascular health: coronary artery risk development in young adults (CARDIA) study [^111c31f4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Metabolic syndrome, defined by abdominal obesity, proatherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance, is a risk factor for incident CVD. 17 Most clinical prevention has focused on BMI as a central arbiter of cardiometabolic risk, with screening beginning in childhood to mitigate chronic consequences of obesity. 24 Indeed, trajectories of obesity in childhood are strongly associated with CVD and diabetes in adulthood. 25 Nevertheless, the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines do not recommend any additional screening for dysglycemia or dyslipidemia prior to middle age (35 years for men, 45 years for women) in individuals not at "significant risk" for CVD or diabetes (defined as obesity, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, or personal or family history). 26 While prior work in CARDIA has defined the importance of cumulative exposure to obesity 7, 27 on cardiovascular structure, the divergence between metabolic risk and obesity (eg, "metabolically healthy obese" and "metabolically unwell lean" subtypes) is increasingly recognized. Previous work by our group 28 and others 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 has indicated that differences in metabolic susceptibility defined by visceral adiposity or inflammation may refine obesity‐related cardiometabolic risk. In addition, studies involving cardiac magnetic resonance suggest that even tissue‐level myocardial phenotypes may be affected in adolescent obesity, in proportion to systemic inflammation and dysglycemia. 34 These findings suggest that early detection of and focus on obesity‐associated metabolic risk may provide a more nuanced conception of cardiometabolic disease early in adulthood that may directly impact heart disease and may help to understand heterogeneity in clinical risk in individuals across the spectrum of obesity. 29

The relevance of pediatric MetS in clinical practice

Given the continuing disagreement and lack of knowledge regarding pediatric MetS, it is difficult to provide recommendations about its clinical application. Results from longitudinal studies are also not that conclusive. In two Iranian studies childhood MetS was found to be a poor prognostic factor for adult MetS and in the "Cardiovascular Risk of Young Finns Study", the accuracy in predicting adult health outcomes was hardly better than prediction by pure chance. These findings agreed with the "Princeton Lipid Research Cohort Study", in which the within-person accordance between childhood- and adult-MetS severity (evaluated by calculation of a MetS severity z -score) was found to be moderate. This instability in MetS status could be explained by changes in weight status as well as by pubertal development during the follow-up period. Individuals, who were obese in childhood, but were of normal weight in adulthood, were shown to have a similar risk for being MetS-positive as those who never have been obese. This indicates that weight status per se is a predictor of adult health risk. Indeed, longitudinal studies revealed that childhood MetS could predict adult MetS, T2DM, or CVD, however the predictive value of MetS was not superior to that of BMI per se. These findings foster the discussion whether its clinical application provides any benefit, especially since body weight assessment requires less effort.

### Pediatric obesity-long-term consequences and effect of weight loss [^111RQR9j]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Childhood obesity is, according to the WHO, one of the most serious challenges of the 21st century. More than 100 million children have obesity today. Already during childhood, almost all organs are at risk of being affected by obesity. In this review, we present the current knowledge about diseases associated with childhood obesity and how they are affected by weight loss. One major causative factor is obesity‐induced low‐grade chronic inflammation, which can be observed already in preschool children. This inflammation — together with endocrine, paracrine, and metabolic effects of obesity — increases the long‐term risk for several severe diseases. Type 2 diabetes is increasingly prevalent in adolescents and young adults who have had obesity during childhood. When it is diagnosed in young individuals, the morbidity and mortality rate is higher than when it occurs later in life, and more dangerous than type 1 diabetes. Childhood obesity also increases the risk for several autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, arthritis, and type 1 diabetes and it is well established that childhood obesity also increases the risk for cardiovascular disease. Consequently, childhood obesity increases the risk for premature mortality, and the mortality rate is three times higher already before 30 years of age compared with the normal population. The risks associated with childhood obesity are modified by weight loss. However, the risk reduction is affected by the age at which weight loss occurs. In general, early weight loss — that is, before puberty — is more beneficial, but there are marked disease‐specific differences.

### Screening and interventions for childhood overweight: a summary of evidence for the US preventive services task force [^115sGFN1]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity are related to health risks, medical conditions, and increased risk of adult obesity, with its attendant effects on morbidity and mortality rates. The prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity has more than doubled in the past 25 years. Purpose. This evidence synthesis examines the evidence for the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment of overweight among children and adolescents in clinical settings.

Methods

We developed an analytic framework and 7 key questions representing the logical evidence connecting screening and weight control interventions with changes in overweight and behavioral, physiologic, and health outcomes in childhood or adulthood. We searched the Cochrane Library from 1996 to April 2004. We searched Medline, PsycINFO, DARE, and CINAHL from 1966 to April 2004. One reviewer abstracted relevant information from each included article into standardized evidence tables, and a second reviewer checked key elements. Two reviewers quality-graded each article with US Preventive Services Task Force criteria.

Results

Although BMI is a measure of relative weight rather than adiposity, it is recommended widely for use among children and adolescents to determine overweight and is the currently preferred measure. The risk of adult overweight from childhood overweight provides the best available evidence to judge the clinical validity of BMI as an overweight criterion for children and adolescents. BMI measures in childhood track to adulthood moderately or very well, with stronger tracking seen for children with ≥ 1 obese parent and children who are more overweight or older. The probability of adult obesity (BMI of > 30 kg/m(2)) is ≥ 50% among children > 13 years of age whose BMI percentiles meet or exceed the 95th percentile for age and gender. BMI-based overweight categorization for individuals, particularly for racial/ethnic minorities with differences in body composition, may have limited validity because BMI measures cannot differentiate between increased weight for height attributable to relatively greater fat-free mass (muscle, bone, and fluids) and that attributable to greater fat. No trials of screening programs to identify and to treat childhood overweight have been reported. Limited research is available on effective, generalizable interventions for overweight children and adolescents that can be conducted in primary care settings or through primary care referrals.

Conclusions

BMI measurements of overweight among older adolescents identify those at increased risk of developing adult obesity. Interventions to treat overweight adolescents in clinical settings have not been shown to have clinically significant benefits, and they are not widely available. Screening to categorize overweight among children under age 12 or 13 who are not clearly overweight may not provide reliable risk categorization for adult obesity. Screening in this age group is compromised by the fact that there is little generalizable evidence for primary care interventions. Because existing trials report modest short- to medium-term improvements (approximately 10–20% decrease in percentage of overweight or a few units of change in BMI), however, overweight improvements among children and adolescents seem possible.
