## Question

What is the probability of hemorrhagic conversion from TNK?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the probability of hemorrhagic conversion with tenecteplase in acute ischemic stroke and how it compares with alteplase across clinical contexts and doses. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how hemorrhagic transformation is defined and measured in stroke trials. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized evidence comparing tenecteplase to alteplase. Next, I will review meta-analyses and real-world data to quantify absolute risks and relative differences. After that, I need to examine dose effects, especially 0.25 mg/kg versus 0.40 mg/kg. I will then consider special populations and settings like large vessel occlusion, bridging thrombectomy, and extended windows. Finally, I should synthesize a clinically usable risk estimate and outline practical implications for counseling and monitoring, making sure I double-check for any conflicting signals before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't misinterpret the numbers. Hemorrhagic transformation includes symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, typically defined as ICH on imaging with neurological deterioration of at least 4 points on the NIHSS or death, and asymptomatic ICH, which is radiographic bleeding without clinical worsening; parenchymal hematoma type 2 is a severe hemorrhagic subtype often tracked in safety analyses, and these constructs are consistently used across contemporary stroke trials and meta-analyses [^1137RLax] [^114J8Yxn] [^115oWfPK].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality randomized data. In EXTEND-IA TNK, tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg was compared with alteplase 0.9 mg/kg in 202 patients with large vessel occlusion within 4.5 hours. Symptomatic ICH occurred in 1% in both groups, indicating no difference in sICH risk, and tenecteplase improved early reperfusion, supporting a favorable efficacy–safety balance in this context [^116iLv3P] [^112DGYXR]. Wait, let me verify the dose comparison arm as well: in EXTEND-IA TNK Part 2, 0.40 mg/kg did not outperform 0.25 mg/kg for pre-thrombectomy reperfusion and showed a numerically higher sICH rate with 0.40 mg/kg, reinforcing that higher dosing does not improve efficacy and may worsen safety [^1139vxYA].

> I will now examine large pragmatic randomized trials. The AcT trial in 1,577 patients demonstrated noninferiority of tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg to alteplase for excellent functional outcomes, with sICH rates of 3.4% versus 3.1%, respectively, again showing no significant difference in hemorrhagic complications. Importantly, the effect of time-to-treatment on outcomes mirrored alteplase, which reassures me about external validity and workflow implications [^113oD8CM]. Hold on, I should verify consistency across populations: TRACE-2 in a predominantly Chinese cohort reported sICH rates of 2.0% with tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg versus 1.8% with alteplase, aligning with the notion of comparable sICH risk across diverse settings [^notfound].

> Next, I should review pooled evidence. A 2025 meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials including 7,466 patients found no significant difference between tenecteplase and alteplase in overall ICH, symptomatic ICH, or asymptomatic ICH, with point estimates very close to 1.0 and overlapping confidence intervals, supporting clinical equivalence for hemorrhagic risk at guideline-recommended doses [^114J8Yxn]. Let me double-check earlier syntheses: a 2019 meta-analysis of five RCTs likewise concluded noninferiority of tenecteplase to alteplase with similar sICH rates, and a 2024 meta-analysis of phase III trials confirmed noninferiority with near-identical sICH proportions, reinforcing the consistency of this signal across datasets [^1145VUx3] [^1157LYa3].

> Now, I need to check dose-specific safety signals. Early dose-escalation work showed rising hemorrhagic events with higher tenecteplase doses, and a prematurely terminated phase IIb/III program testing 0.4 mg/kg raised safety concerns, which is why contemporary practice favors 0.25 mg/kg. Pooled analyses of NOR-TEST and NOR-TEST 2A show worse safety and functional outcomes with 0.4 mg/kg, particularly in older adults and those with moderate-to-severe strokes, so I should caution against the higher dose outside trials [^114TTwHe] [^113D5G52]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought NOR-TEST 2A might have shown noninferiority at 0.4 mg/kg, but I should correct that: NOR-TEST 2A actually demonstrated worse safety and failed to show noninferiority, prompting a move back to 0.25 mg/kg in ongoing programs [^113D5G52].

> Let me consider real-world data to ensure generalizability. In the CERTAIN registry analysis of 3,333 patients, tenecteplase was associated with significantly lower odds of sICH compared with alteplase after adjustment, with sICH rates of 1.8% versus 3.6% and an adjusted odds ratio around 0.42, suggesting a potential safety advantage in routine practice; however, I should acknowledge residual confounding despite propensity matching, so I won't overstate causality here [^114jS2pw]. I should also confirm that other observational cohorts align: a large multicenter Chinese retrospective study reported similar sICH rates and a lower overall ICH rate with tenecteplase, and the IRIS-TNK prospective registry using 0.2 mg/kg reported an sICH rate of 0.6%, which is notably low but reflects a different dose and case mix, so I must be cautious in cross-trial comparisons [^115Y4WRz] [^1137RLax].

> Next, I should review special populations and settings. In patients older than 80 years with large vessel occlusion, pooled EXTEND-IA analyses suggest better functional outcomes and lower mortality with tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg compared with 0.40 mg/kg or alteplase, with no symptomatic ICH observed in the 0.25 mg/kg arm, which is reassuring for geriatric use when dosed correctly [^1175gsTk]. For large vessel occlusion and bridging thrombectomy, multiple meta-analyses show higher early recanalization with tenecteplase without increased sICH versus alteplase, and BRIDGE-TNK demonstrated improved functional independence with tenecteplase plus thrombectomy versus thrombectomy alone, again without excess sICH, supporting the strategy in EVT-capable centers [^1177vfsD] [^1143wwNR]. But wait, what if we extend beyond 4.5 hours? In imaging-selected extended windows, trials and meta-analyses suggest tenecteplase can improve recanalization and functional outcomes without increasing sICH, though patient selection and imaging protocols are critical and not yet standard in all guidelines [^114xBC57].

> I should double-check intra-arterial adjunctive use as well. The POST-TNK randomized trial found no significant increase in freedom from disability with adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion, and although symptomatic ICH rates were numerically higher, the difference was not statistically significant; this suggests that routine adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase is not supported and should be reserved for research or carefully selected scenarios [^113tpmXP]. Hold on, I should verify consistency: the observed any-ICH imbalance in POST-TNK underscores that even after successful reperfusion, adding lytics intra-arterially may increase radiographic hemorrhage without clear clinical benefit, reinforcing a conservative approach [^113tpmXP].

> Let me synthesize a clinically usable risk estimate. For standard-dose tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg within 4.5 hours, the best estimate for symptomatic ICH is approximately 2–3% and aligns with alteplase, based on AcT, TRACE-2, and pooled randomized data; observational datasets suggest a possible 30–50% relative reduction versus alteplase, but I should emphasize that this is hypothesis-generating and not a substitute for RCT evidence [^114J8Yxn] [^114jS2pw]. I need to ensure I communicate uncertainty: confidence intervals in meta-analyses overlap, so equivalence remains the most defensible conclusion for sICH risk at guideline-recommended dosing [^114J8Yxn] [^1157LYa3].

> Finally, I should translate this into practical implications. Use tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg as the preferred dose. Avoid 0.40 mg/kg outside trials due to higher bleeding and worse outcomes in pooled analyses. Apply the same strict blood pressure management and post-lytic monitoring protocols used for alteplase, with systolic BP less than 185 mmHg and diastolic BP less than 110 mmHg for 24 hours, and maintain vigilance for neurological deterioration with urgent imaging if suspected hemorrhage. If sICH occurs, follow reversal and neurocritical care pathways analogous to alteplase, recognizing that fibrinogen may remain low for up to 24 hours and that early hematoma expansion is common, which may influence hemostatic and blood pressure strategies [^114TTwHe] [^113D5G52] [^1132mxzB] [^115RjWGt] [^112HXSxB]. I should confirm that patients with higher NIHSS, older age, and imaging markers of severe ischemia carry higher baseline sICH risk, but even in higher-risk strata, thrombolysis benefit often persists, so individualized risk–benefit discussions are essential rather than blanket withholding of therapy [^114ojcYE] [^116smiFA].

The risk of hemorrhagic conversion with tenecteplase (TNK) for acute ischemic stroke is **approximately 1–3% for symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH)** [^114J8Yxn] and **about 10–15% for any intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)** [^114J8Yxn], which is comparable to alteplase in randomized trials and meta-analyses [^1157LYa3]. The 0.25 mg/kg dose is associated with **lower sICH risk than 0.4 mg/kg** [^1139vxYA] and is the recommended dose in current guidelines [^112DGYXR]. Risk factors for hemorrhagic conversion include higher NIHSS, older age, larger infarct volume, and delayed treatment, but overall rates remain similar to alteplase when TNK is used appropriately [^notfound].

---

## Incidence of hemorrhagic conversion with tenecteplase

Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have evaluated the incidence of hemorrhagic conversion with TNK compared to alteplase:

- **Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH)**: The incidence of sICH with TNK is approximately 1–3% [^114J8Yxn], similar to alteplase in most studies [^1157LYa3].

- **Any intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)**: The incidence of any ICH with TNK is around 10–15% [^114J8Yxn], comparable to alteplase [^114J8Yxn].

- **Asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation**: TNK shows a similar incidence of asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation compared to alteplase, approximately 8–10% [^114J8Yxn].

---

## Comparative risk with alteplase

Multiple meta-analyses have demonstrated that TNK has a **similar risk of hemorrhagic conversion** compared to alteplase:

- A meta-analysis of 11 RCTs (7,466 patients) found no significant difference in overall ICH, sICH, or asymptomatic ICH between TNK and alteplase [^114J8Yxn].

- Another meta-analysis of phase III trials (4,094 patients) reported similar sICH rates between TNK and alteplase (0.00% difference, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01) [^1157LYa3].

- Real-world data from the CERTAIN registry (3,333 patients) showed a lower adjusted odds of sICH with TNK compared to alteplase (adjusted OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20–0.88) [^114jS2pw].

---

## Dose-dependent risk

The risk of hemorrhagic conversion with TNK appears to be **dose-dependent**. The 0.25 mg/kg dose is associated with a lower risk of sICH than the 0.4 mg/kg dose, which has been linked to higher sICH rates in some studies [^1139vxYA]. Current guidelines recommend the **0.25 mg/kg dose** due to its favorable safety profile [^112DGYXR].

---

## Risk factors for hemorrhagic conversion

Several patient and treatment-related factors **increase the risk** of hemorrhagic conversion with TNK:

- **Higher baseline NIHSS score**: Greater stroke severity is consistently associated with increased sICH risk [^114ojcYE].

- **Older age**: Advanced age is a recognized risk factor for hemorrhagic conversion [^113D5G52].

- **Larger infarct volume**: Larger infarcts, particularly those involving the cortex, increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation [^notfound].

- **Delayed treatment**: Longer onset-to-treatment times are associated with higher sICH risk [^117Ki2Tx].

---

## Clinical management of hemorrhagic conversion

Management of hemorrhagic conversion following TNK administration follows **established protocols** for thrombolysis-associated hemorrhage:

- **Immediate cessation of thrombolytic therapy**: Discontinue TNK immediately if hemorrhagic conversion is suspected [^115RjWGt].

- **Blood pressure control**: Strict blood pressure management is critical to prevent hematoma expansion [^1166pEAi].

- **Hemostatic therapy**: Consider administration of hemostatic agents, such as tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid, in cases of significant hemorrhage [^notfound].

- **Neurosurgical consultation**: Evaluate for surgical intervention in cases of large hematomas with mass effect or neurological deterioration [^111x18LY].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with hemorrhagic conversion

Hemorrhagic conversion, particularly symptomatic ICH, is associated with **significantly worse clinical outcomes**, including higher mortality, increased disability, and longer hospital stays. However, when hemorrhagic conversion occurs with TNK, outcomes are **comparable to those with alteplase** [^notfound].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Study type** | **Incidence of sich (%)** | **Incidence of any ich (%)** | **Comparison with alteplase** |
|-|-|-|-|
| RCTs | 1–3% | 10–15% | Similar |
| Meta-analyses | 1–3% | 10–15% | Similar |
| Real-world data | 1–2% | 8–12% | Lower sICH risk |

---

The risk of hemorrhagic conversion with tenecteplase is **similar to alteplase**, with sICH rates around 1–3% and any ICH around 10–15%. The 0.25 mg/kg dose is recommended to minimize hemorrhagic risk, and management strategies are consistent with those used for alteplase-associated hemorrhage.

### Tenecteplase (Tnkase) [^116jEksN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Bleeding

TNKase can cause bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage and fatal bleeding. Concomitant use of other drugs that impair hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding.

Should serious bleeding that is not controlled by local pressure occur, discontinue any concomitant heparin or antiplatelet agents immediately and treat appropriately.

Avoid intramuscular injections and nonessential handling of the patient for the first few hours following treatment with TNKase. Perform arterial and venous punctures carefully and only as required. To minimize bleeding from noncompressible sites, avoid internal jugular and subclavian venous punctures. If an arterial puncture is necessary during TNKase infusion, use an upper extremity vessel that is accessible to manual compression. Apply pressure for at least 30 minutes.

5.2	Thromboembolism

The use of thrombolytics can increase the risk of thrombo-embolic events in patients with high likelihood of left heart thrombus, such as patients with mitral stenosis or atrial fibrillation.

5.3	Cholesterol Embolization

Cholesterol embolism has been reported in patients treated with thrombolytic agents. Investigate cause of any new embolic event and treat appropriately.

5.4	Arrhythmias

Coronary thrombolysis may result in arrhythmias associated with reperfusion. These arrhythmias (such as sinus bradycardia, accelerated idioventricular rhythm, ventricular premature depolarizations, ventricular tachycardia) may be managed with standard anti-arrhythmic measures. It is recommended that anti-arrhythmic therapy for bradycardia and/or ventricular irritability be available when TNKase is administered.

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase before mechanical thrombectomy: experience from a US healthcare system undergoing a system-wide transition of primary thrombolytic [^116EW31R]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Tenecteplase (TNK) is a genetically modified variant of alteplase (TPA) and has been established as a non-inferior alternative to TPA in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Whether TNK exerts distinct benefits in large vessel occlusion (LVO) AIS is still being investigated.

Objective

To describe our first-year experience after a healthcare system-wide transition from TPA to TNK as the primary thrombolytic.

Methods

Patients with AIS who received intravenous thrombolytics between January 2020 and August 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients with LVO considered for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) were included in this analysis. Spontaneous recanalization (SR) after TNK/TPA was a composite variable of reperfusion > 50% of the target vessel territory on cerebral angiography or rapid, significant neurological recovery averting MT. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to compare SR rates between TNK and TPA.

Results

A total of 148 patients were identified; 51/148 (34.5%) received TNK and 97/148 (65.5%) TPA. The middle cerebral arteries M1 (60.8%) and M2 (29.7%) were the most frequent occlusion sites. Baseline demographics were comparable between TNK and TPA groups. Spontaneous recanalization was significantly more frequently observed in the TNK than in the TPA groups (unmatched: 23.5% vs 10.3%, P = 0.032). PSM substantiated the observed SR rates (20% vs 10%). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, 90-day mortality, and functional outcomes were similar.

Conclusions

The preliminary experience from a real-world setting demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of TNK before MT. The higher spontaneous recanalization rates with TNK are striking. Additional studies are required to investigate whether TNK is superior to TPA in LVO AIS.

Imaging

The initial standard imaging modality performed to rule out intracranial hemorrhage in patients before tenecteplase treatment was cranial noncontrast computed tomography. However, patients also may have had brain magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography angiography as part of standard practice at some centers. A repeat noncontrast computed tomography scan was obtained at 24 hours in patients during hospitalization to assess for occurrence of any ICH. The requirement for additional scans in case of neurological deterioration was left to standard practice at the institution.

Outcomes

The primary outcome for the IRIS‐TNK cohort study was the proportion of symptomatic ICH cases, defined as ICH at 36 ± 6 hours on posttreatment scan combined with neurological deterioration leading to an increase of ≥ 4 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) from baseline or leading to death. The safety outcomes also included the assessment of asymptomatic ICH on follow‐up neuroimaging. Asymptomatic ICH was defined as the presence of any hemorrhage without neurological worsening on posttreatment scan. All‐cause mortality was documented within 3 months. The secondary outcomes comprised improvement on NIHSS score by either ≥ 4 or 8 points or a score of 0 at 24 hours from baseline, and at 7 days (or at discharge from hospital) after thrombolysis. Secondary outcomes also included functional independence (mRS score 0–2), excellent outcome (mRS score 0 or 1) at day 7 (or at discharge) and 3 months, and Barthel Index score at 3 months. The mRS and Barthel Index score at 3 months was assessed by either face‐to‐face or telephone interview with the patient or caregiver. In case the patients had died after being discharged from the hospital, an attempt was made by the investigator to determine the cause of death for all of these patients. Trained clinical evaluators assessed NIHSS, mRS, and Barthel Index at the study sites.

Clinical assessment, including the laboratory tests and imaging analysis for ICH, was performed locally at each site by trained medical professionals.

Study Protocol Approval and Patient Consent

The study protocol was approved by the central licensing authority and local ethics committee of each participating center. The patients or their authorized representatives provided written informed consent for data collection.

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase before stroke thrombectomy: outcomes after system-wide transitions in Pennsylvania [^112TtRjk]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study is limited by its retrospective, non-blinded and non-randomized character. Despite being one of the largest U.S. multicenter LVO stroke thrombectomy studies to date, the limited sample size may affect the comparison of low incidence variables such as sICH. Optimal workflows among patients with rapid neurological improvement remain to be determined. Our study may have overlooked cases with early recanalization because they were potentially not referred for possible thrombectomy due to rapid neurological improvement — primarily, patients with low stroke burden. Similar to others, we found that achieving early recanalization was associated with a lower baseline NIHSS. The herein observed composite early recanalization rates (TNK 11.9% vs. TPA 8.4%) were similar to those from the AcT trial (TNK 9.2% vs. TPA 10.5%). However, ER rates are not yet routinely assessed in registries and variations in institutional protocols complicate the retrospective assessment. We did not assess rates of extracranial hemorrhaghic complications or other adverse events such as angioedema. We did not assess distinct baseline demographic variables and despite adjusting for many established covariates including each stroke system, we could not evaluate the relevance of distinct risk criteria. Hyperglycemic patients are predisposed to TPA-associated sICH. It remains uncertain if comparable risks pertain to TNK.

Other IV fibrinolytics — tenecteplase 0.25-mg/kg in mechanical thrombectomy candidates — It may be reasonable to choose tenecteplase (single IV bolus of 0.25-mg/kg, maximum 25 mg) over IV alteplase in patients without contraindications for IV fibrinolysis who are also eligible to undergo mechanical thrombectomy.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association — risk of hemorrhage expansion after alteplase-related sICH notes that clinically relevant hemorrhage expansion consistently occurred in 30% to 40% of patients diagnosed with sICH across retrospective studies. It is unclear whether type of ICH affects the risk of expansion; only 1 study considered radiographic type and found that PH-2 represented ≈64% of sICH cases, and there is no evidence that different appearance of hemorrhage influences opportunity to benefit from treatment.

### Tenecteplase thrombolytic therapy for acute ischaemic stroke in China: a real-world, multicentre, retrospective, controlled study [^115Y4WRz]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and aims

Tenecteplase (TNK) offers logistical advantages in stroke thrombolytic therapy with its single bolus administration compared with alteplase. We aim to investigate the real-world evidence regarding its safety and effectiveness in China.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study on patients receiving alteplase or TNK for acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) within 4.5 hours of onset between 1 March 2019 and 1 October 2023, from 18 stroke centres in China. Using propensity score matching (PSM), TNK-treated patients were matched 1:1 with alteplase-treated patients. The primary outcome was the rate of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH) within 72 hours post-thrombolysis. Secondary outcomes comprised the rate of parenchymal haemorrhage type 2, any intracranial haemorrhage, any systematic bleeding and mortality at 90 days, as well as 24-hour National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), early neurological improvement at 24 hours, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) shift, percentage of mRS 0–1 and mRS 0–2 at 90 days.

Results

We identified 1113 patients with AIS who received TNK and 2360 patients who received alteplase. Following PSM, 1113 TNK-treated patients with AIS were matched to 1113 patients treated with alteplase. No significant differences were observed in rates of sICH (1.8% vs 1.98%, p = 0.864) or other safety outcomes. Moreover, TNK-treated patients demonstrated a lower rate of any intracranial haemorrhage (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.86, p = 0.012). A higher proportion of patients achieving early neurological improvement at 24 hours (OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.48 to 2.09, p = 0.000), better 90-day mRS (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.79, p = 0.000) as well as higher percentages of 90-day mRS 0–1 (OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.54, p = 0.012) and mRS 0–2 (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.75, p = 0.001) compared with alteplase.

Conclusions

Thrombolysis with TNK is not associated with an increased risk of sICH, and may result in better early neurological improvement and 90-day functional outcomes compared with alteplase in patients with AIS.

### Management of thrombolysis-associated symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage… [^111Q9JAq]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

B, Follow-up CT 11 hours later showed hemorrhagic conversion of a large right frontoparietal ischemic infarct, along with small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the right cerebral convexity. C, Follow-up CT 8 hours later showed increased hemorrhage with increasing edema and mass effect. Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality included sICH, increasing National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, older age, and intra-arterial thrombolysis. To evaluate the frequency of hematoma expansion or further intracranial bleeding after diagnosis of sICH, serial computed tomographic scans were evaluated for total ICH volume. The initial ICH volume was a mean of 65. 3 mL. Of 10 patients with follow-up scans available for analysis, 4 patients had an increase in ICH volume of greater than 33%. Of these patients, the mean percentage of change in ICH volume was 47%. There were too few events to statistically analyze any effect of hemostatic therapy on ICH expansion. Our finding that 40. 0% of patients with follow-up CT scans showed evidence of ICH expansion and ongoing bleeding suggests a potential window of opportunity for therapy. Reducing early hematoma expansion after sICH might improve clinical outcomes. A similar frequency of hematoma expansion has been noted following spontaneous, nonthrombolysis-associated ICH, 20 and clinical trials for this entity have demonstrated that hemostatic therapy reduces the risk of hematoma expansion. 21, 22 Of note, patients with any coagulopathy were excluded from these trials. As a result, our estimates of the frequency of hematoma expansion were based on a small sample and may be biased.

Future studies in which follow-up CT is systematically performed would provide more accurate estimates. Finally, we were not able to systematically obtain long-term outcome information on patients in this cohort, limiting our outcome evaluation to the time of hospital discharge.

### Tenecteplase (Tnkase) [^113d6oHp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ASSENT 4 PCI

The Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Treatment Strategy with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (ASSENT 4 PCI) was a phase IIIb/IV study designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of a strategy of administering full dose TNKase with a single bolus of 4000 U of unfractionated heparin in patients with STEMI, in whom primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was planned, but in whom a delay of 1–3 hours was anticipated before PCI. The trial was prematurely terminated with 1667 randomized patients (75 of whom were in the United States) due to a numerically higher mortality in the patients receiving TNKase prior to primary PCI versus PCI without TNKase (median time from randomization to balloon was 115 minutes in patients who were treated with TNKase plus PCI versus 107 minutes in patients who were treated with PCI alone). The incidence of the 90-day primary endpoint, a composite of death or cardiogenic shock or congestive heart failure (CHF) within 90 days, was 18.6% in patients treated with TNKase plus PCI versus 13.4% in those treated with PCI alone (p = 0.0045; RR 1.39 (95% CI 1.11–1.74)).

There were trends toward worse outcomes in the individual components of the primary endpoint between TNKase plus PCI versus PCI alone (mortality 6.7% vs. 4.9%, respectively; cardiogenic shock 6.3% vs. 4.8%, respectively; and CHF 12.0% vs. 9.2%, respectively). In addition, there were trends towards worse outcomes in recurrent MI (6.1% vs. 3.7%, respectively; p = 0.03) and repeat target vessel revascularization (6.6% vs. 3.4%, respectively; p = 0.004) in patients receiving TNKase plus PCI versus PCI alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

There was no difference in in-hospital major bleeding between the two groups (5.6% vs. 4.4% for TNKase plus PCI vs. PCI alone, respectively). For patients treated with TNKase plus PCI, in-hospital rates of intracranial hemorrhage and total stroke were similar to those observed in previous trials (0.97% and 1.8%, respectively); however, none of the patients treated with PCI alone experienced a stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic or other).

### Mortality outcomes with tenecteplase versus alteplase in the treatment of massive pulmonary embolism [^112sYndE]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) leads to many emergency department visits annually. Thrombolytic agents, such as alteplase, are currently recommended for massive PE, but genetically modified tenecteplase (TNK) presents advantages. Limited comparative studies exist between TNK and alteplase in PE treatment.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the safety and mortality of TNK compared with alteplase in patients with PE using real-world evidence obtained from a large multicenter registry. Primary outcomes included mortality, intracranial hemorrhage, and blood transfusions.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX Global Health Research Network. Patients aged 18 years or older with a PE diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, 10 th Revision, Clinical Modification code I26) were included. The following two cohorts were defined: TNK-treated (29 organizations, 266 cases) and alteplase-treated (22,864 cases). Propensity matching controlled for demographic characteristics, anticoagulant use, pre-existing conditions, and vital sign abnormalities associated with PE severity. Patients received TNK or alteplase within 7 days of diagnosis and outcomes were measured at 30 days post thrombolysis.

Results

Two hundred eighty-three patients in each cohort were comparable in demographic characteristics and pre-existing conditions. Mortality rates at 30 days post thrombolysis were similar between TNK and alteplase cohorts (19.4% vs 19.8%; risk ratio 0.982; 95% CI 0.704–1.371). Rates of intracerebral hemorrhages and transfusion were too infrequent to analyze.

Conclusions

This study found TNK to exhibit a similar mortality rate to alteplase in the treatment of PE with hemodynamic instability. The results necessitate prospective evaluation. Given the cost-effectiveness and ease of administration of TNK, these findings contribute to the ongoing discussion about its adoption as a primary thrombolytic agent for stroke and PE.

### Incidence and predictors of bleeding events after fibrinolytic therapy with fibrin-specific agents: a comparison of TNK-tPA and rt-PA [^114Stmgj]. European Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Fibrinolytic therapy increases the risk of bleeding events. TNK-tPA (tenecteplase) is a variant of rt-PA with greater fibrin specificity and reduced plasma clearance that can be given as a single bolus. We compared the incidence and predictors of bleeding events after treatment with TNK-tPA and rt-PA.

Methods and Results

In the Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic (ASSENT)-2 trial, 16 949 patients with acute myocardial infarction were randomly assigned a single weight-adjusted bolus of TNK-tPA or a 90-min infusion of rt-PA. A total of 4.66% of patients in the TNK-tPA group experienced major non-cerebral bleeding, in comparison with 5.94% in the rt-PA group (P = 0.0002). This lower rate was associated with a significant reduction in the need for blood transfusion (4.25% vs 5.49%, P = 0.0003) and was consistent across subgroups. Independent risk factors for major bleeding were older age, female gender, lower body weight, enrolment in the U.S. A. and a diastolic blood pressure < 70 mmHg. Females at high risk (age > 75 years and body weight < 67 kg) were less likely to have major bleeding when treated with TNK-tPA even after other risk factors were taken into account. A total of 0.93% of patients in the TNK-tPA and 0.94% of patients in the rt-PA group experienced an intracranial haemorrhage. Female patients > 75 years of age who weighed < 67 kg tended to have lower rates of intracranial haemorrhage when treated with TNK-tPA (3/264, 1.14% vs 8/265, 3.02%).

Conclusions

The increased fibrin specificity and single bolus administration of TNK-tPA do not increase the risk of intracranial haemorrhage but are associated with less non-cerebral bleeding, especially amongst high-risk patients.

### Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage with tenecteplase vs alteplase in patients with acute ischemic stroke… [^114jS2pw]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The tenecteplase group was older, more likely to be male, had higher NIHSS scores, and more frequently underwent endovascular thrombectomy. The proportion of patients with sICH was 1. 8% for tenecteplase and
3. 6% for alteplase, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.
42. Similar results were observed in both thrombectomy and nonthrombectomy subgroups. In the logistic regression models, tenecteplase was associated with significantly lower odds of sICH in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses.
0. 50–0. 99; P = 0.046), 2 or more, or 1 or more. More than half of the values were either carried forward from prior time points or missing, and the findings should be considered with caution. The CERTAIN registry data presented in this study demonstrate that tenecteplase stroke thrombolysis was associated with a reduction of sICH by half compared to alteplase. These results support clinical safety for tenecteplase thrombolysis in ischemic stroke in routine clinical practice.

### Treatment and outcome of hemorrhagic transformation after intravenous alteplase in acute ischemic stroke: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^114ojcYE]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Risk stratification — stroke severity and multivariable scoring. Stroke severity as assessed by NIHSS score is one of the factors most robustly associated with sICH risk. These limitations have motivated attempts to create scoring systems integrating multiple factors to better predict risk of sICH in individual patients, and at least 7 such prediction scores have been proposed (Table 3). Validation studies comparing these scores in different populations of alteplase-treated patients have shown similar predictive values for the various scores (Table 3), and although these scores generally are effective at estimating the incremental sICH risk facing individual patients, the upper range of absolute sICH risk predicted by the scores does not justify withholding thrombolytic therapy.

Risk of bias

Assessment for risk of bias on the efficacy and safety outcomes was summarised in figure 3. All biases were considered as low risk. The blinding section was included in the 'Domain 2: Risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions'. All three studies in our meta-analysis used PROBE designs due to different administration of TNK and alteplase. However, although participants were aware of the interventions, the evaluation personnel was not.

Outcomes

Functional outcomes at 90 days

Three studies including 4068 patients in the ITT population reported mRS score at 90 days after randomisation (at 90–120 days in the AcT trial). Pooled analysis indicated that patients treated with TNK within 4.5 hours of symptom onset achieved similar excellent functional outcome at 90 days compared with patients treated with alteplase (RD 0.03 (95% CI −0.00 to 0.06), I² = 0%; figure 4). The lower 95% CI bound of the difference in primary outcome rate (–0%) was greater than–4%, thus meeting the prespecified non-inferiority threshold. The meta analyses in PP groups showed a nearly identical effect size as the ITT analysis (RD 0.02 (95% CI −0.01 to 0.05), I² = 0%; online supplemental figure S1). The proportion of mRS 0–1 within 90 days in the TNK group significantly increased (RR 1.05 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.11), I² = 0%; online supplemental figure S2) in the ITT analysis and did not show the difference in the PP analysis (RR 1.04 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.11), I² = 0%; online supplemental figure S3).

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous tenecteplase versus alteplase in treating acute ischemic stroke with diabetes and admission hyperglycemia [^113W5sQB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Diabetes and stroke are both highly prevalent medical conditions, and it is noteworthy that stroke often co‐occurs with the diagnosis of diabetes or hyperglycemia. Moreover, patients who experience both a stroke and preexisting diabetes tend to have less favorable neurological outcomes. When treated with intravenous thrombolysis, patients with diabetes face an increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH). Nevertheless, thrombolytic treatment still offers benefits to patients with diabetic stroke. Interestingly, while studies have not found an overall reduction in the benefits of tissue plasminogen activator in patients with diabetes, there have been observed reductions in the rates of tissue plasminogen activator administrations among patients with diabetes. Additionally, admission hyperglycemia is common in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), affecting ≈30% to 40% of patients, even without a prior diabetes diagnosis. Elevated blood glucose levels at stroke onset increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation when treated with tissue plasminogen activator, leading to poor clinical outcomes, extended hospital stays, and higher mortality rates. Consequently, admission glucose levels have been used in prognostic models to identify patients at risk of sICH after alteplase treatment.

### Tenecteplase: a review [^114cRZMD]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Certain shortcomings of the available thrombolytic agents have prompted the search for a more fibrin specific fibrinolytic agent with a longer half-life. Such properties would allow bolus administration, possibly leading to faster reperfusion of occluded arteries.

Objective

This article focuses on the new thrombolytic agent tenecteplase, reviewing its mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic characteristics, clinical efficacy, tolerability, and potential for drug interactions in the management of acute myocardial infarction.

Methods

English-language articles for inclusion in this review were identified through searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1966 to April 2001. The search terms used included tenecteplase, myocardial infarction, TNK, and TNK-tPA. Abstracts from recent conferences and symposia were also consulted.

Results

Tenecteplase is a variant of the native tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) molecule that has 14-fold greater fibrin specificity than alteplase, a longer half-life, slower plasma clearance, and 80-fold greater resistance to inhibition by plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1. Its half-life of approximately 18 minutes allows single-bolus administration. In comparative clinical trials, tenecteplase was found to have equivalent efficacy to recombinant tPA (alteplase). The rate of intracranial hemorrhage with tenecteplase was similar to that with alteplase, and tenecteplase was associated with fewer noncerebral complications and less need for blood transfusions.

Conclusions

Tenecteplase appears to be as effective and well tolerated as alteplase in the management of acute myocardial infarction and offers the convenience of single-bolus administration.

### Chinese acute tissue-based imaging selection for lysis in stroke tenecteplase II (CHABLIS-T II): rationale and design [^115zaUXw]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Tenecteplase (TNK) has demonstrated non-inferiority to alteplase in patients who had an acute ischaemic stroke presenting within 4.5hours from symptom onset. The trial is aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of TNK in Chinese patients who had an acute ischaemic stroke with large/medium vessel occlusion in an extended time window.

Methods and Design

Chinese Acute Tissue-Based Imaging Selection for Lysis In Stroke Tenecteplase II (CHABLIS-T II) is a multicentre, prospective, block-randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint, phase IIb study. Eligible patients are 1:1 randomised into two groups: 0.25mg/kg TNK versus best medical management (excluding TNK). The safety and efficacy of 0.25mg/kg TNK are assessed through reperfusion status and presence of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH).

Study Outcomes

The primary outcome is major reperfusion without sICH at 24–48hours after randomisation. Major reperfusion is defined as restoration of blood flow to greater than 50% of the involved ischaemic territory assessed by catheter angiography or repeated perfusion imaging. Secondary outcomes include post-thrombolytic recanalisation, neurological improvements, change in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, haemorrhagic transformation at 24–48hours, systematic bleeding at discharge, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0–1, mRS 0–2, mRS 5–6, mRS distribution and Barthel index at 90 days.

Discussion

CHABLIS-T II will provide important evidence of intravenous thrombolysis with TNK for patients who had an acute stroke in an extended time window.

### Tenecteplase real-world data: a three phase sequential comparison [^1118qRsv]. European Stroke Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Increasing clinical trial and real-world data supports the use of tenecteplase as a viable alternative to alteplase for stroke thrombolysis. – Due to tenecteplase's practical advantages of a single bolus injection, non-inferiority alone is a compelling reason to make the change although some evidence suggests TNK might be superior especially in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO). Several guidelines have now endorsed tenecteplase as an alternative either for all eligible patients or the LVO subset. – The optimal stroke TNK dose is 0.25 mg/kg as there is clinical trial evidence of increased bleeding risk and worse outcomes with 0.4 mg/kg dose. However, real-world observational data are limited by potential temporal or inter-cluster confounding as before-and after or treatment cluster (e.g. by center or stroke type such as LVO vs non-LVO) comparison are the usual employed methodologies. The NZ Central Region Stroke Network was an early universal adopter, but had to revert to alteplase following a global tenecteplase shortage. The resultant three different treatment phases provide a unique opportunity to address potential temporal confounding.

Efficacy endpoints

The primary endpoint is 90 (± 7) days of excellent outcome defined as mRS 0–1. The secondary endpoints of the ANGEL-TNK trial include: Tmax > 6 s at 24 (± 12) hours; infarct core volume change from baseline, at 7 (± 1) days or at discharge assessed with NCCT; 90 (± 7) days mRS (shift analysis); 90 (± 7) day mRS 0–2; 90 (± 7) days mRS 0–3; 36 (± 12) hours NIHSS 0–1 or a reduction of ≥ 10 from baseline NIHSS; 90 (± 7) days EQ-5D-5L score. Follow-up evaluations are performed in-person or via telephone if in-person visit at the investigational site is impractical. All subjects entered into the study had a standard neurological assessment by experienced physicians who were blinded to treatment assignment.

Safety endpoints

The primary safety endpoints include symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 48 hours from randomisation according to the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification. Secondary safety endpoints include: all-cause mortality at 90 days, any intracranial haemorrhage within 48 hours from randomisation according to the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification.

Study assessments

Study assessments will be obtained on the day of randomisation, 24 (± 12) hours, 48(± 12) hours, 7 (± 1) days/discharge, 90 (± 7) days. Imaging follow-up will be obtained at 24 (± 12) hours assessed with NCCT+CTA+CTP or DWI+MRA+PWI as well as at 7 (± 1) days or at discharge assessed with NCCT.

Statistical analysis

The main analyses for the primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted in the per-protocol population. We used Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare continuous variables and χ 2 tests or Fisher's exact test to compare categorical variables. For the primary outcome, a generalised linear model with log link and binomial error distribution with adjustment of study site and occlusion site will be used to calculate the relative risk between the two treatment groups. All statistics will be two-sided with p < 0.049 considered significant.

### Prospective observational cohort study of tenecteplase: results from the Indian registry in ischemic stroke-tenecteplase [^1137RLax]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Tenecteplase has been approved for acute ischemic stroke at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg by the Indian licensing authority. A registry to evaluate the safety of tenecteplase was mandated by the licensing authority. The research aim was to use the Indian Registry in Ischemic Stroke‐Tenecteplase (IRIS‐TNK) to assess the safety and clinical outcomes in patients treated with tenecteplase in routine clinical practice.

Methods and Results

In this prospective, registry‐based observational, cohort study, the primary outcome was proportion of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages at 36 ± 6 hours after treatment. Secondary outcomes included improvement in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score by either ≥ 4 or 8 points or an NIHSS score of 0, assessment of excellent outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0 or 1), functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score 0–2), and Barthel Index score. From October 2017 to May 2023, 1015 patients with a median age of 62 years (interquartile range [IQR, 52–71 years]) were recruited across India. The median baseline NIHSS score was 9 (IQR, 6–13). The proportion of patients with symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2–1.3%), and 10 patients (1% [95% CI, 0.5–1.9%]) died within 3 months. Improvement in NIHSS score by ≥ 4 points or an NIHSS score of 0 at 24 hours was observed in 34.4% (95% CI, 31.5–37.4%) of patients. An excellent outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0 or 1) at 3 months was achieved in 55.4% (95% CI, 52.3–58.5%) of patients.

Conclusions

These results confirm that tenecteplase at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg is safe in routine clinical practice, when administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset.

### Prospective observational cohort study of tenecteplase: results from the Indian registry in ischemic stroke-tenecteplase [^113YdMUL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics

The baseline characteristics of the patients in the cohort lost to follow‐up (n = 38, 3.7%) are reported in Table S2. A higher proportion of patients with hypertension (82%), severe stroke (31.6%), and thrombolytic therapy administered beyond 4.5 hours (7.9%) were part of the loss to follow‐up group compared with the IRIS‐TNK study cohort from which complete data were available.

A total of 737 (72.6%), 232 (22.8%), and 46 (4.5%) patients were given tenecteplase within 3 hours, between 3 and 4.5 hours, and beyond 4.5 hours of symptom onset, respectively. The small proportion of patients (4.5%) who reported stroke symptom onset beyond 4.5 hours were administered tenecteplase based on magnetic resonance imaging perfusion‐diffusion mismatch by study investigators. The baseline and demographic data of these different subgroups are summarized in Table S3.

Clinical Outcomes

Symptomatic ICH within 2 days of thrombolysis occurred in 6 patients (0.6% [95% CI, 0.2–1.3]) (Table 2). Of these 6 cases, 3 (50%) died during the study. Asymptomatic ICH occurred in 13 (1.3% [95% CI, 0.7–2.2]) patients, and 1 (0.1% [95% CI, 0–0.6]) case each of hematuria and gum bleeding was observed. Two (0.2% [95% CI, 0–0.7]) cases of recurrent stroke occurred in the study. A total of 10 deaths (1% [95% CI, 0.5–1.9]) were reported during the follow‐up period of 3 months. Of these 10 deaths, 3 (30%) were considered to be related to the tenecteplase treatment by study investigators.

### Tenecteplase thrombolytic therapy for acute ischaemic stroke in China: a real-world, multicentre, retrospective, controlled study [^1167rJWh]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Tenecteplase (TNK) offers logistical advantages in stroke thrombolytic therapy with its single bolus administration compared with alteplase. We aim to investigate the real-world evidence regarding its safety and effectiveness in China.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study on patients receiving alteplase or TNK for acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) within 4.5hours of onset between 1 March 2019 and 1 October 2023, from 18 stroke centres in China. Using propensity score matching (PSM), TNK-treated patients were matched 1:1 with alteplase-treated patients. The primary outcome was the rate of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH) within 72 hours post-thrombolysis. Secondary outcomes comprised the rate of parenchymal haemorrhage type 2, any intracranial haemorrhage, any systematic bleeding and mortality at 90 days, as well as 24-hour National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), early neurological improvement at 24 hours, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) shift, percentage of mRS 0–1 and mRS 0–2 at 90 days.

Results

We identified 1113 patients with AIS who received TNK and 2360 patients who received alteplase. Following PSM, 1113 TNK-treated patients with AIS were matched to 1113 patients treated with alteplase. No significant differences were observed in rates of sICH (1.8% vs 1.98%, p = 0.864) or other safety outcomes. Moreover, TNK-treated patients demonstrated a lower rate of any intracranial haemorrhage (OR: 0.51, 95%CI: 0.31 to 0.86, p = 0.012). A higher proportion of patients achieving early neurological improvement at 24 hours (OR: 1.76, 95%CI: 1.48 to 2.09, p = 0.000), better 90-day mRS (OR: 0.67, 95%CI: 0.57 to 0.79, p = 0.000) as well as higher percentages of 90-day mRS 0–1 (OR: 1.27, 95%CI: 1.05 to 1.54, p = 0.012) and mRS 0–2 (OR: 1.41, 95%CI: 1.14 to 1.75, p = 0.001) compared with alteplase.

Conclusions

Thrombolysis with TNK is not associated with an increased risk of sICH, and may result in better early neurological improvement and 90-day functional outcomes compared with alteplase in patients with AIS.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful endovascular recanalisation in patients with acute posterior circulation arterial occlusion (ATTENTION-IA): multicentre randomised controlled trial [^114MuWFo]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The results of this multicentre randomised trial suggested that intra-arterial tenecteplase use after successful endovascular treatment resulted in similar functional outcomes and mortality at 90 days to endovascular treatment alone in patients presenting with acute intracranial occlusions of the posterior circulation in the vertebral artery, basilar artery, or P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery. The rates of the primary endpoint of excellent outcome (modified Rankin scale score 0 or 1) at 90 days were not statistically significantly different between the two groups. The risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was numerically higher in patients who received intra-arterial tenecteplase.

The results for the secondary outcomes and subgroup and sensitivity analyses were consistent with the result for the primary outcome. All multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, pre-stroke modified Rankin scale score, time from onset to randomisation, hypertension, and baseline NIHSS score. Subgroup analyses did not suggest a statistically significant difference between study arms by time to endovascular treatment, stroke subtype, or whether intravenous thrombolysis was or was not administered before endovascular treatment.

Comparison with other studies

We chose tenecteplase over alteplase as the thrombolytic agent to administer after thrombectomy. Its enhanced fibrin specificity and prolonged half life make tenecteplase a more suitable single bolus option than alteplase after endovascular thrombectomy. The tenecteplase versus alteplase before thrombectomy for ischemic stroke (EXTEND-IA TNK) trial showed the superiority of tenecteplase over alteplase in recanalisation of acute large vessel occlusion before thrombectomy. A retrospective analysis comparing 33 patients who received intra-arterial tenecteplase with 48 patients who received intra-arterial alteplase suggested a trend towards better clinical outcomes with tenecteplase, with no discernible difference in haemorrhage rates between the two thrombolytic agents. The phase IIb adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase following mechanical thrombectomy pilot trial (ALLY) of 20 patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion and had a final eTICI grade of 2b or 2c not amenable to further mechanical retrieval showed intra-arterial tenecteplase (1.5–4.5 mg) to be a safe adjunct to thrombectomy, with one (5%) symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage event. Moreover, a series of acute stroke trials have shown non-inferior or even superior angiographic and clinical outcomes from intravenous tenecteplase use compared with intravenous alteplase.

### Initial clinical results of tenecteplase (TNK) in catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy [^111Yb9Cp]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the safety and immediate efficacy of 2 different doses of tenecteplase (TNK) in peripheral catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy of arterial occlusions and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Methods

Over a 20-month period, 63 nonconsecutive patients underwent catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy with either 0.25 mg/h or 0.50 mg/h of TNK in a nonrandomized, open-label study. Of these, 55 patients (60 limbs) were treated for DVT (36 limbs in 16 men and 15 women; mean age 41 years, range 21–73) or peripheral arterial occlusions (24 limbs in 16 men and 8 women; mean age 63 years, range 32–91). The primary endpoints were major bleeding complications and angiographic reduction in clot burden.

Results

The mean duration of infusion was 18 ± 4 hours in patients with arterial occlusions and 30 ± 13 in those with DVT. Twenty-one (87.5%) patients with occlusive disease had marked or complete lysis of clot. Thirty (83.3%) limbs with DVT had either marked or complete resolution of thrombus. There were 4 (7.3%) episodes of minor bleeding with 1 (1.8%) major hemorrhagic event. Fibrinogen levels dropped by an average of 23%.

Conclusions

Preliminary evidence suggests that TNK doses of 0.25 mg/h to 0.50 mg/h appear to be safe and effective. The potential benefits of TNK therapy warrant further investigation.

### Efficacy and safety outcomes of tenecteplase versus alteplase for thrombolysis of acute ischemic stroke: a meta-analysis of 9 randomized controlled trials [^115oWfPK]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In recent years, Tenecteplase (TNK), a genetically modified variant of alteplase, has been verified as a potential substitute for alteplase in the reperfusion therapy of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Given the emergence of new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of this subject, a meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the present comparative evidence regarding the efficacy and safety outcomes of TNK and alteplase in thrombolysis for AIS.

Methods

Following predefined inclusion criteria, we searched the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. RCTs satisfying our inclusion criteria were selected for meta-analysis. Outcome indicators were categorized into efficacy outcomes (early vessel recanalization, excellent recovery, good recovery and early neurological improvement) and safety outcomes (poor recovery, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, parenchymal hemorrhage type 2(PH2) post thrombolysis, and mortality). We extracted data on efficacy outcomes and safety outcomes for patients with AIS in the TNK group at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg and the alteplase group at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg, and expressed the relative risks between the 2 groups as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the Mantel-Haenszel method. For further insight, we performed a network meta-analysis using a Bayesian framework to compare different doses of TNK (0.1, 0.25, 0.32, and 0.4 mg/kg) with alteplase (0.9 mg/kg).

Results

A total of 2994 patients in 9 RCTs comparing efficacy and safety outcomes in patients with AIS treated with TNK and alteplase were included. In a pairwise analysis of TNK 0.25 mg/kg and alteplase 0.9 mg/kg, regarding efficacy outcomes, the aggregated results show that TNK 0.25 mg/kg statistically significant increased early vessel recanalization (N = 368, TNK vs. alteplase, OR: 2.07,95%CI: [1.19,3.59], I² = 0%) and excellent recovery (N = 3548, TNK vs. alteplase, OR: 1.15,95%CI: [1.01,1.32], I² = 0%). There was no significant difference in good recovery (N = 3486, TNK vs. alteplase, OR: 1.38,95%CI: [0.89,2.15], I² = 84%) or early neurological improvement (N = 1686, TNK vs. alteplase, OR: 1.06,95%CI: [0.87,1.28], I² = 24%) between the TNK 0.25 mg/kg group and the alteplase 0.9 mg/kg group. In the safety outcomes, pooled results showed no significant difference in poor recovery (N = 3548, TNK vs. alteplase, OR: 0.94,95%CI: [0.81,1.10], I² = 0%) and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (N = 3567, TNK vs. alteplase, OR: 1.06,95%CI: [0.70,1.60], I² = 0%) and PH2(N = 3103, TNK vs. alteplase, OR: 1.26,95%CI:[0.39,4.07], I² = 56%)and mortality (N = 3447, TNK vs. alteplase, OR: 0.99,95%CI: [0.80,1.23], I² = 33%) between the TNK group and the alteplase group. In a network meta-analysis, competing treatments were not significantly different from one another (TNK 0.1 mg/kg, TNK 0.25 mg/kg, TNK 0.32 mg/kg, TNK 0.4 mg/kg, alteplase 0.9 mg/kg) in either efficacy outcomes or safety outcomes.

Conclusion

In this analysis of 9 RCTs in patients with AIS, TNK 0.25 mg/kg was comparable to alteplase 0.9 mg/kg from the perspective of efficacy outcomes and safety outcomes after thrombolysis within 4.5 h of AIS occurrence.

### A pilot dose-escalation safety study of tenecteplase in acute ischemic stroke [^1118xH8Z]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) is the only approved treatment in acute ischemic stroke. However, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) occurs in 6.4% of patients treated with rtPA and limits its use. Tenecteplase (TNK) is a modified form of rtPA, with longer half-life and greater fibrin specificity. Patients after myocardial infarction had fewer systemic hemorrhages when treated with TNK compared with rtPA. This open-label, dose-escalation safety study was conducted to develop initial experience with TNK in the treatment of ischemic stroke.

Methods

Eligible patients were treated with an intravenous bolus infusion of TNK within 3 hours of stroke onset. The dose escalation was conducted in tiers of 25 patients, starting at 0.1 mg/kg, to a planned maximum of 0.6 mg/kg. The primary endpoint was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours of treatment. All patients were followed-up for 3 months.

Results

Eighty-eight (88) patients were treated in 4 dosing tiers. In the first 3 tiers (0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg/kg) of 25 patients each, no symptomatic and 2 (8%), 8 (32%), and 7 (28%) asymptomatic ICHs occurred. Enrollment into the fourth tier at 0.5 mg/kg was closed after 2 of 13 patients (15%) had symptomatic and 3 (23%) had asymptomatic ICHs. Overall, modified Rankin scores at 3 months were similar to those of historical controls treated with rtPA and not significantly different between treatment groups.

Conclusions

TNK doses of 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg are safe in ischemic stroke. Future trials are needed to compare the effect of TNK on neurological outcome and safety as compared with rtPA.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous tenecteplase before endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke: the multicenter, randomized, BRIDGE-TNK trial protocol [^114DNkSD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Safety End Points

The following are the safety endpoint of this trial.
Any radiologic intracranial hemorrhage rate within 48 hours.
Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate within 48 hours (Heidelberg classification).
Mortality at 90 ± 14 days.
Procedure‐related complications such as arterial perforation, iatrogenic arterial dissection, arterial access site hematoma, and retroperitoneal hematoma.
Serious adverse events.

Data and Safety Monitoring Board

The independent data and safety monitoring board is composed of 3 specialists in the fields of stroke, neurothrombectomy, and biostatistics, all of whom do not participate in the BRIDGE‐TNK trial and are external to the study sponsors. The data and safety monitoring board will meet once a year to monitor the progress of the trial. The data and safety monitoring board will review the frequency (percentage) of serious adverse events and provide recommendations on whether to suspend, continue, or stop the trial.

Sample Size Estimates

Based on 2 Chinese randomized controlled trials of direct mechanical thrombectomy for acute large‐vessel occlusive stroke, it is assumed that the proportion of functional independence in the thrombectomy‐alone group is 41%. Combining the results of 3 randomized controlled trials of intravenous tenecteplase followed by EVT in patients with stroke with LVO, we hypothesize that the proportion of functional independence in the tenecteplase‐plus‐thrombectomy group will be 54%. Up to 462 (231 patients per arm) patients would provide 80% power at a 2‐sided α = 0.05 significance level. The sample size will be inflated to 544 (272 patients per arm) to account for a possible attrition rate of 15% for protocol violations, treatment failure, and loss to follow‐up. This calculation was conducted using PASS software version 15.0 (NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, UT).

### Tenecteplase-tissue-type plasminogen activator evaluation for minor ischemic stroke with proven occlusion [^1161b15H]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Minor stroke and transient ischemic attack with an intracranial occlusion are associated with neurological deterioration and disability. Tenecteplase (TNK-tissue-type plasminogen activator) compared with alteplase is easier to administer, has a longer half-life, higher fibrin specificity, possibly a lower rate of intracranial hemorrhage, and may be an ideal thrombolytic agent in this population.

Methods

TNK-Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator Evaluation for Minor Ischemic Stroke With Proven Occlusion (TEMPO-1) was a multicenter, prospective, uncontrolled, TNK-tissue-type plasminogen activator dose-escalation, safety, and feasibility trial. Patients with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≤ 5 within 12 hours of symptom onset, intracranial arterial occlusion on computed tomographic angiography and absence of well-evolved infarction were eligible. Fifty patients were enrolled; 25 patients at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, and 25 patients at 0.25 mg/kg. Primary outcome was the rate of drug-related serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included recanalization and 90-day neurological outcome (modified Rankin Scale, 0–1).

Results

Median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 2.5 (interquartile range, 1), and median age was 71 (interquartile range, 22) years. There were no drug-related serious adverse events in tier 1. In tier 2, there was 1 symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.01–20.0). Stroke progression occurred in 6% of cases. Overall, 66% had excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale, 0–1) at 90 days. Recanalization rates were high; 0.1 mg/kg (39% complete and 17% partial), 0.25 mg/kg (52% complete and 9% partial). Complete recanalization was significantly related to excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale, 0–1) at 90 days (relative risk, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–2.5; P = 0.026).

Conclusions

Administration of TNK-tissue-type plasminogen activator in minor stroke with intracranial occlusion is both feasible and safe. A larger randomized controlled trial is needed to prove that this treatment is efficacious.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous tenecteplase before endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke: the multicenter, randomized, BRIDGE-TNK trial protocol [^112TyVB7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Six randomized trials have not detected a difference between intravenous alteplase plus endovascular thrombectomy and endovascular thrombectomy alone in stroke. Tenecteplase, a recombinant human tenecteplase tissue‐type plasminogen activator, is a genetically modified variant of alteplase. It is unclear whether the outcomes are different if alteplase is replaced with tenecteplase. This trial aims to determine whether intravenous tenecteplase within 4.5 hours of time last known well confers benefit in patients with acute ischemic stroke with large‐vessel occlusion who undergo endovascular thrombectomy.

Methods

BRIDGE‐TNK (Thrombectomy With Versus Without rhTNK‐tPA in Stroke) is an investigator‐initiated, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open‐label trial with blinded end point evaluation conducted at 40 thrombectomy‐capable centers in China. This trial will randomize 544 patients with intravenous thrombolysis–eligible stroke (272 in each arm) with large‐vessel occlusion within 4.5 hours of last known well to receive bridging intravenous tenecteplase with endovascular thrombectomy (tenecteplase‐plus‐thrombectomy group) or endovascular thrombectomy alone (thrombectomy‐alone group). The primary outcome is the proportion of patients achieving functional independence, defined as a score of 0 to 2 on the modified Rankin Scale, at 90 days. Safety will be assessed via symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage at 48 hours and death at 90 days.

Conclusions

BRIDGE‐TNK will provide important data on the role of intravenous tenecteplase before endovascular thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke with large‐vessel occlusion who can be treated within 4.5 hours of last known well.

### Tenecteplase vs alteplase before endovascular therapy in basilar artery occlusion [^114VGExX]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy of tenecteplase (TNK), a genetically modified variant of alteplase with greater fibrin specificity and longer half-life than alteplase, prior to endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO).

Methods

To determine whether TNK is associated with better reperfusion rates than alteplase prior to EVT in BAO, clinical and procedural data of consecutive patients with BAO from the Basilar Artery Treatment and Management (BATMAN) registry and the Tenecteplase vs Alteplase before Endovascular Therapy for Ischemic Stroke (EXTEND-IA TNK) trial were retrospectively analyzed. Reperfusion > 50% or absence of retrievable thrombus at the time of the initial angiogram was evaluated.

Results

We included 110 patients with BAO treated with IV thrombolysis prior to EVT (mean age 69 [SD 14] years; median NIH Stroke Scale score 16 [interquartile range (IQR) 7–32]). Nineteen patients were thrombolysed with TNK (0.25 mg/kg or 0.40 mg/kg) and 91 with alteplase (0.9 mg/kg). Reperfusion > 50% occurred in 26% (n = 5/19) of patients thrombolysed with TNK vs 7% (n = 6/91) thrombolysed with alteplase (risk ratio 4.0, 95% confidence interval 1.3–12; p = 0.02), despite shorter thrombolysis to arterial puncture time in the TNK-treated patients (48 [IQR 40–71] minutes) vs alteplase-treated patients (110 [IQR 51–185] minutes; p = 0.004). No difference in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was observed (0/19 [0%] TNK, 1/91 [1%] alteplase; p = 0.9).

Conclusions

TNK may be associated with an increased rate of reperfusion in comparison with alteplase before EVT in BAO. Randomized controlled trials to compare TNK with alteplase in patients with BAO are warranted.

Clinicaltrialsgov Identifiers

NCT02388061 and NCT03340493.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class III evidence that TNK leads to higher reperfusion rates in comparison with alteplase prior to EVT in patients with BAO.

### Safety and efficacy of tenecteplase in older patients with large vessel occlusion: a pooled analysis of the EXTEND-IA TNK trials [^1175gsTk]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Detailed study of tenecteplase (TNK) in patients older than 80 years is limited. The objective of our study was to assess the safety and efficacy of TNK at 0.25 and 0.40 mg/kg doses in patients older than 80 years with large vessel occlusion.

Methods

We performed a pooled analysis of the EXTEND-IA TNK randomized controlled trials (n = 502). Patients were adults presenting with ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid, middle cerebral, or basilar artery presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. We compared the treatment effect of TNK 0.25 mg/kg, TNK 0.40 mg/kg, and alteplase 0.90 mg/kg, stratifying for patient age (> 80 years). Outcomes evaluated include 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, all-cause mortality, and symptomatic ICH. Treatment effect was adjusted for baseline NIH Stroke Score, age, and time from symptom onset to puncture via mixed effects proportional odds and logistic regression models.

Results

In patients > 80 years (n = 137), TNK 0.25 mg/kg was associated with improved 90-day mRS (median 3 vs 4, adjusted common odds ratio (acOR) 2.70, 95% CI 1.23–5.94) and reduced mortality (acOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13–0.91) vs 0.40 mg/kg. TNK 0.25 mg/kg was associated with improved 90-day mRS (median 3 vs 4, acOR 2.28, 95% CI 1.03–5.05) vs alteplase. No difference in 90-day mRS or mortality was detected between alteplase and TNK 0.40 mg/kg. Symptomatic ICH was observed in 4 patients treated with TNK 0.40 mg/kg, 1 patient treated with alteplase, and 0 patients treated with TNK 0.25 mg/kg. In patients ≤ 80 years, no differences in 90-day mRS, mortality, or symptomatic ICH were observed among TNK 0.25 mg/kg, alteplase, and TNK 0.40 mg/kg.

Discussion

TNK 0.25 mg/kg was associated with improved 90-day mRS and lower mortality in patients older than 80 years. No differences among the doses were observed in younger patients.

Trial Registration Information

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class II evidence that tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg given before endovascular therapy in patients > 80 years old with large vessel occlusion stroke is associated with better functional outcomes at 90 days and reduced mortality when compared to tenecteplase 0.40 mg/kg or alteplase 0.90 mg/kg.

### Acr-asnr-sir-snis practice parameter for the performance of endovascular thrombectomy and revascularization in acute stroke [^1132mxzB]. SIR (2024). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke endovascular therapy — blood pressure parameters state that the recommended BP target post-IV tPA or IV Tenecteplase (TNK) is systolic BP < 185 mmHg and diastolic BP < 110 mmHg for 24 hours, and after successful endovascular treatment (mTICI 2b/c and 3) it seems reasonable to consider lower BP parameters despite the lack of evidence because higher BP parameters may increase the theoretical risk of hemorrhage.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous tenecteplase compared to alteplase before mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke: a meta-analysis [^116C4KMQ]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence from previous meta-analyses in AIS patients consistently suggests that the efficacy and safety of TNK is not inferior to ALT. However, given the substantial impact of MT on AIS outcome, many studies have intentionally excluded patients undergoing MT from their study cohorts. As a result, patients receiving MT were underrepresented in meta-analyses. Nonetheless, bridging thrombolysis is a common treatment in AIS. Therefore, it is clinically important to assess the efficacy and safety of the use of TNK and ALT in MT patients. Our meta-analysis, despite detecting no significant impact on functional independence at 90 days, showed that TNK treatment was associated with a lower mortality within 90 days than ALT treatment. The lower mortality rate observed in the TNK group compared to the ALT group can be attributed primarily to higher recanalization rates with similar risks of hemorrhage. Additional RCTs will need to replicate this finding.

Although the pooled analysis revealed no significant difference in rates of sICH and overall ICH following thrombolysis with TNK and ALT, the subgroup analysis for ICH within four non-randomized trials demonstrated a higher ICH incidence in the ALT than TNK group. Several factors could influence the risk of brain hemorrhage. Firstly, TNK's higher fibrin specificity may reduce hemorrhage risks by limiting circulating plasminogen activation and degradation of fibrinogen. Additionally, the absence of data on antiplatelet use during or after MT could also impact ICH rates. As a potential mechanism, ALT might elevate pro-inflammatory signals in the ischemic brain, thereby contributing to ICH via blood–brain barrier disruption. The occurrence of ICH remains a significant concern in ALT treated AIS patients. As a genetically modified ALT variant, TNK represents a potential alternative. The mechanisms underlying the safety of TNK deserves attention in AIS patients undergoing MT.

Besides TNK, reteplase has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Although TNK has been increasingly studied in ischemic stroke, studies of the safety and efficacy of reteplase in ischemic stroke remain limited. Compared with TNK and ALT, the fibrinolytic speed of reteplase is slower, and the risk of ICH may be lower. The results of a recently published phase II RCT showed similar mortality, sICH and functional outcome at 90 days in AIS patients for reteplase and ALT, but the sample size was small. Further studies on the benefits and risks of reteplase in larger trials are needed.

### Tenecteplase for the treatment of pediatric arterial ischemic stroke: a safety surveillance report [^111Rjxfc]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Intravenous tenecteplase (TNK) is increasingly used to treat adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke, but the risk profile of TNK in childhood stroke is unknown. This study aims to prospectively gather safety data regarding TNK administration in children.

Methods

Since December 2023, a monthly email survey was sent to participants recruited from the International Pediatric Stroke Study and Pediatric Neurocritical Care Research Group querying recent experience with TNK in childhood stroke. Limited demographic, safety, and outcome data were collected in a secure REDCap database. Detailed clinical data were not collected.

Results

Eleven children were reported to have received TNK between February 2023 and January 2024. Ten were adolescents (13–17 years old), and 1 was between 5 and 12 years old. TNK was given at an outside facility before transfer to the reporting facility in 7 cases. Final diagnosis was stroke in 8 cases and stroke mimic in 3 cases. No major safety concerns or TNK-related intracranial hemorrhages on follow-up imaging were reported.

Discussion

Our initial data suggest that TNK may be safe in childhood arterial ischemic stroke. Strategically designed prospective studies are needed to further define safety, optimal dosage, and efficacy of TNK in acute pediatric stroke.

### Special issue: abstracts of the 11Congress of the European Academy of Neurology, helsinki, Finland [^114bqYEo]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and aims: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. While alteplase has been widely used for acute management, recent clinical trials suggest that tenecteplase (TNK) may offer improved clinical outcomes. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of TNK compared with alteplase.

Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library from inception to October 2024 to identify randomized controlled trials that compared TNK at 0.25 mg/kg dosage with alteplase. Data about clinical outcomes was extracted from both groups and assessed by generating forest plots using the random‐effects model and pooling odds ratios (ORs).

Results: A total of 11 RCTs with 7,546 patients were included in the analysis. TNK showed statistically significant improvement in excellent functional outcome (mRS 0‐1) compared with alteplase (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.03‐1.25). No statistically significant difference was observed for good functional outcome (mRS 0‐2) (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.9‐1.25), early neurological improvement (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.93‐1.26), all‐cause death (OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.08‐1.22), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.84‐1.59) and poor functional outcome (mRS = 4‐6) (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.79‐1.14).

FIGURE 1 Forest plots for (A) Excellent functional outcome (B) Good functional outcome.

FIGURE 2 Forest plots for (A) All‐cause death (B) symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

FIGURE 3 Forest plots for (A) Poor functional outcome (B) Early neurological improvement.

Conclusion: In patients with acute ischemic stroke, TNK demonstrated a significant advantage over alteplase in achieving excellent functional outcomes. The incidence of early neurological improvement, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, all‐cause death, and poor functional outcome remained comparable across the two groups.

### Comprehensive review of tenecteplase for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke [^115bQ5D7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Stroke is the second‐leading cause of death globally and ischemic stroke constituted more than 60% of all incident strokes in 2019. Intravenous alteplase thrombolysis was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1996, and has become the first‐line treatment for ischemic stroke due to its high‐quality evidence for nearly 30 years, but there are concerns including hemorrhagic complications, restricted fibrinolytic efficacy, and achieving arterial recanalization in less than 40% of patients. Tenecteplase (TNK–tissue‐type plasminogen activator) has a longer half‐life, with more fibrin specificity and possibly a lower rate of intracranial hemorrhage than alteplase, which may make it a better thrombolytic agent. When compared with alteplase, tenecteplase is easier to administer, which reduces the potential for medication errors, dose interruption, and time delays. This improved ease of administration also facilitates interhospital transfer.

### Adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful endovascular thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion stroke (POST-TNK): study rationale and design [^1175ML9o]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Adjunct intra-arterial alteplase has been shown to potentially improve clinical outcomes in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke who have undergone successful endovascular thrombectomy. Tenecteplase, known for its enhanced fibrin specificity and extended activity duration, could potentially enhance outcomes in stroke patients after successful reperfusion when used as an adjunct intra-arterial therapy.

Aim

To explore the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful endovascular thrombectomy in patients with LVO stroke.

Sample Size

To randomize 498 participants 1:1 to receive intra-arterial tenecteplase or no intra-arterial adjunctive thrombolysis therapy.

Methods and Design

An investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, open-label, blind-endpoint multicenter clinical trial. Eligible patients with anterior circulation LVO stroke presenting within 24h from symptom onset (time last known well) and excellent to complete reperfusion (expanded Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) scale 2c-3) at endovascular thrombectomy are planned to be randomized.

Outcomes

The primary outcome is freedom from disability (modified Rankin Scale, mRS, of 0–1) at 90days. The primary safety outcomes are mortality through 90days and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 48h.

Discussion

The POST-TNK trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of intra-arterial tenecteplase in patients with LVO stroke and excellent to complete reperfusion.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses of efficacy outcomes will be performed in the modified intention‐to‐treat data set and will be adjusted for age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score, occlusion site, and time from last known well to randomization. The primary analysis of BRIDGE‐TNK will compare the rate of functional independence between the 2 groups. For the primary outcome and other binary outcomes, differences between the 2 arms will be analyzed with the use of modified Poisson regression with robust error estimation. Analysis of the European Quality Five‐Dimension Five‐Level scale score and mRS shift (the full range of the mRS is considered) will be performed using linear regression and ordinal logistic regression, respectively. Analyses of safety outcomes will be conducted on the basis of the safety data set. Safety outcomes in both groups will be reported as frequency counts and percentages. Secondary analyses will be analyzed for the same primary outcome in the following subgroups: by age (using median age threshold), sex, time to randomization, stroke pathogenesis (cardioembolic versus large‐artery atherosclerosis versus unknown), site of arterial occlusion, baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score, and patients receiving angioplasty or stenting. Unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios, mean differences, and common odds ratios will be presented with their corresponding 95% CIs. The significance level for all analyses is a 2‐sided α = 0.05. Statistical analysis will be conducted on the SAS 9.4 system with Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### Tenecteplase, 0.4 mg / kg, in moderate and severe acute ischemic stroke: a pooled analysis of NOR-TEST and NOR-TEST 2A [^115CN15j]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 3
Distribution of outcome and hemorrhage based on severity of stroke on admission in the per‐protocol analysis.

ALT indicates alteplase; ICH, intracranial hemorrhage; mild stroke, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≤ 5; moderate stroke, NIHSS score 6 to 14; mRS, modified Rankin Scale; OR, odds ratio; severe stroke, NIHSS score ≥ 15; sICH, symptomatic ICH; and TNK, tenecteplase.

Compared with the main analysis, there was no significant change in the primary or secondary outcomes after exclusion of patients with unknown stroke onset (Table S2). In the separate analysis of patients undergoing endovascular treatment, patients treated with alteplase achieved more often major neurologic improvement (OR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.12–0.93]; P = 0.035) and experienced less often any ICH (OR, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.7–14.65]; P = 0.003) (Table S3).

In the pooled population with moderate and severe stroke, the ITT analysis showed a trend toward higher rates of any ICH and sICH in patients treated with tenecteplase (OR, 1.53 [95% CI, 0.99–2.66]; P = 0.051 and OR, 2.51 [95% CI, 0.98–6.44]; P = 0.054, respectively). In the alteplase arm, ordinal shift analysis of mRS at 3 months showed better functional outcome (OR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.18–2.18]; P = 0.002) as well as better functional outcome at 3 months using mRS cutoff 0 to 2 (OR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.33–0.78]; P = 0.002). Major neurologic improvement at 24 hours, expressed by NIHSS score, was more common in the alteplase arm (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.49–0.99]; P = 0.05). Mortality at 3 months was more common in the tenecteplase arm (OR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.28–4.59]; P = 0.007) (Table 3).

### Intravenous tenecteplase for acute ischemic stroke between 4.5 and 6 h of onset (EXIT-BT2): rationale and design [^111dRaoi]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

To date, the benefit of intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients without advanced neuroimaging selection is confined to within 4.5h of onset. Our phase II EXIT-BT (Extending the tIme window of Thrombolysis by ButylphThalide up to 6h after onset) trial suggested the safety, feasibility, and potential benefit of intravenous tenecteplase (TNK) in AIS between 4.5 and 6h of onset. The EXIT-BT2 trial is a pivotal study undertaken to confirm or refute this signal.

Aim

To investigate the efficacy and safety of TNK for AIS between 4.5 and 6h of onset with or without endovascular treatment. Sample size estimates:A maximum of 1440 patients are required to test the superiority hypothesis with 80% power according to a two-sided 0.05 level of significance, stratified by age, sex, history of diabetes, location of vessel occlusion, baseline National Institute of Health stroke scale score, stroke etiology, and plan for endovascular treatment.

Design

EXIT-BT2 is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded assessment of endpoint (PROBE), and multi-center study. Eligible AIS patients between 4.5 and 6h of onset are randomly assigned 1:1 into a TNK group or control group. The TNK group will receive TNK (0.25mg/kg, a single bolus over 5–10s, maximum 25mg). The control group will receive standard medical care in compliance with national guidelines for acute ischemic stroke. Both groups will receive standard stroke care from randomization to 90days after stroke onset according to national guidelines.

Outcome

The primary efficacy endpoint is excellent functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score 0–1 at 90days after randomization, while the primary safety endpoint is symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, defined as National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score increase ⩾4 caused by intracranial hemorrhage within 24 (-6/+12)h after randomization.

Conclusions

The results of EXIT-BT2 may determine whether intravenous TNK has a favorable risk/benefit profile in AIS between 4.5 and 6h of onset.

Prevention of hematoma expansion in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) — Healthcare providers should weigh ischemic risk against hemorrhage severity and expansion risk to set blood pressure goals; with incomplete recanalization, higher blood pressure targets may be necessary to maintain flow and reduce infarct growth, whereas with full recanalization stricter blood pressure control may be reasonable, though safety and efficacy require further investigation.

### Evidence that tenecteplase is noninferior to alteplase for acute ischemic stroke: meta-analysis of 5 randomized trials [^1145VUx3]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- TNK (tenecteplase), a newer fibrinolytic agent, has practical delivery advantages over ALT (alteplase) that would make it a useful agent if noninferior in acute ischemic stroke treatment outcome. Accordingly, the most recent US American Heart Association/American Stroke Association acute ischemic stroke guideline recognized TNK as an alternative to ALT, but only based on informal consideration, rather than formal meta-analysis, of completed randomized control trials. Methods- Systematic literature search and formal meta-analysis were conducted per PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), adapted to noninferiority analysis. The primary outcome of freedom from disability (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–1) outcome at 3 m, and additional efficacy and safety outcomes, were analyzed. Results- Systematic search identified 5 trials enrolling 1585 patients (828 TNK, 757 ALT). Across all trials, mean age was 70.8, 58.5% male, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale mean 7.0, and time from last known well to treatment start mean 148 minutes. All ALT patients received standard 0.9 mg/kg dosing, while TNK dosing was 0.1 mg/kg in 6.8%, 0.25 mg/kg in 24.6%, and 0.4 mg/kg in 68.6%. For the primary end point, crude cumulative rates of disability-free (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–1) 3 m outcome were TNK 57.9% versus ALT 55.4%. Informal, random-effects meta-analysis, the risk difference was 4% (95% CI, -1% to 8%). The lower 95% CI bound fell well within the prespecified noninferiority margin. Similar results were seen for the additional efficacy end points: functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–2): crude TNK 71.9% versus ALT 70.5%, risk difference 2% (95% CI, -3% to 6%); and modified Rankin Scale shift analysis, common odds ratio 1.21 (95% CI, 0.93–1.57). For safety end points, lower event rates reduced power, but point estimates were also consistent with noninferiority Conclusions- Accumulated clinical trial data provides strong evidence that TNK is noninferior to ALT in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. These findings provide formal support for the recent guideline recommendation to consider TNK an alternative to ALT.

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase before stroke thrombectomy: outcomes after system-wide transitions in Pennsylvania [^1125iUi3]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Randomized controlled trial data established intravenous tenecteplase (TNK) non-inferior to intravenous alteplase (TPA) in acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 h of symptom-onset. Real-world clinical experience demonstrated that replacing TPA with TNK in acute ischemic stroke treatment appears safe and effective. Many stroke systems in the United States have switched or are considering switching from TPA to TNK based on the recent trial data, guideline recommendations as well as the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic advantages of TNK over TPA. Notably, TNK features a single bolus injection, which results in practical clinical advantages and improved workflow times. The European Stroke Organisation (ESO) has issued a strong recommendation favoring TNK over TPA for thrombolysis-eligible patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke within 4.5 h of stroke-onset (moderate quality of evidence). The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines suggest that the use of TNK over TPA may be reasonable (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Despite the recent thrombolytic landscape change, U.S. multicenter real-world data from patients receiving TNK prior to emergent endovascular treatment for LVO stroke is lacking. Here, we assessed the safety and effectiveness of switching to TNK before endovascular treatment of LVO stroke.

### Platelet-targeted thrombolysis for treatment of acute ischemic stroke [^1111pxC8]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is one of the leading causes of disability and death worldwide. Thrombolytic therapy, a long-established intervention for the treatment of AIS, involves the systemic administration of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Thrombolysis offers stroke patients several advantages, mainly in its simplicity and "real-life" applicability compared with invasive endovascular clot retrieval that requires expert personnel and resources not readily available, particularly for rural and remote populations. However, the current clinical regimen of tPA therapy faces several limitations such as a narrow therapeutic window (4.5 hours poststroke onset), and a short circulating half-life (4–6 minutes), that require tPA to be infused over a 1-hour period. tPA also increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation, disrupts the blood–brain barrier (BBB), and possibly exacerbates immunosuppression. Compounding these limitations is that tPA is associated with low rates of recanalization (∼40%), which is often attributed to the platelet-rich composition of arterial thrombi.

Platelet-rich clots, in addition to minimizing the accessibility of tPA to fibrinand disrupting its fibrin-dependent mode of plasminogen activation (PA), are also increased in rigidity. Furthermore, platelets secrete plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and, hence, platelet-rich thrombi possess an overwhelming inhibitory capacity of any PA. Collectively, these traits contribute to the thrombolytic resistance frequently observed in platelet-rich clots that is particularly relevant in the context of tPA treatment of AIS.

Tenecteplase (TNK-tPA), a genetically modified, full-length tPA variant with a longer half-life (∼20 minutes) and bolus administration, represents a new benchmark for thrombolysis. However, there are inconsistent reports regarding its superior efficacy and safety profiles compared with its parental enzyme.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase during thrombectomy for acute stroke (BRETIS-TNK II): rationale and design [^117WzAsF]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the design of this trial, two major concerns were considered in advance: the dose of intra-arterial TNK and the sample size of the trial. A study on intra-arterial TNK for the treatment of AIS indicated that administration of intra-arterial TNK with a dose ranging from 1.5 mg to 10 mg had similar safety and favourable outcomes compared with intra-arterial alteplase or reteplase in AIS patients. Furthermore, intra-arterial 0.4 mg/min TNK seemed safe and showed potential benefit in the BRETIS-TNK study. Given these results and the potential risk of sICH across different subgroups, different doses of intra-arterial TNK were chosen in this trial after discussion with the steering committee, with the aim to minimise sICH risk. The second major concern of the trial was the sample size. Given the potential for removal of a subgroup in the event of a safety concern, an adaptive increase in sample size would be performed with statistician support when the interim results are reported.

### Prospective observational cohort study of tenecteplase: results from the Indian registry in ischemic stroke-tenecteplase [^116ukc3D]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This was a prospective, postapproval study to assess the safety and clinical outcomes of thrombolysis with tenecteplase in a large cohort from India. Tenecteplase, administered at the approved dose of 0.2 mg/kg in routine clinical practice was found to be safe and effective. These data are in line with several clinical studies reporting the efficacy and safety of 0.2 mg/kg of tenecteplase administered in patients across India.,

One of the key findings of this study is that only 0.6% patients had symptomatic ICH. This rate of symptomatic ICH observed is lower than the 1.8% reported in the tenecteplase arm of the CERTAIN (Comparative Effectiveness of Routine Tenecteplase vs Alteplase in Acute Ischemic Stroke) collaboration(median baseline NIHSS score 9) and 1.1% reported in the tenecteplase arm from a real‐world study from New Zealand(median baseline NIHSS score 7). The TRACE‐2 (Tenecteplase Versus Alteplase in Acute Ischaemic Cerebrovascular Events 2) trialreported a 2% symptomatic ICH rate in the tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg arm (median baseline NIHSS score 7), and, notably, also reported an increased large parenchymal hematoma rate with 0.25 mg/kg of tenecteplase compared with alteplase. The registry‐linked AcT (Alteplase Compared to Tenecteplase) trialreported a 3.4% symptomatic ICH rate with 0.25 mg/kg of tenecteplase (median baseline NIHSS score 9). Intracranial hemorrhage following thrombolysis is strongly associated with poor outcome. While not a randomized comparison, the 0.2 mg/kg dose of tenecteplase in the IRIS‐TNK cohort study appears to have resulted in a lower proportion of symptomatic ICH cases compared with the 0.25 mg/kg dose used in the other studies. Although the median NIHSS score at admission was comparable across these studies, the role of potential confounders (age, severity of stroke, ethnicities, comorbidities) resulting in reduced symptomatic ICH rates in the IRIS‐TNK cohort study cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, the safety findings observed in IRIS‐TNK are reassuring and have resulted in an extension of the thrombolytic window period up to 4.5 hours from last‐seen‐well for tenecteplase by the Indian licensing authority.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase following endovascular reperfusion for large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke: the POST-TNK randomized clinical trial [^115WeeWc]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The impact of adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase administration following near-complete to complete reperfusion by endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke is unknown.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and adverse events of adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase in patients with large vessel occlusion stroke who had achieved near-complete to complete reperfusion (defined as a score on the expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [eTICI] scale of 2c to 3) after EVT.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Investigator-initiated, randomized, open-label, blinded outcome assessment trial implemented at 34 hospitals in China among 540 patients with stroke due to proximal intracranial large vessel occlusion within 24 hours of the time they were last known to be well, with an eTICI score of 2c to 3 after EVT, and without prior intravenous thrombolysis. Recruitment took place between October 26, 2022, and March 1, 2024, with final follow-up on June 3, 2024.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive intra-arterial tenecteplase (n = 269) at 0.0625 mg/kg or no intra-arterial thrombolysis (control group; n = 271).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was freedom from disability, defined as a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin Scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. The primary safety outcomes were death at 90 days and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 48 hours.

Results

A total of 539 participants (99.8%) completed the trial (median age, 69 years; 221 female [40.9%]). The proportion with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1 at 90 days was 49.1% (132/269) in the intra-arterial tenecteplase group and 44.1% (119/270) in the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.97–1.36]; p = 0.11). Ninety-day mortality was 16.0% and 19.3% (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.50–1.13]; p = 0.16), respectively. The proportions of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were 6.3% and 4.4% (adjusted risk ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 0.68–2.99]; p = 0.35), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion presenting within 24 hours of time last known to be well and who had achieved near-complete to complete reperfusion after EVT, adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase did not significantly increase the likelihood of freedom from disability at 90 days.

Further Investigation of the Optimal Dose of Tenecteplase in Phase 3 Trials

These results from the preliminary trials, though with small samples, encouraged tenecteplase use and lent support for phase 3 randomized trials comparing tenecteplase with alteplase, preferably incorporating penumbral/angiographic imaging selection. The NOR‐TEST (Norwegian Tenecteplase Stroke Trial), the first phase 3 and the only superiority clinical trial of tenecteplase at a high dose (0.4 mg/kg) versus alteplase, enrolled 1100 patients who fulfilled standard thrombolysis eligibility criteria not selected by advanced neuroradiological modalities in 13 stroke units in Norway. Although tenecteplase was not superior to alteplase for excellent outcome (mRS score 0–1), the study added important evidence of safety. The 0.4 mg/kg tenecteplase dose was almost discarded by previous researchers because of safety concerns. However, the similar frequency of sICH (2%–3%) in the NOR‐TEST trial showed that tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg has a similar safety profile to alteplase 0.9 mg/kg within 4.5 hours of symptom onset or of awakening with symptoms. A meta‐analysisincluded 5 randomized clinical trials (the TNK‐S2B [Phase IIB/III Trial of Tenecteplase in Acute Ischemic Stroke Results of a Prematurely Terminated Randomized Clinical Trial], Australian‐TNK, ATTEST, NOR‐TEST, and EXTEND‐IA TNK trials) and 1585 patients (828 tenecteplase, 757 alteplase) identified a 4% risk difference for the disability‐free 3‐month outcome (mRS score 0–1) (95% CI, −1% to 8%). The lower 95% CI bound fell well within the noninferiority margin of 1.3%. The additional efficacy end points such as functional independence (mRS score 0–2) (risk difference [RD], 2% [95% CI, −3% to 6%]) also met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 5%. The rates of sICH and mortality were low and comparable (sICH: 3% versus 3%, RD 0% [95% CI, –1% to 2%]; 90‐day death: 7.6% versus 8.1%, RD 0% [95% CI, −3% to 2%]). The evidence was, however, strongly dependent on NOR‐TEST, which had a probable selection bias in favor of minor stroke and 17% had stroke mimics, which diluted the efficacy of tenecteplase over alteplase. The latest published NOR‐TEST 2trial, a phase 3 and noninferiority trial, enrolled patients at 11 hospitals with stroke units in Norway with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score > 5 and investigated the efficacy and safety of tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg versus alteplase within 4.5 hours after symptom onset or patients with wakeup stroke with a diffusion weighted imaging‐fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery mismatch. The 0.4 mg/kg dose of tenecteplase yielded worse safety and functional outcomes in moderate and severe ischemic stroke compared with alteplase. The study failed to show that 0.4 mg/kg tenecteplase was noninferior to alteplase in moderate and severe ischemic stroke, and a part B trial (NCT03854500) is ongoing with a lower dose of tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg).

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase before thrombectomy for ischemic stroke [^116iLv3P]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study EXTEND-IA TNK was published by Bruce C V Campbell and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the trial question was: what is the role of tenecteplase among patients with ischemic stroke who are eligible to undergo thrombectomy? In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the population was: 202 patients (92 female, 110 male). The inclusion criteria were patients within 4.5 hours after onset of ischemic stroke who had occlusion of the internal carotid, basilar, or middle cerebral artery and who were eligible to undergo thrombectomy. The key exclusion criteria were severe preexisting disability with mRS score > 3, pregnancy, ICH, rapidly improving symptoms at the discretion of the investigator. In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the interventions were: n = 101 tenecteplase (at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg of body weight with a maximum dose of 25 mg) n = 101 alteplase (at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 90 mg). In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reperfusion of > 50% of the involved ischemic territory or an absence of retrievable thrombus at the time of the initial angiographic assessment (22% vs. 10%; IR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.4). In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median mRS score at 90 days (2 points vs. 3 points; OR 1.7, 95% CI 1 to 2.8) Borderline significant increase in incidence of recovery to independent function; mRS score of 0–2 at 90 days (64% vs. 51%; IR 1.2, 95% CI 1 to 1.5) No significant difference in early neurologic improvement at 72 hours (71% vs. 68%; IR 1, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.2). In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, parenchymal hematoma. significant difference in death (10% vs. 18%). In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the conclusion was: in patients within 4.5 hours after onset of ischemic stroke who had occlusion of the internal carotid, basilar, or middle cerebral artery and who were eligible to undergo thrombectomy, tenecteplase was superior to alteplase with respect to reperfusion of > 50% of the involved ischemic territory or an absence of retrievable thrombus at the time of the initial angiographic assessment.

### Risk of intracerebral haemorrhage with tenecteplase versus alteplase in acute ischaemic stroke: a meta-analysis [^114J8Yxn]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tenecteplase (TNK) has been widely used in thrombolytic therapy for acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), but TNK-related intracranial haemorrhage(ICH) remains a severe complication. However, few data are available to guide the management of tenecteplase-related intracranial haemorrhage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of intracranial haemorrhage associated with tenecteplase compared with alteplase in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.

Methods

A thorough literature search of Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to October 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the risk of intracranial haemorrhage between tenecteplase and alteplase (ALT) were eligible for inclusion. To reduce study bias, we uniformly adopted the random-effects model for the meta-analysis of all haemorrhagic outcomes.

Results

Eleven RCTs with a total of 7466 patients were analysed in this meta-analysis. No significant differences were observed between TNK-treated patients and ALT-treated patients in overall ICH (13.22% vs 12.72%; RR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.8–1.24; p = 0.81), symptomatic ICH (3.09% vs. 2.49%; RR = 1.21, 95% CI = 0.92–1.59; p = 0.18), and asymptomatic ICH (8.68% vs. 9.03%; RR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.78–1.16; p = 0.62). Subgroup analyses based on TNK dosage (0.25 mg/kg vs. 0.4 mg/kg) compared to ALT showed no significant differences in ICH incidences. The proportions of ICH in different locations, including intraventricular hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hemorrhagic infarction, parenchymal hematoma, and remote parenchymal hematoma, were also similar between the TNK and ALT groups (all P > 0.05).

Conclusion

Our study provides the best evidence to date that TNK has a similar risk of ICH to ALT in AIS, with a very low incidence of symptomatic ICH, supporting that TNK has a good safety profile in terms of ICH.

### Intravenous tenecteplase before thrombectomy in stroke [^1143wwNR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study BRIDGE-TNK was published by Zhongming Qiu and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the trial question was: what is the role of intravenous tenecteplase in patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion? In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the population was: 550 patients (230 female, 320 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion who had presented within 4.5 hours after onset. The key exclusion criteria were contraindications to intravenous thrombolysis; receipt of intravenous thrombolysis before screening; ICH; any terminal disease with a life expectancy < 6 months; intravenous AVM or aneurysm; pregnancy or lactation. In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the interventions were: n = 278 tenecteplase plus thrombectomy (intravenous tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg, maximum dose of 25 mg, followed by endovascular thrombectomy) n = 272 thrombectomy alone (endovascular thrombectomy alone). In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving functional independence at day 90 (52.9% vs. 44.1%; RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.39). In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mRS score at day 90 (44.9% vs. 39.4%; OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.43) No significant difference in mRS score of 0 or 1 at day 90 (34.9% vs. 27.9%; RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.57) Significant increase in successful reperfusion before thrombectomy (6.1% vs. 1.1%; RR 5.19, 95% CI 1.51 to 17.84). In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death within 90 days, symptomatic ICH within 48 hours. In the BRIDGE-TNK study, the conclusion was: in patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion who had presented within 4.5 hours after onset, tenecteplase plus thrombectomy was superior to thrombectomy alone with respect to the percentage of patients achieving functional independence at day 90.

### Daytime DNase-I administration protects mice from ischemic stroke without inducing bleeding or tPA-induced hemorrhagic transformation, even with aspirin pretreatment [^111w56DV]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Stroke is a leading global cause of death and disability. Reperfusion therapies like tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) or tenecteplase are standard treatments for acute ischemic stroke but have limitations. These therapies are suitable for selected patients, with around 50% of tPA-treated patients not achieving successful reperfusion (tPA resistance), and tPA significantly raises the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT). tPA resistance is not fully understood, but thrombus composition and drug administration timing are key factors. Red blood cell-rich thrombi with low von Willebrand Factor, platelets, and DNA respond better to tPA lysis, while platelet-rich thrombi, lacking red blood cells, are resistant to tPA but sensitive to DNase-1.

Neutrophil activation and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in thrombosis are linked to poor stroke outcomes and reperfusion resistance. DNase-I, which degrades NETs, may improve thrombolytic treatment efficacy. Unresolved questions include its effectiveness in tPA-sensitive models, the safety of coadministration with tPA concerning HT, optimal timing, and effects on animals taking aspirin, a common antiplatelet. To investigate, a tPA-sensitive stroke model was used, demonstrating recanalization and protective effects with early thrombolysis, while late tPA administration produced HT.

### Tenecteplase (Tnkase) [^115MPww5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of tenecteplase IV (also known as TNKase, TNKase):
- Bleeding: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tenecteplase is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Avoid administering intramuscular injections for the first few hours following treatment with tenecreplase. Perform arterial and venous punctures carefully and only as required. Avoid performing internal jugular and subclavian venous punctures to minimize bleeding from noncompressible sites. Use an upper extremity vessel accessible to manual compression if an arterial puncture is required, and apply pressure for at least 30 minutes. Discontinue concomitant heparin and antiplatelet therapy immediately if serious bleeding occurs not controlled by local pressure, and manage the bleeding accordingly.
- Cardiac arrhythmias: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tenecteplase has been associated with an increased risk of reperfusion arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia, accelerated idioventricular rhythm, ventricular premature depolarizations, and VT. Ensure antiarrhythmic therapy for bradycardia and/or ventricular irritability is readily available when administering tenectaplase.
- Cholesterol embolization syndrome: maintain a high level of suspicion, as teneceteplase has been associated with an increased risk of cholesterol emobolization.
- HF, recurrent myocardial ischemia: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tenectaplase has been associated with an increased risk of mortality, cardiogenic shock, congestive HF, recurrent myocardial infarction, and repeat target vessel revascularization in patients undergoing planned PCI for STEMI after fibrinolytic therapy.
- Thromboembolism: use caution in patients at high risk of left heart thrombus, such as with MS or AF.

The AcT (Alteplase Compared to Tenecteplase) randomized controlled trial showed that tenecteplase is noninferior to alteplase in treating patients with acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. The effect of time to treatment on clinical outcomes with alteplase is well known; however, the nature of this relationship is yet to be described with tenecteplase. We assessed whether the association of time to thrombolysis treatment with clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke differs by whether they receive intravenous tenecteplase versus alteplase.

Methods

Patients included were from AcT, a pragmatic, registry-linked, phase 3 randomized controlled trial comparing intravenous tenecteplase to alteplase in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Eligible patients were > 18 years old, with disabling neurological deficits, presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, and eligible for thrombolysis. Primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1 at 90 days. Safety outcomes included 24-hour symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and 90-day mortality rates. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to assess the following: (a) the association of stroke symptom onset to needle time; (b) door (hospital arrival) to needle time with outcomes; and (c) if these associations were modified by type of thrombolytic administered (tenecteplase versus alteplase), after adjusting for age, sex, baseline stroke severity, and site of intracranial occlusion.

Results

Of the 1538 patients included in this analysis, 1146 (74.5%; 591 tenecteplase and 555 alteplase) presented within 3 hours versus 392 (25.5%; 196: TNK and 196 alteplase) who presented within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Baseline patient characteristics in the 0 to 3 hours versus 3- to 4.5-hour time window were similar, except patients in the 3- to 4.5-hour window had lower median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Severity Scale (10 versus 7, respectively) and lower proportion of patients with large vessel occlusion on baseline CT angiography (26.9% versus 18.7%, respectively). Type of thrombolytic agent (tenecteplase versus alteplase) did not modify the association between continuous onset to needle time (P interaction = 0.161) or door-to-needle time (P interaction = 0.972) and primary clinical outcome. Irrespective of the thrombolytic agent used, each 30-minute reduction in onset to needle time was associated with a 1.8% increase while every 10 minutes reduction in door-to-needle time was associated with a 0.2% increase in the probability of achieving 90-day modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1, respectively.

Conclusions

The effect of time to tenecteplase administration on clinical outcomes is like that of alteplase, with faster administration resulting in better clinical outcomes.

### Reduced dose tenecteplase and outcomes in elderly ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients: insights from the STrategic reperfusion early after myocardial infarction trial [^112u5HuF]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Elderly patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have worse outcomes and a greater risk of intracranial bleeding than nonelderly patients. Baseline characteristics, clinical outcomes, and the relationship of the tenecteplase (TNK) dose reduction to the efficacy, safety, and electrocardiographic indicators of reperfusion efficacy were evaluated in STEMI patients ≥ 75 years.

Methods

The STREAM trial evaluated early presenting STEMI patients who could not undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention within 1 hour of first medical contact. Because of excess intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients ≥ 75 years, the dose of TNK was reduced by 50%.

Results

Before dose amendment, there were 3 (7.1%) of 42 elderly patients with ICH; 2 of these were fatal, whereas no ICH occurred in the 93 elderly patients who received half-dose TNK postamendment. The median extent of ST-segment elevation resolution (≥ 50%) and proportion of patients with ≥ 2 mm in the electrocardiogram lead with greatest ST-segment elevation was comparable in elderly patients preamendment and postamendment (63.2% vs 56.0% and 43.6% vs 40.0%, respectively). Patients requiring rescue coronary intervention after TNK was also similar (42.9% vs 44.1%). The primary composite end point (30-day all-cause death, cardiogenic shock, congestive heart failure, and reinfarction) was 31.0% before versus 24.7% postamendment.

Conclusions

Our data, from a modest-sized population of elderly STEMI patients, indicate that half-dose TNK reduces the likelihood of ICH without compromising reperfusion efficacy. These observations are hypothesis generating and warrant further confirmation in randomized clinical trials in the elderly.

### Bridging thrombolysis with tenecteplase versus endovascular thrombectomy alone for large-vessel anterior circulation stroke: a target trial emulation analysis [^117R1MaY]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether bridging thrombolysis with tenecteplase is beneficial compared with thrombectomy alone in patients who had a stroke with large-vessel occlusion remains unclear.

Methods

This is a causal inference study of observational data from the trials SWIFT DIRECT and EXTEND-IA TNK Parts 1 and 2 applying target trial emulation. We compared patients receiving thrombectomy alone to patients receiving tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg or 0.40mg/kg before thrombectomy. The primary outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0–2) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included improvement over the full ordinal mRS scale, freedom of disability (mRS 0–1), mortality and occurrence of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. The average causal treatment effect was estimated via inverse probability of treatment weighting and G-Computation. We calculated standardised risk differences (SRDs) and adjusted (common) ORs (a(c)ORs).

Results

Of 377 patients included in the target trial, 187 received thrombectomy alone and 190 tenecteplase before thrombectomy. Tenecteplase before thrombectomy did not increase the probability of patients achieving functional independence (SRD 0.04 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.13)) but resulted in a significant improvement in the mRS overall (acOR 1.56 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.23)) and in a higher probability of freedom from disability (SRD 0.10 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.20)). The probability for improvement of functional outcomes was further increased in patients treated within 140min after onset (ordinal mRS acOR 1.63 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.56)). No significant differences in safety outcomes were observed between the two groups.

Conclusion

Tenecteplase before thrombectomy compared with thrombectomy alone did not increase the probability of functional independence but resulted in significant improvement over the full mRS scale. This improvement was most evident in patients treated early.

- TIA or minor stroke defined as a baseline NIHSS ≤ 5 at the time of randomization. Patients do not have to have persistent demonstrable neurological deficit on physical neurological examination.
- Pre-stroke independent functional status
- structured mRS ≤ 2.
- Informed consent from the patient or surrogate.
- Patients can be treated within 90 minutes of the first slice of CT or MRI. Scans can be repeated to meet this requirement; if there is no change neurologically then only a CT head need be repeated for assessment of extent and depth of ischemia. Exclusion Criteria:

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous tenecteplase compared to alteplase before mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke: a meta-analysis [^1177vfsD]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The benefits and risks of tenecteplase (TNK) versus alteplase (ALT) have recently been assessed in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy (MT) with diverse results. Due to its high fibrin specificity and lack of excitotoxicity, TNK may have a higher efficacy and safety profile. This study aimed to evaluate the benefits and risks of TNK compared to ALT in AIS patients prior to thrombectomy.

Methods

We systematically searched four key databases, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library until January 27, 2024 for clinical studies evaluating the effects of TNK versus ALT in patients with large vessel occlusion undergoing MT. A random-effect meta-analysis was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Results

Ten studies involving 3722 patients receiving TNK (1266 patients) or ALT (2456 patients) were included (age: 69.05 ± 14.95 years; 55.64% male). Compared to ALT-treated patients, TNK-treated patients demonstrated significantly higher rates of early recanalization (odds ratio 2.02, 95%-confidence interval 1.20–3.38, p = 0.008) without increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (1.06, 0.64–1.76, p = 0.82) or intracerebral hemorrhage (1.21, 0.66–2.25, p = 0.54). TNK-treated patients showed similar rates of functional independence at 90 days (1.13, 0.87–1.46, p = 0.37) as ALT-treated patients, but lower rates of mortality within 90 days (0.65, 0.44–0.96, p = 0.03).

Conclusion

TNK is superior to ALT in achieving early recanalization and is associated with lower mortality within 90 days in AIS patients undergoing MT. Compared with ALT, TNK does not significantly alter functional independence at 90 days, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Tenecteplase for acute ischemic stroke at 4.5 to 24 hours: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114xBC57]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether TNK (tenecteplase) benefits patients with acute ischemic stroke treated within 4.5 to 24 hours remains uncertain, and no previous meta-analysis has differentiated between clinical settings where endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is unavailable or permitted, leading to pooled distinct clinical contexts and obscuring a clear estimation of TNK's net effect.

Methods

We searched for randomized controlled trials comparing intravenous TNK of 0.25 mg/kg with standard care or placebo in adults within 4.5 to 24 hours after acute ischemic stroke onset. The primary outcome was excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–1) at 90 days, with additional efficacy and safety end points. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed both overall and within predefined subgroups, stratified by whether EVT was permitted in individual studies (non-EVT versus EVT-permitted).

Results

Four multicenter randomized controlled trials enrolling 1278 patients were included. TNK significantly increased excellent functional outcome (odds ratio [OR], 1.34 [95% CI, 1.06–1.71]; P = 0.02) at 90 days and recanalization (OR, 3.30 [95% CI, 1.59–6.84]; P = 0.001) compared with the control group, whereas good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–2), reperfusion, and early neurological improvement did not differ significantly. Subgroup analyses of 596 patients in the non-EVT subgroup showed that TNK significantly improved excellent functional outcome (OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.02–2.08]; P = 0.04), good functional outcome (OR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.07–2.09]; P = 0.02), recanalization (OR, 6.17 [95% CI, 3.36–11.33]; P < 0.00001), and early neurological improvement (OR, 3.21 [95% CI, 1.82–5.66]; P < 0.0001). However, in the EVT-permitted subgroup of 682 patients, TNK only improved recanalization (OR, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.34–4.17]; P = 0.003). No significant differences were observed between TNK and control in the risks of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or 90-day mortality, either in the overall or subgroup analyses.

Conclusions

TNK improves excellent functional outcomes and recanalization in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated within 4.5 to 24 hours, without increasing the risks of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or mortality. Notably, extended-window TNK provides greater additional benefits when EVT is inaccessible, establishing its role as an alternative reperfusion strategy in resource-limited settings.

### Tenecteplase thrombolysis for stroke up to 24 hours after onset with perfusion imaging selection: the umbrella phase IIa CHABLIS-T randomised clinical trial [^117Ki2Tx]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Prompt reperfusion is of great importance for patients who had an acute ischaemic stroke with large vessel occlusion. Previous studies have shown that tenecteplase, as a single bolus administration, could achieve more rapid and substantial reperfusion compared with alteplase. The recently reported TIMELESS trial (NCT03785678) has also reported a higher rate of recanalisation at 24 hours in the tenecteplase group than the placebo group. The current trial showed that both 0.25 mg/kg and 0.32 mg/kg tenecteplase dose groups could reach a substantial reperfusion rate of around 30%, compared with the 20% in the EXTEND-IA TNK trials. One possible explanation is that we included medium vessel occlusion or severe stenosis, which could have higher reperfusion rate treated by tenecteplase. Another possible explanation is that the time window of reperfusion assessment in CHABLIS-T was around 60 min for patients transferred for catheter angiography (similar to EXTEND-IA TNK), and 4–6 hours for patients not transferred (60% of CHABLIS-T participants). Apart from the time window, the imaging modality of reperfusion assessments may also play a part, since reperfusion status was mainly assessed through repeated perfusion imaging rather than catheter angiography in the CHABLIS-T trial, which was the opposite to the EXTEND-IA TNK trials. However, reperfusion status assessed through perfusion imaging has been proven to have at least equivalent predictive ability for functional outcome compared with mTICI scores in catheter angiography. As for the safety concerns, we did not observe a higher rate of sICH or PH2 in the higher dose stratum. However, the percentages of haemorrhagic transformation (including symptomatic and asymptomatic) in this trial were notably higher than those of randomised controlled trials with patients with large vessel occlusion treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Since the thrombolytic time windows of prior trials range from ≤ 4.5 hours to ≤ 9 hours after last seen well, the higher risk of haemorrhagic transformation in this trial can be partly explained by the longer onset-to-reperfusion time. Additionally, though patients in CHABLIS-T have been selected with benign perfusion profiles, they may exhibit risk factors of sICH that could not be detected simply by automatically post-processed perfusion imaging (ie, larger volumes of very low cerebral blood flow), which should be further explored by post-hoc analysis. Despite the higher sICH rates, both doses of 0.25 mg/kg and 0.32 mg/kg tenecteplase appear to be of sufficient promise in patients who had an acute ischaemic stroke with large/medium vessel occlusion or severe stenosis in the extended time window. Though the design of the study was not driven by the direct comparison between 0.25 mg/kg and 0.32 mg/kg tenecteplase, more patients in the 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase dose stratum reached the primary outcome but failed to achieve 3-month mRS 0–1 or 0–2, compared with patients in the 0.32 mg/kg dose stratum. This discrepancy may be explained by the higher baseline NIHSS, higher prevalence of cardioembolic stroke and higher rate of PH2 in the 0.25 mg/kg dose stratum.

### Safety and efficacy of tenecteplase and alteplase in patients with tandem lesion stroke: a post hoc analysis of the EXTEND-IA TNK trials [^1122btHF]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The safety and efficacy of tenecteplase (TNK) in patients with tandem lesion (TL) stroke is unknown. We performed a comparative analysis of TNK and alteplase in patients with TLs.

Methods

We first compared the treatment effect of TNK and alteplase in patients with TLs using individual patient data from the EXTEND-IA TNK trials. We evaluated intracranial reperfusion at initial angiographic assessment and 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS) with ordinal logistic and Firth regression models. Because 2 key outcomes, mortality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), were few in number among those who received alteplase in the EXTEND-IA TNK trials, we generated pooled estimates for these outcomes by supplementing trial data with estimates of incidence obtained through a meta-analysis of studies identified in a systematic review. We then calculated unadjusted risk differences to compare the pooled estimates for those receiving alteplase with the incidence observed in the trial among those receiving TNK.

Results

Seventy-one of 483 patients (15%) in the EXTEND-IA TNK trials possessed a TL. In patients with TLs, intracranial reperfusion was observed in 11/56 (20%) of TNK-treated patients vs 1/15 (7%) alteplase-treated patients (adjusted odds ratio 2.19; 95% CI 0.28–17.29). No significant difference in 90-day mRS was observed (adjusted common odds ratio 1.48; 95% CI 0.44–5.00). A pooled study-level proportion of alteplase-associated mortality and sICH was 0.14 (95% CI 0.08–0.21) and 0.09 (95% CI 0.04–0.16), respectively. Compared with a mortality rate of 0.09 (95% CI 0.03–0.20) and an sICH rate of 0.07 (95% CI 0.02–0.17) in TNK-treated patients, no significant difference was observed.

Discussion

Functional outcomes, mortality, and sICH did not significantly differ between patients with TLs treated with TNK and those treated with alteplase.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class III evidence that TNK is associated with similar rates of intracranial reperfusion, functional outcome, mortality, and sICH compared with alteplase in patients with acute stroke due to TLs. However, the CIs do not rule out clinically important differences. TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02388061; clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03340493.

### Effect of intravenous tenecteplase dose on cerebral reperfusion before thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke: the EXTEND-IA TNK part 2 randomized clinical trial [^1139vxYA]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase improves reperfusion prior to endovascular thrombectomy for ischemic stroke compared with alteplase.

Objective

To determine whether 0.40 mg/kg of tenecteplase safely improves reperfusion before endovascular thrombectomy vs 0.25 mg/kg of tenecteplase in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial at 27 hospitals in Australia and 1 in New Zealand using open-label treatment and blinded assessment of radiological and clinical outcomes. Patients were enrolled from December 2017 to July 2019 with follow-up until October 2019. Adult patients (N = 300) with ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid, \basilar, or middle cerebral artery were included less than 4.5 hours after symptom onset using standard intravenous thrombolysis eligibility criteria.

Interventions

Open-label tenecteplase at 0.40 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg; n = 150) or 0.25 mg/kg (maximum, 25 mg; n = 150) given as a bolus before endovascular thrombectomy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was reperfusion of greater than 50% of the involved ischemic territory prior to thrombectomy, assessed by consensus of 2 blinded neuroradiologists. Prespecified secondary outcomes were level of disability at day 90 (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score; range, 0–6); mRS score of 0 to 1 (freedom from disability) or no change from baseline at 90 days; mRS score of 0 to 2 (functional independence) or no change from baseline at 90 days; substantial neurological improvement at 3 days; symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours; and all-cause death.

Results

All 300 patients who were randomized (mean age, 72.7 years; 141 [47%] women) completed the trial. The number of participants with greater than 50% reperfusion of the previously occluded vascular territory was 29 of 150 (19.3%) in the 0.40 mg/kg group vs 29 of 150 (19.3%) in the 0.25 mg/kg group (unadjusted risk difference, 0.0% [95% CI, -8.9% to -8.9%]; adjusted risk ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.66–1.61]; p = 0.89). Among the 6 secondary outcomes, there were no significant differences in any of the 4 functional outcomes between the 0.40 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg groups nor in all-cause deaths (26 [17%] vs 22 [15%]; unadjusted risk difference, 2.7% [95% CI, -5.6% to 11.0%]) or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7 [4.7%] vs 2 [1.3%]; unadjusted risk difference, 3.3% [95% CI, -0.5% to 7.2%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke, a dose of 0.40 mg/kg, compared with 0.25 mg/kg, of tenecteplase did not significantly improve cerebral reperfusion prior to endovascular thrombectomy. The findings suggest that the 0.40-mg/kg dose of tenecteplase does not confer an advantage over the 0.25-mg/kg dose in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke in whom endovascular thrombectomy is planned.

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke: a meta-analysis of phase III randomised trials [^1157LYa3]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Tenecteplase (TNK) was found non-inferior to alteplase in recent clinical trials. We aimed to elucidate the efficacy and safety of TNK versus alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke (AIS).

Methods

Systematic literature search and a meta-analysis of phase III clinical trials in ischaemic stroke patients with TNK use were conducted. The primary outcome was excellent functional outcome which was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 at 90 days and safety outcomes included symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage and death at 90 days. We used random-effects model to estimate the pooled risk difference and 95% CI in R package 'Meta'. The included trials were adapted to the non-inferiority analysis with a margin of -4%.

Results

Three trials enrolling 4094 patients were identified by systematic search. All trials included AIS patients within 4.5hours time window. Meta-analysis indicated that 1089 (53.0%) of 2056 patients in the TNK arm and 1016 (50.5%) of 2012 in the alteplase arm had excellent functional outcome at 90 days (0.03 (95% CI -0.00 to 0.06); I² = 0%), meeting the prespecified non-inferiority threshold. And TNK thrombolysis was not correlated with increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (0.00 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.01); I² = 0%) or death (0.01 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.02); I² = 0%) at 90 days. The sensitivity analysis with the 0.25mg/kg trials exclusively showed similar results to the main analysis.

Conclusions

TNK was non-inferior to alteplase for achieving excellent functional outcome at 90 days without increasing the safety concern in treating patients with AIS. These findings suggest that TNK can be an alternative to alteplase.

### Chinese acute tissue-based imaging selection for lysis in stroke tenecteplase II (CHABLIS-T II): rationale and design [^113mAsUn]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Randomisation and blinding

Randomisation is allowed when all the inclusion criteria are confirmed to be met, all the exclusion criteria have been ruled out, and that written informed consent is obtained from the patient or the proxies. Randomisation is performed using permuted blocks through a centralised website named Easy Random Trial designed by Trial Data Pharmaceutical Technology (Shanghai) Co. by a team of professional and independent statisticians. Since the most updated evidence for thrombolysis in an extended time window under the guidance of perfusion imaging is from the Thrombolysis Guided by Perfusion Imaging up to 9 Hour after Onset of Stroke (EXTEND) study, patients in CHABLIS-T II are stratified according to the time since last known well at randomisation (4.5–9 hours vs 9–24 hours). Treatment allocation is open label while the raters involved in subsequent radiological and clinical evaluation are blinded. The data safety monitoring board (DSMB), independent from the trial committee, has access to all the unblinded grouped data.

Sample size and statistical analysis

Sample size calculation

The sample size is calculated based on the results derived from the EXTEND-IA TNK trial. In the EXTEND-IA TNK trial, 22% of patients from the intravenous TNK group and 10% of patients from the intravenous alteplase group reached major reperfusion, and 1% of patients in both groups, respectively, were found to develop sICH. We hypothesise that in our study, there will be 21% and 7% of patients in the TNK and best medical management group, respectively, reaching the primary outcome. This trial is designed to yield a two-sided type I error of 0.05 and a power of 85% to detect the presumed significant difference. Considering a 5% drop-out rate, a total number of 224 patients (112 patients each group) is estimated to be enrolled in the CHABLIS-T II trial.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous tenecteplase compared to alteplase before mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke: a meta-analysis [^11575NHs]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Characteristics of included studies

This meta-analysis included ten studies with a total of 3722 AIS patients who received MT. Of these, 1266 patients were treated with TNK and 2456 with ALT for thrombolysis. Table 1 shows characteristics of the included studies. Regarding study design, this meta-analysis included two RCTs and eight non-randomized, non-blind cohort studies. Eight used a prospective approach, while two were based on a retrospective approach. Regarding review system, six were peer-reviewed studies and four were non-peer-reviewed studies. The largest sample was included in the study by Checkouri et al. (n = 1865), while Marín et al. had the smallest (n = 18). Six studies included both anterior and posterior circulation occlusion, three studies focused on anterior circulation occlusion, and one on posterior circulation occlusion. Thrombolytic doses were highly consistent across studies, using intravenous TNK (0.25 mg/kg) and ALT (0.9 mg/kg). Of note, in one study a broader dose application was introduced in TNK treatment, allowing for 0.25 mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg.

### Comparison of the novel thrombolytic constitutively active ADAMTS13 with clinical thrombolytics in a murine stroke model [^115hEEQi]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

The therapeutic aim of thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the fast and effective removal of thrombi occluding cerebral arteries to achieve reperfusion. For many years, the only clinically approved thrombolytic to achieve reperfusion has been r-tPA (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator; alteplase). However, r-tPA produces effective recanalization in as few as 10% to 35% of patients, depending on the population and cause studied, and is associated with a significant risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. More recently, there has been an increase in recommendations for the use of TNK (tenecteplase) as a thrombolytic for AIS.TNK is a r-tPA variant with increased fibrin specificity and increased resistance to inhibition and, thus, has a longer half-life than r-tPA. This enables TNK administration as a bolus, as opposed to the administration of r-tPA as a 10% volume bolus followed by 90% volume infusion, and a reduction in the required therapeutic dose. Clinical studies have demonstrated that 0.25-mg/kg TNK has a comparable safety profile to 0.9-mg/kg r-tPA in terms of hemorrhagic transformation events and is at least as effective in terms of reperfusion and functional outcomes.– In preclinical AIS, r-tPA and TNK both have similar efficacy, with increased safety of TNK only at early administration.

The comparable efficacy and shared mechanism of action may suggest that the phenomenon of r-tPA resistance, where r-tPA is ineffective at breaking down altered fibrin and nonfibrinous structural components, may similarly occur with TNK. AIS thrombi are broadly characterized into 2 compositions: red blood cell–rich consisting of areas packed with red blood cells within a thin, loose meshwork of fibrin, and platelet-rich consisting of dense fibrin and VWF (von Willebrand Factor) structures that delineate platelet-filled areas. It is the loose fibrin meshwork of the red blood cell–rich thrombus composition that plasmin derived from r-tPA activation is effective at degrading, while the platelet-rich composition is r-tPA-resistant. The greater the proportion of platelet and VWF components, the greater the r-tPA resistance of thrombi.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase following endovascular reperfusion for large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke: the POST-TNK randomized clinical trial [^113tpmXP]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study POST-TNK was published by Jiacheng Huang and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the POST-TNK study, the trial question was: what is the role of adjunctive intra-arterial tenecteplase after endovascular reperfusion in patients with AIS? In the POST-TNK study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the POST-TNK study, the population was: 539 patients (220 female, 319 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion presenting within 24 hours of time last known to be well who had achieved near-complete to complete reperfusion after endovascular thrombectomy. The key exclusion criteria were prestroke disability; treatment with intravenous thrombolysis before endovascular thrombectomy. In the POST-TNK study, the interventions were: n = 269 intra-arterial tenecteplase (receipt of endovascular treatment plus infusion of intra-arterial tenecteplase 0.0625 mg/kg, maximum dose 6.25 mg, for 10–15 minutes) n = 270 standard treatment (receipt of endovascular treatment without intra-arterial thrombolysis). In the POST-TNK study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in freedom from disability at day 90 (49.1% vs. 44.1%; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.36). In the POST-TNK study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mRS score of 0–2 at day 90 (61.3% vs. 58.9%; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21) No significant difference in improvement in NIHSS score at 5–7 days or discharge if earlier (53.2% vs. 43.1%; WR 1.19, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.46) No significant difference in European QoL Five-Dimension Five-Level score at day 90 (43.6% vs. 37.7%; WR 1.2, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.52). In the POST-TNK study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death within day 90, symptomatic ICH within 48 hours. significant difference in any radiologic ICH within 48 hours (36.6% vs. 27.3%). In the POST-TNK study, the conclusion was: in patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion presenting within 24 hours of time last known to be well who had achieved near-complete to complete reperfusion after endovascular thrombectomy, intra-arterial tenecteplase was not superior to standard treatment with respect to freedom from disability at day 90.

### Comprehensive review of tenecteplase for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke [^1146nVqP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Use of Tenecteplase in Specific Populations

A pooled analysis of the ATTEST and Australian‐TNK trials suggested that the benefits of tenecteplase were possibly more prominent in the subgroup of patients with a defined target mismatch (absolute mismatch volume > 15 mL, mismatch ratio > 1.8, baseline ischemic core < 70 mL, and a volume of severely hypoperfused tissue < 100 mL), regarding early clinical improvement (median NIHSS score change: 6 versus 1; P < 0.001) and late independent recovery (mRS 0–1: OR, 2.33 [95% CI, 1.13–5.94]; P = 0.032).

Another pooled analysis of these 2 trials showed that patients with baseline complete vessel occlusion had a significantly better rate of compete vessel recanalization at 24 hours (71% versus 43%, P < 0.001), approaching rates seen in the recent endovascular trials, larger reduction in 24‐hour NIHSS score from the baseline (9 versus 1, P = 0.001) early clinical improvement, and higher rate of mRS score of 0 to 1 at 90 days (49% versus 25%, OR, 4.82 [95% CI, 1.02–7.84]; P = 0.05), with much lower risk of hemorrhage (3% versus 7%, P = 0.002) and no sICH in tenecteplase group. The finding suggested that tenecteplase may offer greater recanalization efficacy compared with alteplase, possibly more so in patients with complete vessel occlusions on baseline CT angiography. A recent meta‐analysis conducted by Katsanos et alincluded ATTEST, the Australian‐TNK, and EXTEND‐IA TNK randomized controlled clinical trials with a total of 433 patients with confirmed LVO. They found that patients with AIS and LVO receiving intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase had a 3‐fold higher rate of achieving successful recanalization (OR, 3.05 [95% CI, 1.73–5.40]) and a 2‐fold higher rate of having a favorable clinical outcomes of mRS score 0–2 at 3 months (OR, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.15–3.69]) compared with patients receiving intravenous alteplase. The 2 treatments had a similar safety profile. The meta‐analysis was the first to date that provided clear evidence of superiority for tenecteplase compared with alteplase for the treatment of AIS due to LVO.

### Issues in the assessment of the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase (TNK-tPA) [^111yKJuv]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

While thrombolytic agents have demonstrated improved mortality over the use of placebo, this has come at the expense of bleeding complications such as intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Tenecteplase (TNK-tPA) is a novel thrombolytic agent engineered to improve upon the ease of use and safety of alteplase (t-PA). Given its longer half-life, TNK-tPA can be administered as a single bolus. The dosing of TNK-tPA has been weight optimized to enhance both safety and efficacy outcomes. Weight-optimized TNK-tPA dosing requires body weight estimation, which may introduce the potential for medication error. However, data from TNK-tPA clinical trials suggest that body weight estimates can err by up to 20 kg (44 lb) without an increased risk of ICH or death. Furthermore, the results of TNK-tPA clinical trials showed that even at the highest weight-optimized dosage of 50 mg, ICH rates were among the lowest reported in clinical trials of thrombolytics for acute myocardial infarction. In elderly female patients of low body weight, the use of weight-optimized TNK-tPA lowered the risk of ICH compared with the use of t-PA, expanding the potential use of thrombolytics to this high-risk patient population. Tenecteplase has demonstrated clinical equivalence to t-PA, but with a wider therapeutic margin of safety.

### Tenecteplase thrombolytic therapy for acute ischaemic stroke in China: a real-world, multicentre, retrospective, controlled study [^11284Ug9]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study found that thrombolysis with TNK is not associated with an increased risk of sICH, and may lead to better early neurological improvement and 90-day functional outcomes compared with alteplase in patients with AIS.

Our real-world study revealed that patients receiving TNK under off-label conditions tended to be younger, with fewer cerebrovascular risk factors and comorbidities, and generally experienced milder strokes. However, after matching, we observed similar characteristics and thrombectomy rates between the two groups. Moreover, despite a shorter DNT, the longer OTT for TNK recipients indicated they may present at a later thrombolytic time window compared with rt-PA recipients.

Our PSM analysis showed that stroke thrombolysis with TNK in off-label settings demonstrated a safe profile comparable to rt-PA, with a lower overall incidence of intracranial bleeding. These findings remained consistent when we stratified the data based on age, sex, baseline NIHSS score, thrombectomy performance and the level of the medical centre. The sICH rate observed in our study for TNK (1.8%) closely resembles the rates reported in the TRACE-II (2%)and ORIGINAL (1.2%), both of which included Chinese stroke populations with similar age ranges, baseline NIHSS scores and percentages of patients undergoing bridging thrombectomy. The elevated sICH rates observed in studies like Act (3.4% at 24 hours)and ATTEST2 (3%)could be due to factors such as higher NIHSS score and a higher percentage of patients undergoing thrombectomy. Nevertheless, these findings generally aligned with RCTs comparing TNK and rt-PA. A recent meta-analysis including 16 studies indicated that the risk of sICH was similar between TNK and rt-PA groups (RR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.23). Notably, observational studies (RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.99) reported lower incidence rates compared with RCT (RR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.64). The higher rate of sICH in RCTs was possibly influenced by the inclusion of NOR-TEST, which used a dose of 0.4 mg/kg. The real-world study CERTAINand another PSM study from SITS-ISTR, which recruited patients with more severe strokes and higher NIHSS scores, reported similar sICH rates of 1.8% and 1%, respectively. Notably, CERTAIN reported a high bridging percentage of 38%, yet the sICH remained low. A subanalysis within CERTAIN further demonstrated that regardless of the total, non-thrombectomy, or thrombectomy groups, the TNK group consistently showed lower sICH rates than the alteplase group. These along with other off-label studies, provide reassurance regarding the safety of the 0.25 mg/kg dose of TNK in patients with AIS.

### Comprehensive review of tenecteplase for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke [^114TTwHe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Initial Investigation in the Optimal Dose of Tenecteplase

In 2005, a pilot dose‐escalation safety studywas conducted on 88 patients with AIS within 3 hours of symptom onset. The study evaluated the safety of tenecteplase doses ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg, with the primary end point being symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). However, the study did not determine the optimal dose for achieving favorable functional outcomes at 3 months. A phase IIB/III randomized, multicenter, double‐blind trialwas conducted on 112 patients to determine the optimal dose of tenecteplase among 0.1, 0.25, and 0.4 mg/kg. The study used an adaptive, sequential dose selection procedure. However, the trial was prematurely terminated as the 0.4 mg/kg dose displayed a high sICH rate. Furthermore, it was not possible to distinguish between the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg doses as neither showed clear efficacy. It should be noted that these findings represent early results that informed subsequent studies. In 2012, the Australian‐TNK (Low‐Dose Tenecteplase Versus Standard‐Dose Alteplase for Acute Ischemic Stroke) trial, another phase IIB trial based on a perfusion imaging mismatch and a proximal vessel occlusion within 6 hours after onset, demonstrated that tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg was superior to tenecteplase 0.1 mg/kg and alteplase 0.9 mg/kg for recanalization and 24‐hour clinical improvement, with no additional risk of hemorrhage. A longer‐term clinical benefit (0–2 score of the modified Rankin Scale [mRS] at 90 days) was also seen in the 0.25 mg/kg tier (72% versus 40%, P = 0.02). Although the sample size was very small, it was the first trial with no truncation to test the optimal dose for tenecteplase. Multimodal computed tomography (CT) imaging selection criteria in the trial resulted in exclusion of 79% (477/604) of patients who were otherwise eligible for intravenous alteplase. Instead, The ATTEST (Alteplase‐Tenecteplase Trial Evaluation for Stroke Thrombolysis) phase 2 trial, using imaging criteria as exploratory outcome measures rather than selection criteria, found a similar percentage of penumbral salvage on CT perfusion imaging when comparing 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase and standard 0.9 mg/kg alteplase (68% versus 68%) administered within 4.5 hours of stroke onset. This was the first study comparing 1 dose of tenecteplase against alteplase with patients selected by criteria currently used in clinical practice to assess eligibility for thrombolysis in a 4.5‐hour window. The application of advanced imaging for outcome assessment rather than patient selection avoided restrictions of generalizability and some delay in treatment initiation. However, the use of advanced imaging did reveal some baseline imbalances, such as differences in the proportion of patients with large artery occlusion and baseline ischemic core volume. Although these imbalances were not statistically significant, they could potentially affect the interpretation of the neutral results. As a result, larger sample size phase 3 trials are warranted. The pooled analysis of these 3 trials (Haley et al, Parsons et al, and ATTEST) found that a dose of 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase had the greatest odds of achieving early neurological improvement (odds ratio [OR], 3.3 [95% CI, 1.5–7.2], P = 0.093) and excellent functional outcome (mRS score 0–1) at 3 months (OR, 1.9 [95% CI, 0.8–4.4], P = 0.28), with reduced odds of ICH (OR, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.2–1.8], P = 0.43) compared with alteplase.

### RE-OPEN: randomised trial of biosimilar TNK versus TPA during endovascular therapy for acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusions [^111M1Na2]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Rationale

Rapid and timely treatment with intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular treatment (EVT) in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) and large vessel occlusion (LVO) significantly improves patient outcomes. Bridging therapy is the current standard of care in these patients. However, an incompletely answered question is whether one thrombolytic agent is better than another during bridging therapy.

Aim

The current study aims to understand if one thrombolytic agent is superior to the other during bridging therapy in the treatment of AIS and LVO.

Sample Size Estimates

Using 80% power and an alpha error of 5%, presuming a 10% drop out rate, a total of 372 patients will be recruited for the study.

Methods and Design

This study is a prospective, randomised, multicentre, open-label trial with blinded outcome analysis design.

Study Outcomes

The primary outcomes include proportion of patients who will be independent at 3months (modified Rankin score (mRS) ≤ 2 as good outcome) and proportion of patients who achieve recanalisation modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade 2b/3 at first angiography run at the end of EVT. Secondary outcomes include proportion of patients with early neurological improvement, rate of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), rate of any ICH, rate of any systemic major or minor bleeding and duration of hospital stay. Safety outcomes include any intracranial bleeding or symptomatic ICH.

Discussion

This trial is envisioned to confirm the theoretical advantages and increase the strength and quality of evidence for use of tenecteplase (TNK) in practice. Also, it will help to generate data on the efficacy and safety of biosimilar TNK.

### Safety, functional disability, healthcare utilization, and quality-of-life outcomes in elderly receiving alteplase and tenecteplase: a secondary analysis from the AcT trial [^111nPqtN]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Older age has been associated with overall poorer outcomes in acute ischemic stroke. We compared (1) outcomes in various health-related domains among patients < 80 years and ≥ 80 years presenting with acute ischemic stroke and (2) whether outcomes differ between intravenous TNK (tenecteplase) versus alteplase.

Methods

Data are from patients included in AcT (Alteplase Compared to Tenecteplase in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke), a pragmatic, registry-linked, phase 3 randomized controlled trial comparing TNK with alteplase. Outcomes included functional disability (per 90-day modified Rankin Scale), safety (24-hour symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, 90-day mortality rates), health care utilization (discharge destination, length of stay, thrombectomy rate), and quality of life measures (EQ-5D-5L [EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level Scale]). With an a priori plan, patients aged < 80 years were compared with those ≥ 80 years at symptom onset. Mixed effects Poisson regression was used to assess (1) the association of age with outcomes and (2) if these associations were modified by thrombolytic administered (TNK versus alteplase), after adjusting for sex, and baseline stroke severity.

Results

Of the 1577 patients, 1034 (65.6%; 520: TNK and 514: alteplase) were < 80 years and 543 (34.4%; 286: TNK and 257: alteplase) were ≥ 80 years of age. Baseline characteristics in the 2 groups were similar except for sex 40% female in < 80 years group versus 62.8% female in ≥ 80 years. There was no difference in rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (3.5% versus 3.1%). Patients in the ≥ 80 years group had significantly lower rates of excellent functional outcome, return to baseline status, higher mortality, and lower quality-of-life outcomes as compared with the < 80 years group. Length of hospital stay was similar between the 2 groups but, patients in the ≥ 80 years age group had significantly lower rates of endovascular treatment utilization. Type of thrombolytic agent (TNK versus alteplase) did not modify the association between age and primary clinical outcome (P interaction = 0.22).

Conclusions

Similar to alteplase, increasing age was associated with poorer functional outcomes with TNK. Rates of angiographic and bleeding outcomes were similar between patients < 80 and ≥ 80 years.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous tenecteplase compared to alteplase before mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke: a meta-analysis [^117G3ygt]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has emerged as the treatment of choice for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with large vessel occlusion, with its effectiveness confirmed in multiple randomized trials. Prior to MT, intravenous thrombolysis is widely recommended. Although some discussion regarding bridging thrombolysis still remains, current evidence increasingly advocates for thrombolytic therapy in MT-eligible patients. Alteplase (also: recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator; ALT) is currently the most commonly used and guideline-recommended thrombolytic agent for patients with AIS within 4.5 h after stroke onset. Although the beneficial effects of ALT on recanalization are certain, ALT may induce toxicity and aggravate ischemic brain injury, possibly via secondary hemodynamic disturbances.

Tenecteplase (TNK) is a promising thrombolytic agent due to its greater fibrin specificity and longer half-life compared with ALT. Although TNK has not been classified as a recommended class I thrombolytic agent in current stroke guidelines, increasing numbers of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) confirm the non-inferiority of TNK to ALT. In recent years, studies in AIS started to more systematically compare the efficacy and safety of the two thrombolytic agents. The Australian Stroke Guidelines and the New Zealand Stroke Network recognized TNK, specifically at a dosage of 0.25 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg), as an alternative for ALT in 2019. By comparing the outcomes of all adult patients treated with ALT in the New Zealand Central Region from January 1 2018 to March 1 2020 with those treated with TNK from March 2 2020 to February 14 2021, it was found that the functional independence at 90 days after switching from ALT to TNK was improved and there was no increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH, sICH). In a recent large RCT trial, TNK was non-inferior to ALT in patients with AIS who were eligible for standard intravenous thrombolysis but ineligible for or refused MT.

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase before stroke thrombectomy: outcomes after system-wide transitions in Pennsylvania [^112VodjW]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

851 patients received IVT and EVT during the study era. Of 851 patients, 635 patients met the prespecified inclusion criteria. Among the 635 analyzed patients, 309 (48.7%) received TNK and 326 (51.3%) TPA prior to EVT (Fig. 1). Baseline demographics were comparable between TNK and TPA patients (Table 1), except for more patients in the TPA group requiring interhospital-transfer for EVT (p < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated similar pre-defined primary outcomes with TNK and TPA. A favorable functional outcome was observed in 47.6% of TNK and 49.7% of TPA patients (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.72 (0.47–1.10), p = 0.13). TNK versus TPA groups had similar rates of successful endovascular reperfusion (93.5% vs. 89.3%, aOR of 1.19 (0.58–2.43), p = 0.627), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (3.2% vs. 3.4%, aOR of 0.54 (0.20–1.44, p = 0.218)) and 90-day all-cause mortality (23.1% vs. 21.5%, aOR of 1.21 (0.71–2.06, p = 0.491)).

Demographics, procedure, and outcome metrics

In a subset analysis of three centers with 517/851 patients, early recanalization was observed in 30/234 (12.8%) TNK and 25/283 (8.8%) TPA patients (p = 0.143). Following the prespecified inclusion criteria, early recanalization was observed in 20/168 (11.9%) TNK and 17/203 (8.4%) TPA cases (p = 0.259). Only lower baseline NIHSS was associated with early recanalization (p < 0.001).

8	USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1	Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are risks to the mother and fetus from acute ST elevation myocardial infarction, which is a medical emergency in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated (see Clinical Considerations). Published data consisting of a small number of case reports involving the use of related thrombolytic agents in pregnant women have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects. There are no data on the use of tenecteplase during pregnancy to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.

TNKase does not elicit maternal and direct embryo toxicity in rabbits following a single IV administration. In developmental toxicity studies conducted in rabbits, the no observable effect level (NOEL) of a single IV administration of TNKase on maternal or developmental toxicity (5 mg/kg) was approximately 7 times human exposure (based on AUC) at the dose for STEMI.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk

Myocardial infarction is a medical emergency which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of potential concerns regarding the effects of tenecteplase on the fetus.

8.2	Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of tenecteplase in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for TNKase and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the TNKase or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4	Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of TNKase in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5	Geriatric Use

In the ASSENT-2 study, 41% (3500/8458) of patients who were treated with TNKase were aged 65 years or older. In this population, rates of 30-day mortality, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage and major bleeds requiring blood transfusion or leading to hemodynamic complications were higher than in those aged less than 65 years.

Thrombolytic reversal agents — management and indications: thrombolytic infusions should be stopped immediately in any patient with acute clinical changes suggestive of intracranial hemorrhage, and hemorrhage should then be confirmed by non-contrast head CT; because fibrinogen levels can still be very low at 24 h and terminal half-lives of alteplase and tenecteplase are longer than urokinase, it is reasonable to administer reversal agents during the first 24 h after thrombolytic exposure; while reversal is indicated in patients with symptomatic deterioration related to intracranial hemorrhage and/or in those with large intraparenchymal hemorrhages with mass effect, patients with small, asymptomatic hemorrhagic conversion of an ischemic stroke may be conservatively managed on a case by case basis after weighing risks and benefits.

Subgroup analyses

Regarding early recanalization, our findings indicate a uniform treatment effect across all subgroups. The trend of the results consistently favored TNK treatment across all subgroups, although the ORs for TNK treatment were not significant in randomized trials, double-blind studies and patients with occlusion of the intracranial anterior circulation (Fig. 4).

Data are odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). n represents the number of events analyzed in the group, while N represents the total patient size of the group

For the outcome of ICH, our analysis did not reveal any treatment effect heterogeneity among the subgroups study approach, occluded site, and NOS study quality, and review system. Notably, the comparison between double-blind randomized trials and non-randomized, non-blind trials showed a significant difference in ICH rates. In double-blind randomized trials, ICH rates did not significantly differ between TNK and ALT treatments, whereas in non-randomized, non-blind trials, the ICH rate was significantly higher for ALT compared to TNK (Fig. 4).

Regarding mortality within 90 days, our analysis did not reveal any treatment effect heterogeneity across all examined subgroups except for the subgroup concerning publication status. Overall, the TNK group exhibited lower mortality within 90 days, although differences in mortality were not significant among non-peer-reviewed studies (Fig. 5).

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase during thrombectomy for acute stroke (BRETIS-TNK II): rationale and design [^114EEmUv]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rescue treatment with balloon angioplasty and/or stenting will be performed according to the following criteria: (1) intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis is highly suspected as a cause of LVO; (2) repeat reocclusion shortly after recanalisation with EVT and (3) flow compromise because of residual stenosis after EVT. Considering stent patency was shown to be associated with the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor during or after the EVT procedure, the safety and potential benefit of low-dose rescue tirofiban during mechanical thrombectomy on clinical outcome of patients with ICAD, an intra-arterial bolus (0.4–0.6 mg), followed by intravenous maintenance dose of 0.1 µg/kg/min tirofiban for a 12–24 hours will be administered. After dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg) overlap, tirofiban will then be stopped.

Outcomes

The primary end point is a favourable outcome, defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0–2 at 90 ± 7 days.

The secondary end points include the proportion of patients with successful reperfusion after the first pass or final pass of EVT, defined as mTICI 2b–3; excellent outcome (defined as mRS 0–1) at 90 ± 7 days; ordinal distribution of mRS at 90 ± 7 days; change in cerebral circulation time after the intervention; early neurological improvement (ENI), which is defined as a 4 point or greater decrease in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) within 24 (–6/+24) hours; change in NIHSS at 24 (–6/+24) hours; the composite of nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular events within 90 ± 7 days.

The primary safety end point is symptomatic ICH (sICH) within 24 (–6/+24) hours, which is defined as an increase in the NIHSS score of ≥ 4 points as a result of the ICH.

### Bridging thrombolysis with tenecteplase versus endovascular thrombectomy alone for large-vessel anterior circulation stroke: a target trial emulation analysis [^113A18LV]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Whether bridging thrombolysis with tenecteplase is beneficial compared with thrombectomy alone in patients who had a stroke with large-vessel occlusion remains unclear.

Methods

This is a causal inference study of observational data from the trials SWIFT DIRECT and EXTEND-IA TNK Parts 1 and 2 applying target trial emulation. We compared patients receiving thrombectomy alone to patients receiving tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg or 0.40 mg/kg before thrombectomy. The primary outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0–2) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included improvement over the full ordinal mRS scale, freedom of disability (mRS 0–1), mortality and occurrence of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. The average causal treatment effect was estimated via inverse probability of treatment weighting and G-Computation. We calculated standardised risk differences (SRDs) and adjusted (common) ORs (a(c)ORs).

Results

Of 377 patients included in the target trial, 187 received thrombectomy alone and 190 tenecteplase before thrombectomy. Tenecteplase before thrombectomy did not increase the probability of patients achieving functional independence (SRD 0.04 (95% CI –0.06 to 0.13)) but resulted in a significant improvement in the mRS overall (acOR 1.56 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.23)) and in a higher probability of freedom from disability (SRD 0.10 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.20)). The probability for improvement of functional outcomes was further increased in patients treated within 140 min after onset (ordinal mRS acOR 1.63 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.56)). No significant differences in safety outcomes were observed between the two groups.

Conclusion

Tenecteplase before thrombectomy compared with thrombectomy alone did not increase the probability of functional independence but resulted in significant improvement over the full mRS scale. This improvement was most evident in patients treated early.

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase before stroke thrombectomy: outcomes after system-wide transitions in Pennsylvania [^114xY7GE]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients > 18 years who received intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and underwent emergent endovascular treatment (EVT) between 01/2020 and 06/2023. Patients either received TPA (0.9 mg/kg) or TNK (0.25 mg/kg) and were then referred for EVT. Patients who did not primarily present to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) required interhospital-transfer within the corresponding stroke system. Administration of IVT and eligibility for EVT followed contemporary AHA/ASA guidelines and stroke system protocols. During the study period, all stroke systems transitioned from TPA to TNK as their primary thrombolytic agent. The four stroke systems serve rural and urban populations across Pennsylvania and its neighboring states (Fig. 1). We prespecified the cohort of interest with the following criteria (i) LKW-to-IVT ≤ 4.5 h, (ii) intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA), M1 and M2 middle cerebral artery (MCA) with and without carotid tandem, and basilar artery (BA) occlusion, (iii) pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) < 3 (Fig. 1). The primary effectiveness outcomes were 90-day mRS 0–2 and successful endovascular reperfusion (TICI 2b-3). The primary safety outcomes were 90-day all-cause mortality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted with prespecified adjustments for age, sex, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), occlusion site, last-known-well (LKW) to intravenous thrombolysis time (IVT), interhospital-transfer, and stroke system (Data Supplement).

Study flowchart

Pre-thrombectomy data points were available from three sites and were used to quantify early recanalization rates in a separate subset analysis. Early recanalization was defined as neurological improvement averting mechanical thrombectomy or evidence of recanalization of the target vessel with reperfusion > 50% on first target vessel angiography.

Institutional review board approval was obtained at each site. Consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study.

### MRI-based microthrombi detection in stroke with polydopamine iron oxide [^113CTcu6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) results from the occlusion of a cerebral artery due to thrombus formation and is the leading cause of acquired disability among adults and the second cause of dementia worldwide. Current strategies for recanalization of the occluded artery encompass thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Thrombolysis consists of the administration of recombinant tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (rtPA: Alteplase) or Tenecteplase (TNK) within a therapeutic time window of 4.5 hours post-onset of symptoms, which may be extended following specific imaging criteria. The utilization of rtPA or TNK remains limited, constituting < 20% of hospital-admitted AIS patients, owing to its manifold contraindications and noteworthy side effects, particularly hemorrhagic transformations. Following a series of clinical trials from 2015 onwards that substantiate the efficacy of recanalization through MT –, this approach has now become integral to the standard care for AIS patients. MT can be employed either in tandem with or as a potential alternative to rtPA-mediated thrombolysis, broadening the scope of AIS patient eligibility for treatment. However, microembolic signals are found in patients treated with thrombolytics, and microfragmentations of the proximal thrombus — denoted as microthrombi — manifesting as distal microvascular migration are observed in 14 to 20% of patients undergoing MT. The persistence of microthrombi despite a successful recanalization of the occluded artery is associated with an increased risk of dementia and unfavorable patient outcomes –. In addition, animal models have reinforced the idea that reperfusion within the microvasculature can positively impact stroke recoveryand in 2022, the CHOICE Clinical Trial investigated the potential benefits of implementing thrombolysis subsequent to successful thrombectomy.
