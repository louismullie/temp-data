## Question

What is the renal dose adjustment for Bactrim?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to adjust Bactrim (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) dosing in renal impairment, including thresholds, special dialysis/CRRT scenarios, high-dose PCP regimens, and monitoring to mitigate toxicity risks, with evidence support and clinical caveats, all in a stepwise plan [^114tB35F] [^114KxHnU] [^113uVBLs] [^116rNx8o].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetics and renal handling because dose adjustment depends on clearance and metabolite accumulation: trimethoprim is largely renally eliminated with prolonged half-life in kidney dysfunction, sulfamethoxazole undergoes hepatic N-acetylation with both parent and N-acetyl metabolite renally cleared, and both components' half-lives increase substantially in severe renal impairment, raising risks of hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and bone marrow suppression, so the PK signal clearly supports renal dosing changes [^113Dx8od] [^114KxHnU] [^116rNx8o] [^113uVBLs].

> Next, I should review the FDA-labeled renal thresholds to anchor the dosing framework before adding PK-model refinements: for CrCl greater than 30 mL/min no dosage adjustment is required, for CrCl 15–30 mL/min reduce dose by 50%, and for CrCl less than 15 mL/min do not use, with the additional labeled contraindication of severe renal insufficiency when renal status cannot be monitored, which should make me cautious in unstable patients or settings without lab access [^114tB35F] [^115uyNcC] [^111sHFGH] [^114ENzGZ].

> For patients with normal to mild impairment, I will now examine the standard dosing and confirm no adjustment is needed: for common infections the usual adult oral regimen is 1 double‑strength tablet every 12 hours, with IV dosing based on the TMP component 8–10 mg/kg/day divided every 6–8 hours, while ensuring periodic monitoring of renal function and potassium given the amiloride‑like effect of trimethoprim on ENaC that can precipitate hyperkalemia, particularly in those with CKD or on RAAS inhibitors [^1167oGXZ] [^114tB35F] [^116rNx8o].

> For moderate impairment with CrCl 15–30 mL/min, I should double‑check the practical adjustment: reduce the total daily dose by 50% such as 1 double‑strength tablet every 24 hours or half a double‑strength tablet every 12 hours for oral therapy, keeping the same dosing interval for IV while halving the daily amount, and I need to ensure early electrolyte checks at day 3–5 with repeat potassium thereafter and weekly CBCs to detect cytopenias early [^115uyNcC] [^111X1VYR] [^117MT2Fp] [^116rNx8o].

> For severe impairment with CrCl less than 15 mL/min, my initial reflex is to state it is contraindicated and should be avoided altogether; wait, let me verify the dialysis carve‑outs because practice nuances matter: FDA labeling says do not use for CrCl less than 15 mL/min and specifically lists severe renal insufficiency without the ability to monitor as a contraindication, but in intermittent hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, guidance aligns dosing with the less‑than‑15 mL/min category and if used, it should be given post‑hemodialysis with very close monitoring, so strictly speaking it is "avoid if possible", and if absolutely necessary administer after dialysis with enhanced labs and clinical surveillance [^111sHFGH] [^114ENzGZ] [^111AWTKc] [^113bCBSJ] [^111kNuFf].

> Now, for CRRT I need to check mechanistic differences because extracorporeal clearance is asymmetric: hold on, I should verify the POPPK data showing CRRT increases sulfamethoxazole clearance but not trimethoprim or N‑acetyl sulfamethoxazole more than population medians, which skews the TMP:SMX ratio and supports model‑based suggestions to increase the SMX component to maintain target exposures, yet I must emphasize these are PK‑model inferences rather than FDA‑labeled instructions, so individualize by CRRT modality and flows and strongly consider therapeutic drug monitoring when high doses are used [^113uVBLs] [^1117T5Wm] [^116jvTrL] [^1157RDUX].

> Considering high‑dose therapy for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, I should confirm the labeled dose first and then reconcile with PK‑guided reductions: standard therapy is 15–20 mg/kg/day of the trimethoprim component divided every 6 hours, but population PK suggests to achieve equivalent exposure a reduction of about 16.7% at eGFR 30 and 33.3% at eGFR 10 mL/min/1.73 m², although many clinicians still default to the conservative 50% FDA reduction when safety is paramount, and emerging clinical data indicate reduced TMP targets can be effective in selected populations, which I should balance against toxicity risks and patient severity [^1167oGXZ] [^113uVBLs] [^1117T5Wm] [^112vmA95].

> Next, I should review monitoring because early detection of predictable toxicities can avert harm: check potassium at baseline and within 3–5 days of initiation and then serially given the well‑documented hyperkalemia signal that amplifies as eGFR declines, monitor sodium given the nontrivial hyponatremia incidence with high‑dose regimens, obtain baseline and periodic creatinine recognizing trimethoprim can artifactually raise serum creatinine by inhibiting tubular secretion without true GFR decline, and perform frequent CBCs to preempt marrow suppression, escalating to therapeutic drug monitoring in high‑dose regimens or CRRT [^116rNx8o] [^116C7QHU] [^114VVtx3] [^114kfagc] [^117MT2Fp].

> I should also confirm key caveats that often confound bedside decisions: trimethoprim's effect on tubular creatinine secretion can mimic AKI by increasing serum creatinine 10–30% without true GFR loss, oral and IV exposures are broadly comparable supporting route flexibility, and elderly patients may exhibit reduced trimethoprim renal clearance and heightened adverse event susceptibility including hyperkalemia and marrow toxicity, warranting conservative dosing and closer surveillance, with awareness of interactions such as increased digoxin levels in older adults [^114kfagc] [^114ZbKia] [^114zDsQs].

> Finally, let me consolidate a practical decision pathway while guarding against premature conclusions in dynamic renal function: first, estimate creatinine clearance with Cockcroft–Gault and recheck frequently in AKI rather than hard‑coding a single dose, second, identify whether standard dosing or high‑dose PCP therapy is intended, third, apply FDA thresholds for initial adjustment while considering PK‑modeled refinements in stable CKD or during CRRT with TDM support, and fourth, implement the monitoring plan rigorously and be ready to adjust or discontinue promptly if hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, rising creatinine out of proportion, or cytopenias emerge, remembering that early under‑ or over‑adjustment in rapidly changing kidney function can harm patients and warrants a cautious, reassessment‑driven approach [^114tB35F] [^116dZUzY] [^115VxTvA] [^112xowH7].

Bactrim requires renal dose adjustment because both components are renally cleared and accumulate in impairment, increasing toxicity risk [^114KxHnU] [^114ZbKia] [^113Dx8od]. Reduce dose by 50% for CrCl 15–30 mL/min [^115uyNcC] and avoid use if CrCl < 15 mL/min unless benefits clearly outweigh risks and close monitoring is ensured [^111sHFGH]. For hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, dose as for CrCl < 15 mL/min [^111AWTKc] [^111FwNvi]; for CRRT, adjust based on modality and flow rates [^116jvTrL] [^1157RDUX] [^113uVBLs]. Monitor renal function [^116dZUzY], potassium, and CBC; watch for hyperkalemia [^116rNx8o] [^116C7QHU], hyponatremia [^114VVtx3], and hematologic toxicity [^114zDsQs].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and renal clearance

Regarding pharmacokinetics, trimethoprim is primarily eliminated unchanged via renal excretion, with a half-life of ~8–10 hours that is prolonged in renal impairment [^113Dx8od]. Sulfamethoxazole is metabolized mainly by N4-acetylation, with ~16% excreted unchanged and ~46% as N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, and has a half-life of ~10 hours that is also prolonged in renal impairment [^114ZbKia]. Renal impairment increases half-lives and plasma concentrations, necessitating dose adjustments to prevent toxicity [^114ZbKia] [^114KxHnU] [^113uVBLs].

## Recommended renal dose adjustments

| **Renal function (CrCl)** | **Recommended dose adjustment** |
|-|-|
| > 30 mL/min | No adjustment required [^114tB35F] [^117P8BZU] |
| 15–30 mL/min | Reduce dose by 50% [^115uyNcC] [^111X1VYR] |
| < 15 mL/min | Avoid use unless benefits outweigh risks and close monitoring is possible [^111sHFGH] [^114ENzGZ] |

---

## Dialysis considerations

- **Hemodialysis**: Dose as for CrCl < 15 mL/min [^111AWTKc] [^113bCBSJ].
- **Peritoneal dialysis**: Dose as for CrCl < 15 mL/min [^111FwNvi] [^111kNuFf].
- **Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)**: Adjust based on modality and flow rates [^116jvTrL] [^1157RDUX] [^113uVBLs].

---

## Clinical monitoring and safety considerations

- **Renal function**: Monitor serum creatinine and eGFR regularly [^1157QyjE].
- **Electrolytes**: Monitor potassium closely due to hyperkalemia risk, especially in renal impairment or with other hyperkalemia-inducing drugs [^116rNx8o] [^116C7QHU].
- **Hematologic toxicity**: Monitor CBC for bone marrow suppression, particularly in elderly or prolonged use [^114zDsQs] [^117MT2Fp].
- **Hyponatremia**: Monitor sodium, especially with high-dose therapy [^114VVtx3] [^116rNx8o].

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks of inappropriate dosing

In renal impairment, **inappropriate dosing increases adverse events** and poor outcomes [^111DPMjP], including hyperkalemia [^116C7QHU], hematologic toxicity, and treatment failure [^116qDd6t]. Accurate **renal function assessment** and **adherence to dosing guidelines** are essential to minimize these risks [^111DPMjP] [^116dZUzY].

---

## Special populations

Among special populations, **elderly patients** are at increased risk of severe adverse reactions, so the dose should be adjusted with close monitoring [^114zDsQs] [^112uUetQ]. For **pediatric patients**, the drug is contraindicated in infants < 2 months, and dosing should be adjusted based on renal function [^1167oGXZ] [^114U46H5].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **CrCl > 30 mL/min**: No adjustment required [^114tB35F] [^117P8BZU].
- **CrCl 15–30 mL/min**: Reduce dose by 50% [^115uyNcC] [^111X1VYR].
- **CrCl < 15 mL/min**: Avoid use unless benefits outweigh risks and close monitoring is possible [^111sHFGH] [^114ENzGZ].
- **Dialysis**: Dose as for CrCl < 15 mL/min [^111AWTKc] [^111FwNvi].
- **CRRT**: Adjust based on modality and flow rates [^116jvTrL] [^1157RDUX] [^113uVBLs].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor renal function, electrolytes, and hematologic parameters [^116rNx8o] [^117MT2Fp].

### Incidence of hyponatremia with high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole exposure [^114VVtx3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a commonly prescribed antibiotic used at high doses for the treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia and other infections. Trimethoprim is structurally related to the potassium-sparing diuretic amiloride and has been associated with hyperkalemia and hyponatremia through the blocking of epithelial sodium channels in the distal nephron. The incidence of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients treated with high-dose TMP-SMX is unknown.

- **Methods**: We performed a single-center retrospective chart review of all hospitalized patients who received high-dose TMP-SMX (n = 235) from January 2012 to July 2014. Patients with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², baseline hyponatremia, and those on other medications associated with hyponatremia were excluded. Hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium level < 136 mEq/L.

- **Results**: Analysis was restricted to 76 unique patients who received more than 8 mg/kg/d of TMP for ≥ 3 days. Mean starting serum sodium at the time of TMP-SMX initiation was 138.4 ± 2.1 mEq/L. Fifty-five patients (72.3%) developed hyponatremia while on therapy, of which 43.6% (n = 24) were cases of serum sodium < 130 mEq/L. Mean sodium at the time of nadir was 131.6 ± 5.1 mEq/L. Hyponatremia was noted, on average, 5.5 days after initiation of therapy, with more severe hyponatremia development among African American patients. Urine sodium concentrations were available for 40.0% (22/55) of incident hyponatremia cases, with a mean urinary sodium of 104.8 ± 55.9 mEq/L.

**Geriatric use**: Clinical studies of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g. impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function, and the duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections). The trimethoprim component of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism or with renal insufficiency.

Regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole PO (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra) in patients with CrCl 15–30 mL/min, the following guidelines are recommended:

- **Dosage adjustment**: Reduce dose by 50%.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor renal function and watch for hyperkalemia.
- **Severe renal insufficiency**: Do not use if renal status cannot be monitored.

### Bactrim [^116rNx8o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Electrolyte abnormalities:

- **Hyperkalemia**: High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase in serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients.

- **Hyponatremia**: Severe and symptomatic hyponatremia can occur in patients receiving Bactrim, particularly for the treatment of P. jirovecii pneumonia. Evaluation for hyponatremia and appropriate correction is necessary in symptomatic patients to prevent life-threatening complications.

- **Crystalluria**: During treatment, ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are "slow acetylators" may be more prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^1117T5Wm]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

- **Results**: A total of 168 patients (16 LUMC, 116 Erasmus MC, and 36 UMCG) were included in this study. The population was predominantly male (64.3%) and the median age was 58 years. The median eGFR, based on the CKD-EPI formula, was 70 mL/minute/1.73 m², and 18 patients (10.7%) were concomitantly treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The most frequently used initial dosing regimen was cotrimoxazole TID 1,920 mg (48.2%) and intravenous infusion was the most common route of administration (55.4%).

- **Data availability**: In total, 348 sulfamethoxazole and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole concentrations were available for analysis. Trimethoprim concentrations were only measured in two of the three participating hospitals, with 137 concentrations from 52 patients (16 LUMC and 36 UMCG) available for the trimethoprim model. The concentrations included both peak and trough concentrations. Sulfamethoxazole concentrations ranged between 2 and 380 mg/L, N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole between 2 and 173.4 mg/L, and trimethoprim concentrations were between 0.2 and 15.6 mg/L.

Lamivudine:

- **Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole**: Co-administration of TMP/SMX with lamivudine resulted in an increase of 43% ± 23% (mean ± SD) in lamivudine AUC∞, a decrease of 29% ± 13% in lamivudine oral clearance, and a decrease of 30% ± 36% in lamivudine renal clearance. The pharmacokinetic properties of TMP and SMX were not altered by co-administration with lamivudine.

- **Sorbitol (excipient)**: Co-administration of lamivudine with a single dose of 3.2 grams, 10.2 grams, or 13.4 grams of sorbitol resulted in dose-dependent decreases of 14%, 32%, and 36% in the AUC∞; and 28%, 52%, and 55% in the Cmax of lamivudine, respectively.

TDF:

No clinically significant changes in exposure were observed for tenofovir when co-administered with tacrolimus or entecavir. No clinically significant changes in exposure were observed for the following drugs when co-administered with tenofovir: tacrolimus, entecavir, methadone, or ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate.

Mechanism of action:

- **Doravirine**: Doravirine is a pyridinone non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor of HIV-1 and inhibits HIV-1 replication by non-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). The inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC₅₀) of doravirine for RNA-dependent DNA polymerization of recombinant wild-type HIV-1 RT in a biochemical assay was 12.2 ± 2.0 nM (n = 3). Doravirine does not inhibit the human cellular DNA polymerases α, β, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.

- **Lamivudine**: Lamivudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue. Intracellularly, lamivudine is phosphorylated to its active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, lamivudine.

### An IQ industry perspective on informing dosing recommendations in patients with renal impairment [^116s8vQa]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, analysis methods frequently used by responders included both pairwise comparison (GMR (Renal Impairment/Control) and 90% CI) and regression analysis for dedicated renal impairment study data. Some preferred pairwise comparison as it is a simple and commonly used method, especially for reduced design studies. Others favored regression analysis because it utilizes the totality of data, minimizes the impact of outliers, is amenable to extrapolation, and allows for comparison of data across studies, making it more informative. Both methods were presented in the clinical study report. However, regulators now recommend regression analysis (or mathematical models) as the preferred method due to its potential for identifying more clinically meaningful thresholds for dose modification.

For deriving dosing recommendations in renal impairment participants, most responders preferred matching based on point estimate (GMR RI to Healthy in dedicated RI study) due to its simplicity and ease of implementation, especially given the limited sample size in these studies, which makes a CI-based approach impractical. Some responders preferred matching based on confidence intervals (CI of the mean in RI to a predefined "no-effect boundary") as it was considered practical and clinically relevant. A small number of responders also preferred matching to the exposure range (10th–90th percentile) observed in clinical trials.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^116oAAwA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Cotrimoxazole is an antibiotic combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. The drug disrupts the production of essential nucleic acids needed for bacterial proliferation and replication by synergistically inhibiting two consecutive enzymatic steps involved in bacterial folinic acid synthesis. It has excellent tissue penetration and is, therefore, used for the treatment of various infections, ranging from those caused by more resistant pathogens (ESBL+ E. coli, MRSA) to Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).

Trimethoprim is primarily eliminated through nonionic renal diffusion, with 40–75% of the drug recovered unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. Sulfamethoxazole is extensively metabolized into inactive metabolites which are renally excreted. Approximately 16% of sulfamethoxazole is eliminated unchanged and 46% as N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, the predominant metabolite. Although N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole lacks relevant antibacterial activity, this metabolite has been associated with concentration-dependent toxicity due to accumulation in patients with renal impairment. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is therefore recommended in patients with impaired renal function receiving high-dose cotrimoxazole.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^114Ra6et]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic modeling was conducted using nonlinear mixed‐effects modeling (NONMEM) with the first‐order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCE‐I) for POPPK model building. Two different POPPK models were developed:

- **Trimethoprim model**: Describes the population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim.
- **Integrated model**: Describes the pharmacokinetics of sulfamethoxazole and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole.

For all three components, one‐ and two‐compartment models with first‐order elimination were explored during the structural model development. Oral absorption was modeled using first‐order absorption and biological availability was estimated. A lag time on oral absorption was evaluated. No urine concentrations were available for sulfamethoxazole or N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole; therefore, 40% of the total sulfamethoxazole clearance was estimated to be converted to N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole. Additive, proportional, and combined error models were tested for residual variability in drug concentrations. Inter‐individual variation was tested for all PK parameters. The structural model selection was based on reduction of the objective function value (OFV), which approximates a χ² distribution for nested models, with a ΔOFV of 3.84 corresponding to a P-value of 0.05, goodness‐of‐fit (GOF) plots, shrinkage, and precision of pharmacokinetic parameter estimates.

Biologically plausible patient characteristics were tested for inclusion as covariates to investigate potential factors that may impact the pharmacokinetics of the three components. This included age.

### Does dose reduction of renally cleared antibiotics in patients with impaired renal function lead to adequate drug exposure? A systematic review [^116qDd6t]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Low credibility.

There is inconsistency between many guidelines in the recommended dose reduction of renally cleared antibiotics in patients with impaired renal function. This systematic review summarizes the available evidence on the adequacy of the recommended dose reduction in terms of achieving sufficient antibiotic drug exposure or pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment after treatment with these reduced doses.

- **Data sources**: We systematically searched Ovid Medline and Embase from their inception (1946 and 1947, respectively) through July 2019.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: All studies reporting antibiotic drug exposure and/or PK/PD target attainment after dose reduction of antibiotics in patients with impaired renal function were eligible.

- **Participants**: Adult patients with or without infections were included.

- **Interventions**: Administration of reduced doses of antibiotics (orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly) was examined.

- **Methods**: The reduced dose was considered adequate when the most relevant parameters of drug exposure or PK/PD target attainment in patients with impaired renal function were within a range of 80% to 125% of those patients with adequate renal function receiving a regular dose (reference) or when PK/PD target attainment was attained in at least 90% of the patients with impaired renal function, regardless of the lack of a reference group.

Results showed that twenty-seven of the 4202 identified studies were included. The quality of 15 of these 27 studies was considered fair, with most studies focusing on β-lactams (12 out of 27). Best evidence was available for meropenem across four studies.

### An IQ industry perspective on informing dosing recommendations in patients with renal impairment [^114sxfSX]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

With regards to enrollment of severe renal impairment versus ND-ESRD (non-dialysis dependent — end-stage renal disease) participants in dedicated renal impairment studies, most survey participants recommended enrollment of severe renal impairment participants over ND-ESRD participants. The justification is that ND-ESRD participants constitute a vulnerable population which is difficult to enroll. Additionally, ND-ESRD participants are at risk of progressing into dialysis dependent — end-stage renal disease (DD-ESRD) very quickly, sometimes during the trial. Participants with severe renal impairment are considered more stable in terms of renal function compared to ND-ESRD participants.

Per the recently issued FDA and EMA guidance, PK data in participants with DD-ESRD are recommended to be collected for drugs likely to be administered to these patients. This helps determine the contribution of the specific replacement modality (e.g. intermittent hemodialysis) to the elimination of the drug and its potentially active metabolites.

Survey responders indicated that challenges with enrolling ND-ESRD or severe RI subjects in a dedicated RI study included participant availability, safety of the drug in this population, and the impact of concomitant medications. Dialysis schedules and fluctuating renal function in the subjects were other challenges in conducting a study in DD-ESRD subjects. These challenges could be mitigated by using multiple, experienced, and/or dedicated sites, increased advertising, staged enrollment, and dose reduction/up-titration.

This study indicates that appropriate dose adjustment was not done for patients with renal impairment by practitioners in a significant percentage of patients. This finding highlights the necessity of providing doctors with information and guidelines for dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment to prevent poor clinical outcomes and toxicity resulting from dosing errors in such patients.

### Drug dosing adjustments in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1157QyjE]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects renal drug elimination and other pharmacokinetic processes involved in drug disposition, such as absorption, drug distribution, and nonrenal clearance (metabolism). Drug dosing errors are common in patients with renal impairment and can cause adverse effects and poor outcomes. Dosages of drugs cleared renally should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate and should be calculated using online or electronic calculators. Recommended methods for maintenance dosing adjustments include dose reductions, lengthening the dosing interval, or both. Physicians should be familiar with commonly used medications that require dosage adjustments. Resources are available to assist in dosing decisions for patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^113uVBLs]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

Cotrimoxazole is an antibiotic combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Sulfamethoxazole peak concentrations above 100 mg/L and trimethoprim concentrations greater than 5 mg/L have been associated with clinical effectiveness for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Concentrations of sulfamethoxazole greater than 200 mg/L, its metabolite N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole greater than 75 mg/L, and trimethoprim greater than 15 mg/L are associated with toxicity. All three components are cleared to some extent by renal clearance.

- **What question did this study address**: Which dosing regimens of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should be used to reach the target concentrations for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and which dose adjustments are needed for patients with renal insufficiency or with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)?

- **What does this study add to our knowledge**: TID 1,920 mg and b.i.d. 2,400 mg lead to sufficient exposure for infections with P. jirovecii in patients without renal insufficiency. To reach equivalent exposure, a dose reduction of 33.3% is needed in patients with an eGFR of 10 mL/minute/1.73 m² and of 16.7% for an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m². N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulates in patients with reduced eGFR. CRRT increased the clearance of sulfamethoxazole, but not trimethoprim or N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, compared with the median clearance in the population.

- **How might this change clinical pharmacology or translational science**: The dosing regimens suggested in this study offer guidelines for optimizing treatment in patients with altered renal function or those receiving CRRT, potentially improving therapeutic outcomes and minimizing toxicity.

### Tazicef [^112Tr3wm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The usual adult dosage of Tazicef (ceftazidime for injection, USP) is 1 gram administered intravenously or intramuscularly every 8 to 12 hours. The dosage and route should be determined by the susceptibility of the causative organisms, the severity of the infection, and the patient's condition and renal function.

- **Dosage schedule**: The guidelines for the dosage are recommended as follows:

	- **Impaired hepatic function**: No adjustment in dosage is required for patients with hepatic dysfunction.

	- **Impaired renal function**: Ceftazidime is excreted by the kidneys, almost exclusively through glomerular filtration. Therefore, in patients with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 50 mL/min), it is recommended that the dosage of ceftazidime be reduced to compensate for its slower excretion. In patients with suspected renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram of ceftazidime may be given. An estimate of GFR should be made to determine the appropriate maintenance dosage.

When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft's equation) may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^115UFTP1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

The goal of the study was to describe the population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole in hospitalized patients. Furthermore, this study used the model to optimize dosing regimens of cotrimoxazole for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and in patients with renal insufficiency or with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). This was a retrospective multicenter observational cohort study based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data from hospitalized patients treated with cotrimoxazole.

We developed two population pharmacokinetic (POPPK) models: a model of trimethoprim and an integrated model with both sulfamethoxazole and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole concentrations. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the optimal dosing regimen. A total of 348 measurements from 168 patients were available. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and CRRT were included as covariates on the clearance of all three compounds. Cotrimoxazole TID 1,920 mg and b.i.d. 2,400 mg led to sufficient exposure for infections with P. jirovecii in patients without renal insufficiency. To reach equivalent exposure, a dose reduction of 33.3% is needed in patients with an eGFR of 10 mL/minute/1.73 m² and of 16.7% for an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m².

N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulates in patients with a reduced eGFR. CRRT increased the clearance of sulfamethoxazole, but not trimethoprim or N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, compared with the median clearance in the population. Doubling the sulfamethoxazole dose is needed for patients on CRRT to reach optimal therapeutic levels.

### Sulfatrim [^117MT2Fp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections, such as the common cold. When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that while it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Patients should be instructed to maintain an adequate fluid intake to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics and usually resolves when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes, after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools, with or without stomach cramps and fever, even two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. If a significant reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be discontinued.

eGFR and CRRT were included as covariates in both models. As expected, it was observed that the inclusion of eGFR had a more significant impact on the clearance of N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole compared with sulfamethoxazole. The primary clearance route for sulfamethoxazole is liver metabolism, with less than 30% being recovered unchanged in urine. In contrast, N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole is mainly cleared renally, leading to its accumulation in patients with reduced eGFR. For trimethoprim, the association between eGFR and clearance was also as expected, since the primary elimination route is renal clearance, with only a small percentage of metabolism or biliary excretion.

The final model was used to generate dose recommendations for PCP and dose reductions in case of renal insufficiency. A starting dose of TID 1,920 mg or b.i.d. 2,400 mg for PCP will result in sufficient exposure in the majority of patients. TID 1,920 mg has a larger risk of concentrations above the target range while b.i.d. 2,400 mg has a larger risk of underexposure. Because of the large inter-individual variability (IIV), TDM should be considered to improve the percentage of patients within the target range. Patients with an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m² require a dose reduction of 16.7%, and patients with an eGFR of 10 mL/minute/1.73 m² a dose reduction of 33.3% to reach similar exposure to patients without renal insufficiency. The risk of concentrations above the target range increases with doses in patients with a low eGFR. Therefore, for infections requiring high‐dose cotrimoxazole like PCP or infections caused by Nocardia spp.

### Bactrim [^114U46H5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim distribute to sputum, vaginal fluid, and middle ear fluid; trimethoprim also distributes to bronchial secretion, and both pass the placental barrier and are excreted in human milk.

- **Pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients**: A simulation conducted with data from a pharmacokinetic study in 153 infants and children demonstrated that the mean steady-state AUC and maximum plasma concentration of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole would be comparable between pediatric patients 2 months to 18 years receiving 8/40 (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours and adult patients receiving 320/1600 (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) mg/day.

- **Pharmacokinetics in geriatric patients**: The pharmacokinetics of sulfamethoxazole 800 mg and trimethoprim 160 mg were studied in 6 geriatric subjects (mean age: 78.6 years) and 6 young healthy subjects (mean age: 29.3 years) using a non-US approved formulation. Pharmacokinetic values for sulfamethoxazole in geriatric subjects were similar to those observed in young adult subjects. The mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was significantly lower in geriatric subjects compared with young adult subjects (19 mL/h/kg vs. 55 mL/h/kg). However, after normalizing by body weight, the apparent total body clearance of trimethoprim was on average 19% lower in geriatric subjects compared with young adult subjects.

### Sulfatrim [^114ZbKia]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**: Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Both exist in the blood as unbound, protein-bound, and metabolized forms; sulfamethoxazole also exists in the conjugated form. The metabolism of sulfamethoxazole occurs predominantly by N4-acetylation, although the glucuronide conjugate has been identified. The principal metabolites of trimethoprim include the 1- and 3-oxides and the 3'- and 4'-hydroxy derivatives. The free forms of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are considered to be therapeutically active. Approximately 70% of sulfamethoxazole and 44% of trimethoprim bind to plasma proteins. The presence of 10 mg percent sulfamethoxazole in plasma decreases the protein binding of trimethoprim insignificantly; conversely, trimethoprim does not influence the protein binding of sulfamethoxazole.

	- Peak blood levels for the individual components occur 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. The mean serum half-lives of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are 10 and 8 to 10 hours, respectively. However, patients with severely impaired renal function exhibit increased half-lives for both components, necessitating dosage regimen adjustment. Detectable amounts of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are present in the blood 24 hours after drug administration. During administration of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim twice daily, the mean steady-state plasma concentration of trimethoprim was 1.72 µg/mL.

### Trimethoprim [^116PJ1Td]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The usual oral adult dosage is 100 mg of trimethoprim every 12 hours or 200 mg of trimethoprim every 24 hours, each for 10 days. The use of trimethoprim in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 15 mL/min is not recommended. For patients with a creatinine clearance of 15 to 30 mL/min, the dose should be 50 mg every 12 hours.

### Bactrim [^1167oGXZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: BACTRIM is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 months of age.

- **Urinary tract infections, shigellosis in adults and pediatric patients, and acute otitis media in children**:
	- **Adults**: The usual adult dosage for treating urinary tract infections is 1 BACTRIM DS (double strength) tablet or 2 BACTRIM tablets every 12 hours for 10 to 14 days. An identical daily dosage is used for 5 days in the treatment of shigellosis.
	- **Children**: The recommended dose for children with urinary tract infections or acute otitis media is 40 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole and 8 mg/kg trimethoprim per 24 hours, given in two divided doses every 12 hours for 10 days. An identical daily dosage is used for 5 days in the treatment of shigellosis.

- **For patients with impaired renal function**: When renal function is impaired, a reduced dosage should be employed.

- **Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in adults**: The usual adult dosage for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis is 1 BACTRIM DS (double strength) tablet or 2 BACTRIM tablets every 12 hours for 14 days.

- **Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia treatment**:
	- **Adults and children**: The recommended dosage for treating patients with documented Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is 75 to 100 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole and 15 to 20 mg/kg trimethoprim per 24 hours, given in equally divided doses every 6 hours for 14 to 21 days.

### Sulfatrim [^112uUetQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension should be administered with caution to patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, those with possible folate deficiency (e.g. the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states), and those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma. In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur, and this reaction is frequently dose-related (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

- **Use in the elderly**: Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are seen rarely, usually occurring following a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or those receiving high doses of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are particularly at risk. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients, or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy.

Trimethoprim has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism, but this is of no significance in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary restriction.

As with all drugs containing sulfonamides, caution is advised.

### Drug dosage adjustment in hospitalized patients with renal impairment at Tikur Anbessa specialized hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia [^113xvs6z]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

The present study evaluated drug dosage adjustment in hospitalized patients with renal impairment. The prevalence of renal impairment was 9% of internal medicine ward admissions. When compared to the study by Decloedt et al, which reported a prevalence of 32%, this figure is relatively low. This discrepancy may be attributed to our use of a serum creatinine cutoff point, rather than estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), to define renal impairment, which could have led to some cases of renal impairment being missed.

The study also assessed the proportion of patients receiving appropriately adjusted drug doses. In this study, 74% of the patients received at least one drug that required dose adjustment, meaning 26% did not require any dose adjustment. These patients might have been prescribed medications that either did not require dosage adjustments or were provided with alternative drugs to avoid nephrotoxic effects. Among those who received medications necessitating dose adjustments, 15 patients (28%) had all their drugs correctly adjusted, 22 patients (41%) had some drugs properly adjusted, while 17 patients (31%) had no drugs correctly adjusted.

In contrast, the Decloedt et al. study reported that 71% of patients received at least one drug requiring dose adjustments. However, only 12% of patients had all their drugs correctly adjusted, some drugs were correctly adjusted in 29% of patients, and no drug was correctly adjusted in 59% of patients. This indicates that there remains significant room for improvement in dose adjustment practices. Nonetheless, our findings were notably better compared to a similar study conducted in South Africa.

- **Monitoring**: Monitor renal function and for hyperkalemia.
- **Severe renal insufficiency**: Do not use if renal status cannot be monitored.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^114BSxFS]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

We conducted a population pharmacokinetic study of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in hospitalized patients. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the largest cohort to date and is the only population pharmacokinetic analysis to include trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole.

The pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole were accurately described by one-compartment models. The clearance and volume of distribution observed in our population were similar to values published in the literature for both trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole in healthy individuals and other cohorts of hospitalized patients. To our knowledge, there is no previously published information on the pharmacokinetics of N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole in the currently available literature.

The bioavailability of both trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole was close to 100%, which aligns with previous studies and indicates that even in severely ill patients, oral administration of cotrimoxazole is a viable method. Inter-individual variation was large for both trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, which may be explained by the heterogeneous population in this study or other unmeasured variables affecting the pharmacokinetics. Generally, the model performance was good, except for some imprecision in the estimation of the absorption constant for trimethoprim. This discrepancy is likely due to the smaller sample size and the use of routinely collected data, which may introduce some uncertainty regarding the exact measurements.

### Drug dosage adjustment in hospitalized patients with renal impairment at Tikur Anbessa specialized hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia [^115Khseo]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Dose adjustment for certain drugs is required in patients with reduced renal function to avoid toxicity, as many drugs are eliminated by the kidneys. The aim of this study was to assess whether appropriate dosage adjustments were made in hospitalized patients with renal impairment.

- **Methods**: A prospective cross-sectional study was carried out in the internal medicine wards of Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital. All patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 59 ml/min admitted to the hospital between April and July 2013 were included in the analysis. Data regarding serum creatinine level, age, sex, and prescribed drugs and their dosage was collected from the patients' medical records. A serum creatinine level ≥ 1.2 mg/dL was used as a cutoff point in the pre-selection of patients. The estimated creatinine clearance was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation. The Guideline for Drug Prescribing in Renal Failure provided by the American College of Physicians was used as the standard for dose adjustment.

- **Results**: Nine percent (73/810) of medical admissions were found to have renal impairment (CrCl ≤ 59 ml/min). There were 372 prescription entries for 73 patients with renal impairment. Dose adjustment was required in 31% (115/372) of prescription entries, and fifty-eight (51%) prescription entries requiring dose adjustment were found to be inappropriate. Of 73 patients, 54 patients received ≥ 1 drug that required dose adjustment (median 2; range 1–6). Fifteen (28%) patients had all of their drugs appropriately adjusted, while twenty-two (41%) patients had some drugs appropriate.

### Treatment with reduced-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective in mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies [^112vmA95]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

The treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in patients with hematologic malignancies was explored. The median initial corrected treatment doses were 11.6 mg TMP/kg/day (range 7.9–14.8 mg TMP/kg/day) for the reduced-dose group and 16.7 mg TMP/kg/day (range 15.1–20 mg TMP/kg/day) for the standard-dose group. It was observed that 19 out of 33 patients (58%) in the standard-dose group required dose reductions after the first two full days of treatment, resulting in a mean corrected daily dose of TMP-SMX of ≤ 15 mg/kg on days 3–7. Conversely, only 1 out of 80 patients in the reduced-dose group had an increased dose, leading to a mean corrected daily dose of TMP-SMX > 15 mg/kg on days 3–7. Notably, this patient was not categorized as a clinical failure according to the medical records, and the reason for dose escalation was not known.

- **Initial treatment dose distribution**: The initial treatment dose corresponds to the mean daily dose per kilogram of trimethoprim (TMP), corrected for renal function, during the first and second days of full daily treatment. Horizontal lines in the corresponding figure represent median values, boxes extend from the 25th to the 75th percentile, and whiskers indicate the minimum and maximum values.

Details regarding PJP treatment and duration of TMP-SMX are presented in Table 2. Eighty patients received < 21 days of TMP-SMX, with a median treatment duration of 14 days (range, 2–20 days). Clinical cure was the reason for discontinuation in 58 of these 80 patients, with a median TMP-SMX duration of 14.5 days.

### Renal dosing of antibiotics: Are we jumping the gun [^112xowH7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Antibiotic renal dose adjustments are determined in patients with stable chronic kidney disease and may not translate to patients in late-phase trials and practice. Ceftolozane/tazobactam, ceftazidime/avibactam, and telavancin all carry precautionary statements for reduced clinical response in patients with baseline creatinine clearance of 30–50 mL/min, potentially due to unnecessary dose reduction in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI).

- **Regulatory landscape**: In this review, we discuss the regulatory landscape for antibiotics eliminated by the kidney and highlight the importance of the first 48 hours of therapy. Using a clinical database, we identified AKI on admission in a substantial proportion of patients with pneumonia (27.1%), intraabdominal (19.5%), urinary tract (20.0%), or skin and skin structure infections (9.7%) that resolved by 48 hours in 57.2% of cases.

We suggest that deferred renal dose reduction of wide therapeutic index antibiotics could improve outcomes in patients with infectious diseases.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^112XBvAd]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

We did not estimate the optimal dosing regimens for infections other than PCP. In the literature, target concentrations have been suggested for infections caused by other pathogens; however, these target concentrations are based predominantly on in vitro studies and are not clinically validated. For PCP, the evidence for the target range is also limited to small studies; therefore, larger studies are needed to establish the optimal concentrations for effectiveness.

To further optimize the dosing regimens of cotrimoxazole, additional research is needed to investigate its PK/PD, PK/toxicity, post-antibiotic effect, and tissue penetration. In a murine thigh model, AUC/MIC was found to best predict the effectiveness for MRSA infections. However, T > MIC, Cmax > MIC, and species-dependent associations have also been suggested. Based on the specific association for a certain pathogen, alternative dosing regimens could be explored.

For instance, beta-lactam antibiotics are often administered via continuous infusion because T > MIC best predicts their effectiveness. If T > MIC is also a predictor of cotrimoxazole's effectiveness, shortening the dose interval or using continuous infusion might be beneficial. If Cmax best predicts the effectiveness and there is sufficient post-antibiotic effect, high doses with a prolonged dosing interval might be more effective. Furthermore, because of the high tissue penetration of both trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, the target site concentrations might be higher compared with plasma concentrations and require alternative dosing regimens based on these findings.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for melioidosis in patients receiving hemodialysis in the tropics? One size does not fit all [^116XWR1N]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Melioidosis has a high case fatality rate and is more common in patients with chronic kidney disease. Some authors recommended trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis for all hemodialysis (HD) patients during the wet season in melioidosis-endemic regions. Historical data were reviewed to determine if TMP/SMX prophylaxis was warranted in the HD population of Far North Queensland, Australia. Between 1997 and 2017, there were 242 culture-confirmed cases of melioidosis in the region; three (1.2%) occurred in HD patients, and all survived without intensive care support.

During the study period, there were 843 HD patients in the region with 3,024 cumulative patient years of risk. Even assuming 100% efficacy, it would have been necessary to prescribe TMP/SMX for 1,008 patient years to prevent one case of melioidosis. Given the significant additional cost and potentially life-threatening side effects of TMP/SMX therapy, clinicians should review the local epidemiology of melioidosis before the implementation of universal TMP/SMX prophylaxis in their HD population.

### Bactrim [^1145k1Sg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug/laboratory test interactions**: Bactrim, specifically the trimethoprim component, can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as determined by the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is used as the binding protein. No interference occurs if methotrexate is measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). The presence of Bactrim may also interfere with the Jaffé alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, resulting in overestimations of about 10% in the range of normal values.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**:

	- **Carcinogenesis**: Sulfamethoxazole was not carcinogenic when assessed in a 26-week tumorigenic mouse (Tg-rasH2) study at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day sulfamethoxazole, equivalent to 2.4-fold the human systemic exposure (at a daily dose of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole twice a day).

	- **Mutagenesis**: In vitro reverse mutation bacterial tests according to the standard protocol have not been performed with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination. An in vitro chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim was negative. During in vitro and in vivo tests in animal species, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not damage chromosomes. In vivo micronucleus assays were positive following oral administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Observations of leukocytes obtained from patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim revealed no chromosomal abnormalities. Sulfamethoxazole alone was positive in an in vitro reverse mutation bacterial assay.

### An IQ industry perspective on informing dosing recommendations in patients with renal impairment [^111BxSXU]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

The International Consortium for Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development (IQ) Organ Impairment Working Group (WG) conducted a survey in 2020 among member pharmaceutical companies to collect information on the approaches and experiences for evaluating the impact of kidney function impairment on drugs under development and informing dosing recommendations.

IQ is a not-for-profit organization of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with a mission of advancing science and technology to augment the capability of member companies to develop transformational solutions that benefit patients, regulators, and the broader research and development community. The mission of the IQ Organ Impairment Working Group is to enhance the paradigm for informing dosing recommendations for patients with organ impairment. Among others, the objectives of the working group are to map out multiple pathways to facilitate the inclusion of participants with organ impairment in Phase 2/3 studies and to enhance practices for conducting Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies in participants with organ impairment.

Aligned with the WG mission and prompted by the draft FDA guidance on renal impairment (RI) studies issued in 2020, the WG conducted a survey to understand how various member companies develop dosing recommendations for patients with renal impairment. The survey questions were related to whether and how dedicated renal impairment studies are conducted, the timing of the study in relation to the overall drug development program, and the formulae utilized for kidney function assessment.

- **Dosage adjustments in adult patients with renal impairment**: Levetiracetam dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults with renal impairment are based on creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area. Information is unavailable for dosage adjustments in pediatric patients with renal impairment. To calculate the dose for adult patients, an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be determined using a standard formula.

	1Following dialysis, a 250 to 500 mg supplemental dose is recommended.

- **Discontinuation of levetiracetam**: Avoid abrupt withdrawal from levetiracetam to reduce the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^115L8NWi]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

The goal of the study was to describe the population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole in hospitalized patients. The study utilized a model to optimize dosing regimens of cotrimoxazole for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia as well as in patients with renal insufficiency or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

This retrospective multicenter observational cohort study was based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data from hospitalized patients treated with cotrimoxazole. We developed two population pharmacokinetic (POPPK) models: a model of trimethoprim and an integrated model with both sulfamethoxazole and N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole concentrations. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the optimal dosing regimen.

A total of 348 measurements from 168 patients were available. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and CRRT were included as covariates on the clearance of all three compounds. Cotrimoxazole TID 1,920 mg and b.i.d. 2,400 mg led to sufficient exposure for infections with P. jirovecii in patients without renal insufficiency. To reach equivalent exposure, a dose reduction of 33.3% is needed in patients with an eGFR of 10 mL/min/1.73 m² and of 16.7% for an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m². N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulates in patients with reduced eGFR. CRRT increased the clearance of sulfamethoxazole, but not trimethoprim or N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, compared with the median clearance in the population. Doubling the sulfamethoxazole dose is needed for patients on CRRT.

### An IQ industry perspective on informing dosing recommendations in patients with renal impairment [^111EnT9S]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

This practice among the surveyed pharmaceutical companies aligns with FDA and EMA guidance documents, which suggest evaluating the impact of renal function on pharmacokinetics (PK) as part of Phase 2/3 trials using population PK. The guidance indicates that if the number of patients with severe or ND-ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease) in these trials is insufficient, a reduced design renal impairment PK study may be needed.

In general, the majority (> 80%) of participating companies preferred conducting reduced renal impairment studies. They utilized modeling and simulation approaches to predict exposure in patients with lesser severity of renal impairment and included participants with renal impairment in Phase 2/3 trials.

### Mozobil [^11722DE4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Dose modifications in renal impairment**: In patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (CLCR) less than or equal to 50 mL/min), reduce the dose of Mozobil by one-third based on body weight category as shown in Table 1. If CLCR is less than or equal to 50 mL/min, the dose should not exceed 27 mg/day, as the mg/kg-based dosage results in increased plerixafor exposure with increasing body weight [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Similar systemic exposure is predicted if the dose is reduced by one-third in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment compared with subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Creatinine clearance estimation**: The following (Cockcroft-Gault) formula may be used to estimate CLCR:
	- **Males**: Creatinine clearance (mL/min) = weight (kg) × (140 – age in years) / 72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)
	- **Females**: Creatinine clearance (mL/min) = 0.85 × value calculated for males

- **Hemodialysis considerations**: There is insufficient information to make dosage recommendations in patients on hemodialysis.

### Bactrim [^1131zqsM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetic studies in humans**: Research shows that pharmacokinetic studies of co-trimoxazole in humans, after single and repeated doses, offer crucial insights [Kremers et al, J Clin Pharmacol, 1974;14:112–117; Kaplan et al, J Infect Dis, 1973;128(Suppl):S547–S555]. Further studies in the elderly demonstrate variations in pharmacokinetics [Varoquaux et al, Br J Clin Pharmacol, 1985;20:575–581].

- **Therapeutic considerations in specific populations**: In AIDS patients, adjunctive folinic acid with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is associated with increased risks [Safrin et al, J Infect Dis, 1994;170(4):912–7]. Trimethoprim has also been linked with inducing hyperkalemia in several cases, including life-threatening instances [Marinella, Gerontol, 1999;45:209–212; Margassery and Bastani, J Nephrol, 2002;14:410–414].

- **Hematological and cardiac considerations**: Hematological changes occur in adults receiving a zidovudine-containing HAART regimen combined with cotrimoxazole [Moh et al, Antivir Ther, 2005;10(5):615–24]. Additionally, clinicians should note the QT interval's importance when treating patients [Al-Khatib et al, JAMA, 2003;289(16):2120–2127].

- **Drug interaction studies**: Trimethoprim has been shown to alter the disposition of procainamide and its metabolite [Kosoglou et al, Clin Pharmacol Ther, 1988;44(4):467–77]. Understanding these interactions helps in devising effective treatment plans while minimizing adverse effects.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^114kfagc]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

This study has some limitations. First, we utilized retrospectively collected routine TDM data to build the model, which unavoidably introduced some uncertainties regarding exact dosing and sampling times. In addition, the number of samples per patient was limited. However, the chosen type of analysis, nonlinear mixed-effects modeling, can still provide reliable pharmacokinetic parameter estimates even in sparse datasets.

Secondly, renal function was estimated using the CKD-EPI formula to calculate the eGFR. The CKD-EPI formula is not ideal for assessing glomerular filtration in ICU patients. Furthermore, trimethoprim interferes with tubular creatinine secretion, resulting in an approximate 10–30% elevation in serum creatinine concentrations and thereby falsely underestimated eGFR. To address this issue, future studies should focus on alternative measures of GFR, such as cystatin C or iohexol clearance.

Third, because of the limited number of patients treated with CRRT, we were not able to investigate the influence of different CRRT regimens and settings on the pharmacokinetics. Lastly, we lacked information about N-acetyltransferase or CYP2C19 genotypes, as well as urine pH, all of which are factors previously associated with the pharmacokinetics of cotrimoxazole.

### Tazicef [^113RfX2z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dosage and administration:

- **Dosage**: The usual adult dosage is 1 gram administered intravenously every 8 to 12 hours. The dosage and route should be determined by the susceptibility of the causative organisms, the severity of the infection, and the condition and renal function of the patient. The guidelines for the dosage of Tazicef (ceftazidime for injection, USP) are listed in Table 3. The following dosage schedule is recommended.

- **Impaired hepatic function**: No adjustment in dosage is required for patients with hepatic dysfunction.

- **Impaired renal function**: Ceftazidime is excreted by the kidneys, almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Therefore, in patients with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 50 mL/min), it is recommended that the dosage of ceftazidime be reduced to compensate for its slower excretion. In patients with suspected renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram of ceftazidime may be given. An estimate of GFR should be made to determine the appropriate maintenance dosage. The recommended dosage is presented in Table 4.

	- When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft's equation) may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function:
		- **Males**: Creatinine clearance (mL/min) = [Weight (kg) × (140 − age)/serum creatinine]

### Assessment of the impact of renal impairment on systemic exposure of new molecular entities: Evaluation of recent new drug applications [^116gvYy5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently developing guidance for industry to replace a previous guidance titled "Pharmacokinetics in Patients With Impaired Renal Function — Study Design, Data Analysis, and Impact on Dosing and Labeling" (renal guidance) issued in May 1998. The impact of the 1998 renal guidance was assessed following a survey of 94 new drug applications (NDAs) for small-molecule new molecular entities (NMEs) approved over the past five years (2003–2007). The survey results indicate that 57% of these NDAs included renal impairment study data, 44% of those with renal data included evaluation in patients on hemodialysis, and 41% of those with renal data resulted in a recommendation of dose adjustment in renal impairment. In addition, the survey results provided evidence that renal impairment can affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are predominantly eliminated by nonrenal processes such as metabolism and/or active transport. This finding supports our updated recommendation to evaluate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic alterations in renal impairment for those drugs that are mainly eliminated by nonrenal processes, in addition to those that are mainly excreted unchanged by the kidney.

### Fortaz [^114KN8Xc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). High credibility.

The usual adult dosage is 1 gram administered intravenously or intramuscularly every 8 to 12 hours. The dosage and route should be determined by the susceptibility of the causative organisms, the severity of infection, and the condition and renal function of the patient.

The guidelines for the dosage of Fortaz are listed in Table 3. The following dosage schedule is recommended.

- **Impaired hepatic function**: No adjustment in dosage is required for patients with hepatic dysfunction.

- **Impaired renal function**: Ceftazidime is excreted by the kidneys, almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Therefore, in patients with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 50 mL/min), it is recommended that the dosage of ceftazidime be reduced to compensate for its slower excretion. In patients with suspected renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram of Fortaz may be given. An estimate of GFR should be made to determine the appropriate maintenance dosage. The recommended dosage is presented in Table 6.

When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft's equation) may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function:

In patients with severe infections who would normally receive 6 grams of Fortaz daily were it not for renal insufficiency, the unit dose given in the table above may be increased by 50% or the dosing frequency may be increased appropriately. Further dosing should be determined by therapeutic monitoring, severity of the infection, and susceptibility of the causative organisms.

### Bactrim [^114aep8A]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pregnancy: While there are no large, well-controlled studies on the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in pregnant women, Brumfitt and Pursell, in a retrospective study, reported the outcome of 186 pregnancies during which the mother received either placebo or sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. The incidence of congenital abnormalities was 4.5% (3 of 66) in those who received placebo and 3.3% (4 of 120) in those receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. There were no abnormalities in the 10 children whose mothers received the drug during the first trimester. In a separate survey, Brumfitt and Pursell also found no congenital abnormalities in 35 children whose mothers had received oral sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim at the time of conception or shortly thereafter.

Because sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may interfere with folic acid metabolism, Bactrim should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

- **Teratogenic effects**:
	- **Human data**: While there are no large prospective, well-controlled studies in pregnant women and their babies, some retrospective epidemiologic studies suggest an association between first trimester exposure to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, cardiovascular abnormalities, urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot. These studies, however, were limited by the small number of exposed cases and the lack of adjustment for multiple statistical comparisons and confounders.

### Kidney function and clinical recommendations of drug dose adjustment in geriatric patients [^115XaVHu]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Family physicians frequently encounter elderly, multimorbid patients receiving multiple medications. In many cases, chronic kidney disease complicates drug prescription. Physicians face the challenge of deciding the best way to measure renal function and make informed decisions about drug dose adjustments. It is critical to assess kidney function accurately and adjust drug doses accordingly. Otherwise, drugs could accumulate, exposing patients to risks of toxicity and adverse reactions. Therefore, kidney function must not be overestimated. Conversely, underestimation could lead to underdosing or unnecessary discontinuation of essential medications.

Using serum creatinine alone for drug dose adjustment without calculating an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) increases the risk of adverse drug reactions, as renal function may be impaired despite normal serum creatinine levels. Serum creatinine-based equations for calculating eGFR are vital tools for identifying geriatric patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and determining suitable drug dosages. The most commonly used serum creatinine-based equations for GFR or creatinine clearance prediction are the abbreviated (4-variable) Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) formula. However, several authors point out…

### Kidney function and clinical recommendations of drug dose adjustment in geriatric patients [^115x6KdH]. BMC geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

In elderly patients, chronic kidney disease often limits drug prescription. Given the numerous equations for the quick assessment of kidney function by estimating the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the various clinical recommendations for drug dose adjustment in renal failure, practitioners face challenges in selecting the correct drug dosage approach. The aims of our study were to quantify the agreement between eGFR equations, grouped by creatinine-based or cystatin C-based methods, and within these groups. We also sought to investigate whether the use of various literature and online references results in differing recommendations for drug dose adjustment in renal disease in very elderly primary care patients.

- **Methods**: We included 108 primary care patients aged 80 years and older from 11 family practices into a cross-sectional study. GFR was estimated using two serum creatinine-based equations (Cockroft-Gault, MDRD) and three serum cystatin C-based equations (Grubb, Hoek, Perkins). Concordance between different equations was quantified using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Essential changes in drug doses or discontinuation of medication were documented and compared in terms of estimated renal function as a consequence of the different eGFR equations using five references commonly used in the US, Great Britain, and Germany.

- **Results**: In general, creatinine-based equations resulted in lower eGFR estimation and a higher necessity for drug dose adjustment than cystatin C-based equations. Concordance was high between creatinine-based methods.

### Antimicrobial dosing in specific populations and novel clinical methodologies: Kidney function [^115VxTvA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

Kidney function is a common parameter used to define antimicrobial drug dosage and the frequency of administration. Several methods exist to measure kidney function, but for pragmatic reasons, they rely on estimated kidney function equations based on the endogenous biomarker serum creatinine and common clinical variables. Regulatory guidance on the design of studies in patients with abnormal kidney function in the United States also recommends consideration of estimated kidney function for this reason.

Over the past few decades, there have been developments in alternate endogenous biomarkers, administration of exogenous biomarkers for noninvasive measurement, use of probe substrates to characterize individual kidney drug clearance pathways, modifications to conventional equations to account for time-varying clearance, and improved clinical trial modeling and simulation to factor in these uncertainties. Furthermore, major changes in kidney replacement therapy delivery are occurring in outpatient, inpatient, and at-home settings.

Antimicrobial drug dose adjustment in this diverse population is complex and in a state of flux due to technical innovations. Over-reliance on kidney function estimates to guide drug dosing in patients with infectious diseases can lead to biased underdosing, especially among the acutely ill. A holistic approach to drug dose adjustment in patients with abnormal kidney function is necessary to optimize clinical outcomes.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and the risk of a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia: A matched population-based cohort study [^116C7QHU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) can cause hyperkalemia by reducing renal potassium excretion. We assessed the risk of hyperkalemia after initiating TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin and determined if this risk is modified by a patient's baseline kidney function [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)].

- **Methods**: We conducted a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada, involving adults aged 66 years or older who were newly treated with TMP-SMX (n = 58,999) and matched 1:1 with those newly treated with amoxicillin (2008–2020). The primary outcome was a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia, defined by a laboratory serum potassium value ≥ 5.5 mmol/L within 14 days of antibiotic treatment. Secondary outcomes included a hospital encounter with acute kidney injury (AKI) and all-cause hospitalization. Risk ratios (RRs) were obtained using a modified Poisson regression.

- **Results**: A hospital encounter with hyperkalemia occurred in 269/58,999 (0.46%) patients treated with TMP-SMX versus 80/58,999 (0.14%) in those treated with amoxicillin [RR 3.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.62–4.31]. The absolute risk of hyperkalemia in patients treated with TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin increased progressively with decreasing eGFR (risk difference of 0.12% for an eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m², 0.42% for eGFR 45–59, 0.85% for eGFR 30–44 and 1.45% for eGFR < 30; additive interaction P < .001). TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin was associated with a higher risk of a hospital encounter with AKI [RR 3.15, 95% CI 2.82–3.51] and all-cause hospitalization [RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.34–1.53].

- **Conclusions**: The 14-day risk of hyperkalemia increases with TMP-SMX use, especially as eGFR decreases.

### Bactrim [^114KxHnU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Peak blood levels for the individual components occur 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. The mean serum half-lives of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are 10 and 8 to 10 hours, respectively. However, patients with severely impaired renal function exhibit an increase in the half-lives of both components, requiring dosage regimen adjustment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). Detectable amounts of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are present in the blood 24 hours after drug administration.

During administration of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim b.i.d., the mean steady-state plasma concentration of trimethoprim was 1.72 µg/mL. The steady-state mean plasma levels of free and total sulfamethoxazole were 57.4 µg/mL and 68.0 µg/mL, respectively. These steady-state levels were achieved after three days of drug administration.

Excretion of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is primarily by the kidneys through both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Urine concentrations of both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are considerably higher than the concentrations in the blood. The average percentage of the dose recovered in urine from 0 to 72 hours following a single oral dose of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is 84.5% for total sulfonamide and 66.8% for free trimethoprim. Thirty percent of the total sulfonamide is excreted as free sulfamethoxazole, with the remainder as the N4-acetylated metabolite.

When administered together as sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, neither sulfamethoxazole nor trimethoprim affects the urinary excretion pattern of the other.

### Clinical pharmacokinetics in kidney disease: Application to rational design of dosing regimens [^116dZUzY]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

A change in pharmacokinetics can alter drug exposure and predispose the patient to either over- or underdosing, potentially resulting in adverse drug reactions or therapeutic failure.

Kidney disease is characterized by multiple physiologic effects, which induce clinically significant changes in pharmacokinetics. These vary between individuals and may be quantified in certain instances. An understanding of pharmacokinetic concepts is, therefore, important for a rational approach to the design of drug dosing regimens for the delivery of personalized medical care.

Whether kidney disease is acute or chronic, drug clearance decreases and the volume of distribution may remain unchanged or increase. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by dynamic changes in kidney function, which complicates attempts to accurately quantify drug clearance. In contrast, changes in drug clearance progress more slowly with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

In general, kidney replacement therapies increase drug clearance, but the extent to which this occurs depends on the modality used and its duration, the drug's properties, and the timing of drug administration. However, the changes in drug handling associated with kidney disease are not isolated to reduced kidney clearance, and an appreciation of the scale of potential derangements is important.

In most instances, the first dose administered in patients with kidney disease is the same as in patients with normal kidney function. However, in some cases, a higher (loading) initial dose is given to rapidly achieve therapeutic concentrations, followed by a lower maintenance dose, as is well described.

### Renal drug dosing practices and clinical outcomes in patients with kidney disease admitted at two referral hospitals in northwest Ethiopia [^112gq54M]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Renal drug dose adjustment practice

Over three-quarters, 296 (77.1%) of patients utilized two or more drugs requiring renal drug dose adjustment, of which 93 (24.2%) were prescribed two, 61 (15.9%) three, 64 (16.7%) four, and 78 (20.3%) were utilizing five or more drugs necessitating dose adjustment.

Complete guideline-based dose adjustment was implemented only for 89 (23.2%) of patients, while partial adjustments were made to 129 (33.6%) patients. A significant 166 (43.2%) of participants received no dose adjustment to their drug prescriptions. Among medications that need dose adjustment, metoclopramide, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, vancomycin, insulin, and cefepime were found to be most poorly adjusted.

- **Pattern of renal drug dose adjustment practices**: This figure details renal drug dose adjustment practices in patients with kidney disease admitted to medical wards at specialized hospitals, Amhara, Ethiopia, in 2023 (n = 384).

Patient treatment outcomes

In this study, a significant proportion, 244 (63.5%) of patients, experienced improvement and were discharged under favorable conditions. However, 140 (36.5%), with a 95% CI of 31.5% − 41.5%, faced worsened outcomes. This included scenarios such as the necessity for dialysis, referrals due to complications, departures against medical advice prompted by poor prognoses, or unfortunate instances of mortality.

### Drug dosage adjustment in hospitalized patients with renal impairment at Tikur Anbessa specialized hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia [^113eHQ4z]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Dose adjustment of prescription entries by stage of renal impairment at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, August 2013.

On univariate and multivariate analysis, COR and AOR revealed that age, sex, weight, SCr, CrCl, BUN, reason for admission, comorbidity, stage of renal impairment, number of medications prescribed per patient, and the number of medications requiring dose adjustment per patient did not show a significant difference in the proportion of appropriately adjusted prescriptions per patient.

- **Table 2**: Relationship between independent variables and proportion of appropriately adjusted prescription entries per patient in Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, August 2013. A statistically significant; COD crude odds ratio; AOR adjusted odds ratio.

- **Table 3**: Relationship between independent variables and appropriateness of dose adjustment of prescription entries in Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, August 2013. A statistically significant; COD crude odds ratio; AOR adjusted odds ratio.

However, dose adjustment of prescription entries was associated with the type of medications prescribed, stage of renal impairment, SCr level, and BUN. There was a negative association between the type of medication prescribed and the likelihood of appropriately adjusting medications. When cimetidine (AOR = 0.013 [0.001, 0.150]), vancomycin (AOR = 0.045 [0.004, 0.525]), ceftazidime (AOR = 0.067 [0.005, 0.894]), and digoxin (AOR = 0.009 [0.000, 0.297]) were prescribed, the dose was appropriately adjusted less.

### Trimethoprim [^113Dx8od]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Trimethoprim is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. It exists in the blood as unbound, protein-bound, and metabolized forms. Ten to twenty percent of trimethoprim is metabolized, primarily in the liver; the remainder is excreted unchanged in the urine. The principal metabolites of trimethoprim are the 1- and 3-oxides and the 3'- and 4'-hydroxy derivatives. The free form is considered to be the therapeutically active form. Approximately 44% of trimethoprim is bound to plasma proteins.

Mean peak serum concentrations of approximately 1.0 mcg/mL occur 1 to 4 hours after oral administration of a single 100 mg dose. A single 200 mg dose will result in serum levels approximately twice as high. The half-life of trimethoprim ranges from 8 to 10 hours. However, patients with severely impaired renal function exhibit an increase in the half-life of trimethoprim, which requires either dosage regimen adjustment or avoiding the drug in such patients (see dosage and administration). During a 13-week study of trimethoprim administered at a daily dosage of 200 mg (50 mg q.i.d.), the mean minimum steady-state concentration of the drug was 1.1 mcg/mL.

Steady-state concentrations were achieved within 2 to 3 days of chronic administration and were maintained throughout the experimental period.

Excretion of trimethoprim is primarily by the kidneys through glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Urine concentrations of trimethoprim are considerably higher than the concentrations in the blood.
