## Question

How successful is psilocybin for treating major depressive disorder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how successful psilocybin is for treating major depressive disorder and what the evidence shows about its efficacy, durability, safety, and limitations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality randomized controlled trials to anchor effect size and clinical significance. Then, I should verify pooled estimates from meta-analyses and how they translate into response and remission. Next, I will examine durability and long-term outcomes. After that, I need to check safety and tolerability, including serious adverse events. I will then review methodological limitations that could bias estimates, consider moderators of response, and finally synthesize a cautious, clinically useful bottom line with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the anchor RCT data. The pivotal JAMA trial in adults with moderate-to-severe MDD found that a single 25 mg dose of psilocybin with psychological support produced a mean reduction of 12.3 points on MADRS at day 43 versus niacin placebo, with sustained response in 42% versus 11% on placebo and remission in 25% versus 9%, which is clinically meaningful and statistically significant, and it also improved functional disability on the Sheehan scale, with no serious adverse events reported in that study [^1166T4uN] [^1148TGzH].

> Wait, let me verify the dose-response signal. A dose-response network meta-analysis of three RCTs indicated that 25 mg was the most effective dose, with large symptom reductions at day 8 and day 15 versus placebo, reinforcing the 25 mg target used in many contemporary trials and supporting a time-dependent therapeutic effect that emerges within 1–2 weeks [^111r9sTh].

> Next, I should review pooled estimates. Multiple high-quality meta-analyses converge on a moderate-to-large standardized mean difference of about Hedges' g ≈ 0.66 versus comparator, with moderate certainty of evidence and low between-study heterogeneity for continuous change, which supports a robust antidepressant signal across randomized trials [^1143LErM] [^112EsAtu].

> I will now examine dichotomous outcomes. Meta-analytic synthesis shows psilocybin roughly doubles the likelihood of treatment response versus placebo and nearly triples the likelihood of remission, with risk ratios around 2.17 for response and 2.96 for remission, though confidence intervals are wide and heterogeneity is moderate, so I should be cautious about overgeneralization across settings and populations [^113JyEQw] [^117YNP1c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about durability. Long-term follow-up studies suggest large and stable antidepressant effects persisting up to 12 months after one or two psilocybin sessions, with response rates around 75% and remission around 58% at 12 months in a randomized waitlist-controlled cohort, although these data are from small, non-blinded samples and some participants initiated antidepressants during follow-up, which complicates attribution [^112VB4Th] [^115ZSbyj] [^116Sojfe].

> I need to check safety and tolerability carefully. Across RCTs, psilocybin is generally well tolerated in medically screened populations under supervision, with transient anxiety, confusion, nausea, and headache as common acute effects; however, serious adverse events are uncommon but not absent, and a large TRD trial reported serious adverse events in about 9% of the 25 mg arm, including suicidality, so risk stratification and monitoring are essential [^1166T4uN] [^117T3HP9].

> But wait, what if expectancy and blinding are inflating effects. Functional unblinding is a major concern in psychedelic trials; participants and staff can often discern active dose, and control arms in psilocybin studies show smaller within-group improvements than in SSRI or esketamine trials, suggesting potential overestimation of between-group effects, so I should interpret effect sizes with caution and note that active placebo designs and expectancy controls are needed [^115611cW] [^111g4BFH].

> Let me consider moderators of response. Subgroup analyses suggest larger effects in secondary depression, when outcomes are measured with self-report scales, and in older adults or those with prior psychedelic use, whereas expectancy, mystical experience, and the intensity of psychotherapeutic support likely contribute to outcomes; however, mystical-type experience correlates inconsistently with clinical benefit across studies, so I should avoid assuming it is necessary or sufficient for response [^1143LErM] [^111bpr8H] [^114tF2U9].

> I should double-check implementation issues that could limit real-world success. Trials use highly protocolized settings with extensive preparation, dosing-day support, and integration, often totaling 20+ hours of therapist contact; populations are predominantly White and exclude psychosis, bipolar I, active suicidality, and substance use disorders, so generalizability to routine care remains uncertain until standardized training, equitable access, and pragmatic trials are established [^114XDCGd] [^112E8Q65] [^113w5BfG] [^11697Jnv].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. Psilocybin shows a consistent, moderate-to-large antidepressant effect in rigorously conducted RCTs, with clinically meaningful response and remission rates after one or two doses when combined with psychological support, and signals of durability up to 12 months in small cohorts; however, effects are likely overestimated relative to conventional treatments due to blinding limitations, and safety signals mandate careful screening and monitoring, so psilocybin should be considered promising but not yet ready for first-line, routine clinical use outside trials [^1166T4uN] [^1143LErM] [^112VB4Th] [^115611cW] [^116DSr7p].

---

Psilocybin shows **large, rapid, and sustained antidepressant effects** in MDD, with single 25 mg doses producing clinically significant symptom reductions within 1–2 weeks [^1166T4uN] and durable benefits through 6–12 months in multiple trials [^112VB4Th] [^1173e7rf]. Meta-analyses report **moderate-to-large effect sizes** versus placebo (Hedges' g ≈ 0.66–0.78) [^1143LErM] [^113rgvm4] and higher response/remission rates, though heterogeneity and expectancy effects remain concerns [^113JyEQw] [^1143LErM]. Serious adverse events are uncommon in controlled settings, but transient anxiety, nausea, and blood pressure elevation are common; rare suicidal ideation has been reported, warranting careful screening and supervision [^115LtYvD] [^117T3HP9]. Psilocybin is not yet a first-line therapy; ongoing Phase 3 trials and standardization of protocols are needed before routine clinical use [^114MtSPe] [^116DSr7p].

---

## Clinical efficacy

### Short-term efficacy (days to weeks)

- **Rapid onset**: Single-dose psilocybin (20–30 mg) with psychological support produces large, clinically significant reductions in depressive symptoms within 1–2 weeks [^1166T4uN] [^116zVpNE].

- **Effect sizes**: Meta-analyses report moderate-to-large effects versus placebo (Hedges' g ≈ 0.66–0.78) at 1–4 weeks [^1143LErM] [^113rgvm4].

- **Response/remission**: Higher rates of response and remission than placebo in randomized trials [^113JyEQw] [^117YNP1c].

---

### Long-term efficacy (months to years)

- **Durability**: Sustained benefits at 6–12 months in multiple studies, with ~75% response and ~58% remission at 12 months in one trial [^112VB4Th] [^1173e7rf].

- **Relapse**: Median time to relapse ~3 months in some cohorts; durability varies and some require booster doses or ongoing care [^114z9CuV] [^116Sojfe].

- **Comparison**: Effects appear comparable or superior to escitalopram in some outcomes, though not all primary endpoints show superiority [^1173e7rf] [^111mtDvr].

---

## Safety and tolerability

### Common adverse effects

Common adverse effects include **transient anxiety** or psychological distress during dosing, **nausea** and mild gastrointestinal upset, and transient increases in blood pressure and heart rate. These effects are generally manageable with preparation and support [^111r9sTh] [^115LtYvD].

---

### Serious adverse effects

Serious adverse effects are **rare in controlled settings** but include suicidal ideation or behavior (about 9% in one TRD trial), psychotic or manic symptoms in vulnerable individuals, and flashbacks or HPPD (rare). Careful screening and supervision are essential [^117T3HP9] [^116QxgZb].

---

## Factors influencing efficacy

Several factors **modulate response**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on efficacy** |
|-|-|
| Dose | 25 mg appears optimal; 10 mg is less effective [^111r9sTh] [^112geqLy] |
| Psychological support | Essential; preparation and integration improve outcomes [^114XDCGd] [^1151UJbH] |
| Set and setting | Supportive, controlled environments reduce adverse effects and enhance benefits [^116EwXps] [^112yNPHq] |
| Patient characteristics | Prior psychedelic use, older age, and secondary depression may predict greater improvement [^1143LErM] [^112EsAtu] |

---

## Limitations and gaps in current research

- **Sample size**: Most trials are small; larger, diverse samples are needed [^115okYVh] [^116p2Zsh].

- **Blinding**: Functional unblinding and expectancy effects may inflate efficacy estimates [^115611cW] [^111g4BFH].

- **Long-term data**: Limited > 12-month data; durability and relapse prevention strategies need clarification [^112VB4Th] [^117T3HP9].

- **Standardization**: Protocols vary widely; standardized dosing and psychotherapy models are needed [^114XDCGd] [^114ZoG2s].

---

## Comparison with existing treatments

Psilocybin's antidepressant effects are **rapid (days to weeks)** compared with the weeks-to-months onset typical of SSRIs, and its effect sizes are comparable to or larger than those of SSRIs and similar to ketamine's in some studies. Its durability after 1–2 doses may exceed ketamine's, though more data are needed [^113UBZRB] [^115BKtnQ].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Psilocybin is **experimental and not a first-line therapy**; use should be limited to research or specialized clinics. Ongoing Phase 3 trials and regulatory review will clarify its role. If approved, it will likely be reserved for treatment-resistant cases or patients preferring non-daily, rapid-acting options [^1122p2ia].

---

Psilocybin demonstrates **large, rapid, and sustained antidepressant effects** in MDD, with a favorable safety profile under controlled conditions, but further research is needed to address expectancy, standardize protocols, and define long-term outcomes before routine clinical adoption [^1143LErM] [^1166T4uN].

### Efficacy and safety of psilocybin in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD): a dose-response network meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials [^111r9sTh]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Selecting the optimal dose of psilocybin for treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) is crucial for clinical development and regulatory approval. This meta-analysis evaluates psilocybin's efficacy and safety in treating MDD to determine the optimal dose and timing for clinical trials. A systematic review and Dose-Response Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) of Randomized Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials (RCTs) registered with PROSPERO was conducted. Databases searched included Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, up to July 2024. The PICOS framework defined eligibility criteria: P: adult patients with MDD; I: psilocybin; C: placebo; O: changes in MADRS scores at Days 2, 8 and 15, and adverse events; S: RCT. Independent researchers performed data extraction and bias assessment. From 5419 search results, three RCTs involving 389 patients were included. Psilocybin significantly reduced symptoms compared to placebo at Day 8 (MD = -7.42; 95% CI:10.07 to -4.78; p < 0.001) and Day 15 (MD = -9.55; 95% CI:12.44 to -6.65; p < 0.001), without significant effects on Day 2. The NMA indicated that a 25 mg dose was the most effective, with a SUCRA value of 92.25%, compared to doses of 0.215 mg/kg and 10 mg. However, psilocybin was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, particularly nausea (RR = 8.35; p < 0.001). This meta-analysis supports psilocybin's efficacy in treating MDD, particularly at a 25 mg dose, showing a time-dependent therapeutic effect. The recommended timing of efficacy evaluation by regulatory authorities is validated by this evidence, underscoring its importance in clinical trial design for psychedelic substances.

### Psilocybin-assisted therapy for depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113rgvm4]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The aim of this review was to determine the effect of psilocybin on depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses or major depressive disorder. Systematic searches were conducted to search for randomized clinical trials and open-label trials that evaluated depression symptoms after psilocybin therapy. Data was pooled using a random-effects model. The primary outcome was the standardized mean difference (SMD) in depression severity, determined by calculating the change in depression ratings from baseline to the primary endpoint in the psilocybin arm versus the control arm. The literature search yielded 1734 studies, and 13 studies (n = 686) were included in either qualitative and/or quantitative analyses. The meta-analysis included 9 studies (pooled n = 596) and yielded a large effect size in favour of psilocybin (SMD = -0.78; p < 0.001). Risk ratios for response and remission were large and significant in favour of psilocybin. A review of open-label trials showed robust decreases in depressive symptoms following psilocybin administration. These findings provide preliminary evidence for antidepressant efficacy with psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, however, further studies are needed to evaluate safety and efficacy and to optimize treatment protocols.

### Efficacy of psilocybin for treating symptoms of depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1143LErM]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of psilocybin as an antidepressant compared with placebo or non-psychoactive drugs.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Five electronic databases of published literature (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index, and PsycInfo) and four databases of unpublished and international literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, and PsycEXTRA), and handsearching of reference lists, conference proceedings, and abstracts.

Data Synthesis and Study Quality

Information on potential treatment effect moderators was extracted, including depression type (primary or secondary), previous use of psychedelics, psilocybin dosage, type of outcome measure (clinician rated or self-reported), and personal characteristics (eg, age, sex). Data were synthesised using a random effects meta-analysis model, and observed heterogeneity and the effect of covariates were investigated with subgroup analyses and metaregression. Hedges' g was used as a measure of treatment effect size, to account for small sample effects and substantial differences between the included studies' sample sizes. Study quality was appraised using Cochrane's Risk of Bias 2 tool, and the quality of the aggregated evidence was evaluated using GRADE guidelines.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised trials in which psilocybin was administered as a standalone treatment for adults with clinically significant symptoms of depression and change in symptoms was measured using a validated clinician rated or self-report scale. Studies with directive psychotherapy were included if the psychotherapeutic component was present in both experimental and control conditions. Participants with depression regardless of comorbidities (eg, cancer) were eligible.

Results

Meta-analysis on 436 participants (228 female participants), average age 36–60 years, from seven of the nine included studies showed a significant benefit of psilocybin (Hedges' g = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.86, P < 0.001) on change in depression scores compared with comparator treatment. Exploratory subgroup analyses and metaregressions indicated that having secondary depression (Hedges' g = 0.88, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.33), being assessed with self-report depression scales such as the Beck depression inventory (0.88, 0.42 to 1.33), and older age and previous use of psychedelics (metaregression coefficient 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.23 and 6.00, 2.48 to 9.53, respectively) were correlated with greater improvements in symptoms. All studies had a moderate risk of bias, but the change from baseline metric was associated with low heterogeneity and a statistically non-significant risk of small study bias, resulting in a moderate certainty of evidence rating.

Conclusion

Treatment effects of psilocybin were significantly larger among patients with secondary depression, when self-report scales were used to measure symptoms of depression, and when participants had previously used psychedelics. Further research is thus required to delineate the influence of expectancy effects, moderating factors, and treatment delivery on the efficacy of psilocybin as an antidepressant.

### Single-dose psilocybin treatment for major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^1166T4uN]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Psilocybin shows promise as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD).

Objective

To evaluate the magnitude, timing, and durability of antidepressant effects and safety of a single dose of psilocybin in patients with MDD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this phase 2 trial conducted between December 2019 and June 2022 at 11 research sites in the US, participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of psilocybin vs niacin placebo administered with psychological support. Participants were adults aged 21 to 65 years with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition diagnosis of MDD of at least 60 days' duration and moderate or greater symptom severity. Exclusion criteria included history of psychosis or mania, active substance use disorder, and active suicidal ideation with intent. Participants taking psychotropic agents who otherwise met inclusion/exclusion criteria were eligible following medication taper. Primary and secondary outcomes and adverse events (AEs) were assessed at baseline (conducted within 7 days before dosing) and at 2, 8, 15, 29, and 43 days after dosing.

Interventions

Interventions were a 25-mg dose of synthetic psilocybin or a 100-mg dose of niacin in identical-appearing capsules, each administered with psychological support.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was change in central rater-assessed Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score (range, 0–60; higher scores indicate more severe depression) from baseline to day 43. The key secondary outcome measure was change in MADRS score from baseline to day 8. Other secondary outcomes were change in Sheehan Disability Scale score from baseline to day 43 and MADRS-defined sustained response and remission. Participants, study site personnel, study sponsor, outcome assessors (raters), and statisticians were blinded to treatment assignment.

Results

A total of 104 participants (mean [SD] age, 41.1 [11.3] years; 52 [50%] women) were randomized (51 to the psilocybin group and 53 to the niacin group). Psilocybin treatment was associated with significantly reduced MADRS scores compared with niacin from baseline to day 43 (mean difference,-12.3 [95% CI, -17.5 to -7.2]; P < .001) and from baseline to day 8 (mean difference, -12.0 [95% CI, -16.6 to -7.4]; P < .001). Psilocybin treatment was also associated with significantly reduced Sheehan Disability Scale scores compared with niacin (mean difference, -2.31 [95% CI, 3.50–1.11]; P < .001) from baseline to day 43. More participants receiving psilocybin had sustained response (but not remission) than those receiving niacin. There were no serious treatment-emergent AEs; however, psilocybin treatment was associated with a higher rate of overall AEs and a higher rate of severe AEs.

Conclusions and Relevance

Psilocybin treatment was associated with a clinically significant sustained reduction in depressive symptoms and functional disability, without serious adverse events. These findings add to increasing evidence that psilocybin-when administered with psychological support-may hold promise as a novel intervention for MDD.

### Psilocybin efficacy and mechanisms of action in major depressive disorder: a review [^115okYVh]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of The Review

We aim to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge about the efficacy of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, as well as its mechanisms of action.

Recent Findings

Psilocybin has a large, rapid, and persistent clinical effect in the treatment of resistant or end-of-life depression. Tolerance is good, with mild side effects limited to a few hours after dosing. The studies conducted to date have had small sample sizes. One clinical trial has been conducted against a reference treatment (escitalopram) without showing a significant superiority of psilocybin in the main outcome. The neurobiological mechanisms, mostly unknown, differ from those of SSRI antidepressants. Psilocybin represents a promising alternative in the treatment of depression. Further research with larger sample sizes, particularly against reference treatments, is needed to better understand the neurobiological factors of its effects and to investigate its potential for use in everyday practice.

### Single-dose psilocybin-assisted therapy in major depressive disorder: a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trial [^116zVpNE]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Psilocybin has been suggested as a novel, rapid-acting treatment for depression. Two consecutive doses have been shown to markedly decrease symptom severity in an open-label setting or when compared to a waiting list group. To date, to our knowledge, no other trial compared a single, moderate dose of psilocybin to a placebo condition.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomised clinical trial, 52 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder and no unstable somatic conditions were allocated to receive either a single, moderate dose (0.215 mg/kg body weight) of psilocybin or placebo in conjunction with psychological support. MADRS and BDI scores were assessed to estimate depression severity, while changes from baseline to 14 days after the intervention were defined as primary endpoints. The trial took place between April 11th, 2019 and October 12th, 2021 at the psychiatric university hospital in Zürich, Switzerland and was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03715127).

Findings

The psilocybin condition showed an absolute decrease in symptom severity of -13.0 points compared to baseline and were significantly larger than those in the placebo condition (95% CI -15.0 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.97; P = 0.0011; MADRS) and -13.2 points (95% CI; -13.4 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.67; P = 0.019; BDI) 14 days after the intervention. 14/26 (54%) participants met the MADRS remission criteria in the psilocybin condition.

Interpretation

These results suggest that a single, moderate dose of psilocybin significantly reduces depressive symptoms compared to a placebo condition for at least two weeks. No serious adverse events were recorded. Larger, multi-centric trials with longer follow-up periods are needed to inform further optimisation of this novel treatment paradigm.

Funding

The study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, Crowdfunding, the Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation, and the Heffter Research Institute.

### Efficacy of psilocybin for treating symptoms of depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112EsAtu]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine the efficacy of psilocybin as an antidepressant compared with placebo or non-psychoactive drugs.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Five electronic databases of published literature (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index, and PsycInfo) and four databases of unpublished and international literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, and PsycEXTRA), and handsearching of reference lists, conference proceedings, and abstracts.

Data synthesis and study quality

Information on potential treatment effect moderators was extracted, including depression type (primary or secondary), previous use of psychedelics, psilocybin dosage, type of outcome measure (clinician rated or self-reported), and personal characteristics (eg, age, sex). Data were synthesised using a random effects meta-analysis model, and observed heterogeneity and the effect of covariates were investigated with subgroup analyses and metaregression. Hedges' g was used as a measure of treatment effect size, to account for small sample effects and substantial differences between the included studies' sample sizes.

Search strategy

We searched major electronic databases and trial registries of psychological and medical research, with no limits on the publication date. Databases were the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials via the Cochrane Library, Embase via Ovid, Medline via Ovid, Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science via Web of Science, and PsycInfo via Ovid. A search through multiple databases was necessary because each database includes unique journals. Supplementary Appendix B shows the search syntax used for the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, which was slightly modified to comply with the syntactic rules of the other databases.

Unpublished and grey literature were sought through registries of past and ongoing trials, databases of conference proceedings, government reports, theses, dissertations, and grant registries (eg, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, and PsycEXTRA). The references and bibliographies of eligible studies were checked for relevant publications. The original search was done in January 2023 and updated search was performed on 10 August 2023.

Data collection, extraction, and management

The results of the literature search were imported to the Endnote X9 reference management software, and the references were imported to the Covidence platform after removal of duplicates. Two reviewers (AM and DT) independently screened the title and abstract of each reference and then screened the full text of potentially eligible references. Any disagreements about eligibility were resolved through discussion. If information was insufficient to determine eligibility, the study's authors were contacted. The reviewers were not blinded to the studies' authors, institutions, or journal of publication.

The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow diagram shows the study selection process and reasons for excluding studies that were considered eligible for full text screening.

Critical appraisal of individual studies and of aggregated evidence

The methodological quality of eligible studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool (RoB 2) for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. In addition to the criteria specified by RoB 2, we considered the potential impact of industry funding and conflicts of interest. The overall methodological quality of the aggregated evidence was evaluated using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

If we found evidence of heterogeneity among the trials, then small study biases, such as publication bias, were assessed using a funnel plot and asymmetry tests (eg, Egger's test).

### Efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted treatment for major depressive disorder: prospective 12-month follow-up [^115h9Amq]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects over 260 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of disability and healthcare expenditures. First-line treatments, including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, may take weeks or months to produce clinically meaningful symptom reduction, and patients can have difficulty with treatment adherence. At least 30% of patients ultimately meet criteria for treatment-resistant depressive illness after failing to respond to multiple attempts at treatment. MDD also has a highly recurrent course, with 40–60% of those diagnosed with a single episode eventually relapsing, and rate of relapse increasing with each subsequent episode. Novel interventions are needed that can act rapidly and produce sustained remission.

Several preliminary studies suggest that psilocybin-assisted treatment may have substantial antidepressant effects in patients with MDD, with treatment response occurring within a week of administration of just one or two doses in the context of psychotherapy. In an initial report of primary outcomes following two doses of psilocybin using a randomized waitlist-control study design, we reported a large effect size (Cohen d = 2.3) and high rates of treatment response and remission (71% and 54%) at 1 month following intervention. Treatment-resistant patients also appear to have a favorable response rate. A more recent study used a double-blind double dummy design to compare high-dose psilocybin plus 6 weeks of placebo with very low dose psilocybin plus 6 weeks of escitalopram. The authors failed to show a significant difference between the two groups at 6 weeks in their designated primary outcome measure (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms). The majority of results for secondary outcome measures including other depression severity scores favored the high-dose psilocybin group, though analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons.

Although psilocybin treatment of MDD appears promising, little is known about long-term efficacy and safety. The three studies conducted to date demonstrated efficacy at their longest follow-up assessments of 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months, although depression severity scores were trending upward at 3- and 6-month follow-up timepoints. with the longest period of follow-up, had an open-label design. Given the chronicity and relapsing disease course of MDD, the present study represents a significant extension of these previous findings by assessing efficacy and safety of a psilocybin intervention throughout a 12-month follow-up period.

### Efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted treatment for major depressive disorder: prospective 12-month follow-up [^112VB4Th]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

Preliminary data suggest that psilocybin-assisted treatment produces substantial and rapid antidepressant effects in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), but little is known about long-term outcomes.

Aims:

This study sought to examine the efficacy and safety of psilocybin through 12 months in participants with moderate to severe MDD who received psilocybin.

Methods:

This randomized, waiting-list controlled study enrolled 27 patients aged 21–75 with moderate to severe unipolar depression (GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD) ⩾ 17). Participants were randomized to an immediate or delayed (8 weeks) treatment condition in which they received two doses of psilocybin with supportive psychotherapy. Twenty-four participants completed both psilocybin sessions and were followed through 12 months following their second dose.

Results:

All 24 participants attended all follow-up visits through the 12-month timepoint. Large decreases from baseline in GRID-HAMD scores were observed at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up (Cohen d = 2.3, 2.0, 2.6, and 2.4, respectively). Treatment response (⩾50% reduction in GRID-HAMD score from baseline) and remission were 75% and 58%, respectively, at 12 months. There were no serious adverse events judged to be related to psilocybin in the long-term follow-up period, and no participants reported psilocybin use outside of the context of the study. Participant ratings of personal meaning, spiritual experience, and mystical experience after sessions predicted increased well-being at 12 months, but did not predict improvement in depression.

Conclusions:

These findings demonstrate that the substantial antidepressant effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy may be durable at least through 12 months following acute intervention in some patients.

### Efficacy of psilocybin for treating symptoms of depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1162ZYcQ]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

The renewed interest in psilocybin's antidepressive effects led to several clinical trials on treatment resistant depression, major depressive disorder, and depression related to physical illness. These trials mostly reported positive efficacy findings, showing reductions in symptoms of depression within a few hours to a few days after one dose or two doses of psilocybin. These studies reported only minimal adverse effects, however, and drug harm assessments in healthy volunteers indicated that psilocybin does not induce physiological toxicity, is not addictive, and does not lead to withdrawal. Nevertheless, these findings should be interpreted with caution owing to the small sample sizes and open label design of some of these studies.

Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses since the early 2000s have investigated the use of psilocybin to treat symptoms of depression. Most found encouraging results, but as well as people with depression some included healthy volunteers, and most combined data from studies of multiple serotonergic psychedelics, even though each compound has unique neurobiological effects and mechanisms of action. Furthermore, many systematic reviews included non-randomised studies and studies in which psilocybin was tested in conjunction with psychotherapeutic interventions, which made it difficult to distinguish psilocybin's treatment effects. Most systematic reviews and meta-analyses did not consider the impact of factors that could act as moderators to psilocybin's effects, such as type of depression (primary or secondary), previous use of psychedelics, psilocybin dosage, type of outcome measure (clinician rated or self-reported), and personal characteristics (eg, age, sex). Lastly, systematic reviews did not consider grey literature, which might have led to a substantial overestimation of psilocybin's efficacy as a treatment for depression. In this review we focused on randomised trials that contained an unconfounded evaluation of psilocybin in adults with symptoms of depression, regardless of country and language of publication.

### Single-dose psilocybin treatment for major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^1148TGzH]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study Psilocybin in MDD was published by Charles L Raison and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Major depressive disorder. In the Psilocybin in MDD study, the trial question was: what is the role of a single dose of psilocybin in patients with major depressive disorder? In the Psilocybin in MDD study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Psilocybin in MDD study, the population was: 104 patients (52 female, 52 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients aged 21–65 years with a DSM-5 diagnosis of major depressive disorder of ≥ 60 days of duration and moderate or greater symptom severity. The key exclusion criteria were receiving antidepressants for ≥ 2 weeks; personal or first-degree family history of psychosis or mania; active substance use disorder; active suicidal ideation with intent. In the Psilocybin in MDD study, the interventions were: n = 51 psilocybin (25 mg administered with psychological support) n = 53 placebo (niacin 100 mg administered with psychological support). In the Psilocybin in MDD study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at day 43 (19.1 points vs. 6.8 points; MD 12.3, 95% CI 7.2 to 17.5). In the Psilocybin in MDD study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at day 8 (17.8 points vs. 5.8 points; MD 12, 95% CI 7.4 to 16.6) Significant increase in reduction in Sheehan Disability Scale score at day 43 (4.07 points vs. 1.76 points; MD 2.31, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.5) Significant increase in sustained depressive symptom response (41.7% vs. 11.4%; AD 30.3%, 95% CI 13.5 to 47.1). In the Psilocybin in MDD study, the conclusion was: in adult patients aged 21–65 years with a DSM-5 diagnosis of major depressive disorder of ≥ 60 days of duration and moderate or greater symptom severity, psilocybin was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at day 43.

### Psilocybin for major depressive disorder: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^113Me8eD]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Due to the unsatisfactory therapeutic effects of current antidepressants, research has been launched into alternative treatment approaches, such as the administration of psychedelics. Psilocybin, a classic hallucinogen, has been shown to exert considerable positive influence on depression symptoms through its serotonergic and glutamatergic effects. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of psilocybin in treating depression.

Methods

A comprehensive search of Medline (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify relevant studies. Inclusion criteria were applied to select studies that investigated the therapeutic impact of psilocybin on depression. A mixed-effects multi-level model was used to estimate the overall effect size. Effectiveness over time was also investigated as a secondary analysis.

Results

The results of the primary analysis revealed a large and clinically observable reduction (SMC: -1.24, 95%CI: -1.83 to -0.65, I² level2 = 11.39%, I² level3 = 77.67%) of depressive symptomatology in patients receiving psilocybin in addition to supportive therapy compared to baseline measurements. The decrease was also marked when compared to placebo (p -value = 0.032). The results remained significant even when a secondary analysis assessed the effect in various time intervals since the administration of psilocybin.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis substantiate the claim that psilocybin is superior in treating depression compared to established psychotherapy alone used for treating depression. This finding warrants further studies with larger sample sizes and across a longer timeframe.

### Effect of psilocybin versus escitalopram on depression symptom severity in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder: observational 6-month follow-up of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^1173e7rf]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Psilocybin therapy (PT) produces rapid and persistent antidepressant effects in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the long-term effects of PT have never been compared with gold-standard treatments for MDD such as pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy alone or in combination.

Methods

This is a 6-month follow-up study of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial involving patients with moderate-to-severe MDD. Participants were recruited from a hospital in the UK. Male or female patients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV), moderate to severe depression (HAM-D ≥ 17), no MRI or SSRI contraindications, confirmed diagnosis by a GP or mental healthcare professional, aged 18–80, and competent in English were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either two 25 mg doses of the psychedelic drug psilocybin administered orally combined with psychological support ('psilocybin therapy' or PT) and book-ended by further support or a 6-week course of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram (administered daily at 10 mg for three weeks and 20 mg for the subsequent three weeks) plus matched psychological support ('escitalopram treatment' or ET). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16) at week 6, which has been reported previously. Herein, we present results at the 6-month follow-up time point. Measures of social functioning, connectedness, and meaning in life constituted the study's secondary outcomes during follow-up. Safety in the follow-up period was not assessed. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03429075.

Findings

Between January 15th, 2019 and March 20th, 2020, 59 patients were enrolled and 30 (11 females [37%] and 19 males [63%]) were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 (9 females [31%] and 20 males [69%]) to the escitalopram group. 25 participants in the PT group and 21 in the ET group completed the 6-month follow-up. At the 6-month follow-up, both PT and ET conditions yielded sustained improvements in depressive symptom severity. The mean between-condition difference in QIDS-SR-16 scores at 6-months was 1.51 (95% CI: -1.35, 4.38; p = 0.311). Secondary outcomes demonstrated that PT had greater mean between-condition differences in functioning (WSAS: -7.46; 95% CI: -12.4, -2.47; p < 0.001), psychological connectedness (WCS: 11.02; 95% CI: 1.25, 20.83; p = 0.033), and meaning in life (MLQ: 4.86; 95% CI: 0.67, 9.05; p = 0.021) compared to ET.

Interpretation

Six-week intensive treatments with either psilocybin or escitalopram (with psychological support) for MDD were associated with long-term improvements in depressive symptom severity. The greater degree of improvement in the PT arm at follow-up on psychosocial functioning, meaning in life, and psychological connectedness suggests warrant future research. However, these results are descriptive and should be interpreted with caution. Key limitations of the study include its suboptimal power to detect small but meaningful differences between treatments, missing data, the potential use of additional interventions during the follow-up period, and reliance on self-reported treatment assessments. These factors may affect the interpretation of the study findings and should be considered when evaluating the results.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^114skabZ]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The potential for psilocybin, and other psychedelic drugs, to fulfil a much needed and potentially transformative class of psychiatric treatments has garnered significant attention. Consequently, there has been a great deal of interest and investment in accelerating its development and potential implementation in routine clinical practice. However, the expanding scope of scientific discovery, heightened media coverage, and commercial interests in the field risk outpacing the rate of developments in the necessary guidelines and infrastructure required for integration of psilocybin into clinical practice. The US National Network of Depression Centers (NNDC) Task Group on Psychedelics and Related Compounds-comprising psychiatrists, psychologists, neuroscientists, psychedelic researchers, and leaders in healthcare consulting affiliated with the NNDC-developed this consensus statement as a summary of clinical expertise and opinion on the matter, to recognise psilocybin's therapeutic potential while also emphasising the need for further research and careful consideration before the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care. We outline the current state of the science on psilocybin, incorporating articles published through April 2025. We identify key areas for further research and frame them within the context of therapeutic and ethical implications surrounding psilocybin's use in future clinical practice. We highlight the need for further research to address gaps in understanding of therapeutic dosage, efficacy across diverse populations, and long-term safety. Finally, we propose an agenda which calls for diversification of funding, collaborative research efforts, standardised training for healthcare providers, and careful consideration of ethical dilemmas inherent in the theorised clinical use of psilocybin. Crucially, we advocate for a balanced approach that prioritises rigorous scientific standards while considering the urgency of the need for better treatment options, ensuring equitable access and safety as the field progresses. We acknowledge that the single-country focus of the NNDC may limit the generalisability of recommendations to international contexts with differing healthcare systems and regulatory landscapes.

### Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for depression: emerging research on a psychedelic compound with a rich history [^117QPBBL]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

There is a serious need for novel therapies that treat individuals with depression, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). An emerging body of research has demonstrated that psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin, combined with supportive psychotherapy, exert rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. The use of psychedelics is not new: they have a rich history with evidence of their use in ritual and medical settings. However, due to political, social, and cultural pressures, their use was limited until modern clinical trials began to emerge in the 2010s. This review provides a comprehensive look at the potential use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression and TRD. It includes an overview of the history, pharmacology, and proposed mechanism of psilocybin, and describes several published studies in the last decade which have provided evidence of the efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for individuals with depression. It also includes a discussion of the limitations and barriers of current research on psychedelics. The results of these studies are contextualized within the current treatment landscape through an overview of the pathophysiology of depression and the treatments currently in use, as well as the clinical needs these novel therapies have the promise to fulfill.

Background

Preliminary data suggest that psilocybin-assisted treatment produces substantial and rapid antidepressant effects in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), but little is known about long-term outcomes.

Aims

This study sought to examine the efficacy and safety of psilocybin through 12months in participants with moderate to severe MDD who received psilocybin.

Methods

This randomized, waiting-list controlled study enrolled 27 patients aged 21–75 with moderate to severe unipolar depression (GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD)⩾17). Participants were randomized to an immediate or delayed (8weeks) treatment condition in which they received two doses of psilocybin with supportive psychotherapy. Twenty-four participants completed both psilocybin sessions and were followed through 12months following their second dose.

Results

All 24 participants attended all follow-up visits through the 12-month timepoint. Large decreases from baseline in GRID-HAMD scores were observed at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up (Cohen d = 2.3, 2.0, 2.6, and 2.4, respectively). Treatment response (⩾50% reduction in GRID-HAMD score from baseline) and remission were 75% and 58%, respectively, at 12months. There were no serious adverse events judged to be related to psilocybin in the long-term follow-up period, and no participants reported psilocybin use outside of the context of the study. Participant ratings of personal meaning, spiritual experience, and mystical experience after sessions predicted increased well-being at 12months, but did not predict improvement in depression.

Conclusions

These findings demonstrate that the substantial antidepressant effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy may be durable at least through 12months following acute intervention in some patients.

### Protocols and practices in psilocybin assisted psychotherapy for depression: a systematic review [^114XDCGd]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) is a promising treatment option for depression, with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) providing preliminary support for its safety and efficacy. However, there is a lack of consistency across existing treatment protocols and psychotherapeutic approaches. The objective of this review is to summarize and compare current psychotherapy methods of PAP in treating depression and distress in life-threatening illnesses. We sought to comprehensively summarize published psychotherapy protocols from clinical trials to provide insights for future practices.

Methods

A systematic search of four databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL) for data relating to psychotherapy protocols was conducted by two independent reviewers.

Results

In total, our search identified 1869 articles; after removing duplicates, we screened 1107 articles. We included 70 articles in the full-text review and determined that 28 were eligible for the final review. All protocols include sessions before (preparatory) and after (integration) the psychedelic dosing session with supportive monitoring. However, there was substantial variability and inconsistencies in all other aspects of therapy protocols (e.g., duration and number of sessions, model of therapy). Additionally, significant limitations were identified in the frequent need for more clarity in the description of therapeutic approaches.

Conclusion

In published clinical trials, PAP has consisted of preparation, supportive dosing, and integration sessions. Beyond this basic framework, significant heterogeneity and lack of clarity were identified in reported psychotherapy protocols, meaning a validated and universally agreed upon protocol for PAP currently does not exist. Future studies should more clearly define and report psychotherapeutic components to identify the safest and most efficacious approaches to PAP.

### Psilocybin with psychological support for treatment-resistant depression: an open-label feasibility study [^115LtYvD]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Psilocybin is a serotonin receptor agonist that occurs naturally in some mushroom species. Recent studies have assessed the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for various conditions, including end-of-life anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and smoking and alcohol dependence, with promising preliminary results. Here, we aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression.

Methods

In this open-label feasibility trial, 12 patients (six men, six women) with moderate-to-severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. There was no control group. Psychological support was provided before, during, and after each session. The primary outcome measure for feasibility was patient-reported intensity of psilocybin's effects. Patients were monitored for adverse reactions during the dosing sessions and subsequent clinic and remote follow-up. Depressive symptoms were assessed with standard assessments from 1 week to 3 months after treatment, with the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) serving as the primary efficacy outcome. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN14426797.

Findings

Psilocybin's acute psychedelic effects typically became detectable 30–60 min after dosing, peaked 2–3 h after dosing, and subsided to negligible levels at least 6 h after dosing. Mean self-rated intensity (on a 0–1 scale) was 0.51 (SD 0.36) for the low-dose session and 0.75 (SD 0.27) for the high-dose session. Psilocybin was well tolerated by all of the patients, and no serious or unexpected adverse events occurred. The adverse reactions we noted were transient anxiety during drug onset (all patients), transient confusion or thought disorder (nine patients), mild and transient nausea (four patients), and transient headache (four patients). Relative to baseline, depressive symptoms were markedly reduced 1 week (mean QIDS difference -11.8, 95% CI -9.15 to -14.35, p = 0.002, Hedges' g = 3.1) and 3 months (-9.2, 95% CI -5.69 to -12.71, p = 0.003, Hedges' g = 2) after high-dose treatment. Marked and sustained improvements in anxiety and anhedonia were also noted.

Interpretation

This study provides preliminary support for the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression and motivates further trials, with more rigorous designs, to better examine the therapeutic potential of this approach.

### Efficacy of psilocybin for treating symptoms of depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116DVUch]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of indexed and non-indexed randomised trials we investigated the efficacy of psilocybin to treat symptoms of depression compared with placebo or non-psychoactive drugs. The protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (see supplementary Appendix A). The study overall did not deviate from the pre-registered protocol; one clarification was made to highlight that any non-psychedelic comparator was eligible for inclusion, including placebo, niacin, micro doses of psychedelics, and drugs that are considered the standard of care in depression (eg, SSRIs).

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^112E8Q65]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, evidence for therapeutic benefits of psilocybin suggest promise, though several limitations should be acknowledged. Clinical trials, for example, are highly protocolised and controlled, and may not always generalise to non-research clinical settings. Investigations of diverse populations which adequately represent the target population of the disorders in question are much needed. For instance, more than 80% of the study participants in psychedelic trials have been white individualswhich severely limits our ability to understand efficacy amongst other racial and ethnic groups, and in other underserved and underrepresented populations. Finally, therapeutic mechanisms of action are also understudied, and they are likely more complicated than first envisaged and may differ drastically across indications. In particular, the differential contributions of pharmacology and psychotherapy are closely intertwined and not yet separable based on the current literature, but psychotherapeutic approaches, whether structured or unstructured, could plausibly play a role in observed efficacy. Overall, therapeutic mechanisms likely involve diverse pathophysiological processes across cellular, circuit-based, cognitive, psychological, social and anthropological systems, requiring expansion of resources to new disciplines and multi-disciplinary collaboration to identify the contribution of any given process, level, or system to both risks and potential benefits of psychedelic therapies.

Call to action

To this end, we advocate for (Fig. 1):
1 Expansion of funding mechanisms, including those from major public funding bodies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to facilitate rigorous and hypothesis driven evidence with clear impact on clinical decision making and to facilitate hypothesis generating pilot studies.
2 Large-scale studies incorporating multidisciplinary expansion across basic, translational, and clinical sciences, to support richer understanding of mechanisms of therapeutic action.
3 Multicentre collaboration through consortia of leading centres with predefined data harmonisation protocols to facilitate big-data approaches and multi-site secondary analyses.
4 Further studies involving diverse study populations with intentional efforts to involve participants from marginalised communities and diverse backgrounds with varying degrees of disease severity and complexity of life circumstances.
5 More robust longitudinal evaluations of potential harms of short-term and long-term psilocybin administration as well as potential risk factors for adverse events.
6 Large-scale factorial design studies to evaluate the relative contributions of drug vs. associated therapy as well as the interactions between drug and therapy.

### Effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy on major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^116uhW8H]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

The substantial negative public health impact of MDD underscores the importance of conducting more research into drugs with rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. Current pharmacotherapies for depression have variable efficacy and unwanted adverse effects. Novel antidepressants with rapid and sustained effects on mood and cognition could represent a breakthrough in the treatment of depression and may potentially improve or save lives. Therefore, the primary objective of this randomized clinical trial was to investigate the effect of psilocybin therapy in patients with MDD.

### Effect of psilocybin versus escitalopram on depression symptom severity in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder: observational 6-month follow-up of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^111MgSTd]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study investigated the sustained effects of Psilocybin Therapy (PT) versus Escitalopram Treatment (ET) in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) over a six-month follow-up period. MDD, the first or second leading cause of disability globally, is characterized by marked changes in mood, motivation, pleasure and cognition. Even when an episode of MDD has been successfully treated, the risks of relapse or recurrence are high — roughly one in three patients achieving remission will relapse within one year. A key consideration of any treatment of MDD, therefore, is its capacity to produce sustained antidepressant response or remission.

In the original 6-week trial,59 patients were randomised to one of two active treatment conditions: PT or ET. The PT condition consisted of two high-dose (25 mg) treatment sessions with the serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin, administered with support from two study therapists (at least one being a qualified mental health professional), in addition to preparatory and integrative psychotherapy and daily placebo capsules. The ET condition consisted of daily doses of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram — 10 mg for three weeks followed by 20 mg for a further three weeks — as well as equivalent psychological support including dosing sessions with placebo-like doses of psilocybin (1 mg). This ET condition thus approximated a gold-standard treatment for depression of concomitant evidence-based pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, albeit at a somewhat briefer and more intensive treatment rhythm. That is, typical antidepressant drug effects are usually seen after 4–6 weeks of treatment, and most (non-private) psychotherapies for depression, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, are administered at a frequency of 1 h per week.

### Efficacy of psilocybin for treating symptoms of depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116EwXps]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

This review's findings on psilocybin's efficacy in reducing symptoms of depression are encouraging for its use in clinical practice as a drug intervention for patients with primary or secondary depression, particularly when combined with psychological support and administered in a supervised clinical environment. However, the highly standardised treatment setting, high cost, and lack of regulatory guidelines and legal safeguards associated with psilocybin treatment need to be dealt with before it can be established in clinical practice.

### Efficacy of psilocybin for treating symptoms of depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11558Xd7]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Depression affects an estimated 300 million people around the world, an increase of nearly 20% over the past decade. Worldwide, depression is also the leading cause of disability.

Drugs for depression are widely available but these seem to have limited efficacy, can have serious adverse effects, and are associated with low patient adherence. Importantly, the treatment effects of antidepressant drugs do not appear until 4–7 weeks after the start of treatment, and remission of symptoms can take months. Additionally, the likelihood of relapse is high, with 40–60% of people with depression experiencing a further depressive episode, and the chance of relapse increasing with each subsequent episode.

Since the early 2000s, the naturally occurring serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin, found in several species of mushrooms, has been widely discussed as a potential treatment for depression. Psilocybin's mechanism of action differs from that of classic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and might improve the treatment response rate, decrease time to improvement of symptoms, and prevent relapse post-remission. Moreover, more recent assessments of harm have consistently reported that psilocybin generally has low addictive potential and toxicity and that it can be administered safely under clinical supervision.

### Efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted treatment for major depressive disorder: prospective 12-month follow-up [^112gghvb]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this long-term follow-up of participants who were not blinded to the drug condition suggest that psilocybin-assisted treatment for MDD produces large and stable antidepressant effects throughout at least 12 months after treatment. These data document larger effects of longer duration than previous studies of psilocybin in depressed patients. Further studies are needed with active treatment or placebo comparison controls in larger and more diverse populations.

### Effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy on major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^114esevo]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of psilocybin-assisted therapy in producing large, rapid, and sustained antidepressant effects among patients with MDD. These data expand the findings of previous studies involving patients with cancer and depression as well as patients with treatment-resistant depression by suggesting that psilocybin may be effective in the much larger population of MDD. Further studies are needed with active treatment or placebo controls and in larger and more diverse populations.

Psilocybin — clinical and public health positioning — should be approached with optimism but caution; messaging about status and promise should be tempered, careful monitoring in clinical and unsanctioned settings is necessary to ensure protection, psychedelics should be considered as second- or third-line therapies until more clarity is gained, an adequate evidence base must be developed to guide appropriate training and expertise, and the limits of efficacy must be carefully articulated with sustained commitment to monitoring, implementation science, and continuing education for any future roll-out if approved as therapies.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^113Dj16k]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

US National Network of Depression Centers (NNDC) Task Group on Psychedelics and Related Compounds — consensus statement summarises clinical expertise and opinion on psilocybin's therapeutic potential while emphasising the need for further research and careful consideration before integration into routine clinical care. It outlines the current state of the science and identifies key areas for further research within therapeutic and ethical contexts, highlighting gaps in therapeutic dosage, efficacy across diverse populations, and long-term safety. The statement proposes an agenda calling for diversification of funding, collaborative research efforts, standardised training for healthcare providers, and careful consideration of ethical dilemmas in professional clinical use. It advocates a balanced approach that prioritises rigorous scientific standards while considering the urgency for better treatment options, ensuring equitable access and safety as the field progresses, and it acknowledges that a single-country focus may limit generalisability to international contexts with differing healthcare systems and regulatory landscapes.

### Effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy on major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^1122p2ia]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a substantial public health burden, but current treatments have limited effectiveness and adherence. Recent evidence suggests that 1 or 2 administrations of psilocybin with psychological support produces antidepressant effects in patients with cancer and in those with treatment-resistant depression.

Objective

To investigate the effect of psilocybin therapy in patients with MDD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized, waiting list-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Adults aged 21 to 75 years with an MDD diagnosis, not currently using antidepressant medications, and without histories of psychotic disorder, serious suicide attempt, or hospitalization were eligible to participate. Enrollment occurred between August 2017 and April 2019, and the 4-week primary outcome assessments were completed in July 2019. A total of 27 participants were randomized to an immediate treatment condition group (n = 15) or delayed treatment condition group (waiting list control condition; n = 12). Data analysis was conducted from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, and included participants who completed the intervention (evaluable population).

Interventions

Two psilocybin sessions (session 1: 20 mg/70 kg; session 2: 30 mg/70 kg) were given (administered in opaque gelatin capsules with approximately 100 mL of water) in the context of supportive psychotherapy (approximately 11 hours). Participants were randomized to begin treatment immediately or after an 8-week delay.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome, depression severity was assessed with the GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD) scores at baseline (score of ≥ 17 required for enrollment) and weeks 5 and 8 after enrollment for the delayed treatment group, which corresponded to weeks 1 and 4 after the intervention for the immediate treatment group. Secondary outcomes included the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated (QIDS-SR).

Results

Of the randomized participants, 24 of 27 (89%) completed the intervention and the week 1 and week 4 postsession assessments. This population had a mean (SD) age of 39.8 (12.2) years, was composed of 16 women (67%), and had a mean (SD) baseline GRID-HAMD score of 22.8 (3.9). The mean (SD) GRID-HAMD scores at weeks 1 and 4 (8.0 [7.1] and 8.5 [5.7]) in the immediate treatment group were statistically significantly lower than the scores at the comparable time points of weeks 5 and 8 (23.8 [5.4] and 23.5 [6.0]) in the delayed treatment group. The effect sizes were large at week 5 (Cohen d = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4–3.5; P < .001) and week 8 (Cohen d = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5–3.7; P < .001). The QIDS-SR documented a rapid decrease in mean (SD) depression score from baseline to day 1 after session 1 (16.7 [3.5] vs 6.3 [4.4]; Cohen d = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.8–3.5; P < .001), which remained statistically significantly reduced through the week 4 follow-up (6.0 [5.7]; Cohen d = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5–3.0; P < .001). In the overall sample, 17 participants (71%) at week 1 and 17 (71%) at week 4 had a clinically significant response to the intervention (≥ 50% reduction in GRID-HAMD score), and 14 participants (58%) at week 1 and 13 participants (54%) at week 4 were in remission (≤ 7 GRID-HAMD score).

Conclusions and Relevance

Findings suggest that psilocybin with therapy is efficacious in treating MDD, thus extending the results of previous studies of this intervention in patients with cancer and depression and of a nonrandomized study in patients with treatment-resistant depression.

### Efficacy of psilocybin for treating symptoms of depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117YNP1c]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Remission rate — Overall, the likelihood of psilocybin intervention leading to remission of depression was nearly three times greater than with placebo (risk ratio 2.96, 95% CI 1.69 to 5.17). Despite the use of different scales to measure response, there was little statistical heterogeneity between studies (I² = 7.1%, P = 0.37). PIs marginally crossed the line of no difference (0.93 to 2.38), indicating that there could be settings or populations in which psilocybin intervention would be less efficacious.

Exploring publication bias in response and remission rates data — We used Egger's test and a funnel plot to examine whether response and remission estimates were affected by small study biases. The result for Egger's test was non-significant (P > 0.05) for remission estimates, and no substantial asymmetry was observed in the funnel plots, providing no indication for the presence of bias against smaller studies with non-significant results. Egger's test was significant for response estimates (P = 0.002), which could indicate that there might be settings or populations where psilocybin's effects on treatment response are less robust. However, alternative explanations for funnel plot asymmetry are worth considering. For example, it is possible that smaller studies conducted at the early stages of a new psychotherapeutic intervention tend to include more high risk or responsive participants, and psychotherapeutic interventions tend to be delivered more effectively in smaller trials; both of these factors can exaggerate treatment response rates, resulting in some degree of funnel plot asymmetry. However, the relatively small number of included studies means that test power might be insufficient to distinguish real asymmetry from chance. Thus, this analysis should be considered exploratory.

### Control group outcomes in trials of psilocybin, SSRIs, or esketamine for depression: a meta-analysis [^115611cW]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Psilocybin has demonstrated rapid and sustained antidepressant efficacy, with acute-phase effect sizes often more than double those for conventional antidepressants. However, concerns have been raised that high rates of functional unblinding in combination with trial participants with positive expectations of psychedelic use might bias treatment outcomes.

Objective

To compare outcomes for patients receiving control treatments in randomized clinical trials of psilocybin for depression with control treatment outcomes from trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and esketamine.

Data Sources

Two previous meta-analyses and 1 US Food and Drug Administration review published between March 2019 and December 2024 were used to identify double-blind trials on adult major depressive disorder (MDD) or treatment-resistant depression (TRD) that had a relevant control treatment arm and used the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) for symptom rating.

Study Selection

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guideline, trials of psilocybin for MDD and TRD, esketamine for TRD, and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for MDD were selected. Studies that included only individuals aged younger than 18 years or older than 65 years, used a crossover design, or had a duration less than 2 weeks were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

All authors assessed the 3 reviews for includable trials. Three authors independently extracted data for all trials, with disagreements resolved by consensus discussion. Data were pooled using random-effects models.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Standardized mean change (SMC) in MADRS scores from baseline to up to 6 weeks after randomization was used to assess within-group effect sizes, and standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to assess between-group effect sizes. Omnibus Test of Moderators (QM) was used to test whether the study population significantly moderated effect sizes.

Results

The study included 17 trials: 4 of psilocybin (n = 373), 2 of esketamine (n = 573), and 11 of SSRIs (n = 4014). Pretreatment to posttreatment SMCs (SEMs) were 1.21 (0.15) for psilocybin, 1.28 (0.06) for SSRIs, and 1.43 (0.15) for esketamine and were 0.50 (0.15), 1.00 (0.08), and 1.12 (0.17) for their respective control treatments. Study population was a significant moderator of between-group SMDs (QM, 10.7; df, 2; p = 0.005) and pre- to post-control treatment SMCs (QM, 10.4; df, 2; p = 0.005) but not of pre- to post-active treatment SMCs (QM, 1.21; df, 2; p = 0.55). MADRS response rates for control treatments in SSRI trials were 14 percentage points higher than in psilocybin trials and in esketamine trials were 23 percentage points higher than in psilocybin trials. Dropout rates for psilocybin (active treatment: 10 of 186 [5%]; control: 20 of 187 [11%]) and esketamine (active treatment: 43 of 349 [12%]; control: 18 of 224 [8%]) were similar and considerably lower than for SSRIs (active treatment: 866 of 2694 [32%]; control: 467 of 1320 [35%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this meta-analysis of control treatment outcomes in trials of psilocybin, SSRIs, or esketamine for depression, participants receiving control treatment in psilocybin trials had significantly less improvement in depression ratings than participants receiving control treatment in trials of SSRIs or esketamine. This might indicate that psilocybin's antidepressant efficacy is overestimated compared with that of SSRIs and esketamine.

### Results from a long-term observational follow-up study of a single dose of psilocybin for a treatment-resistant episode of major depressive disorder [^114z9CuV]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: The largest randomized study of psilocybin to date demonstrated the efficacy of COMP360 25 mg (Compass Pathways' investigational proprietary pharmaceutical-grade synthesized psilocybin formulation) in participants with treatment-resistant depression (COMP 001), compared with 10 mg and 1 mg doses. Here, we report findings from COMP 004, a 52-week observational follow-up of patients from COMP 001 and COMP 003, a small open-label study of the coadministration of 25 mg COMP360 with continuing antidepressant treatment.

Methods: Adverse events (AEs) were collected over the full 52-week period. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to a prespecified depressive event over the 52 weeks following COMP360 administration in COMP 001 participants, presented as Kaplan-Meier estimates. A post hoc analysis included only participants that entered COMP 004. Data were collected from July 2020 to July 2022.

Results: Sixty-six participants entered COMP 004 (COMP 001, n = 58 [25 mg group n = 22, 10 mg group n = 19, 1 mg group n = 17]; COMP 003, n = 8). Few AEs were reported post-entry into COMP 004, with 1 AE of mild suicidal ideation in the 1 mg group deemed possibly related to study drug. For all COMP 001 patients (n = 233), median time to depressive event was greater for the 25 mg group (92 days) compared to the 10 mg (83 days) and 1 mg (62 days) groups, with the majority of participants having had a depressive event by Week 12 (25 mg n = 37/75, 10 mg n = 38/79, 1 mg n = 44/75). The post hoc supplementary analysis of those who enrolled in COMP 004 from COMP 001 exhibited the difference between groups more strikingly (25 mg, 189 days; 10 mg, 43 days; 1 mg, 21 days); however, only 10 participants experienced a depressive event post-COMP 004 enrollment (25 mg n = 6, 10 mg n = 3, 1 mg n = 1) from COMP 001 and none from COMP 003. At COMP 004 entry, the 1 mg group had the highest number of participants on antidepressant medication (n = 10; 10 mg, n = 9; 25 mg, n = 6) and generally initiated treatment earlier.

Conclusion: Over 52 weeks, a single administration of 25 mg psilocybin suggested longer maintenance of antidepressant effect than both 1 mg and 10 mg. Larger long-term studies are required to confirm these findings and provide clarity on the longer-term effects of psilocybin.

### The effects of psilocybin in adults with major depressive disorder and the general population: findings from neuroimaging studies [^111aFBhs]. Psychiatry Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of psilocybin as treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) has been examined as a promising alternative to traditional first-line options. We reviewed existing literature to provide a synthesis of the extant neuroimaging observations with psilocybin, and to identify putative therapeutic targets for target engagement studies with psilocybin, and potentially other psychedelics. We assessed neuroimaging observations with psilocybin among participants with MDD and healthy populations. A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar and PsycINFO from database inception to November 17th, 2021. The study quality (i.e., risk of bias) was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. A total of ten studies evaluated psilocybin in healthy populations and three studies assessed psilocybin in MDD participants using neuroimaging techniques. Following psilocybin administration, a decrease in amygdala activity and a reduction in depressive symptoms was observed in two studies. Changes in functional connectivity and activation of prefrontal limbic structures, specifically the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala, was seen in healthy populations. There was high heterogeneity in methodology (e.g., dosing schedule and imaging methods) amongst included studies. Longitudinal studies are needed to further elucidate psilocybin treatment for MDD, its long-term effects and the possibility of sustained therapeutic effects.

### Psilocybin-assisted therapy for major depressive disorder: an exploratory placebo-controlled, fixed-order trial [^111bpr8H]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Several early phase studies have demonstrated that psilocybin-assisted therapy has rapid-acting and persisting antidepressant effects from just one or two doses. However, methodological limitations (e.g., placebo-control, blinding) limit interpretability of the existing literature.

Methods

In an exploratory placebo-controlled, within-subject, fixed-order study, individuals with moderate to severe major depressive disorder were administered placebo (n = 19) followed by psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) (n = 15) 4 weeks later. Dosing sessions were embedded within an manualized course of psychotherapy. Enhanced blinding procedures were used. Depression, anxiety, and quality of life were measured over a 16-week study period.

Results

Depression and anxiety significantly improved following both placebo and psilocybin with no significant difference in the degree of change between the two conditions. However, antidepressant effect sizes were larger after psilocybin (d ' = 1.02–2.27) than after placebo (d ' = 0.65–0.99) and there were high rates of response (66.7%) and remission (46.7%) following psilocybin administration. Antidepressant effects following psilocybin persisted, on average, for 2 months and there were persisting improvements in mood-related quality of life domains. The strength of mystical-type experience during psilocybin dosing was not correlated with subsequent antidepressant effects.

Conclusions

The results of this exploratory study highlight the complex interplay between expectancy, therapy effects, and drug/placebo effects in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy studies. Nonetheless, the acute and persisting clinical improvements observed following psilocybin support further study of its potential in the treatment of major depression. Future studies should more explicitly mitigate and measure expectancy effects and assess the impact of repeated dosing and different forms of psychotherapeutic support.

### Effect of psilocybin versus escitalopram on depression symptom severity in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder: observational 6-month follow-up of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^117TeAtB]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Unlike the current study, the single-group or crossover methodologies of previous studies did not allow for long-term parallel group comparisons, and entry into a non-psychedelic waitlist or inert placebo arm could cause disappointment effects that exaggerate between-condition differences.

Thirty four percent (34%) of patients in the ET reported continuation or resumption of medication in the follow-up, yet ET patients exhibited sustained rates of response around 50% and remission around 30% at six months. Given that a successful course of SSRI therapy is typically associated with a relapse rate of around 40% six months after discontinuation (Kato et al. 2021), we conjecture that the trial's intensive psychological support might have contributed to the observed benefits in the ET condition post trial. Such an inference is equally applicable to the PT group. However, standard PT includes psychological support by default, a practice not always paralleled in SSRI treatment protocols, where medication is often prescribed without accompanying therapy (16).

In meta-analysis, the odds of depression relapse following psychotherapy alone are approximately half of those associated with medications alone — meaning patients are more likely to relapse after pharmacotherapy. While patients in the ET condition received psychological support only during the six weeks trial treatment phase (versus 18–24 weeks of psychotherapy for a conventional course of CBT), they received around 20 h of psychological support during this time — often from two trained mental health professionals. In other words, this was a relatively standard "dose" of psychotherapeutic hours but administered over a treatment period approximately 75% shorter, including two prolonged sessions of 6–8 h each. To our knowledge, outside of psychedelic therapy, no prior study has investigated such a high-intensity psychotherapeutic intervention for depression in combination with escitalopram. Indeed, additive benefits have been observed with conventional psychotherapy–psychopharmacological combinations, with previous meta-analyses finding that combined interventions are more effective than either treatment alone in both the short- and the long-term. Given that antidepressant effects can begin as early as one week after treatment (and approach peak efficacy at 6 weeks,), even the brief course of escitalopram of the ET condition might have potentiated psychotherapeutic interventions by, for instance, reducing depressive symptoms like amotivation and hopelessness that can impede progress. We present this possible accounting for the durability of therapeutic effects in the ET while recognizing the potential confounding influence of treatment seeking behaviour in the follow-up period.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^112geqLy]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Since then, additional early-phase studies have been initiated to test psilocybin as a potential treatment for a wide variety of neuropsychiatric, neurological, and other disorders. Currently MDD remains the most extensively studied. An open label pilot study of 12 individuals with treatment-resistant depression showed a response rate of 67% one week after treatment, and 42% remaining in remission at 3 month follow up. A later wait-list controlled trial observed a clinical response of 71% and remission in 54% of 24 patients four weeks after two doses of psilocybin (20 mg/70 kg followed by 30 mg/70 kg), with a sustained response at 12 month follow up. Other recently published studies include a large phase-2 double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating psilocybin plus psychological support during administration for treatment-resistant depression, which showed a positive yet more modest response of shorter duration compared to prior studies. Of the 79 patients in the high-dose (25 mg) treatment arm, 23 showed remission, which represented a higher remission rate than the 1 mg control condition (29% vs. 14% remission) over three weeks. However, the 10 mg group (low-dose) showed no significant difference compared with the control (1 mg) condition. Furthermore, suicidality was raised as a serious adverse event in both the 25 mg and 10 mg arms, prompting concern. Follow up phase III trials are ongoing, using the same dosing protocol along with a separate protocol that includes a second dose at three weeks. Another recent RCT of 104 participants with MDD comparing psilocybin + psychotherapy to niacin, placebo + psychotherapy showed a clinically significant response in 42% of the psilocybin group vs. 11% in placebo, and 25% remission in the psilocybin group vs. 9% in placebo. Although some of these response and remission rates are indeed striking, when viewed through the lens of non-response the results are more sobering. In these studies, 11–58% (mean 35%) of participants did not achieve treatment response, and 29–85% (mean 59%) did not achieve remission. Future work should consider precision medicine approaches to identify suitable candidates for therapeutic psilocybin while also exploring explanations of why some participants do not respond.

### Psilocybin-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression in the US: a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis [^116WBYA1]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common mood disorder globally. In the US, an estimated 21 million adults or 8.3% of the adult population have MDD, and the annual health, social, and economic costs total $330 billion. While several pharmacological and psychosocial interventions are available to treat MDD, about one-third of people with MDD do not adequately respond, a condition called treatment-resistant depression (TRD). TRD is associated with higher all-cause and suicide-specific mortality and higher overall and mental health-related costs than responsive MDD.

In an effort to develop new MDD treatments, psychedelic therapies have been tested in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for their efficacy in reducing MDD symptoms. Among the most studied psychedelics is psilocybin, a naturally occurring serotonin 1A/2A receptor agonist found in Psilocybe fungi. A 6-week RCT (N = 104) found that 25% of participants with MDD who received a single-dose psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) achieved sustained remission, compared to 9.1% in the active placebo group (P < 0.05). An earlier and smaller RCT among individuals with MDD (N = 52) found similar results, with a 2-week remission rate of 54% compared to 12% in the control group (P < 0.01). Finally, in an RCT focused on individuals with TRD (N = 79), single-dose PAT led to a three-week remission rate of 29%, which is higher than the 13.7% remission rate for standard third-line antidepressants.

### Effect of psilocybin versus escitalopram on depression symptom severity in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder: observational 6-month follow-up of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^116jPrLk]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Follow-up assessments took place via online questionnaires at monthly intervals for six months after the trial's end, during which time patients received no additional treatment from the study team and had no restrictions on their psychiatric care. Follow-up assessments were delivered to participants via email via the online survey platform Alchemer. Each questionnaire consisted of a series of validated scales arranged sequentially, designed to be self-explanatory and user-friendly. The participants were asked to complete the questionnaires within one week of receipt to maintain consistency in response timing across the study cohort. The questionnaire interface was accessible on a variety of electronic devices, ensuring that participants could complete the forms at their convenience. Upon completion, participants submitted their responses directly through the online system. Of note, patients in the ET condition were neither required to stop nor to continue escitalopram. Please seeandfor further details of the original study and treatment.

All procedures involving human patients were approved by the Brent Research Ethics Committee, the U.K. MHRA, HRA and Imperial College London JRO and GDPR, as well as the risk assessment and trial management review board at the site (NIHR, Imperial CRF).number, Approval Number 17HH3790.

Procedures

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either PT) or ET. Patients in the PT group received two doses of 25 mg of psilocybin administered orally at visit 2 and visit 4, with psychological support on dosing days and subsequent integration sessions. The ET group received 1 mg of psilocybin at visit 2, followed by daily doses of 10 mg of escitalopram for the first three weeks, increased to 20 mg for the next three weeks. The second dose of 1 mg of psilocybin was given at visit 4, with placebo capsules on other days. Assessments included functional MRI, cognitive and affective processing tasks, and clinician-rated evaluations at baseline and week 6. Psychological support was provided at each visit. Follow-up continued for 6 months to monitor long-term outcomes. All outcome measures reported were pre-specified in the study protocol. Detailed information about protocol violations can be found in the original trial publication. Psilocybin was provided by COMPASS Pathways, and escitalopram and placebo by the Pharmacy Manufacturing Unit at Guy's and St. Thomas's Hospital.

### Effect of psilocybin versus escitalopram on depression symptom severity in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder: observational 6-month follow-up of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^114jstSw]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Should such results replicate in future work, one possibility is that a brief course of escitalopram can exert neuroplasticity-enhancing effects that, like psilocybin, enhance intensive psychotherapy. Escitalopram has recently been shown to augment neuroplasticity and facilitate learning, especially emotional relearning. It is at least plausible therefore that neuroplasticity-related mechanisms are at work in both ET and PT conditions of this trial, though future study is required to confirm such hypotheses and evaluate whether they may also underlie more conventional treatment rhythms (e.g. weekly psychotherapy). A final consideration is that the two 1 mg doses of psilocybin administered could have played a role in the antidepressant effects observed in this arm. This dosage aligns with the quantities used in previous research on microdosing of magic mushrooms. Although recent research has sparked interest in the benefits of microdosing psychedelics for mental health and wellbeing, existing studies have yet to demonstrate substantive or reliable long-term positive effects. Moreover, microdosing typically involves ingesting small amounts of psychedelics at least 2–3 times a week over numerous weeks, unlike the regimen employed in our study, which involved two 1 mg doses separated by three weeks. Therefore, we submit that these doses were unlikely to significantly contribute to the results.

Compared with ET, patients in the PT condition reported overall greater improvements in other study outcomes measures assessed in the follow-up period; general functioning, connectedness and meaning in life. The superior enhancements in functioning in the PT condition carry potential importance, as clinical guidelines for MDD prioritize the restoration of functioning as a key objective (e.g.), and symptom remission frequently does not coincide with functional recovery. As such, functioning may be of at least equal importance for adjudicating the relative efficacy of the therapies presently under study as functioning might lead to improved quality-adjusted life years (QALYs;) over time, a metric usually used for assessing the costs-effectiveness of new treatments. An item-level analysis was conducted to probe the most responsive domains of functioning to PT versus ET, revealing that domains linked to home management, social and private leisure activities, and meaningful relationships, but not the ability to work, responded more strongly to PT than ET (Supplementary Table S7).

Randomisation and masking

After enrolment of a participant by a study physician, the resident pharmacy was responsible for randomisation and allocation of the participant to either the psilocybin-assisted therapy group or the placebo-therapy group according to a priori computer-generated sequence in a 1:1 ratio without further stratification. Each participant was randomised after their third visit (−1d). The resident pharmacy had no further role in the rest of the trial. Allocations were stored in sealed, opaque envelopes. Placebo capsules were identical to the psilocybin-containing capsules in size, weight, shape and colour and contained pure mannitol. Pharmaceutical-grade, synthetic psilocybin was obtained from Compass Pathways, Ldt. Participants and study personnel except the resident pharmacist were blind to participants' treatment allocation until after the database was locked.

### Efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted treatment for major depressive disorder: prospective 12-month follow-up [^116Sojfe]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Of note, eight patients (33%) reported beginning a new course of treatment with a daily antidepressant drug at some point during the 12-month follow-up period, which is similar to the 32% of patients in a previous trial that did so by 6 months. Although patients who used antidepressants during the follow-up period had higher GRID-HAMD scores at baseline, at 12 months they did not significantly differ from those who did not initiate medications. Determining the extent of the contribution of psilocybin vs other medications to clinical improvement in those who resumed antidepressant use is not possible. However, participant ratings of persisting well-being attributed to the psilocybin sessions were not significantly different from those who did not use antidepressant medications, suggesting that psilocybin treatment resulted in some independent benefit.

Although relapse and remission rates at 12 months were favorable, the ability to accurately compare the long-term efficacy of psilocybin-assisted treatment to that of standard antidepressant treatment is limited. The majority of recent studies of long-term antidepressant efficacy drop non-responders from follow-up and focus on rate of relapse among those who respond to a particular drug, which is often a minority of the intention-to-treat sample. In our sample, of the 17 participants who met criteria for treatment response at 1-month follow-up, 12 (71%) continued to meet criteria for treatment response at all subsequent timepoints. An additional 3 participants who responded at 1 month also met criteria for treatment response at 12 months, but had one or more interim assessments during which their GRID-HAMD score was elevated out of the range for treatment response. The 71% continuous treatment response at 12 months is somewhat higher than the 54% rate reported in a study of fluoxetine responders who were maintained on fluoxetine, and much higher than those switched to placebo (28%).

Conventional antidepressants such as the SSRI used in this trial (i.e. escitalopram) and psychotherapy are generally considered effective treatments for depression, and their combination produces greater and more persistent benefits, as well as greater tolerability, than either intervention alone. Nevertheless, even gold-standard treatments have limitations. SSRI pharmacotherapy typically involves long-term daily dosing even after positive responses to mitigate risks of depression relapse or recurrence. This is a particularly important drawback given that SSRIs are associated with adverse side-effects like sexual dysfunction, weight gain, fatigue, and emotional blunting, and non-adherence rates up to 50%. Psychotherapy is associated with fewer side-effects and more persistent benefits, but also relatively high treatment drop-rates of approximately 17.5% in depression. Further, both SSRIs and psychotherapy are relatively slow-acting, often requiring weeks or months to achieve clinical response. There is thus a clear need for new treatment options for depression.

PT is being increasingly investigated as a rapid-acting treatment for MDD and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Phase 1, Phase 2A, and Phase 2B, trials have demonstrated that one or two doses of psilocybin, administered with psychological support, can produce almost immediate reductions in depressive symptoms that may persist for months. These are primarily attributed to serotonin 2A receptor signaling in the brain, altering neural information processing that, in appropriate contexts, can lead to experiences like emotional catharsis, ego dissolution, cognitive reappraisaland psychological insight.

In our original study, PT and ET induced comparable reductions in depressive symptoms on the primary outcome of self-reported depression at 6-weeks. However, the PT group exhibited signs of superior response on certain domains of depression, including mood and anhedonia, as well as on all secondary outcomes, including measures of work and social functioning, well-being, rumination, and suppression of negative emotions. PT also appeared positively affect several sexual functioning domains, while those on ET reported declines.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the antidepressant response and evolution of all acquired secondary measures up to six months of naturalistic follow-up after the trial's primary endpoint at 6 weeks, including the differential response between PT and ET conditions. Such questions are of great relevance for evaluating the viability of psilocybin-assisted therapy as an emerging treatment of depression.

### Single-dose synthetic psilocybin with psychotherapy for treatment-resistant bipolar type II major depressive episodes: a nonrandomized open-label trial [^114tF2U9]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

In this study, most participants remitted rapidly (ie, within 1 week of dosing), and in most participants, remission persisted for the 12-week study duration. The 3 participants who restarted medication due to lack of benefit or relapse following improvement generally had poorer response throughout the trial. Thus, in a sample of patients with treatment-resistant cyclical mood disorder, achieving persistent remission over a 3-month period is notable, especially given the single dosing of psilocybin. Further follow-up is warranted.

Despite the high remission rate, there was an association between general intensity of the psychedelic experience and clinical benefit. In particular, individuals in whom psilocybin administration had little subjective impact showed little clinical benefit. The necessity of a distinct psychedelic experience for response remains a point of debate within the field, and the findings of this study suggest that the degree of psychedelic experience is predictive of longer-term antidepressant effects.

This study supports further study of the utility of psychedelics in the BDII population. Consideration should be given to whether psilocybin administration alters (increases or decreases) the high risk of substance use disorders in the population, whether the novel changes in perspective and emotional processing seen with psychedelic administration can be reliably assessed in this population, and whether such cognitive alterations are necessary or sufficient for therapeutic effects. In light of this study, the safety and efficacy of psilocybin administration should be explored in a randomized clinical trial enrolling patients with BDII. Care should be taken in expanding this paradigm to BDI disorder given the higher potential risk.

Limitations

As an uncontrolled, open-label study, the efficacy findings could be influenced by multiple factors in addition to the effects of psilocybin, including selection biases in study participation, intensity of therapeutic contact, and expectation effects. The small sample size also limits results. The selected nature of the study population and high levels of motivation prevent extrapolation to the general population of people with bipolar illness. Participants were only followed up with for 12 weeks postdosing, providing limited information on the durability of response. Follow-up studies are needed to provide longer-term assessment. The single dose protocol of this study does not capture benefits or harms that could occur with multiple dosings. Also, these findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with BDI or BDII in a mixed or hypomanic phase of their illness.

### Effect of psilocybin versus escitalopram on depression symptom severity in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder: observational 6-month follow-up of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^1169koBn]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A further limitation is the reliance on retrospective and self-reported treatment assessments. This methodological approach may introduce recall bias, as participants' memories of their symptoms and behaviours can be subject to inaccuracy over time. Moreover, the retrospective nature of self-reporting could be influenced by participants' current state of mind and social expectations. These factors should be carefully considered when interpreting the results.

Another factor that is important to discuss is that daily escitalopram (43 doses in the present study) versus two doses of psilocybin implies assumptions regarding the need for a steady state drug action with the former and a quite distinct longer-tailed action with the latter — implying a carryover action with PT that endures well after the psilocybin/psilocin itself has been metabolized from the body. This 'carryover' type action is exactly how the potential mechanisms of PT have previously been characterized, and differentiated from the action of SSRIs. This is important as it implies that whereas PT is assumed to have a long-tailed causal action, a 6-week course of an SSRI is not generally assumed to act in this way, e.g. with guidelines advising sustained use to avoid relapse and evidence showing shorter time-to-relapse than psychotherapy. In other words, whereas causal connections between PT and enduring psychological changes have previously been inferred (e.g.) — the same precedent does not exist for escitalopram. Thus, one is left either inferring that any causal connection to the intervention in the ET arm was caused by the unusual intensity of psychotherapy in that condition, or that the justification for inferring any causal connection at all is not strong. Regarding this latter possibility, the implication would be that other spurious factors such as post-trial interventions, spontaneous improvement and/or regression to the mean may have contributed to the observed 6-month improvements in this condition. We attempted to understand this further by examining the correlational relationships of early treatment response at 6 weeks with subsequent follow-ups, i.e. correlating change between baseline and 6 weeks with change between baseline and subsequent follow-ups. We found that distinct patterns emerge for the PT and ET conditions. The PT group indeed exhibited correlations that tended to be larger than the ET group and consistently moderate, e.g. exceeding r = 0.30 (Supplementary Table S11). These results indicate that the order of individuals who responded most robustly at the 6-week mark maintained moderate stability through the first 5 months of the follow-up period, and suggest that early processes of change–elicited during PT–may have exerted a sustained influence throughout this period. In contrast, the ET did not exhibit the same level of stability. Although there were sporadic instances of large correlation, the pattern was not consistent, suggesting that the effects observed at follow-ups in ET may be less attributable to the original treatment and more attributable to alternative interventions or stochastic changes in the follow-up period.

### Efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted treatment for major depressive disorder: prospective 12-month follow-up [^112yNPHq]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Strengths of this study of psilocybin-facilitated treatment of depression include a primary outcome measure that was assessed by blinded clinician raters, the longest post-treatment follow-up interval to date, and excellent participant retention. Although no participants reported extraneous psilocybin use, 33% reported using antidepressants during the follow-up period, which precludes determination of the effects of psilocybin alone in those patients. Although the randomized waiting list-control design of the study allowed for comparison of short-term treatment effects to the control group, as described previously, the design did not allow for a comparison group at long-term follow-up. A recent study suggests that expectancy effects and psychotherapy may account for some of the clinical benefit of psychedelic-assisted therapy. In that study, which utilized a double-blind, double dummy design, both the high-dose and very low-dose psilocybin groups showed significant immediate decreases in depression, suggesting that the preparation and drug administration day procedures may reduce depressive symptoms even in the absence of high-dose psilocybin. Studies of other types of interventions for patients with MDD have demonstrated that placebo effects may last for weeks or months beyond intervention, and a lack of a comparator group makes it difficult to account for such effects in our study. Other limitations include the small sample size, the predominately Caucasian, non-Hispanic study sample, and exclusion of those judged to be at elevated risk of suicide.

Call to action — psilocybin clinical research priorities are stated explicitly: To this end, we advocate for expansion of funding mechanisms (including from major public funders such as the National Institutes of Health) to enable rigorous and hypothesis-driven evidence and pilot studies; large-scale studies incorporating multidisciplinary expansion across basic, translational, and clinical sciences; multicentre collaboration via consortia with predefined data harmonisation to facilitate big-data approaches and multi-site secondary analyses; further studies involving diverse study populations with intentional inclusion of marginalised communities and diverse backgrounds; and large-scale safety studies to evaluate the relative contributions of drug vs. associated therapy as well as their interactions.

Introduction

Bipolar II disorder (BDII) is a lifelong condition characterized by recurrent hypomanic and depressive episodes with a lifetime prevalence of at least 0.4% among adults. It causes a level of functional impairment and disability comparable to bipolar I disorder (BDI). Despite treatment, patients with BDII are typically symptomatic most of the time, primarily experiencing protracted and difficult-to-treat periods of depression. Bipolar disorder has high mortality, as 30% of affected individuals attempt and 5% to 15% commit suicide. Historically, BDII was viewed as the lesser of the bipolar disorders due to the absence of florid mania. However, recent studies document that functional impact and risk of suicide are similar in BDI and BDII.

Treatment options are limited for patients with BDII depression. Until recently, treatment guidelines did not distinguish between BDI and BDII. The recent Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments and International Society for Bipolar Disorders 2018 guidelines for management of bipolar disorder devoted a separate discussion to BDII. The primary conclusion was that the extant literature is inadequate to make evidence-based recommendations for patients with BDII. This is largely because most randomized trials of pharmacological treatments for bipolar depression do not include patients with BDII in sufficient number to independently test efficacy. In general, antidepressant medications have not demonstrated reliable benefit for this population, with ongoing debate as to whether their potential harms outweigh benefits in BDII. There is compelling need for novel agents in BDII depression for patients who have insufficiently benefited with or not tolerated existing therapies.

Psilocybin is a naturally occurring plant alkaloid derived from psilocybin mushrooms. When ingested, it creates a mind-altering effect mediated in part through its action as a 5HT2a receptor agonist. Psilocybin appears to increase associative learning, cognitive flexibility, and neuroplasticity. Several recent studies suggest that this agent has therapeutic properties in patients with major depressive disorder. The largest study compared 1-mg, 10-mg, and 25-mg dosages of psilocybin accompanied by psychological support in 233 patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. The higher doses showed a marked antidepressant effect with evidence of durability at 3 months following the single exposure to psilocybin. These trials were not without adverse effects, with headache, nausea, fatigue, and insomnia being the most common.

### Assessing the risk of symptom worsening in psilocybin-assisted therapy for depression: a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis [^114tueCo]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

We conducted a meta-analysis using individual participant data from three, two-dose psilocybin trials for depression (N = 102) with the aim of assessing the risk of symptom worsening. Clinically significant symptom worsening occurred for a minority of participants in the psilocybin and escitalopram conditions (∼10%) and for a majority of participants in the waitlist condition (63.6%). Using data from the two trials with control arms, the psilocybin arm showed a lower likelihood of symptom worsening versus waitlist, and no difference in the likelihood of symptom worsening versus escitalopram. The limitation of a relatively small sample size should be addressed in future studies.

### Increased global integration in the brain after psilocybin therapy for depression [^1119EVCH]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Psilocybin therapy shows antidepressant potential, but its therapeutic actions are not well understood. We assessed the subacute impact of psilocybin on brain function in two clinical trials of depression. The first was an open-label trial of orally administered psilocybin (10mg and 25mg, 7d apart) in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was recorded at baseline and 1d after the 25-mg dose. Beck's depression inventory was the primary outcome measure (MR/J00460X/1). The second trial was a double-blind phase II randomized controlled trial comparing psilocybin therapy with escitalopram. Patients with major depressive disorder received either 2×25mg oral psilocybin, 3 weeks apart, plus 6 weeks of daily placebo ('psilocybin arm') or 2×1mg oral psilocybin, 3 weeks apart, plus 6 weeks of daily escitalopram (10–20mg) ('escitalopram arm'). fMRI was recorded at baseline and 3 weeks after the second psilocybin dose (NCT03429075). In both trials, the antidepressant response to psilocybin was rapid, sustained and correlated with decreases in fMRI brain network modularity, implying that psilocybin's antidepressant action may depend on a global increase in brain network integration. Network cartography analyses indicated that 5-HT2A receptor-rich higher-order functional networks became more functionally interconnected and flexible after psilocybin treatment. The antidepressant response to escitalopram was milder and no changes in brain network organization were observed. Consistent efficacy-related brain changes, correlating with robust antidepressant effects across two studies, suggest an antidepressant mechanism for psilocybin therapy: global increases in brain network integration.

### The therapeutic potential of psilocybin beyond psychedelia through shared mechanisms with ketamine [^114mnnYX]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Major depressive disorder is a debilitating condition, with many patients unresponsive to conventional monoaminergic antidepressants. Rapid-acting antidepressants such as ketamine and psilocybin offer promising alternatives, relieving symptoms within hours. Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, and psilocybin, a serotonergic psychedelic primarily targeting 5-HT 2A receptors, both enhance synaptic plasticity in mood-regulating circuits through distinct mechanisms. This review synthesizes recent clinical and preclinical findings on ketamine and psilocybin, emphasizing their molecular targets, circuit-level effects, and converging downstream pathways. A key shared mechanism involves BDNF-TrkB signaling, which promotes spinogenesis and synaptogenesis critical for sustained antidepressant efficacy. We also discuss 5-HT₂A receptor biased agonism as a potential strategy to dissociate psilocybin's therapeutic effects from its hallucinogenic actions. By comparing their mechanistic profiles, we identify both overlapping and distinct features that may inform the development of next-generation rapid-acting antidepressants. Understanding how serotonergic, glutamatergic, and neurotrophic systems converge may guide the development of fast-acting, durable, and non-hallucinogenic antidepressants.

### Preliminary evidence of sleep improvements following psilocybin administration, and their involvement in antidepressant therapeutic action [^113FQFHu]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of The Study

Psilocybin is a rapidly-emerging treatment for depression, yet its impact on sleep is not well understood. We sought to explore the literature on sleep and psilocybin use, and explore the topic using our own primary data.

Findings

Whilst clinical trials demonstrate large depressive symptom improvements, the impact of psilocybin on sleep quality or insomnia symptoms, has not been directly studied. Using our own preliminary-data we demonstrated that both depressive-symptoms and sleep-disturbances decreased significantly following psilocybin use, though sleep improvements were smaller compared to depressive symptoms. More severe sleep-disturbances at baseline were linked to lower probability of depression remission, underscoring a potential interaction between sleep and psilocybin's efficacy. Addressing sleep disturbances could enhance therapeutic outcomes in psilocybin-assisted therapy and could lead to more effective, personalized treatment-strategies. Future research should focus on populations with sleep disorders, and on examining causal-pathways of sleep physiology's impact on psilocybin efficacy.

Risk of bias

The Cochrane RoB 2 tools were used to evaluate the included studies (table 3). RoB 2 for randomised trials was used for the five reports of parallel randomised trials (Carhart-Harris et aland its secondary analysis Barba et al, Goodwin et aland its secondary analysis Goodwin et al, and von Rotz et al) and RoB 2 for crossover trials was used for the four reports of crossover randomised trials (Griffiths et al, Grob et al, and Ross et aland its follow-up Ross et al). Supplementary Appendix G provides a detailed explanation of the assessment of the included studies.

Table 3
Summary risk of bias assessment of included studies, based on domains in Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool

Domain 1 assessed bias arising from the randomisation process, including blinding and randomisation of the allocation sequence, and baseline differences between groups. Domain S assessed the period and carryover effects specific to the crossover trials. Domain 2 assessed bias due to deviations from the intended intervention, including participant and researcher blinding, and the effects of differential adherence between groups. Domain 3 assessed bias due to missing outcome data. Domain 4 assessed bias in measurement of the outcome, including the appropriateness of metrics and questionnaires used and between group differences in outcome assessment. Domain 5 assessed reporting bias arising from the selective reporting of results or data analyses, or both. The "other" criterion assessed bias due to potential conflicts of interest, such as industry funding and associations with pharmaceutical companies.

Quality of included studies

Confidence in the quality of the evidence for the meta-analysis was assessed using GRADE, through the GRADEpro GDT software program. Figure 2 shows the results of this assessment, along with our summary of findings.

Call to action

We recommend (Fig. 2):
1 Further support for collaboration between research centres with the clinical research and data analytic expertise required to facilitate a feedforward loop of refinement of clinical protocol optimisation.
2 Further studies of dose-response relationships and alternative treatment protocols (e.g. group administration, short-acting doses, micro-dosing, dismantling of psychotherapeutic components).
3 Further development of standardised monitoring systems to track the incidence and prevalence of adverse events related to psilocybin use in a clinical context.
4 Investment in carefully collected phenotypic data in patients undergoing psychedelic therapy, both to identify predictors of therapeutic response and predictors of adverse outcomes, including outcomes such as transition to mania, psychosis, or HPPD, as these outcomes appear rare and elusive in current clinical trials data.
5 Further economic modelling, cost-benefit analyses, and studies of clinical implementation.
6 Consultation with payers, regulators, clinician, and other key implementation stakeholders to define barriers and roadmaps towards reimbursement benchmarks.

Although protocols have differed, most of the efficacy-determining studies to date have administered psilocybin alongside some degree of psychotherapeutic support. Typically, psychotherapeutic support is given before and after psilocybin administration (historically referred to as "psychedelic therapy"). This contrasts with the prevailing model used with MDMA, where psychotherapeutic support is given during administration (historically referred to as "psycholytic therapy"). Different terminology has been used in the literature to reflect these different interventions. We will broadly refer to psilocybin therapy as it has been delivered in the field to date, encompassing the diversity of dosing and psychotherapeutic protocols implemented in psilocybin research.

To date, a growing body of evidence has shown great promise for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and tobacco use disorder. Results from several Phase-II studies of psilocybin for depression have been replicated with positive and sustained results, which have led to ongoing Phase-III registration trials investigating its use for MDDand treatment-resistant depression. Many other investigations are also currently underway, including Phase-I or Phase-II trials evaluating psilocybin for the treatment of a range of other psychiatric, neurological, inflammatory, and other illnesses. While psilocybin remains a Schedule I substance and is approved by the FDA for investigational use, there are ongoing efforts at the state level to promote access and decriminalisation. For example, in 2020, Oregon became the first state to legalise "psilocybin services" at licenced centres, and in 2022 Colorado passed the Natural Medicine Health Act decriminalising psilocybin use along with several other psychedelic substances that exist in organic forms. In 2025, the New Mexico Medical Psilocybin Act established a regulated medical psilocybin program for licenced healthcare professionals to administer natural psilocybin for qualifying conditions in supervised settings. In addition, multiple countries, including Australiaand Canada, have already granted early compassionate access to psilocybin, allowing it to be used clinically in limited cases, and such compassionate use has been ongoing in Switzerland for many years. Even so, the clinical application of psychedelics in the US, Canada, and Australia has been incredibly limited and represents only a very limited scope of practice as explicit therapy. Further, such use has not been accompanied by open and rigorous tracking of patient outcomes, limiting the utility of these examples for informing cautions and considerations for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care.

Introduction

In recent years, psychedelic medicines have surged to the forefront of public attention as a potential new class of much-needed psychiatric therapeutic agents. Research into the applications of psilocybin has been largely encouraging, further promoting broad hope for psilocybin's potential to provide relief for individuals suffering from some of our most difficult-to-treat conditions. With positive findings from the completion of multi-national Phase-II clinical trials with psilocybin for the treatment of depression, and with Phase-III registration trials underway, many are anticipating a future "post-regulatory era". As members of the National Network of Depression Centers (NNDC), we share in this hope and recognise potential opportunities for breakthrough progress in the treatment of several psychiatric disorders if investment and public commitment to the development of psychedelic medicine continues. However, given the early stage of this field, many obstacles must first be addressed before we can arrive at this position. In this consensus statement, we discuss critical considerations as we move towards a future when psilocybin may be implemented into routine psychiatric care. In doing so, we outline areas of critical need for further investment and research, and we highlight several ethical considerations for the delivery of psychedelic therapy. Although other molecules such as DMT and LSD have been studied for depression and other indications, the bulk of contemporary evidence to date has arisen from the study of psilocybin, and as a result it is the only drug with reasonable prospects of clinical implementation for mood disorders in the near-term. For these reasons, we elect to limit the focus of this piece to psilocybin.

Search strategy and selection criteria

We conducted a Review of publicly available databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases, for relevant publications published between database inception and April 2025. The search was limited to articles published in English. The search terms used in PubMed and Cochrane Library included "psilocybin", "psychedelics", "major depressive disorder", and "psychedelic assisted therapy". We included various types of publications such as research studies, review articles, editorials, and clinical trials published until April 2025. We examined the secondary references of relevant papers to identify additional articles not captured by the electronic search. Articles were also identified through searches of the authors' own files. The final reference list was generated on the basis of originality and relevance to the broad scope of this Review.

### Efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted treatment for major depressive disorder: prospective 12-month follow-up [^116BeHKR]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study suggests that two doses of psilocybin provided in the context of supportive therapy for MDD produced large and stable antidepressant effects throughout a 12-month follow-up period. More specifically, depression, as measured by blinded clinician-rated assessments (GRID-HAMD), decreased substantially after treatment and remained low at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. The effect size at 12 months was very large (Cohen d = 2.4). Likewise, high and stable rates of response and remission occurred throughout the follow-up period (75% response and 58% remission at 12 months). Two patient-rated measures of depression (QIDS and BDI-II) showed similar large magnitude and stable antidepressant effects on mean scores and on response and remission rates. These findings suggesting enduring antidepressant effects of psilocybin 1 year after treatment significantly extend the previous results in this and two other trials that showed antidepressant effects through 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months. Notably, the remission rate and magnitude of the effect in the current study at both 6 and 12 months were substantially greater than those in a previous study at 6 months (QIDS, remission rate 67% and 67% vs 32%, Cohen d 2.2 and 2.3 vs 1.6, respectively). Whether this difference reflects population differences in severity of illness or procedural differences is unknown. Future research is needed to explore the possibility that efficacy of psilocybin treatment in MDD may be substantially longer than the 12 months observed in the present study, as has been suggested in a study that documented decreases in depressive symptoms up to 4.5 years following psilocybin treatment in patients with cancer-related distress.

### Effect of psilocybin versus escitalopram on depression symptom severity in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder: observational 6-month follow-up of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^1141JhH6]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

However, these results should be qualified by suboptimal visibility into treatment seeking behaviour within the follow-up period. Although there was no observed disparity in treatment uptake in the follow-up period between groups, 63% of patients in the PT arm still reported some form of additional treatment during the six months of follow-up, aligning with previous studies. Moreover, treatment uptake was not granularly measured beyond the presence or absence of psychedelic use, medication, and psychotherapy. As such, we cannot rule out the involvement of these adjunct treatments in having a causal role in the observed between-condition differences. Nevertheless, establishing the absence of disparity between groups on the measured treatment behaviour is a meaningful prerequisite for countenancing the present results and forming preliminary interpretation and hypotheses.

Notwithstanding this serious limitation, few modern studies have investigated the long-term effects of PT administered in a clinical trial of depression. Previously, Gukasyan and colleaguesfound sustained antidepressant effects up to 12 months following PT and Carhart-Harris and colleaguesdemonstrated sustained antidepressant effects up to 6 months in a treatment-resistant cohort. To the degree that the pattern of results observed here are causally related to the experimental treatment conditions and replicate in future work, a number of causal explanations are conceivable. The antidepressant effects of PT may arise from a combination of neurobiological, psychological, and social factors. By promoting neuroplasticity, engendering transformative experiences, and administering psychotherapy, psilocybin might offer unique opportunities for (re)learning mechanisms that can generate a healthy recalibration of an individual's psychological state. Accordingly, the active influence of psychotherapy on the therapeutic effect of psilocybin is important to consider in the present trial. Psychological support is regarded by the authors as an ethical standard, though the amount and type of support/psychotherapy provided remains variable and subject to considerations of population and disorder type. Furthermore, as in the case of combined antidepressant psycho- and pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy may produce greater sustained efficacy and lower relapse.

### Effect of psilocybin versus escitalopram on depression symptom severity in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder: observational 6-month follow-up of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^113V69Bz]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In the second set of analyses, for models showing significant main effects of time, pairwise comparisons were conducted without correction for missing data to examine between-condition differences between specific pairs of timepoints. We further performed single arm analyses for both PT and ET conditions to explore changes in outcomes from baseline within the two arms separately. For pairwise comparisons, effect sizes are presented using Cohen's d and normative benchmarks of small (0.2), medium (0.5) and large (0.8) effects.

A third set of analyses employed a conservative single imputation for missing data to more stringently test for the potential superiority of PT in the face of potential attrition bias. Missing data at one or more follow-up timepoints was thus imputed using the worst follow-up score for participants in the PT condition and the best follow-up score for patients in the ET condition across timepoints. This additional set of analyses was motivated by concerns that the somewhat greater levels of missing data in the ET condition may reflect asymmetrical patient factors, like greater positive regard for PTversus ET.

In the fourth set of analyses, we examined between-condition differences in therapeutic changes on each outcome while controlling for treatment seeking behaviour in the follow-up period. Specifically, 2e conducted linear mixed models (utilizing the same conservative imputation method as the third set of analyses) that included three covariates controlling for the impact of (1) psychiatric medications, (2) non-pharmacological therapy, and (3) psychedelic drug use during follow-up. The models took the form of:

Supplementary analyses

While the main focus of the present study was on the between-condition differences in outcomes over the 6-month follow-up period, we also present within-condition changes in outcomes in Supplementary Materials. We also included sensitivity analyses while excluding missing data at either 3- or 6-month FU and participants who used psilocybin in the follow-up period as well as analyses using both the conservative imputation method and additional controlling by including missingness as a covariate in the models. These analyses are considered supplementary and exploratory and therefore were not corrected for multiple comparisons.

### Effect of psilocybin versus escitalopram on depression symptom severity in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder: observational 6-month follow-up of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^113QQNYN]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Finally, this study did not incorporate a systematic assessment of side effects during the follow-up period. This constitutes a limitation of our research and we suggest that future studies consider including longitudinal side effect profiles to enhance the evaluation of therapeutic interventions' safety over time. We also note that response rates in the PT arm at the 6-month follow-up in the current study (43%) were lower than those reported previously in — which were 79% at 6 months for MDD. This difference could suggest that the longevity of the effects of PT may vary among individuals or may depend on other factors, such as the open-label study design in, the severity of the depression at baseline or the type of therapeutic support used.

More limitations inherent to the main trial can be found in.

Overall, while PT and ET interventions were both associated with improvements in depressive symptom severity at 6-month follow-up, we observed greater benefits for psychological connectedness, general functioning, and existential meaning among PT patients. In view of missing data and limitations on visibility into treatment-seeking behaviour within the follow-up period, these results are considered preliminary but useful for informing hypotheses in future replicative research.

### Single-dose psilocybin-assisted therapy in major depressive disorder: a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trial [^111nuwxw]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Choice of primary measure

Two independent scales were administered at every study visit to assess MDD symptom severity and response rates: MADRS and BDI. The primary endpoints were defined as changes from visit 2 (−5d) to visit 7 (+14d) on these scales. The MADRS, a clinician-rated instrument, is one of the most commonly used symptom severity scales to evaluate the efficacy of antidepressant treatment. A clinically relevant response is defined as either a 50% reduction in the MADRS sum score or a decrease below a prospectively determined threshold of < 10 points or both. The BDI is one of the most commonly used self-report questionnaires. The cut-off for remission is < 10 points and the criteria for clinically relevant responses are calculated analogously to the MADRS.

Clinical implications

As novel antidepressants, classic psychedelics are commonly compared to ketamine and its analogues. Despite distinct mechanisms of pharmacologic action, both have rapid antidepressant effects and both have garnered concern about their potential for non-medical use. Ketamine has nontrivial abuse potential and there may be overlap between mechanisms underlying its antidepressant effects and abuse potential, which may be exacerbated by the requirement for repeated administration to maintain therapeutic efficacy. Although evidence to date suggests that psilocybin has relatively low abuse potential, there remains concern for its potential to cause harm or encourage substance misuse in vulnerable populations. The present study highlights a key potential advantage of psilocybin treatment over ketamine in that antidepressant effects after just two administrations of psilocybin paired with psychological support appear to be sustained through 12 months, which is well beyond the duration of effects reported with ketamine. It will be important for future research to determine the risks and benefits of additional psilocybin administration for those who failed to respond or experienced early relapse.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^115KJPBC]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Psilocybin clinical outcomes across cancer-related distress, treatment-resistant depression, and major depressive disorder (MDD) are quantified with response, remission, and dosing details. In cancer cohorts, 51 participants had improvement with depressive symptoms (HAM-D: 89% response, 71% remission) and anxiety symptoms (HAM-A: 80% response, 50% remission) at 6 month follow up, and a second study of 24 participants showed anxiolytic 78% response and antidepressant 58% response relative to control 14% at 7 weeks with effects sustained at 6.5 months and 4.5 years. In treatment-resistant depression, an open label pilot in 12 individuals reported 67% response at one week and 42% remission at 3 month follow up, and a wait-list controlled trial found 71% response and 54% remission of 24 patients four weeks after two doses (20 mg/70 kg followed by 30 mg/70 kg). In a multi-site randomized trial (n = 233), the high-dose 25 mg arm had 79 patients with 23 remissions and a higher remission rate than the 1 mg control (29% vs. 14%) over three weeks, while the 10 mg group showed no significant difference versus 1 mg. For MDD, an RCT of 104 participants reported 42% response versus 11% with placebo and 25% remission versus 9% with placebo. Across studies, non-response ranged 11–58% (mean 35%) and non-remission 29–85% (mean 59%), and an earlier therapeutic study in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) reported an acute reduction of symptom severity in 9 patients.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^117T3HP9]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Clinical and practical considerations — safety highlight that while most early psilocybin studies have brought relative reassurance in terms of safety profile, recent expansion of data demonstrates a need for studies designed to include more diverse populations and leaves many unanswered questions about drug-drug interactions, optimal environment and expectancy, dosing comparisons, the role of adjunct psychotherapy, longitudinal and sustained benefits, possible harms not observed in shorter trials, and use in patients with major medical comorbidities. Long acknowledged risks include distressing or psychologically challenging experiences, heightened anxiety, or emergence of psychotic symptoms during the psychedelic experience, and as clinical studies have grown in size and complexity a possible signal for increased suicidal thinking and behaviour has emerged. For example, a recent phase-II trial of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression reported serious adverse events in 9% of the 25 mg group.

Dose optimization for psilocybin — although a canonical dose of 25 mg has driven therapeutic response in recent trials, it is unclear whether this is optimal, different indications may require different doses, and evidence may suggest a higher dose up to 40 mg of psilocybin may be necessary in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD); questions also remain about best practices for integrating psychotherapy within treatment.

Dichotomous data

We extracted response and remission rates for each group when reported directly, or imputed information when presented graphically. Two studies did not measure response or remission and thus did not contribute data for this part of the analysis. The random effects model with a Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman modification was used to allow for heterogeneity to be incorporated into the weighting of the included studies' results, and to provide a better estimation of between study variance accounting for small sample sizes.

Response rate — Overall, the likelihood of psilocybin intervention leading to treatment response was about two times greater (risk ratio 2.17, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.99) than with placebo. There was moderate statistical heterogeneity between studies (I² = 53.1%, P = 0.06). PIs were, however, wide and crossed the line of no difference (0.57 to 2.65), indicating that there could be settings or populations in which psilocybin intervention would be less efficacious.

### The impact of antidepressant discontinuation prior to treatment with psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression [^113id72o]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

It has been suggested that the recent use and discontinuation of antidepressant drugs compromises the action of psilocybin. As evidence is only available from small or uncontrolled samples, this post hoc analysis investigated this using data from the largest, phase II, randomized controlled trial of psilocybin treatment to date. Data from 233 participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) who received 25 mg, 10 mg, or 1 mg of investigational drug COMP360 psilocybin (a proprietary, pharmaceutical-grade synthetic psilocybin formulation, developed by the sponsor, Compass Pathfinder Ltd.), administered with psychological support, were compared for groups of participants who either discontinued one or more antidepressant drugs during screening or entered the trial antidepressant drug free. Measures of depression symptom severity change during the antidepressant drug discontinuation period, baseline suicidality, acute subjective psychedelic effects, and the study's primary endpoint (change in depression symptom severity between Baseline and Week 3) are described for both groups. Antidepressant drug discontinuation was not related to worsening of depression severity before Baseline. Suicidality was comparable between groups at Baseline. Psilocybin treatment efficacy and the subjective psychedelic experience did not appear to be compromised by antidepressant drug discontinuation. Thus, it does not limit the feasibility of psilocybin treatment for the future. These findings also support the overall homogeneity of our findings with psilocybin treatment as a monotherapy for TRD. The prior contradictory reports may come to appear misleading.

### Efficacy of psilocybin for treating symptoms of depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116p2Zsh]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Implications for future research

More large scale randomised trials with long follow-up are needed to fully understand psilocybin's treatment potential, and future studies should aim to recruit a more diverse population. Another factor that would make clinical trials more representative of routine practice would be to recruit patients who are currently using or have used commonly prescribed serotonergic antidepressants. Clinical trials tend to exclude such participants because many antidepressants that act on the serotonin system modulate the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2A receptor that psilocybin primarily acts upon, with prolonged use of tricyclic antidepressants associated with more intense psychedelic experiences and use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors or SSRIs inducing weaker responses to psychedelics. Investigating psilocybin in such patients would, however, provide valuable insight on how psilocybin interacts with commonly prescribed drugs for depression and would help inform clinical practice.

Minimising the influence of expectancy effects is another core problem for future studies. One strategy would be to include expectancy measures and explore the level of expectancy as a covariate in statistical analysis. Researchers should also test the effectiveness of condition masking. Another proposed solution would be to adopt a 2×2 balanced placebo design, where both the drug (psilocybin or placebo) and the instructions given to participants (told they have received psilocybin or told they have received placebo) are crossed. Alternatively, clinical trials could adopt a three arm design that includes both an inactive placebo (eg, saline) and active placebo (eg, niacin, lower psylocibin dose), allowing for the effects of psilocybin to be separated from those of the placebo.

Overall, future studies should explore psilocybin's exact mechanism of treatment effectiveness and outline how its physiological effects, mystical experiences, dosage, treatment setting, psychological support, and relationship with the therapist all interact to produce a synergistic antidepressant effect. Although this may be difficult to achieve using an explanatory randomised trial design, pragmatic clinical trial designs may be better suited to psilocybin research, as their primary objective is to achieve high external validity and generalisability. Such studies may include multiple alternative treatments rather than simply an active and placebo treatment comparison (eg, psilocybin v SSRI v serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor), and participants would be recruited from broader clinical populations. Although such studies are usually conducted after a drug's launch, earlier use of such designs could help assess the clinical effectiveness of psilocybin more robustly and broaden patient access to a novel type of antidepressant treatment.

### Catalyst for change: psilocybin's antidepressant mechanisms – A systematic review [^111pP5Vv]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol

This review was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocol (PRISMA;) and the guidelines outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were structured based on the PICOS framework (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, Study Characteristics). The research protocol has been pre-registered under.

Inclusion criteria

The review included studies that met the specified inclusion criteria:

Population

Human populations with diagnosed depression or healthy subjects in studies directly related to depression. Samples with depressive conditions included various diagnoses, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and TRD.

Intervention

Studies involving psilocybin therapy, with a minimum dose of 10 mg in the test group, administered in a controlled and guided study context. Microdosing was excluded, as current evidence indicates that significant antidepressant effects are primarily observed at moderate to higher doses in clinical trials (e.g.).

Comparator

Studies with randomized placebo or active control groups. Alternatively, pre–post comparisons, if higher standard designs are not available on the same issue, for example, follow-up studies.

Outcome

Studies focusing on antidepressant neurological or psychological mechanisms of psilocybin and associations with common factors of psychotherapy.

Study characteristics

Clinical trials of all types (quantitative and qualitative) were published from 2015 onwards in English or German language. This review included studies from 2015 onwards to focus on modern psilocybin trials with controlled protocols, depressive samples, and recent advancements in neuroimaging and brain functioning research.

### Effect of psilocybin versus escitalopram on depression symptom severity in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder: observational 6-month follow-up of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^11697Jnv]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

This is a 6-month follow up study of a double-blind randomised control trial (RCT) comparing psilocybin (Compass Pathways' investigational, proprietary, synthetic, psilocybin formulation COMP360) to the SSRI escitalopram in 59 participants with MDD. All the patients provided written informed consent and after discontinuing any pre-trial antidepressants, enrollees received two oral doses of psilocybin (1 mg or 25 mg) with accompaniment from two experienced therapists for ∼6–8 h, separated by 3 weeks, as well as daily pills (escitalopram 10–20 mg or placebo capsules). Thirty patients were randomised to PT and 29 to ET. Participants were required to be 18–85 years, physically healthy, be diagnosed with unipolar MDD by a physician, and be willing to stop any antidepressants and/or psychological therapies before the trial's baseline timepoint. Detailed eligibility requirements can be found in Carhart-Harris et al.

During the treatment period, each participant worked with study therapists and psychiatrists employing the ACE (Accept, Connect and Embody) model as a therapeutic framework. The model is based on six psychological flexibility processes (Experiential Acceptance, Present Moment Focus, Cognitive Defusion, Self as Context, Values, Committed Action) that are the core of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. On dosing days, the therapists accompanied them from the moment they ingested the drug until the day's end. Before and after dosing days, participants underwent psychological preparation and integration, respectively. Taking into account screening, preparation, dosing, and integration, participants in each condition received approximately 20 h of in-person therapeutic support during the trial, as well as up to six further integration calls over Skype or by telephone. There was no difference between conditions in the adoption of these optional calls.

Our recommendations: clinical and public health implications

These recommendations carry the potential for broad clinical and public health implications, through guiding policy development, supporting equitable access, and helping prevent premature or unsafe implementation as interest in psychedelic therapies grows. Clinicians and the public should approach psychedelics with optimism but caution, as psychedelics are neither widely approved nor clearly understood within a health system context. Messaging regarding the status and promise of psychedelic medicine should be tempered by these facts. In addition, more preparation and education of lawmakers, policymakers, care providers, and the public is needed regarding the potential risks that are known (e.g. in those with potential cardiovascular vulnerabilities), suspected (e.g. unmasking mania and precipitating psychosis in those with specific psychiatric vulnerabilities), and as of yet unknown (e.g. 1/1000 or 1/10,000 risks that have yet to be encountered in clinical trials). Careful monitoring of psychedelic use and outcomes in both clinical and unsanctioned settings will aid in tracking and responding to these risks as access to psychedelics increases. Care must be taken to ensure that patients are adequately protected in periods of immense psychological vulnerability that can be encountered with psychedelic therapy. Given all of the known and unknown risks as well as our scope of knowledge regarding efficacy, psychedelics might best be considered as second- or third-line therapies until we gain more clarity about the use of psychedelics in the clinic. An adequate evidence base must be developed to guide the appropriate level of training and expertise that is necessary to ensure the safety of patients undergoing psychedelic therapy. Finally, the limits of efficacy of psychedelic therapy must be more carefully charted and communicated. These efforts will require a substantial commitment to monitoring, rigorous implementation science, and continuing education to best ensure a safe roll-out of psychedelics, if they are approved as therapies.

### Efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted treatment for major depressive disorder: prospective 12-month follow-up [^116nGV5G]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

As previously reported, at 1 week after treatment, 17 of the 24 participants (71%) showed a clinical response rate on the GRID-HAMD (⩾50% reduction from pretreatment) and 14 (58%) were in remission (GRID-HAMD score ≤ 7). As shown in Table 1, the response and remission rates were generally sustained through the 12-month follow-up assessment, with final response and remission rates of 75% and 58%, respectively. Table 1 shows similar or greater response and remission rates with the two patient-rated measures of depression (QIDS and BDI-II).

Table 1.
Percentage of total sample (N = 24) meeting criteria for treatment response (reduction in depression ⩾ 50% from pretreatment baseline) or remission.

Figure 2 shows GRID-HAMD depression scores for each of the 24 study participants from pretreatment through the 12-month follow-up assessment. Most participants showed large decreases in their depression score at the first follow-up interval at 1-week post-treatment, consistent with the 71% response rate and 58% remission rate shown in Table 1. The figure shows that psilocybin did not exacerbate depression in any participant and that 3 of 24 participants (13%) did not meet criteria for a treatment response at any post-treatment timepoint.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^111mtDvr]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Psilocybin evidence and limitations — depression and other indications are summarized as follows: Psilocybin did not significantly outperform escitalopram when assessed using the primary outcome for depression (QIDS), whereas secondary outcome assessments mostly favoured psilocybin over escitalopram, underscoring the importance of psychometrics and symptom characterisation. Beyond major depressive disorder (MDD), psilocybin has shown safety and potential utility in alcohol use disorder (AUD), tobacco use disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), migraine headaches, cluster headaches, bipolar depression, and anorexia nervosa; many studies are ongoing including investigations in comorbid MDD and AUD and work on dosing or psychotherapy protocols and co-administration with a serotonin 5HT₂A receptor antagonist such as risperidone. Overall, evidence for therapeutic benefits suggests promise but key limitations include highly protocolised trials that may not generalise to non-research clinical settings, lack of diversity in which more than 80% of participants in psychedelic trials have been white individuals, and understudied mechanisms wherein pharmacology and psychotherapy are closely intertwined and not yet separable, with psychotherapeutic approaches plausibly contributing to observed efficacy.

Call to action — We recommend (Fig. 2): further support for collaboration between research centres with the clinical research and data analytic expertise required to facilitate a feedback loop of refinement of clinical protocol optimisation; further studies of dose-response relationships and alternative treatment protocols (e.g., group administration, short-acting doses, micro-dosing, dismantling of psychotherapeutic components); further development of standardised monitoring systems to track the incidence and prevalence of adverse events related to psilocybin use in a clinical context; investment in carefully collected phenotypic data in patients undergoing psychedelic therapy to identify predictors of therapeutic response and adverse outcomes, including transition to mania, psychosis, or HPPD; further economic modelling, cost-benefit analyses, and studies of clinical implementation; and consultation with payers, regulators, clinician, and other key implementation stakeholders to define barriers and roadmaps towards reimbursement benchmarks.

Research-to-practice considerations for psilocybin — patients in trials are rigorously screened for exclusionary criteria or contraindications (e.g., bipolar disorder, psychosis, substance use disorder), whereas in routine care patient histories can be partial or unclear and risk stratification more nuanced; highly trained mental health care specialists are required to be present before, during, and after treatment sessions, creating staffing and reimbursement challenges.

Psilocybin

Meanwhile, 2016 brought a pair of double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trials with a total of 80 patients that looked at psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy's effects on anxiety and depression in patients with life-threatening cancer. These studies found strong reductions in both depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as improvements in quality of life and spiritual well-being, from psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. That same year, another pilot trial found success with psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Moreover, the studies helped establish the safety of psilocybin, which was well-tolerated and did not cause any serious negative physiological or psychological consequences. Other research has supported psilocybin's capacity to treat tobacco use disorder, alcohol use disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder.

In one of the largest clinical trials so far on psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for major depressive disorder (n = 27), 71% of participants had a clinically significant response to psilocybin 4 weeks after a single dose, while 54% of participants achieved remission from depression over the same time, corresponding with large effect sizes (d = 2.3). Of note, this was a crossover trial, which can inflate response rates. Another recent trial found that psilocybin was non-inferior to the commonly prescribed anti-depressant escitalopram, with 30 patients receiving psilocybin and 29 patients receiving escitalopram. Across these trials, positive benefits often endured for months after just a single psilocybin dose. Many patients have commented that the psilocybin session was among most meaningful experiences of their life. Table 1 provides some details of the clinical trials described above. While some variation exists between psychedelic protocols, the therapeutic process tends to follow a general timeline and structure, which is detailed in Fig. 1.

### Single-dose synthetic psilocybin with psychotherapy for treatment-resistant bipolar type II major depressive episodes: a nonrandomized open-label trial [^113TBa28]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Bipolar II disorder (BDII) is a debilitating condition frequently associated with difficult-to-treat depressive episodes. Psilocybin has evidence for rapid-acting antidepressant effects but has not been investigated in bipolar depression.

Objective

To establish the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with BDII in a current depressive episode.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a 12-week, open-label nonrandomized open-label trial conducted at Sheppard Pratt Hospital. Participants aged 18 to 65 years with BDII, a current depressive episode longer than 3 months, and documented insufficient benefit with at least 2 pharmacologic treatments during the current episode were invited to participate. Of 70 approached, 19 met inclusion criteria and were enrolled. The trial was conducted between April 14, 2021, and January 5, 2023.

Interventions

A single dose of synthetic psilocybin, 25 mg, was administered. Psychotropic medications were discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to dosing. Therapists met with patients for 3 sessions during pretreatment, during the 8-hour dosing day, and for 3 integration sessions posttreatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measure was change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) at 3 weeks posttreatment. Secondary measures included MADRS scores 12 weeks posttreatment, the self-rated Quick Inventory of Depression Symptoms-Self Rating (QIDS-SR), and the self-rated Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), each completed at baseline and all subsequent visits. Safety measures included the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) completed at each visit.

Results

Of the 15 participants in this study (6 male and 9 female; mean [SD] age, 37.8 [11.6] years), all had lower scores at week 3, with a mean (SD) change of -24.00 (9.23) points on the MADRS, (Cohen d = 4.08; 95% CI, -29.11 to -18.89; P < .001). Repeat measures analysis of variance showed lower MADRS scores at all tested posttreatment time points, including the end point (Cohen d = 3.39; 95% CI, -33.19 to -16.95; adjusted P < .001). At week 3, 12 participants met the response criterion (50% decrease in MADRS), and 11 met remission criterion (MADRS score ≤ 10). At the study end point, 12 patients met both response and remission criteria. QIDS-SR scores and Q-LES-Q-SF scores demonstrated similar improvements. YMRS and CSSRS scores did not change significantly at posttreatment compared to baseline.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings in this open-label nonrandomized open-label trial suggest efficacy and safety of psilocybin with psychotherapy in BDII depression and supports further study of psychedelics in this population.

### The experimental effects of psilocybin on symptoms of anxiety and depression: a meta-analysis [^116SQmPf]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The current meta-analysis examined the effects of psilocybin in combination with behavioral interventions on anxiety and depression in samples with elevated symptoms. Across four studies (one uncontrolled; three randomized, placebo-controlled; N = 117), within-group pre-post and pre-follow-up effects on anxiety and depression were large (Hedges' gs = 1.16 to 1.47) and statistically significant. Across three placebo-controlled studies, pre-post placebo-controlled effects were also large (gs = 0.82 to 0.83) and statistically significant. No serious adverse events were reported. Limitations include the small number of studies and risk for bias within studies. Results tentatively support future research on psilocybin for the treatment of anxiety and depression.

### Single-dose psilocybin for depression with severe treatment resistance: an open-label trial [^114FDJC4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Depression varies along a difficulty-to-treat spectrum. Patients whose illness fails to respond to at least five treatments may be considered to have severely treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The objective of this study was to document the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with severe TRD.

Methods

This was a 12-week, open-label trial conducted at Sheppard Pratt Hospital. Participants were 18–65 years of age, in a major depressive episode with documented insufficient benefit from at least five treatments during the current episode. A single dose of synthetic psilocybin (25 mg) was administered. Psychotropic medications were discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to dosing through at least 3 weeks post-dosing. Therapists met with patients for three sessions during pretreatment, during the 8-hour dosing day, and for three integration sessions posttreatment. The primary outcome measure was change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) at 3 weeks posttreatment. Secondary measures including MADRS scores up to 12 weeks posttreatment, and subject-rated scales capturing depression and level of function were completed at baseline and all subsequent visits.

Results

Twelve participants (six male, six female; mean age = 40.6 years [SD = 9.6]) with severe TRD were followed over the study period. Depressive symptoms were significantly decreased at week 3 (MADRS least-squares mean change = -15.8, 95% CI = -25.4 to -6.3) and Week 12 (MADRS least-squares mean change = -17.2, 95% CI = -25.2 to -9.1). In exploratory analyses, the Oceanic Boundlessness (OB) dimension of the psychedelic experience correlated with post-dosing antidepressant responses. Patients with comorbid PTSD (N = 5) showed significantly less antidepressant effect of psilocybin.

Conclusions

This open-label study suggests efficacy and safety of psilocybin in severe TRD and supports further study of psychedelics in this population, including consideration of PTSD interaction effects.

### Control group outcomes in trials of psilocybin, SSRIs, or esketamine for depression: a meta-analysis [^111g4BFH]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Antidepressant efficacy is typically established by comparing a candidate antidepressant with some control treatment for 4 to 12 weeks. The response to control treatments in depression varies but is often substantial. Jones and coworkersreported the average pretreatment to posttreatment effect size across a range of control treatments for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) to be 1.05, and Cuijpers and colleaguesfound pretreatment to posttreatment effect sizes of 0.64 for care as usual and 0.37 for waiting list controls in a meta-analysis of psychotherapies for depression.

Psilocybin is a novel candidate antidepressant with a unique mechanism of action that has demonstrated substantial acute-phase efficacy in depression, with effect sizes often more than double those for conventional antidepressants. However, control treatment response rates have been noted to be lower than expected in some trials. Psilocybin in trials for depression has been given in psychedelic doses, which risks making functional unblinding both immediate and prevalent. Furthermore, since administration is usually supervised, unblinding may also extend to study personnel. If control treatment response rates are low across the board for psilocybin trials, it could indicate that efficacy is overestimated (eg, via functional unblinding and nocebo effects).

To assess whether low control treatment efficacy is a general phenomenon in trials of psilocybin for depression, we performed an indirect comparison of outcomes on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) for 3 trial populations: (1) psilocybin trials on major depressive disorder (MDD) and TRD, (2) esketamine trials on TRD, and (3) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) trials on MDD. Since the hypothesis was that control treatment outcomes may differ systematically depending on which active drug is trialed, there was no common treatment through which indirect evidence might be contrasted (ie, inert placebo might work differently in an SSRI trial than it does in a psilocybin trial). For this reason, the analyses were undertaken using conventional meta-analysis techniques rather than using network meta-analysis.

### Postpartum depression: a role for psychedelics? [^111DbBUV]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

The safety profile of psilocybin in the treatment of MDD is becoming established. Multi-centre phase 2 trials for psilocybin in MDD are currently in progress (NCT03775200, NCT03866174, NCT04670081, NCT03429075) and will likely give a more robust indication of efficacy. COMPASS Pathways recently announced results from a multi-centre phase IIb trial of psilocybin therapy in 233 participants with treatment-resistant depression. These results are not yet independently verified or peer-reviewed. A single dose of psilocybin 25 mg was reported to result in a rapid and enduring reduction in depressive symptom severity after 3 weeks, and nearly 25% of the patients had sustained response at 12 weeks. The majority of treatment-emergent adverse events occurred and resolved on the day of psilocybin administration. Suicidal ideation and behaviours were reported, all occurring in participants who were non-responders to psilocybin. Taking into account the timing and circumstances of adverse events including suicidal behaviours, psilocybin was reported to be generally well-tolerated in this trial. In comparison with brexanolone in PPD, psilocybin therapy appears to have similar rapid reduction in depression scores, with enduring response at 6 months. Phase 3 trials of psilocybin will give a better indication of psilocybin efficacy in treatment of depression.

### Psilocybin increases emotional empathy in patients with major depression [^115fLaEi]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Empathy plays a crucial role in interpersonal relationships and mental health. It is decreased in a variety of psychiatric disorders including major depression. Psilocybin, a promising candidate for treating depression, has been shown to acutely increase emotional empathy in healthy volunteers. However, no study has investigated this effect and its relevance for symptom improvement in a clinical population. This study examines the enduring effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy on empathy in depressed patients using a randomized, placebo-controlled design. Fifty-one depressed patients were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of psilocybin (0215mg/kg body weight) or a placebo embedded in a 4-week psychological support intervention. Empathy was measured using the Multifaceted Empathy Test at baseline and 2 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks after substance administration. Changes in empathy were compared between treatment conditions. Patients who received psilocybin showed significant improvements in explicit emotional empathy driven by an increase in empathy towards positive stimuli compared to the placebo group for at least two weeks. This study highlights the potential of psychedelics to enhance social cognition in individuals living with depression and contributes to a better understanding of the psychological mechanisms of action of psychedelics. Further studies are necessary to investigate the interaction between social cognition and clinical efficacy. The trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03715127) and KOFAM (Identifier: SNCTP000003139).

### Effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy on major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^1155Kvss]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Method

This randomized, waiting list–controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research in Baltimore, Maryland. The Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board approved this trial (the protocol is included in Supplement 1). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Study Design and Participants

This trial of psilocybin therapy included participants with moderate or severe MDD episodes, as assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5)and the GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD; a score of ≥ 17 was required for enrollment). Eligible candidates were aged 21 to 75 years who self-reported no current pharmacotherapy for depression at trial screening. To avoid the confounding effects and potential interactions of concurrent antidepressant use, candidates were required to refrain from using antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) for at least 5 half-lives before the screening and up to 4 months after enrollment (through the completion of the primary outcome assessment). However, the decision to taper off and/or continuing not to take their medications during the study was made by the individuals and their prescribing physicians and not by study personnel. Additional eligibility requirements included being medically stable with no uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions; having no personal or family history (first or second degree) of psychotic or bipolar disorders; and, for women, being nonpregnant, being non-nursing, and agreeing to use contraception. Individuals with a moderate or severe alcohol or other drug use disorder (including nicotine) in the past year, as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (DSM-5) criteria, were excluded, as were individuals with substantial lifetime use (> 10 total) or recent use (past 6 months) of ketamine or classic hallucinogens, such as psilocybin-containing mushrooms or lysergic acid diethylamide (eMethods in Supplement 2).

### Psilocybin increases emotional empathy in patients with major depression [^115HF5jY]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups trial involved 7 in-person visits over 4 weeks for each participant. The data were collected as part of a clinical trial testing the efficacy of psilocybin-assisted therapy for major depression. The pharmacological intervention consisted of a single oral administration of either psilocybin (0.215 mg/kg body weight) or placebo (mannitol). Participants received 2 psychological preparation sessions one day and four days before substance administration to prepare them for the treatment, ensure participant safety, set a therapeutic goal, and foster a trusting therapeutic relationship. Two, eight, and fourteen days after psilocybin administration, 3 integration sessions were conducted to help process difficult emotions, to develop a meaningful narrative of the experience and support for making adequate behavioural adjustments in daily life. All psychological support sessions were provided by the same study therapist and lasted around 60 min. For details regarding psychological support, see supplementary information and von Rotz et al. Participants in both intervention arms completed identical procedures during each visit. The trial was conducted in German, corresponding validated versions of questionnaires and interviews were used. Approval was granted by the Cantonal Ethics Committee Zurich, Switzerland, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Swissmedic), and the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). The study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03715127) and KOFAM (Identifier: SNCTP000003139) and was conducted in accordance with the Revised Declaration of Helsinki (2000) and the International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. Synthetic, pharmaceutical-grade psilocybin was obtained from Compass Pathways Ltd. United Kingdom. All participants and study staff, with the exception of the resident pharmacist, were blinded to the treatment assignments until the database was closed. Additional information on the study procedure is provided in the supplement.

### Psychedelic therapy for depressive symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Ah97P]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Psychedelic therapy shows promise for Major Depressive Disorder, especially when treatment-resistant, as well as life-threatening illness distress. The objective of this systematic review, inclusive of meta-analysis, is to examine recent clinical research on the therapeutic effects of classic psychedelics on depressive symptoms.

Methods

Fourteen psychedelic therapy studies, utilising psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, were systematically reviewed. For the meta-analysis, standardised mean differences were calculated for seven randomised controlled trials.

Results

The systematic review indicated significant short- and long-term reduction of depressive symptoms in all conditions studied after administration of psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, with psychological support. In the meta-analysis, symptom reduction was significantly indicated in three timepoints out of four, including 1-day, 1-week, and 3–5 weeks, supporting the results of the systematic review, with the exception of the 6–8 weeks follow-up point which was less conclusive.

Limitations

The absence of required data for 2 studies necessitated the less precise use of graphical extraction and imputation. The small sample size in all but one study negatively affected the statistical power. None of the studies had long-term follow-up without also utilising the cross-over method, which did not allow for long-term results to be included in the meta-review.

Conclusions

This review indicates an association between psychedelic therapy and significant reduction of depressive symptoms at several time points. However, the small number of studies, and low sample sizes, calls for careful interpretation of results. This suggests the need for more randomised clinical trials of psychedelic therapy, with larger and more diverse samples.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^114ysNgb]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our recommendations: caveats

While bringing together a diverse group of U.S.-based experts, the single-country focus of the NNDC may limit the generalisability of recommendations to international contexts with differing healthcare systems and regulatory landscapes. Additionally, while the group achieved consensus through a process of collaborative discussion and iterative drafting, it did not include a formal Delphi methodology. Such an approach may enhance and strengthen such recommendations in the case that a more broad and inclusive set of considerations and opinions are generated in future work. Further, the inclusion of patients with lived experience with psychedelic therapy may be useful in the future, but at this time the available lived experience is restricted to patients enrolled in clinical trials as well as individuals undergoing psychedelic therapy in unsanctioned settings. Both these factors relate in an unclear manner to the way in which psychedelics may be delivered in a clinical care setting after FDA approval, and thus might limit the generalisability of lived experience to future clinical settings. Future reviews and perspectives will be well-informed by experience in a post-approval world.

### Psilocybin-assisted supportive psychotherapy in the treatment of major depression-quo vadis? [^116x56KZ]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Reynolds CF. Psilocybin-Assisted Supportive Psychotherapy in the Treatment of Major Depression — Quo Vadis. JAMA Psychiatry. 2021; 78: 476–478. doi: 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.2901 In this issue of JAMA Psychiatry, Davis and colleagues1 at the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research have contributed a timely and important proof-of-concept randomized clinical trial on the effects of psilocybin-assisted supportive psychotherapy for the treatment of major depression. The authors reported rapid relief of depressive symptoms and high rates of response and remission that were sustained for more than 4 weeks in a sample of 24 midlife adults, many of whom had chronic depression.

The research, supported by crowd-sourced funding, was carried out rigorously, with attention to experimental bias through the use of both immediate and delayed treatment conditions, single-blind and self-reported outcome assessments across many domains, and urn randomization to yield comparable groups of participants in both immediate and delayed treatment conditions. In addition to assessing efficacy, the investigators carefully documented potentially adverse effects of psilocybin use. Because of this attention to efficacy and tolerability as well as high rates of retention, treatment completion, and follow-up, the data from this trial are clinically informative and have heuristic value for further research.

### A study of psilocybin for major depressive disorder (MDD… [^116EsnkH]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Overview One hundred participants, ages 21 to 65, who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for major depressive disorder will be stratified by study site and randomized with a 1-to-1 allocation under double-blind conditions to receive a single 25 mg oral dose of psilocybin or a single 100 mg oral dose of niacin. Niacin will serve as an active placebo. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential efficacy of a single 25 mg oral dose of psilocybin for MDD compared to the active placebo in otherwise medically-healthy participants, assessed as the difference between groups in changes in depressive symptoms from Baseline to Day 43 post-dose. Partial-but incomplete-response to antidepressants is associated with an increased risk of full symptomatic relapse and a worse long-term disease course.

Combined with the high prevalence and significant disability associated with MDD, the fact that currently available treatments are not fully adequate highlights the tremendous need to identify novel treatment strategies. Data suggest that psilocybin may have behavioral effects relevant to the treatment of depression and recent studies also suggest that psilocybin may possess antidepressant properties. To further assess the effects of psilocybin on MDD signs and symptoms, this trial will enroll 100 participants, ages 21 to 65, who meet criteria for MDD. Participants will be stratified by study site and randomized with a 1-to-1 allocation under double-blind conditions to receive a single 25 mg oral dose of psilocybin or a single 100 mg oral dose of niacin. Niacin will serve as an active placebo.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the potential efficacy of a single 25 mg oral dose of psilocybin for MDD compared to the active placebo, assessed as the difference between groups in changes in depressive symptoms from Baseline to Day 43 post-dose.
