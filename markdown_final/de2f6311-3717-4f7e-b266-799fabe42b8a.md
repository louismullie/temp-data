## Question

what does 20/13 vision mean

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what 20/13 vision means and how to interpret this measurement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the Snellen fraction notation and what each number represents. Then, I should verify the standard reference line (20/20) and what "normal" acuity implies. Next, I will calculate the angular subtense implied by 20/13 and translate that into a logMAR value. After that, I should compare 20/13 to common benchmarks like 20/20 and 20/15 to contextualize how exceptional it is. Finally, I will consider clinical implications, measurement variability, and any caveats about test methods and refraction status before summarizing the interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the Snellen notation basics. In "20/13", the numerator (20) is the testing distance in feet, and the denominator (13) is the distance at which a person with "normal" vision could read the same line, so 20/13 means the patient sees at 20 feet what a person with normal vision sees at 13 feet, indicating better-than-normal acuity. I should double-check that this interpretation aligns with standard descriptions of Snellen scoring, which it does.

> Wait, let me verify the reference standard. Normal visual acuity is classically defined as 20/20, which corresponds to the ability to resolve detail subtending about 1 minute of arc. Individuals with normal or corrected-to-normal vision typically achieve 0 logMAR (the 20/20 line), so anything numerically smaller than 20/20 in the denominator reflects better-than-normal acuity, which supports the idea that 20/13 is superior to 20/20.

> I will now examine the angular implication of 20/13. Hold on, I should verify the math: if 20/20 corresponds to 1 minute of arc, then 20/13 implies resolving detail that is roughly 13/20 of 1 minute of arc, which is about 0.65 minutes of arc. That means the patient can distinguish features roughly 35% smaller than what a person with 20/20 vision can resolve, which is a meaningful improvement in spatial resolution.

> Next, I should review the logMAR conversion to quantify this precisely. Let me think about the formula: logMAR = log10(denominator/numerator), so logMAR for 20/13 is log10(13/20) ≈ −0.19. This negative logMAR value confirms acuity better than 0 logMAR (20/20), and it sits between the commonly cited 20/15 (≈ −0.18 logMAR) and 20/10 (≈ −0.30 logMAR), placing 20/13 at the high end of "better-than-normal" vision, though not quite at the extraordinary 20/10 level.

> But wait, what if I'm overstating how rare this is? I should double-check population data. Most normal eyes achieve best-corrected acuity of 20/20 to 20/25, and while some individuals reach 20/15 or better, 20/13 is still uncommon in the general population; moreover, excellent measured acuity does not exclude ocular disease, so I need to ensure we don't equate a good Snellen result with perfect ocular health without a full exam [^117WP8WE].

> I need to ensure I account for measurement variability. Snellen acuity has notable test–retest variability, and even under controlled conditions, differences of about ± 0.1 to 0.2 logMAR are not unusual. Therefore, a measured 20/13 could reasonably fluctuate into the 20/15–20/20 range on repeat testing without a true physiologic change, so I should interpret a single high score cautiously and consider confirmatory testing or ETDRS-based methods when precision matters [^11619ugM] [^114543YM].

> Hold on, I should verify refraction status and testing context. Was this best-corrected acuity or uncorrected? Was the chart standardized and the distance verified? Preferred practice emphasizes measuring distance acuity at 20 feet or 6 meters with current correction and using consistent protocols; if 20/13 was achieved with glasses or contacts, that reflects the optical correction's capacity to optimize retinal image quality, whereas uncorrected 20/13 would imply exceptional emmetropia and ocular optics [^1179U6YK].

> Let me consider functional implications briefly. Vision better than 20/20 can confer advantages in tasks demanding fine spatial discrimination, such as certain professional or avocational activities, but I should confirm that such acuity still needs to be interpreted alongside other visual functions like contrast sensitivity and fields; importantly, even patients with excellent acuity can harbor serious eye disease, reinforcing the need for comprehensive eye examinations rather than relying on acuity alone [^117WP8WE] [^117WrTLd].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. 20/13 vision means the individual can see at 20 feet what a person with normal vision sees at 13 feet, corresponding to approximately −0.19 logMAR and representing acuity about 35% better than 20/20. This is uncommon in the general population, sits just beyond 20/15, and indicates exceptionally sharp distance vision, though small measurement variability and the need for proper refraction and context should temper overinterpretation of a single high Snellen score [^11619ugM] [^114A2Am5].

---

20/13 vision means you can see at 20 feet what a person with normal vision sees at 13 feet, indicating **better-than-normal acuity**. This level is uncommon in the general population and reflects **exceptional sharpness**, often seen in individuals with healthy eyes, optimal correction, or enhanced visual processing [^114A2Am5]. It exceeds the 20/20 standard and is well above legal thresholds for driving or most occupational vision requirements [^115oXf9Y] [^116Yt1mX]. While 20/13 is excellent, it does not guarantee absence of eye disease, so **regular eye exams remain important** [^117WP8WE] [^1165RxLn].

---

## Clinical significance of 20/13 vision

- **Better-than-normal acuity**: 20/13 vision is superior to the 20/20 standard, indicating sharper visual resolution and detail discrimination [^115ywbbZ].

- **Rarity**: This level of acuity is uncommon in the general population, reflecting exceptional visual function [^notfound].

- **Functional advantages**: Individuals with 20/13 vision may experience enhanced performance in tasks requiring fine detail, such as reading small print, driving, or certain sports [^113Cr6Y6].

---

## Factors contributing to 20/13 vision

Several factors can contribute to achieving **20/13 vision**:

- **Genetics**: Genetic predisposition plays a significant role in determining visual acuity potential [^111pvahH].

- **Eye health**: Healthy ocular structures, including the cornea, lens, and retina, are essential for optimal vision [^111cYX5G].

- **Refractive correction**: Accurate correction of refractive errors through glasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery can enhance visual acuity [^112feDZM].

- **Visual processing**: Efficient neural processing and eye movement coordination can improve perceived visual acuity [^1179U6YK].

## Comparison with standard vision measurements

| **Vision level** | **Snellen notation** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Normal vision | 20/20 | Standard visual acuity |
| Better-than-normal | 20/13 | Exceptional visual acuity |
| Legal blindness | 20/200 | Severe visual impairment |

---

20/13 vision is significantly better than the standard 20/20 and far exceeds the legal blindness threshold of 20/200 [^116Yt1mX].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Despite its exceptional nature, **20/13 vision** does not guarantee the absence of eye diseases or conditions. Regular **comprehensive eye examinations** are essential to monitor overall eye health and detect potential issues early [^1165RxLn]. Additionally, **visual acuity** alone does not encompass other critical aspects of vision, such as peripheral vision, color vision, and contrast sensitivity [^117WrTLd].

---

## Conclusion

20/13 vision represents **exceptional visual acuity**, surpassing the standard 20/20 measurement. It is uncommon and reflects optimal eye health, accurate refractive correction, and efficient visual processing. While it provides functional advantages, regular eye examinations remain essential to ensure overall eye health and detect potential issues early.

### Advising patients on visual fitness to drive: implications of revised DVLA regulations [^116hoDaB]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Summary and conclusions

From 2012, car drivers in the UK must be able to read a number-plate at 20 m and have a visual acuity of 6/12 or better. To assess drivers' vision, it is recommended that a logMAR progression letter chart (such as an ETDRS) or Snellen chart scored by full line is used. Drivers with 6/7.5 (+0.10 logMAR) or better can be advised that they meet the visual standard. Drivers with acuity between 6/9 and 6/12 (+0.12 to +0.30 logMAR) meet the visual acuity standard but should be encouraged to check their ability to read a number-plate, as some may not be able to. Clinicians will see patients who can read a number-plate but do not achieve 6/12, who will now need to improve their vision in order meet the visual requirements for driving.

### Advising patients on visual fitness to drive: implications of revised DVLA regulations [^116CQLra]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Some patients will appear to meet the visual standard in the test room, but will be unable to read a number-plate at the correct distance. These patients (false negatives in table 2; 2%–6% of the participants within the overlap zone on the Snellen and ETDRS style charts) will have acuity in the region of 6/12 to 6/9 Snellen or +0.30 to +0.12 logMAR. Care should therefore be taken when making recommendations to patients with vision that only just meets the standard, and they should be advised that they must also check their ability to read a number-plate at 20 m.

Patients to whom this may be particularly relevant include those with cataract, as an acuity of 6/12 or worse is being applied in some areas as a criterion for National Health Service funded cataract surgery. Some patients with vision slightly better than 6/12 may find themselves in a position that they are unable to automatically qualify for cataract surgery, but should not drive as they are unable to read a number-plate.

A larger group of patients (false positives in table 2; 14%–15% of the participants within the overlap zone on the Snellen and ETDRS style charts) will believe themselves to meet the visual standards for driving as they can read a number-plate at 20 m, and would have met the standard prior to 2012, but will fail to achieve the 6/12 standard in the examination room and thus do not meet the new standard. The clinician will need to inform the patients that they must either improve their acuity with refractive correction for driving or, if acuity cannot be improved with correction, that the patients do not meet the visual standards to drive and that it is their duty to inform the DVLA, following General Medical Council guidance.

We chose to examine participants with uncorrected refractive error, as inadequate refractive correction is a common reason for failing the number-plate test. This could be considered to be a limitation of the study, as results may not generalise to those with ophthalmic pathology limiting best corrected visual acuity, although a similar range of visions within which a number-plate pass can be achieved has been seen by othersin relation to previous visual standards for driving. This is the first study to investigate the impact of the new regulations on visual fitness to drive.

### Idiopathic macular hole preferred practice pattern ® [^113KsEGQ]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Idiopathic macular hole — prognosis of untreated full-thickness macular holes (FTMH) indicates only 5% of eyes will have visual acuity of 20/50 or better, approximately 55% will have visual acuity of 20/100 or better, and 40% will have visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Sixty percent of eyes with an FTMH will lose 2 or more lines of vision over 5 years of follow-up, and after a follow-up of 3 to 5 years, 70% to 80% of eyes will have 20/200 or worse visual acuity while the remaining 20% to 30% will usually be 20/70 to 20/100. In about 3% to 11% of cases an FTMH will close spontaneously, and the majority of eyes with untreated macular holes deteriorate to the 20/100 to 20/400 range and then stabilize with good peripheral vision.

### Global, regional, and national epidemiology of visual impairment in working-age individuals, 1990–2019 [^113D1MqW]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Visual impairment in working-age individuals can affect their general health and employment prospects, leading to decreased social and economic productivity and increased poverty rates. Nonetheless, investigations in this population appear to be limited.

Objective

To investigate the trends of visual impairment prevalence and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in working-age individuals from 1990 to 2019.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional, population-based study used data for individuals of working age (15–64 years) from 204 countries and territories obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study. The data analysis was performed between May 1 and 10, 2023.

Exposure

Visual impairment, defined as visual acuity of less than 6/18 (20/60) or near visual acuity of less than 6/12 (20/40) distance equivalent as determined by Snellen chart.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Trends of visual impairment prevalence, DALYs, and corresponding estimated annual percent changes (EAPCs) from 1990 to 2019 were stratified according to region, nation, and sociodemographic index (SDI).

Results

There were 437 539 484 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 325 463 851–575 573 588) prevalent cases of visual impairment globally (53.12% female and 46.88% male) in 2019, representing an increase of 91.46% from 1990 (prevalent cases, 228 530 964; 95% UI, 172 515 833–297 118 596). Over 3 decades, visual impairment-associated DALYs increased from 7 601 852 (95% UI, 5 047 030–11 107 897) to 12 563 276 (95% UI, 8 278 866–18 961 723). Among the 5 SDI groups, the low-SDI group had the largest increase in DALYs (898 167 [95% UI, 597 161–1 301 931] in 1990 to 1 634 122 [95% UI, 1 079 102–2 444 381] in 2019). Regionally, the greatest increase in prevalence was observed in Eastern Europe (EAPC, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02–0.19). Among all countries and territories, Nepal had the highest national prevalence of visual impairment per 100 000 population in 2019 (26 008.45; 95% UI, 19 987.35–32 482.09), while South Sudan had the highest DALY rate per 100 000 population (480.59; 95% UI, 316.06–697.06).

Conclusions and Relevance

Despite the mild decrease in visual impairment prevalence rates in less-developed countries, these findings suggest that the number of prevalent cases globally has increased substantially, with discernible unfavorable patterns in developed regions. The findings support the notion that visual impairment in working-age individuals is a growing global health challenge. A better understanding of its epidemiology may facilitate the development of appropriate measures for prevention and treatment from both medical and social perspectives.

### What is the global burden of visual impairment? [^117Cpfg5]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

A recent estimate by the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that 161 million persons worldwide have visual impairment, including 37 million blind (best-corrected visual acuity less than 3/60 in the better eye) and 124 million with visual impairment less severe than blindness (best-corrected acuity less than 6/18 to 3/60 in the better eye). This estimate is quoted widely, but because it is based on definitions using best-corrected visual acuity, uncorrected refractive error as a cause of visual impairment is excluded.

Methods

We reviewed data from population-based surveys of visual impairment worldwide published 1996 onwards that included presenting visual acuity, and estimated the proportion of visual impairment caused by uncorrected refractive error in different sub-regions of the world. We then extrapolated these data to estimate the worldwide burden of visual impairment including that caused by uncorrected refractive error.

Results

The total number of persons with visual impairment worldwide, including that due to uncorrected refractive error, was estimated as 259 million, 61% higher than the commonly quoted WHO estimate. This includes 42 million persons with blindness defined as presenting visual acuity less than 3/60 in the better eye, and 217 million persons with less severe visual impairment level defined as presenting visual acuity less than 6/18 to 3/60 in the better eye, 14% and 75% higher, respectively, than the WHO estimates based on best-corrected visual acuity. Sensitivity analysis, taking into account the uncertainty of the proportion of visual impairment caused by refractive error, revealed that the number of persons in the world with visual impairment due to uncorrected refractive error could range from 82 to 117 million.

Conclusion

The actual burden of visual impairment worldwide, including that caused by uncorrected refractive error, is substantially higher than the commonly quoted WHO estimate that is based on best-corrected visual acuity. We suggest that the indicative estimate of 259 million persons with visual impairment worldwide, which includes 42 million blind with visual acuity less than 3/60 in the better eye, be used for further planning of the VISION 2020 initiative instead of the often quoted 161 million estimate that includes 37 million blind.

### The Lancet global health commission on global eye health: vision beyond 2020 [^113ueYTB]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Vision impairment and mortality

Vision impairment seems to be associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Several explanations are possible for this association in relation to non-communicable eye diseases, mental health, and injuries (figure 5). This Commission did a systematic review and meta-analysis to contribute an updated appraisal of the literature, assessment of bias, and overall grading of the quality of evidence (appendix 1 p 24). We included studies that measured visual acuity and contained at least 1-year follow-up to assess all-cause mortality. A total of 28 studies representing 30 cohorts were included. Studies came from 12 countries in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America and included 451 001 participants.

The primary meta-analysis included studies comparing mortality among participants with vision better or worse than the prespecified thresholds of 6/12, 6/18, and 6/60. Since age is a common risk factor for vision impairment and mortality, all measures of association in this meta-analysis were age-adjusted. Where available, we also selected estimates adjusted for other possible confounders such as smoking, diabetes, access to health care, and socioeconomic status. Figure 6 presents the results of this analysis. We found that the hazard of mortality was higher among those with visual acuity < 6/12 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.20–1.39) and < 6/18 (1.43, 1.22–1.68) compared to those with better vision. At the 6/60 threshold, the hazard of mortality was higher than for those with visual acuity of ≥ 6/18 (1.89, 1.45–2.47). However, no significant association was detected when comparing those with visual acuity better and worse than 6/60 (1.02, 0.79–1.32), probably because the reference group contained participants with a substantial degree of vision impairment (≥ 6/60). We evaluated the certainty of evidence using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and judged it to be of moderate certainty. Additional research is needed to better understand factors that modulate mortality risk among adults with vision impairment, and to more fully characterise risk in LMICs, where data remain scarce. Given the prevailing finding of an association between vision impairment and mortality, future calculations of disability-adjusted life-years might include years of life lost due to vision impairment, which could provide a more complete estimate of the overall global burden of vision impairment. The impact of vision impairment on mortality should drive action to address avoidable sight loss and reinforces the relevance of eye health to SDG3 (good health and wellbeing) and the SDGs in general.

### The Lancet global health commission on global eye health: vision beyond 2020 [^113xBwTC]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Globally, of 7.79 billion people living in 2020, it is estimated that 43.28 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 37.57–48.36) are blind with presenting visual acuity of worse than 3/60 in the better eye and a crude all-age prevalence of 0.55% (0.48–0.61; table 3). Of these, 55% or 23.88 million (20.83–26.82) are women. The prevalence of blindness increases with age; most (77.7% or 33.61 million, 28.58–38.54) people with blindness are aged 50 years or older.

Table 3
Global number, crude prevalence, and age-adjusted prevalence of vision impairment in 2020

Moderate or severe vision impairment (MSVI) is defined as presenting visual acuity of worse than 6/18 to 3/60 in the better eye. MSVI is estimated to affect 295.09 million (95% UI 267.32–324.60) people, which is 3.74% (3.39–4.12) of the global population (table 3). A further 257.83 million (232.66–285.34) or 3.27% (2.95–3.62) have mild vision impairment, defined as presenting visual acuity of worse than 6/12 to 6/18 in the better eye. Globally, an estimated 509.69 million (371.11–666.66) people globally have near vision impairment from uncorrected presbyopia, representing 22.06% (15.52–29.62) of people aged 50 years and older. Similar to the gender imbalance in blindness, 55% or 162.97 million (147.43–179.21) of individuals who have MSVI and 55% or 142.29 million (128.45–157.36) of people with mild vision impairment are women.

### Expert CONsensus on visual evaluation in retinal disease manaGEment: the CONVERGE study [^117WrTLd]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Round 1 results

All 33 panel members completed round 1. We did not seek to quantitatively analyse the responses at this stage but the questions, summary of responses and unattributed additional comments can be seen in online supplemental material.

Notable outcomes included:

Majority agreement (26/33, 79%) that both structural and functional testing will be required in the future. The themes identified in the comments are illustrated with 11 quotes in table 2 (online supplemental material). One of the dominant themes was that panel members considered the two types of testing to each have their relative strengths and weaknesses and could potentially complement each other (quote 1). Generally, most agreed that structural testing would predominate over functional to detect early stage disease (quotes 1, 2 and 3). Nevertheless, their respective usage varied depending on the type and stage of the disease with some disagreement as to which one performs better in the early stages (quote 2 vs quote 6).
Unanimous agreement that VA often poorly correlates with symptoms and/or disease severity. Panel members further commented that VA does not necessarily mirror patients' reported day-to-day visual function. They noted that a poor correlation is more likely to be found in certain diseases where the regions of the retina affected differ from that determining VA, usually the fovea (quote 3).
A majority of panel members agreed with the potential of CS to improve understanding of visual function in retinal disease due to its high sensitivity to early vision loss and gradual change in visual function. Nevertheless, various barriers were given for why it is not as widely used. They highlighted the complexity of employing the test including staff training, repeatability, lack of standardisation and time constraints (quote 4).
A wide range of functional tests, such as VA, colour vision, CS, visual field and microperimetry, are used in clinical care and research/clinical trials. However, the relative ranking of the tests in terms of importance is different in clinical care compared with research/clinical trials. For example, colour vision is considered more important in a clinical care setting, whereas in research/clinicals it is CS (round 1 online supplemental material, questions 13 and 15). Various other tests were suggested as important such as electrophysiology, reading function and low luminance VA.
Most respondents considered PROMs to be important in future assessment but the level of importance ranged from 'essential' to 'fairly unimportant'. They further explained in the comments that PROMs, a subjective measure of the visual impairment impact on patients, should be used in conjunction with visual function testing (quote 5).

### Screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111pvahH]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Older adults — burden and epidemiology relevant to the I statement: In 2011, an estimated 12% of US adults aged 65 to 74 years and 15% of those 75 years or older reported having problems seeing, even when wearing glasses or contact lenses. The prevalence of hyperopia (including presbyopia) increases with age, while the prevalence of myopia tends to decrease with age. About half of all cases of bilateral low vision (ie, best-corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40) in adults 40 years or older are caused by cataracts, and the prevalence of cataracts increases sharply with age; an estimated 50% of US adults 75 years or older have cataracts. The prevalence of AMD is 6.5% in adults 40 years or older and increases with age (2.8% in adults aged 40 to 59 years and 13.4% in those 60 years or older), and AMD is the leading cause of blindness in adults older than 65 years. The prevalence of impaired visual acuity is higher among persons of lower socioeconomic or educational status and those without private health insurance. Risk factors for cataracts include older age, smoking, alcohol use, exposure to UV light, diabetes, and exposure to oral or inhaled corticosteroids, while risk factors for AMD are thought to include older age, smoking, obesity, diet low in green leafy vegetables, elevated cholesterol levels, cardiovascular disease, and family history; a positive family history is strongly associated with refractive disorders such as myopia and hyperopia.

### Population prevalence of vision impairment in US adults 71 years and older: the national health and aging trends study [^114udCK6]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Existing estimates of the prevalence of vision impairment (VI) in the United States are based on self-reported survey data or measures of visual function that are at least 14 years old. Older adults are at high risk for VI and blindness. There is a need for up-to-date, objectively measured, national epidemiological estimates.

Objective

To present updated national epidemiological estimates of VI and blindness in older US adults based on objective visual function testing.

This survey study presents a secondary data analysis of the 2021 National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a population-based, nationally representative panel study of Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older. NHATS includes community-dwelling older adults or their proxies who complete in-person interviews; annual follow-up interviews are conducted regardless of residential status. Round 11 NHATS data were collected from June to November 2021, and data were analyzed in August 2022.

Interventions

In 2021, NHATS incorporated tablet-based tests of distance and near visual acuity and contrast sensitivity with habitual correction.

Main Outcomes and Measures

National prevalence of impairment in presenting distance visual acuity (> 0.30 logMAR, Snellen equivalent worse than 20/40), presenting near visual acuity (> 0.30 logMAR, Snellen equivalent worse than 20/40), and contrast sensitivity (> 1 SD below the sample mean). Prevalence estimates stratified by age and socioeconomic and demographic data were calculated.

Results

In the 2021 round 11 NHATS sample, there were 3817 respondents. After excluding respondents who did not complete the sample person interview (n = 429) and those with missing vision data (n = 362), there were 3026 participants. Of these, 29.5% (95% CI, 27.3%-31.8%) were 71 to 74 years old, and 55.2% (95% CI, 52.8%-57.6%) were female respondents. The prevalence of VI in US adults 71 years and older was 27.8% (95% CI, 25.5%-30.1%). Distance and near visual acuity and contrast sensitivity impairments were prevalent in 10.3% (95% CI, 8.9%-11.7%), 22.3% (95% CI, 20.3%-24.3%), and 10.0% (95% CI, 8.5%-11.4%), respectively. Older age, less education, and lower income were associated with all types of VI. A higher prevalence of near visual acuity and contrast sensitivity impairments was associated with non-White race and Hispanic ethnicity.

Conclusions and Relevance

More than 1 in 4 US adults 71 years and older had VI in 2021, higher than prior estimates. Differences in the prevalence of VI by socioeconomic and demographic factors were observed. These data could inform public health planning.

### Refractive errors preferred practice pattern ® [^114A2Am5]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Refractive errors Preferred Practice Pattern — examination and refraction specify that distance visual acuity is usually measured in a dimly lit room, typically at 20 feet or 6 meters, and distance acuity should be measured separately for each eye with current correction, with near acuity measured at a specified near working distance, typically 14 inches or 36 centimeters. Each eye should be evaluated independently, the refraction may be performed objectively or subjectively, in cooperative patients subjective refinement of refraction using a phoropter or trial lens set is preferred, and determination of vertex distance and precise astigmatic axis is especially important in patients with high refractive errors. The reproducibility of subjective refraction has been found to be within 0.50 D for spherical equivalent, spherical power, and cylindrical power. Distance refraction should be performed with accommodation relaxed using manifest (noncycloplegic) refraction with fogging or other techniques to minimize accommodation, and in some cases, especially in children and many adolescents, a cycloplegic refraction can be useful. Near vision should be measured in each eye before cycloplegia for patients with high hyperopia, presbyopia, or complaints about near vision. Cycloplegic refraction is especially indicated when accommodation cannot be relaxed and for patients whose symptoms are not consistent with the manifest refractive error, and it is advised when the accuracy of the refraction is in question for any reason. In adults, tropicamide and cyclopentolate are commonly used for cycloplegic refraction; tropicamide provides a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of effect, whereas cyclopentolate provides greater cycloplegia that may allow a more accurate refraction but a longer duration of effect. A significant difference between manifest and cycloplegic refraction is observed frequently in children; in adults, a substantial difference may require a postcycloplegic refraction on a subsequent day when the cycloplegic refraction is used to guide the final manifest prescription, and the postcycloplegic refraction is performed after full accommodation has returned. Although most normal eyes should have a corrected acuity of 20/25 or better, it may not be possible to achieve this level of acuity in patients with high refractive errors.

### Visual function, digital behavior and the vision performance index [^115ywbbZ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Measuring visual acuity: past and present

Visual acuity serves as the backbone by which ocular function is measured. As practiced in clinical ophthalmology, visual acuity is the subjective measurement obtained by an individual reading the smallest recognizable optotype from a standardized list (ie, Early Treatment in Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS], Snellen; Figure 1). The test yields information regarding not only a patient's ocular health but also his or her neurological health in regard to intracranial visual pathways and processing. A patient's ability to perform the test successfully requires a certain degree of mental capacity and compliance. This is perhaps the greatest drawback of current methods of vision testing. Ideally, vision assessment should be objective, reproducible and exact without dependence on patient compliance.

The Snellen chart, developed by Dr Hermann Snellen in 1862, is among the most common forms of visual acuity testing (Figure 1A). The chart essentially measures spatial patterns or angular acuity. Each line on the chart is sized differently and yields data regarding the smallest angular measurement able to be visualized by the individual at a standardized distance. For example, at 6 m (or 20 feet) away from the chart, the 20/20 line is composed of letters that subtend 5 minutes of arc (Figure 2). Each part of the letter subtends 1 minute of arc. At the same distance, the 20/200 line letters subtend 50 minutes of arc.

The disadvantages of this method are multiple, much of which have to do with the line-to-line inconsistencies. First, each line contains a different number of letters. While the 20/200 line contains 1–3 letters, the 20/20 line contains 8 letters. Because of this difference, the scoring system of the chart is highly inconsistent. A patient may miss one letter on the 20/20 line (or 20/20-) in which he or she has read 7/8 letters correctly. Whereas if the patient has scored 20/200-, he or she has read only 2/3 letters correctly. Furthermore, the difference between the size of the letters of each line and the space between each line does not follow standardized progression pattern. This potentially overestimates vision, especially in the lower spectrum of visual acuities. For this reason, statistical analysis of Snellen visual acuity is very difficult for research studies.

### Vision and quality in the digital imaging environment: how much does the visual acuity of radiologists vary at an intermediate distance? [^1123itQB]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine the intermediate-distance visual acuity of a cross section of radiologists and to identify variation in visual acuity during a typical workday.

Subjects and Methods

Forty-eight radiologists completed a brief survey before undergoing visual acuity testing, with corrective lenses if routinely used, at three times of the day. Testing was performed with modified versions of a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration visual acuity test instrument.

Results

The mean acuity of radiologists across all measurements was 20/15 (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR], -0.109 ± 0.105 [SD]). Visual acuity ranged from 20/30 to 20/10 (logMAR, 0.176 to -0.301). Mean visual acuity in the morning session was approximately 20/16 (logMAR, -0.0856). This value was statistically significantly lower than the mean visual acuity in both the early afternoon (logMAR, -0.124; p = 0.003) and the late afternoon (logMAR, -0.118; p = 0.015), both of which were approximately 20/15. This change was within the expected test-retest variability of Snellen acuity measurements.

Conclusion

Although a statistically significant difference was detected between the visual acuity of radiologists in the morning and acuity in other parts of the day, this difference was relatively modest and within previously published ranges of variability for similar visual acuity tests. It is unlikely that such variation in visual acuity among radiologists influences diagnostic performance. Not every radiologist had 20/20 vision, a few needed visual correction, and more than a few had not undergone a thorough eye examination for as many as 15 years before the study.

Table 2
Refractive Data Before and After Trifocal Sulcus IOL Implantation

Figure 2 shows the mean monocular visual acuity by distance and correction status. The mean monocular uncorrected VA was 0.1 logMAR (20/25, 0.8 decimal). Distance corrected near VA was about a half line better. Table 3 summarizes the categorized VA data by distance and correction. Twenty of 25 eyes (80%) had a UNVA of 0.2 logMAR (20/32) or better. Seventeen of 25 eyes (68%) had a distance corrected VA of 0.2 logMAR or better at all test distances, while 15/25 eyes (60%) had uncorrected VA of 0.2 logMAR or better at all test distances.

Table 3
Cumulative Monocular Visual Acuity Results by Distance and Correction (n = 25)

Figure 2
Monocular visual acuity by correction and distance.

As noted previously, one eye of one subject had the trifocal sulcus IOL implanted but did not have prior refractive surgery. Table 4 shows the binocular visual acuity results. Binocular uncorrected distance visual acuity was 0.1 logMAR or better in all subjects and the binocular uncorrected near visual acuity was 0.1 logMAR or better in all but one subject. Monocular corrected low contrast distance visual acuity was 0.24 ± 0.13 logMAR, with a range of 0.02 to 0.46 logMAR.

Table 4
Binocular Visual Acuity Results (n = 13)

Figure 3 shows the distance-corrected monocular defocus curve. Mean distance VA was −0.05 logMAR (20/20 +2) while mean near VA was 0.05 logMAR (20/20 −2). Mean acuity was better than 0.3 logMAR (20/40) from distance to −3.00 D vergence (~ 33 cm viewing distance).

Figure 3
Monocular defocus curve.

Given the range of follow-up times in this study, all VA and refractive data were checked for correlation to the time of follow-up. Distance corrected intermediate vision was the only statistically significant correlation (p < 0.05), suggesting better intermediate vision over time. However, a detailed examination of the data showed the correlation was driven by one outlier with lower (worse) intermediate VA and the shortest follow-up time (7 months), so it was not deemed clinically important.

### Vision rehabilitation preferred practice pattern ® [^115PDFVK]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

World Health Organization (WHO) visual impairment classification with best possible correction defines acuity-based categories and related field criteria as follows: Under visual acuity with best possible correction, category 1 has maximum less than 6/18 (20/70) and minimum equal to or better than 6/60 (20/200); category 4 has maximum less than 1/60 (central fixation at 1 meter) and minimum equal to or better than Light perception, and category 5 is No light perception. If the extent of the visual field is taken into account, patients with a field no greater than 10 degrees but greater than 5 around central fixation should be placed in category 3; patients with a field no greater than 5 around central fixation should be placed in category 4, even if the central acuity is not impaired. Terminology notes state that the term low vision in category H54 comprises categories 1 and 2 of the table; the term blindness comprises categories 3, 4, and 5; and the term unqualified visual loss comprises category 9.

### Visual function, digital behavior and the vision performance index [^11619ugM]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

In addition, the chart does not address other aspects involved in vision such as pattern recognition or contrast sensitivity, especially in patients with poor visual acuity. For example, mistaking the letters "G" and "C" is given the same score as mistaking the letter "A" for "C". In the first scenario, the letters "G" and "C" have similar patterns. Yet, the patient is given no credit for this recognition.

Ideally, a vision score should be consistent and reproducible. This is key to allow for detection of subtle changes in vision. The test–retest variability (TRV) is a measure of the variance of a single test carried out under the same conditions. The higher the TRV, the lower the ability to detect a true change in visual patterns. Snellen TRV is very high, ranging from 5 to 16.5 letters in normal patients and up to 3.5 lines variation in patients with visual pathology such as cataracts or macular degeneration. Clinically, the same patient could be 20/20 in one sitting and 20/50 in another on the same day under the same conditions, without any real change in vision. While the clinical repercussions of such large variations are problematic, the lack of reproducibility makes this test almost impossible to utilize for vision testing in research studies.

In order to overcome the deficiencies in the Snellen chart, in 1982, a new chart was developed for the ETDRS called the ETDRS chart (Figure 1B). This chart was designed such that each line has an equal number of letters per line with equal spacing between letters and rows (0.1 log units). Between rows, the size of the letters increases with a logarithmic progression. So, a change in vision can be calculated as an overall percent change, no matter in which line on the chart the change occurs. These factors have led to the ETDRS chart's increased accuracy and reduced TRV. The TRV of the ETDRS chart is about 3.5 letters for patients with normal acuity and 10 letters for patients with ocular disease.

Nonetheless, despite its apparent benefits, the ETDRS has not completely replaced the Snellen chart in the clinical setting. Resurgence of interest and use of the mobile version of Snellen chart can be seen in more recent literature. Results of these studies demonstrate a large discrepancy between clinical Snellen measurements and mobile measurements, in addition to the baseline inconsistencies within the Snellen chart itself.

Background — United States vision loss burden and projections include 2015 estimates of "1.02 million" legally blind individuals (best-corrected visual acuity of "20/200 or less" in the better-seeing eye) and "approximately 3.22 million" with visual impairment (best-corrected visual acuity "less than 20/40" in the better-seeing eye), with "up to 8.2 million" having reduced vision due to uncorrected refractive errors; by 2050, counts are projected to double to "approximately 2.01 million" with legal blindness, "6.95 million" with visual impairment, and "16.4 million" with reduced vision due to uncorrected refractive errors. The document notes that "Visual impairment increases with age among all racial and ethnic groups", and the elderly population "(65 years and older)… was approximately 56 million in 2020" and is estimated to reach "nearly 86 million by 2050". It further states that "at least 40 percent of vision loss in the United States is either preventable or treatable with timely intervention".

### Self-management interventions for quality of life in adults with visual impairment [^113iGPo2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Visual impairment is a major health concern that predominantly impacts older adults due to age-related ocular diseases. Visual impairment affects more than 2200 million people worldwide and may lead to functional and psychological decline, emphasizing the need for effective self-management interventions. Self-management interventions aim to enhance individuals' abilities to manage their condition, maintain activities of daily living, and improve overall well-being.

Objectives

To assess the effects of self-management interventions on quality of life in adults with visual impairment compared with inactive or active (usual care) control interventions.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trial registries, together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was on 19 May 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing multifaceted self-management interventions in adults with acquired visual impairment (including dual sensory impairment).

Outcomes

Outcomes assessed were overall and subscores of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) scores at the end of follow-up, adverse events during the study period, and vision-related living performance measures at the end of follow-up.

Risk Of Bias

We assessed the risk of bias for three outcomes reported in a summary of findings table using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We synthesized results for each outcome using meta-analysis where possible, by calculating standardized mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes. Where this was not possible due to the nature of the data, we provided a narrative summary of the results. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for prespecified outcomes.

Included Studies

We included 20 parallel-group RCTs that enrolled 3151 participants. The size of studies ranged from 30 to 323 participants with a median of 153 participants. Studies were conducted in Asia (two studies), Australia (two), Europe (six), and North America (10) in academic medical centers, hospitals, low-vision clinics, private practice, rehabilitation centers, and Veterans Affairs medical facilities. The participants were older adults with a mean age across the included studies ranging from 60 to 84 years. The mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity ranged from 0.15 to 1.11. Age-related macular degeneration was the predominant cause of low vision in 15 studies. We did not identify any eligible studies for adults with dual sensory impairment. One study was funded by industry, whereas others received a research grant or support from a non-profit organization or foundation. Multifaceted self-management interventions included in this review were diverse. The control group was placed on a wait list, while other active controls included usual care, optical aids, or low-vision rehabilitation.

Synthesis Of Results

We rated the overall risk of bias of included studies as low or some concerns. The meta-analysis revealed consistent findings across different outcomes and comparisons. For HRQoL, evidence suggests that self-management intervention may result in little to no difference in HRQoL (change score: SMD -0.09, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.15; I² = 46%; 3 studies, 568 participants; final value: SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.08; I² = 31%; 3 studies, 459 participants; low-certainty evidence). This finding remained consistent regardless of whether wait list or active control was the comparator. For VRQoL, multifaceted self-management interventions may result in little to no difference in VRQoL change score compared to active control (SMD -0.12, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.10; I² = 48%; 4 studies, 733 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence from six studies by final values suggests that self-management intervention may not improve VRQoL compared to control treatment in the longer-term (6 to 24 months) (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.13; I² = 0%; 6 studies, 864 participants; low-certainty evidence). The conclusion was unchanged, irrespective of the comparator used. We judged the certainty of evidence for both HRQoL and VRQoL as low according to GRADE criteria, downgrading one level for imprecision and one level for unexplained heterogeneity. For harms, self-management interventions may not affect the risk of adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.66; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 255 participants; low-certainty evidence). Of four studies that reported adverse events, three studies observed no treatment-related adverse events. One study referred 12 (34%) participants to the general medical practitioner for depressive symptoms in the intervention group compared with seven (22%) participants in the wait list comparison group.

Authors' Conclusions

In this review, we found low-certainty evidence that multifaceted self-management interventions have little or no effects on improving HRQoL and VRQoL for adults with visual impairment. Research is needed to develop more sensitive measures of quality of life and to assess the benefit of such interventions across a broader demographic, including different stages of vision impairment and people with dual-sensory impairment.

Extensions of STROBE items for vision impairment surveys

- **Items 7 and 11 (variables)**: define and report vision categories and unit of analysis (eg, best eye or binocular), eye disease case definitions, avoidable vision loss, and any risk exposures of interest
- **Item 8 (details of measurement)**: for vision testing, report chart type (scale, optotype), approach to maintaining constant test distance, location of testing, and whether the examination protocol differed for different subgroups (eg, children or adults with cognitive impairment); if collecting clinical images, report details of reading centre personnel, training and grading or agreement criteria

Major risks of bias to minimise and report

- Wrong sample size bias — sample too small to yield precise prevalence estimates or too large and resource inefficient — eg, if expected prevalence of blindness is lower than sample prevalence
- Selection bias — the sampled population not accurately representing the target population, resulting in erroneous inferences about the population's magnitude of vision impairment — eg, if the random sampling and enumeration procedures are not rigorously observed, a convenience sample might be recruited, yielding an apparently good response rate, who differ in important but unmeasurable ways from the true target population
- Non-responder bias — non-responders might differ substantially from responders — eg, older people (in whom vision impairment is more prevalent) or people not working on account of vision impairment, are more likely to be available for examination than younger employed people
- Diagnostic purity bias — narrow case definitions — eg, exclusion of ocular comorbidities might lead to misleading cause attribution, a tendency to over-report causes most easily identified from simple examination protocols and to underreport posterior segment disease
- Missing clinical data bias — missing data might differentially impact reliability of results in different subgroups — eg, likelihood of agreeing to pupil dilation might vary between different clinical subgroups, affecting the ability to collect data

### Comparing a home vision self-assessment test to office-based snellen visual acuity [^116J7eP2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective, cross-sectional study, we assessed how patients performed when VA was self-measured at home using a modified ETDRS chart displayed in a PDF file compared to office-based Snellen testing. Patients completed the home test within one week of their office-based test. Patients enrolled had VA better than 20/125 by Snellen VA. This allowed for a buffer of > 2 lines of vision from the upper limit on the home chart (20/200). In our study, the majority of patients had "good" vision, defined as better than or equal to 20/40. There was no statistically significant difference between the mean office-based VA compared to home VA. 91% of study eyes had clinically significant agreement (defined a priori as ≤ 0.2 logMAR lines of difference from the mean difference) and 60% of eyes had ≤ 0.1 logMAR line of difference from the mean difference.

In our subgroup analysis, there was a significant mean difference between the office and home measurements for those with "good" vision (better than or equal to 20/40), but not those with vision worse than 20/40. For the patients with "good" vision, the mean difference was −0.05 logMAR (SD 0.13, P = 0.01), which was not clinically significant and likely within the range of normal variability for an individual. Furthermore, our study was not powered to detect a difference of < 0.1 logMAR. For those with vision worse than 20/40, the mean difference was more than 1 line of vision (0.13 logMAR, SD 0.17, P = 0.09), with eyes performing better with the home vision test compared to the office test. There were fewer study eyes in this "intermediate" vision group (N = 7) and additional evaluation is needed with larger sample sizes powered for subgroup analysis.

### Visual acuity and ophthalmic outcomes in the year after cataract surgery among children younger than 13 years [^112oaTi8]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Cataract is an important cause of visual impairment in children. Outcomes reported from a large clinical disease-specific registry can provide real-world estimates of visual outcomes and rates of adverse events in clinical practice.

Objective

To describe visual acuity and refractive error outcomes, as well as rates of amblyopia, glaucoma, and additional eye surgery, during the first year after lensectomy in children.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prospective observational study was conducted from June 18, 2012, to July 8, 2015, at 61 pediatric eye care practices among 880 children younger than 13 years at the time of lensectomy in at least 1 eye with follow-up within 15 months after surgery. Statistical analysis was performed from December 12, 2016, to December 14, 2018.

Exposures

Lensectomy with or without implantation of an intraocular lens.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Visual acuity as well as rates of amblyopia, glaucoma, suspected glaucoma, and other intraocular surgery.

Results

Among the 880 children (432 girls and 448 boys; mean [SD] age at annual follow-up, 4.9 [3.8] years) in the study, lens surgery was bilateral in 362 (41.1%; 95% CI, 37.9%-44.4%) children and unilateral in 518 (58.9%; 95% CI, 55.6%-62.1%). An intraocular lens was implanted in 654 of 1132 eyes (60.2%; 95% CI, 57.0%-63.4% [proportions reported for eye-level outcomes account for the potential correlation induced by enrolling both eyes of some individuals; for participants who received bilateral surgery, these numbers will differ from the quotient of the number of cases divided by the total sample size]). Amblyopia was identified in 449 children (51.0%; 95% CI, 47.7%-54.3%). In children age 3 years or older, mean visual acuity was 0.30 logMAR (about 20/40) in 153 bilateral pseudophakic eyes, 0.49 logMAR (about 20/63) in 141 unilateral pseudophakic eyes, 0.47 logMAR (about 20/63) in 21 bilateral aphakic eyes, and 0.61 logMAR (about 20/80) in 17 unilateral aphakic eyes. Mean visual acuity improved with older age at surgery in eyes with bilateral pseudophakia by 0.2 logMAR line (99% CI, 0.02–0.4; p = 0.005) and by 0.3 logMAR line (99% CI, 0.04–0.60; p = 0.004) in eyes with unilateral pseudophakia. A new diagnosis of glaucoma or suspected glaucoma was made in 67 of 1064 eyes that did not have glaucoma prior to lensectomy (5.9%; 95% CI, 4.6%-7.7%); 36 of 273 eyes with bilateral aphakia (13.2%; 95% CI, 9.0%-19.0%), 5 of 308 eyes with bilateral pseudophakia (1.5%; 95% CI, 0.6%-4.2%), 14 of 178 eyes with unilateral aphakia (7.9%; 95% CI, 4.7%-12.8%), and 12 of 305 eyes with unilateral pseudophakia (3.9%; 95% CI, 2.2%-6.8%). Additional intraocular surgery, most commonly vitrectomy or membranectomy to clear the visual axis, was performed in 189 of 1132 eyes (17.0%; 95% CI, 14.8%-19.6%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Amblyopia was frequently observed during the first year after lensectomy in this cohort of children younger than 13 years. For children age 2 years or older at surgery visual acuity was typically less than normal for age and was worse with unilateral cataract. Management of visual axis obscuration was the most common complication requiring surgical intervention during the first year after surgery.

### Vision rehabilitation preferred practice pattern ® [^1172YFMy]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Vision rehabilitation — ICD-10 visual acuity and field impairment categorization is based on a 6-level World Health Organization (WHO) classification from normal to no light perception, and relevant ICD codes take into account both the right and left eye. The six visual acuity thresholds presented are 20/60 or better, 20/61 to 20/200, 20/201 to 20/400, 20/401 to 20/1200, 20/1201 to LP, and NLP; LP is light perception and NLP is no light perception. Visual field impairment can also be used to determine ICD codes, with Category 3 defined as a field no greater than 10 degrees but greater than 5 around central fixation and Category 4 defined as a field no greater than 5 degrees around central fixation. Visual field impairment is assessed based on a Goldmann III size target for Goldman fields, and for Humphrey field testing a point seen with a 10db or higher stimulus is a point that would be seen with a 4e stimulus.

### Screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113ZzQKj]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Epidemiology and risk factors — impaired visual acuity in older adults — note that about 12% of US adults aged 65 to 74 years and 15% of those 75 years or older report problems seeing even with correction. Refractive errors are the most common cause; half of all cases of bilateral low vision in adults 40 years or older are caused by cataracts, and 50% of adults 75 years or older in the US have cataracts. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in adults older than 65 years. Impaired visual acuity is more prevalent among persons with lower socioeconomic or educational status and those without private health insurance. Risk factors include older age, family history (correlating with myopia and hyperopia), smoking, alcohol use, ultraviolet light exposure, diabetes, oral or inhaled corticosteroid exposure, obesity, diet low in green leafy vegetables, elevated cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, and family history. There is limited evidence that primary care–based screening benefits persons without reported symptoms. Impaired visual acuity is associated with decreased quality of life and increased risk of falls and other accidental injuries.

### Assessment of near visual acuity in 0–13 year olds with normal and low vision: a systematic review [^117XBthm]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The general goal of this review was to provide guidelines for near visual acuity measurement for 0–13 year old children with normal vision and low vision. The most frequently used method to measure visual acuity in 0–36 month old children was the TAC. There was no clear method of choice for the intermediate age group, the 4–7 year old children. For the 8–13 year old children, the ETDRS was the most frequently used chart. Nine studies were included that measured near and distance visual acuities (reporting means and standard deviations), but there were no systematic difference between these measures. Standard deviations were not larger for near than distance visual acuities, suggesting that reliability of these measures is not weaker than reliability of distance visual acuities when measured with a standardized routine. This review brings forth several insights with regards to four topics: (i) the impact of threshold choice on vision outcome, (ii) the sensitivity of charts to detect refraction errors or crowding, (iii) the impact of viewing distance during near vision assessments, and (iv) the impact of optotype choice on the measured visual acuity.

### Determining the variability associated with visual acuity and refractive error measurements: a systematic review [^114543YM]. Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Topic

The goal of this systematic review was to evaluate the measurement variability of distance visual acuity (VA) and refractive error (RE).

Clinical Relevance

Accurately measuring VA and RE is fundamental to eye care; however, no scientific consensus has been reached on the measurement variability. Scientific literature suggests limits of variability of ± 0.15 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) for VA and ± 0.5 diopters (D) for RE. This lack of consensus on variability affects our clinical decision-making, regulations, and research.

Methods

This systematic review was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and was registered at PROSPERO (ID CRD42024554663). We searched Medline, PubMed, and Embase databases. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool was then used to assess the risk of bias (RoB). We included studies of adults that directly compared distance VA or RE and reported the limits of agreement (LoA) and mean difference. An overall summarized mean is reported in LoA, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation.

Results

After applying the eligibility criteria, 12 studies reporting on VA and 6 studies reporting on RE were included. Six of the 18 studies (33%) scored a low RoB in at least 3 of 4 QUADAS-2 domains. In 25 of 36 subgroups (69%), the LoA exceeded the suggested clinical accepted variability ranges for VA (± 0.15 logMAR) or RE (± 0.5 D). The overall summarized mean is ± 0.20 logMAR (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17–0.23) for VA and ± 0.70 D (95% CI, 0.50–0.89) for RE. The Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation certainty of evidence was very low.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that distance VA and RE measurements have a high measurement variability in adults, exceeding the suggested limits of variability (VA: ± 0.15 logMAR, RE: ± 0.5 D). The evidence either fails to support the suggested limits of variability or is based on studies with methodological weaknesses, with a very low certainty of evidence. Methodological rigorous studies are therefore needed to accurately estimate the suggested limits of variability. For now, we propose using the overall summarized mean LoA obtained in our study as a provisional frame of reference (i.e., ± 0.20 logMAR and ± 0.70 D).

### Revision of visual impairment definitions in the international statistical classification of diseases [^113zwLRd]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Visual acuity level to define blindness

Because the ICD definition and WHO recommend use of a visual acuity level less than 3/60 to define blindness, many population-based surveys from less developed countries have reported blindness rates with this definition in the past. There are exceptions such as India, where a visual acuity level less than 6/60 is used to define blindness, and recent reports from other less developed countries covering African and Chinese populations that have used visual acuity less than 6/60 to define blindness. The more developed countries have often used visual acuity level less than 6/60 to define blindness; the United States uses visual acuity less than or equal to 6/60 for this definition. The level of human development in less developed countries has been increasing over the past few decades, as indicated by increases in life expectancy, literacy and income. Since the recommendation to use visual acuity level less than 3/60 to define blindness some three decades ago, higher levels of vision are now required for optimal functioning even in less developed countries because of the increasing complexity of daily tasks, prompting suggestions for using a less severe level of visual impairment to define blindness. We therefore suggest that a uniform definition of blindness for both the less and more developed countries as presenting visual acuity less than 6/60 is now more appropriate than the 3/60 acuity level used by the ICD definition (Table 3). In the existing ICD visual impairment categories, there is no visual field loss corresponding to visual acuity less than 6/60 to 3/60 (Table 1). It has previously been suggested that for visual acuity level of 6/60 the equivalent central visual field of 20° seems appropriate, and we propose this for inclusion in the ICD classification (Table 3).

Additionally, visual acuity less than 6/12 is often used in more developed countries to define visual impairment, as this level of vision is considered necessary for daily tasks. Using logic similar to that used above for blindness, the increasing complexity of daily tasks even in less developed countries would require better vision with the passage of time. We therefore suggest that it would be useful to have a category of mild visual impairment in the ICD classification for presenting visual acuity less than 6/12 to 6/18 (Table 3).

### Trends in prevalence of blindness and distance and near vision impairment over 30 years: an analysis for the global burden of disease study [^113yyQDC]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Background

To contribute to the WHO initiative, VISION 2020: The Right to Sight, an assessment of global vision impairment in 2020 and temporal change is needed. We aimed to extensively update estimates of global vision loss burden, presenting estimates for 2020, temporal change over three decades between 1990–2020, and forecasts for 2050.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based surveys of eye disease from January, 1980, to October, 2018. Only studies with samples representative of the population and with clearly defined visual acuity testing protocols were included. We fitted hierarchical models to estimate 2020 prevalence (with 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs]) of mild vision impairment (presenting visual acuity ≥ 6/18 and < 6/12), moderate and severe vision impairment (< 6/18 to 3/60), and blindness (< 3/60 or less than 10° visual field around central fixation); and vision impairment from uncorrected presbyopia (presenting near vision < N6 or < N8 at 40 cm where best-corrected distance visual acuity is ≥ 6/12). We forecast estimates of vision loss up to 2050.

Findings

In 2020, an estimated 43.3 million (95% UI 37.6–48.4) people were blind, of whom 23.9 million (55%; 20.8–26.8) were estimated to be female. We estimated 295 million (267–325) people to have moderate and severe vision impairment, of whom 163 million (55%; 147–179) were female; 258 million (233–285) to have mild vision impairment, of whom 142 million (55%; 128–157) were female; and 510 million (371–667) to have visual impairment from uncorrected presbyopia, of whom 280 million (55%; 205–365) were female. Globally, between 1990 and 2020, among adults aged 50 years or older, age-standardised prevalence of blindness decreased by 28.5% (-29.4 to -27.7) and prevalence of mild vision impairment decreased slightly (-0.3%, -0.8 to -0.2), whereas prevalence of moderate and severe vision impairment increased slightly (2.5%, 1.9 to 3.2; insufficient data were available to calculate this statistic for vision impairment from uncorrected presbyopia). In this period, the number of people who were blind increased by 50.6% (47.8 to 53.4) and the number with moderate and severe vision impairment increased by 91.7% (87.6 to 95.8). By 2050, we predict 61.0 million (52.9 to 69.3) people will be blind, 474 million (428 to 518) will have moderate and severe vision impairment, 360 million (322 to 400) will have mild vision impairment, and 866 million (629 to 1150) will have uncorrected presbyopia.

Interpretation

Age-adjusted prevalence of blindness has reduced over the past three decades, yet due to population growth, progress is not keeping pace with needs. We face enormous challenges in avoiding vision impairment as the global population grows and ages.

### Vision rehabilitation preferred practice pattern ® [^111Yj6Mx]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

ICD-10 visual impairment severity thresholds are defined as follows. Moderate visual impairment is when best-corrected visual acuity is "less than 20/60 (including 20/70) to 20/160". Severe visual impairment is when best-corrected visual acuity is "less than 20/160 (including 20/200) to 20/400", or the visual field diameter is "20 degrees or less (largest field diameter for Goldmann isopter III4e, 3/1000 white test object, or equivalent)". Profound visual impairment is when best-corrected visual acuity is "less than 20/400 (including 20/500) to 20/1000", or the visual field diameter is "10 degrees or less (largest field diameter for Goldmann isopter III4e, 3/1000 white test object, or equivalent)". Near-total vision loss is when best-corrected visual acuity is "less than 20/1000". Total blindness is "no light perception".

### Refractive surgery preferred practice pattern ® [^117WP8WE]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Best‑corrected visual acuity (BCVA) expectations and evaluation — Although most normal eyes should have a corrected acuity of 20/20 to 20/25 or better, it may not be possible to achieve this level in patients with high refractive errors even with optimal refraction. For a subset of patients this might be due to minification from high myopic correction at the spectacle plane or to refractive amblyopia, and a pathologic basis for reduced BCVA should be sought. A suddenly acquired refractive change may signal a systemic or local disease or a drug or medication effect, and excellent visual acuity does not preclude serious eye disease; therefore, all patients should have a comprehensive medical eye evaluation at the recommended intervals.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^1142E3ky]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to natural history (advanced age-related macular degeneration, general principles), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that advanced AMD is defined in the AREDS as either neovascular AMD or GA involving the center of the macula. Eyes classified as category 4 were required to have no advanced AMD in the study eye and the fellow eye had to have VA less than 20/32 as a result of AMD abnormalities. In the AREDS, the risk of progression for patients with advanced AMD in one eye to an advanced stage in the fellow eye ranged from 35% to 50% at 5 years, depending largely on the phenotype in the better eye. In the Beaver Dam Eye Study, approximately 22% of the fellow eyes of such patients developed neovascular changes or GA involving the fovea over 5 years. In the Submacular Surgery Trial, these findings were also confirmed and further emphasize the value of the simple risk scale. In 2013, the Beckman Initiative for Macular Research Classification Committee classified advanced AMD as either neovascular AMD and/or any GA whether the macula is affected or not.

### Screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113Cr6Y6]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Impairment of visual acuity is a serious public health problem in older adults. The number of persons 60 years or older with impaired visual acuity (defined as best corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40 but better than 20/200) was estimated at 2.91 million in 2015, and the number who are blind (defined as best corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or worse) was estimated at 760 000. Impaired visual acuity is consistently associated with decreased quality of life in older persons, including reduced ability to perform activities of daily living, work, and drive safely, as well as increased risk of falls and other unintentional injuries.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults.

Population

Asymptomatic adults 65 years or older who present in primary care without known impaired visual acuity and are not seeking care for vision problems.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for impaired visual acuity in asymptomatic older adults. The evidence is lacking, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. More research is needed.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults. (I statement).

Disease definition and legal blindness criteria — low vision is described as "vision impairment that cannot be corrected by standard eyeglasses, contact lenses, or by medical or surgical treatment", and "may result from many different ocular diseases or from neurological disorders such as cerebral vascular accidents". The document notes, "The ICD-10 CM definitions of low vision are based on visual acuity and visual field", and that "a minimum visual acuity of 20/50 to 20/70 in the better seeing eye is required for driving in many states". Legal blindness is defined by the Social Security Administration as "visual acuity 20/200 or less with the use of a correcting lens or a visual field diameter 20 degrees or less in the better seeing eye", and "Individuals who cannot identify any letters with either eye on the 20/100 line of a visual acuity chart, such as Bailey-Lovie or the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, are considered legally blind". For those with very limited vision, services "are referred to as blind rehabilitation and include sight substitutes such as braille instruction, long-white-cane training, or guide dog assistance".

Visual Acuity and Refraction

Two hundred twelve patients had a documented BCVA for at least 1 eye at presentation. Mean ± SD BCVA was 0.37 ± 0.47 logMAR (Snellen equivalent, mean, 20/47; range, –0.18 to 2.28 logMAR [Snellen equivalent, 20/13–20/3811]) for the right eye and 0.33 ± 0.42 logMAR (Snellen equivalent, mean, 20/43; range, –0.18 to 2.28 logMAR [Snellen equivalent, 20/13–20/3811]) for the left eye at presentation. Baseline BCVA was highly variable among patients, but no significant interocular difference was found (t = 0.72; P = 0.47, paired t test). Data from both eyes were pooled and plotted against age (Fig 2 A). A statistically significant weak correlation was found between BCVA and age at presentation (r = 0.33; P < 0.0001, Pearson correlation coefficient).

Refraction data from 235 eyes of 119 patients were included in the analysis. The spherical equivalent was calculated, and refractive errors were classified. Thirty-four eyes (14.5%) were found to have high hyperopia, 67 eyes (28.5%) were found to have moderate hyperopia, and 84 eyes (35.7%) were found to have low hyperopia. Eleven eyes (4.7%) were emmetropic and 39 eyes exhibited low myopia (16.6%). No patient was found to have high myopia. Of the 213 patients with clinical information, amblyopia was diagnosed in 13 patients (6.1%), with 1 patient successfully treated with occlusion therapy. The cause for amblyopia was strabismus in 8 patients, refractive error in 3 patients, and not documented for 2 patients.

### LIGHTSITE III: 13-month efficacy and safety evaluation of multiwavelength photobiomodulation in nonexudative (dry) age-related macular degeneration using the lumithera valeda light delivery system [^113nS5cd]. Retina (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current report provides details of the 13-month analysis of the LIGHTSITE III 24-month study. The study met the predetermined primary efficacy endpoint with a statistically significant difference in BCVA between the PBM versus Sham treatment groups. A mean letter gain ≥ 5 letters was observed following PBM. Furthermore, 55.0% of PBM-treated eyes showed ≥ 5 letter gain, and 26.4% showed ≥ 10 letter gain. A total of 92.0% of eyes were categorized as early/intermediate dry AMD and showed limited visual impairment at study enrollment. Best-corrected visual acuity letter scores of 60 to 70 letters (Snellen 20/40–20/64) are considered mild vision loss/near-normal vision and 40 to 60 letters (Snellen 20/64–20/160) are considered moderate visual impairment or moderate low vision. The majority of eyes enrolled in this study had an initial BCVA letter score consistent with very mild or near-normal vision. Earlier stage dry AMD patients with better vision are not capable of large magnitude gains as seen in later stage patients with worse BCVA. Subjects who were enrolled had good vision with 70.0% of eyes showing a baseline BCVA of 70 to 75 letters (20/40–20/32 Snellen), which made these improvements in BCVA more noteworthy. Stabilization of BCVA, that is, a reduction in further decline, is also of critical consideration in degenerative disease. Treatment with PBM showed a reduction in the number of eyes that lost BCVA letters. The nonstudy eye subgroup with good vision (> 75 letters) further documents the loss of BCVA over time with a 2.3 letter loss. This BCVA letter loss per year is consistent with natural history studies of earlier/intermediate dry AMD.

### Vision rehabilitation preferred practice pattern ® [^1165wK7T]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Vision Rehabilitation PPP — prevalence and demographic projections of vision loss — In 2020, 295 million people globally had moderate or severe visual impairment (defined as presenting visual acuity worse than 20/60 to 20/400) and 43.3 million had blindness (defined as presenting visual acuity worse than 20/400 or less than 10 degrees of visual field around central fixation); by 2050 it was projected that 474 million people would be living with moderate or severe vision impairment and 61 million with blindness. In the United States, 3.22 million individuals had visual impairment in 2015 (defined as visual acuity less than 20/40 in the better-seeing eye but better than 20/200 best corrected) and 1.02 million were legally blind, with estimates for 2050 of 2.01 million living with legal blindness and 6.95 million living with visual impairment; the highest numbers are predicted among non-Hispanic whites, women, and older adults, and African Americans are projected to have the highest prevalence of blindness. Visual impairment disproportionately affects the elderly, as adults over the age of 80 account for almost 70% of individuals with severe vision impairment (visual acuity 20/200 or less in the better eye) yet they represent only 7.7% of the population, and the U.S. population aged 65 and older is estimated to reach 83.7 million by 2050. Leading causes of blindness in those 50 and older include cataract, glaucoma, undercorrected refractive error, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and diabetic retinopathy; AMD burden estimates include 1.75 million adults 40 or older with AMD in 2004 and at least 1 in every 10 individuals over the age of 80 with advanced AMD. Diabetic retinopathy increased from 4.06 million to 7.69 million individuals aged 40 and older from 2000 to 2010 (an estimated 89% increase) and is anticipated to almost double by 2050 to 14.6 million, while glaucoma worldwide is estimated to increase from 76.02 million in 2020 to 111.82 million by 2040.

Table 4 and eTable in the Supplement (in meters [Snellen], Glasgow Acuity Cards notation, and logMAR) estimate VA at 15 and 30 days and 1 year compared with the actual 1-year outcomes. Vision categorization was based on the World Health Organization definitions of vision impairment. Model estimates were well calibrated to observed outcomes.

### Psychometric properties of the national eye institute-refractive error quality of life instrument [^1132XDbQ]. Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the psychometric properties of a vision-targeted measure of health-related quality of life, the National Eye Institute-Refractive Error Quality of Life survey (NEI-RQL), which includes 13 scales designed to assess the impact of refractive error and its correction on day-to-day life.

Design

Cross-sectional survey.

Participants

The NEI-RQL was self-administered by 667 myopes, 380 hyperopes, and 114 emmetropes recruited from the practices of 6 medical centers. All participants had near and distance visual acuity of 20/32 or better in the worse eye while benefiting from their current method for correction of refractive error (glasses, contact lens, refractive surgery).

Methods

Mean scores, standard deviations, internal consistency reliability, and test-retest intraclass correlations were estimated for the NEI-RQL scales. Item discrimination was assessed by item-scale correlations. Construct validity was evaluated by assessing the sensitivity of scale scores to type of refractive error, type of refractive error correction, and spherical equivalent. Construct validity of the NEI-RQL was compared to those of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) and the National Eye Institute Vision Functioning Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) in a random subsample of respondents.

Main Outcome Measures

The 13 NEI-RQL scales-clarity of vision, expectations, near vision, far vision, diurnal fluctuations, activity limitations, glare, symptoms, dependence on correction, worry, suboptimal correction, appearance, and satisfaction with correction.

Results

Emmetropes tended to score significantly better on the NEI-RQL scales than myopes and hyperopes. The method of refractive error correction was also associated with NEI-RQL scores. In addition, the NEI-RQL multi-item scales accounted for 29% of the variance in the NEI-RQL satisfaction with correction item beyond that explained by the SF-36 and the NEI VFQ-25.

Conclusion

These results support the reliability and construct validity of the NEI-RQL. The instrument appears to be useful for comparisons of people with different types of correction for refractive error.

### Simultaneous perception of prosthetic and natural vision in AMD patients [^112pUzs9]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Loss of photoreceptors in atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD) results in severe visual impairment. Since the low-resolution peripheral vision is retained in such conditions, restoration of central vision should not jeopardize the surrounding healthy retina and allow for simultaneous use of the natural and prosthetic sight. This interim report, prespecified in the study protocol, presents the first clinical results with a photovoltaic substitute of the photoreceptors providing simultaneous use of the central prosthetic and peripheral natural vision in atrophic AMD. In this open-label single group feasibility trial (NCT03333954, recruitment completed), five patients with geographic atrophy have been implanted with a wireless 2x2 mm-wide 30 µm-thick device, having 378 pixels of 100µm in size. All 5 patients achieved the primary outcome of the study by demonstrating the prosthetic visual perception in the former scotoma. The four patients with a subretinal placement of the chip demonstrated the secondary outcome: Landolt acuity of 1.17 ± 0.13 pixels, corresponding to the Snellen range of 20/460–20/565. With electronic magnification of up to a factor of 8, patients demonstrated prosthetic acuity in the range of 20/63–20/98. Under room lighting conditions, patients could simultaneously use prosthetic central vision and their remaining peripheral vision in the implanted eye and in the fellow eye.

Near visual acuity assessments in 8–13 year olds

Ten studies were included in which near visual acuity was assessed in children aged 8 years and older. Table 5 presents the design, participant characteristics, method and outcome of the included studies. Figure 5 displays the results of 6 of the included studies in which means and standard deviations were provided.

Fig. 5
Near and distance visual acuity in 8–13 year olds with normal vision. As can be seen in this Figure, there was quite some variation in outcome. This variation can be due to differences in population characteristics across studies. Note that in the Larsson study, distance letter acuity was 0.11 logMAR poorer for letters than symbols. RA = reading acuity measured with the Italian version of MNREAD chart, ETDRS = ETDRS chart, LEA = Lea symbols, J = Jaeger chart, Log = LogMAR chart (type not specified). Error bars ± 1 sem

Impact method on VA measured

In the 70's and 80's the Sheridan Gardener test was often used to measure near visual acuity in school aged children and the Snellen chart was used to measure distance visual acuity. Nowadays, the ETDRS chart, the Bailey-Lovie letter chart and LEA charts are more frequently used to assess near visual acuity in school-aged children. The ETDRS and Bailey-Lovie letter chart can be used in children that can read letters. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the method that is used to measure near visual acuity has a profound effect on the outcome. The two Larsson studies used LEA symbols to measure acuity in 10 year olds and report much better acuities than the other four studies in which letters were used to measure acuity. One study compared distance visual acuity for letters with distance visual acuity for LEA symbols and found a difference between these two methods of almost 1 logMAR line. Viewing distance was 40 cm for the majority of studies (6/8 studies where viewing distance was reported). In two studies a viewing distance of 25 cm was used.

### Association between vision impairment and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Fs9Ps]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Summary

Background

The number of individuals with vision impairment worldwide is increasing because of an ageing population. We aimed to systematically identify studies describing the association between vision impairment and mortality, and to assess the association between vision impairment and all-cause mortality.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, and Global Health database on Feb 1, 2020, for studies published in English between database inception and Feb 1, 2020. We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies that measured the association between vision impairment and all-cause mortality in people aged 40 years or older who were followed up for 1 year or more. In a protocol amendment, we also included randomised controlled trials that met the same criteria as for cohort studies, in which the association between visual impairment and mortality was independent of the study intervention. Studies that did not report age-adjusted mortality data, or that focused only on populations with specific health conditions were excluded. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. We graded the overall certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework. We did a random-effects meta-analysis to calculate pooled maximally adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality for individuals with a visual acuity of < 6/12 versus those with ≥ 6/12; < 6/18 versus those with ≥ 6/18; < 6/60 versus those with ≥ 6/18; and < 6/60 versus those with ≥ 6/60.

Findings

Our searches identified 3845 articles, of which 28 studies, representing 30 cohorts (446 088 participants) from 12 countries, were included in the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 17 studies, representing 18 cohorts (47 998 participants). There was variability in the methods used to assess and report vision impairment. Pooled HRs for all-cause mortality were 1.29 (95% CI 1.20–1.39) for visual acuity < 6/12 versus ≥ 6/12, with low heterogeneity between studies (n = 15; τ 2 = 0.01, I² = 31.46%); 1.43 (1.22–1.68) for visual acuity < 6/18 versus ≥ 6/18, with low heterogeneity between studies (n = 2; τ 2 = 0.0, I² = 0.0%); 1.89 (1.45–2.47) for visual acuity < 6/60 versus ≥ 6/18 (n = 1); and 1.02 (0.79–1.32) for visual acuity < 6/60 versus ≥ 6/60 (n = 2; τ 2 = 0.02, I² = 25.04%). Three studies received an assessment of low risk of bias across all six domains, and six studies had a high risk of bias in one or more domains. Effect sizes were greater for studies that used best-corrected visual acuity compared with those that used presenting visual acuity as the vision assessment method (p = 0.0055), but the effect sizes did not vary in terms of risk of bias, study design, or participant-level factors (ie, age). We judged the evidence to be of moderate certainty.

Interpretation

The hazard for all-cause mortality was higher in people with vision impairment compared with those that had normal vision or mild vision impairment, and the magnitude of this effect increased with more severe vision impairment. These findings have implications for promoting healthy longevity and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

Table 2
Comparison of logMAR Visual Acuity Scores

Figure 1
Scatterplot of Office versus Home Visual Acuity.

The Bland-Altman plot of study eyes (Figure 2A) showed that 91% of eyes had clinically significant agreement defined as ≤ 0.2 logMAR of difference from the mean difference. 91% of eyes also demonstrated agreement within the 95% limits of agreement (−0.31 to 0.26 logMAR). 60% of eyes had ≤ 0.1 logMAR of difference between the two methods. Examination of the Bland-Altman plots showed likely increasing variability of differences with worse vision, though there were few patients with VA worse than 20/40. The Bland-Altman plot of the fellow eyes showed similar findings (Figure 2B): 83% of eyes demonstrated clinically significant agreement (≤ 2 lines of difference from the mean difference), 89% of eyes demonstrated agreement with the 95% limits of agreement (−0.31 to 0.27 logMAR), and 69% of eyes had ≤ 1 line of difference from the mean difference.

Figure 2
Bland-Altman Plot of Office versus Home Visual Acuity.

We divided the cohort into those with "good vision" defined as vision better than or equal to 20/40 (the requirement for an unrestricted driver's license in most states)and those with vision worse than 20/40 by their office VA scores. Thirty-eight (84%) of the study eyes had "good" vision. Interestingly, there was a significant mean difference between the office and home measurements for the "good" vision group (−0.05 logMAR, SD 0.13, P = 0.01), though this was not clinically significant. For those with vision worse than 20/40, the mean difference was not significant at 0.13 logMAR (SD 0.17, P = 0.09) (Table 2).

In a univariate regression analysis, age was not correlated with the amount of difference noted between the home and office vision assessments (P = 0.67). There were also no significant effects on mean difference between the methods when we examined gender (P = 0.28), glaucoma status (P = 0.80), lens status (P = 0.37), myopia (P = 0.55) or uveitis (P = 0.57).

### Association of individual-level factors with visual outcomes in optic neuritis: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^116GQ66M]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Participant retention was 442 (97.1%) at 15 days, 433 (95.2%) at 30 days, and 410 (90.1%) at 1 year. Median VA was 20/20 (IQR, 20/16–20/38) at 15 days, 20/18 (IQR, 20/16–20/25) at 30 days, and 20/17 (IQR, 20/14–20/21) at 1 year (211 of 270 [78.1%] with 20/20 or better and 256 of 270 [94.8%] with 20/40 or better). Visual acuity was worse than 20/20 in 220 of 442 participants (49.8%) at 15 days, 173 of 433 (40.0%) at 30 days, and 113 of 410 (27.6%) at 1 year. After excluding 166 participants who received oral prednisone, 59 of 270 (21.9%) had a VA worse than 20/20 at 1 year and 14 of 270 (5.2%) had a VA worse than 20/40 at 1 year. Median CS was 13 (IQR, 10–14) at 15 days, 14 (IQR, 12–15) at 30 days, and 14 (IQR, 14–15) at 1 year. Contrast sensitivity was 12 or worse in 212 of 442 participants (48.0%) at 15 days, 159 of 433 (36.7%) at 30 days, and 68 of 410 (16.6%) at 1 year. Compared with those who attended the 1-year follow-up visit, participants who missed the 1-year follow-up visit were more likely to be nonwhite (14 of 45 [31.1%] vs 53 of 410 [12.9%]; p = 0.003), to have probable MS at baseline (7 of 44 [15.9%] vs 22 of 410 [5.4%]) rather than definite (1 of 44 [2.3%] vs 35 of 410 [8.5%]; p = 0.045), and to be younger (median age, 30.2 [IQR, 24.6–33.7] vs 31.9 [IQR, 26.4–37.5] years; p = 0.02). Plots of VA and CS at 1 year vs baseline are presented in the Figure and demonstrate the overall recovery of vision for most participants, but with a greater range of observed outcomes for those with VA of light perception or no light perception at baseline.

### Diabetic retinopathy preferred practice pattern ® [^1149L8uP]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy PPP — DRCR.net Protocol T outcomes by baseline visual acuity show that with anti-VEGF strategies, "eyes with vision 20/32 or worse due to CI-DME gained around 2 lines of vision at 2 years compared with stabilization of vision using focal treatment alone", and "A significant portion of patients in these trials (30%–46%) underwent focal laser surgery treatment". In Protocol T, "For eyes with visual acuity of 20/40 or better, the visual gains were similar between the three groups", whereas "In eyes with visual acuity of 20/50 or worse, mean visual acuity gains were 18.3, 13.3, and 16.1 letters for aflibercept, bevacizumab, ranibizumab, respectively, at 2 years, with a statistically significant difference only found between the aflibercept and bevacizumab groups". Treatment intensity declined as "In the second year, the average number of injections decreased to about half the number of the first year". Laser use was common: "Over 2 years, the percentage of eyes undergoing focal laser surgery for persistent edema was 41%, 64%, and 52% for aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab groups, respectively (all pairwise comparisons were P < 0.05)". Longer-term follow-up noted that "Two thirds of eligible study participants completed year 5", and "Between years 2 and 5, treatment was driven by clinician judgment (no specified treatment protocol)", with "Compared with follow-up at 2 years, at 5 years visual acuity remained improved compared with baseline and eyes had stable OCT thickness".

### Advising patients on visual fitness to drive: implications of revised DVLA regulations [^115oXf9Y]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Until recently, the visual acuity standard for driving a car (Group 1 license) in the UK has been 'the ability to read in good daylight (with the aid of glasses or contact lenses, if worn) a registration mark fixed to a motor vehicle and containing characters 79 mm high and 50 mm wide from 20 m' (ie, a post-September 2001 number-plate). It has previously been of interest to understand the relationship between this 'number-plate test' and visual acuity, given that the tasks are different, so as to predict from clinical visual acuity measurement who would be likely to pass and fail the driving standard.

However, in 2012, an additional standard was introduced that 'the visual acuity (with the aid of glasses or contact lenses, if worn) must be at least 6/12 (Snellen, decimal 0.5) with both eyes open, or in the only eye if monocular', in order to bring the UK into compliance with European Union (EU) directives. Given that there is now a specific acuity standard in addition to the number-plate test, and that these two standards have to be independently met, the relevant question becomes to what extent do these two standards pass and fail the same drivers? In particular, the rule change potentially means that some people who were eligible to drive will now be excluded.

No guidance has been provided by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) regarding which charts to use or how to determine drivers' vision. We therefore compare performance on several commonly used visual acuity charts with the number-plate test in order to provide clinicians with evidence on how to assess vision to give appropriate guidance to their patients on their visual fitness to drive.

### Evaluation of the visual system by the primary care provider following concussion [^111hTZC2]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Visual acuity (children) — If the child has glasses, they should be worn for acuity testing. Most children do not report 20/20 vision using standard acuity chart testing until after about 5 years of age, and visual acuity should be approximately equal between the eyes. In general, children 5 years or older who have monocular vision worse than 3 of 5 letters on the 20/30 line have abnormal results. If a distance vision chart is not available, near visual acuity testing can be accomplished using one of the standard types of near vision testing cards.

### Changes in visual acuity in a population over a 10-year period: the beaver dam eye study [^112FYtsv]. Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the change in visual acuity in a 10-year period.

Design

Population-based cohort study.

Participants

Included 3684 persons 43 to 86 years of age at the time of a baseline examination in 1988 to 1990, living in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, at a follow-up examination in 1993 to 1995 and/or 1998 to 2000.

Methods

Best-corrected visual acuity was measured, after refraction, with logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution charts using a modification of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol.

Main Outcomes Measures

Doubling of the visual angle and incidence of visual impairment.

Results

The change in the mean number of letters read correctly over the 10-year period varied in the right eye from -0.9 (standard deviation [SD] = 5.5) and in the left eye from -1.2 (SD = 6.6) in people between 43 and 54 years of age to -11.0 (SD = 20.0) in the right eye and -12.6 (SD = 20.4) in the left eye in people 75 years of age or older (n = 184) at baseline. Over the 10-year period, 5.9% of the population had impaired vision (20/40 or worse in the better eye) develop, 0.8% had severe visual impairment (20/200 or worse in the better eye) develop, 4.8% had doubling of the visual angle, and 3.9% had improved vision. People who were 75 years of age or older at baseline were 15.0 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.9–20.6; P < 0.001) as likely to have impaired vision develop, 9.3 times (95% CI, 6.5–13.3; P < 0.001) as likely to have doubling of the visual angle, and 19.8 times as likely (95% CI, 8.4–46.4; P ≤ 0.001) to have severe visual impairment develop than people younger than 75 years of age at baseline. For the 82 persons 75 years of age or older, currently residing in a nursing or group home at follow-up, they were 2.6 times (95% CI, 1.45–4.52) as likely to have impaired vision develop, 1.6 times (95% CI, 0.47–5.62) as likely to have severely impaired vision develop, and 3.6 times (95% CI, 1.96–6.78) as likely to have had a doubling of the visual angle than those not residing in a nursing or group home at follow-up.

Conclusions

These data provide precise population-based estimates of the 10-year incidence of loss of vision over a wide spectrum of ages and show that decreased visual acuity in people 75 years of age after 10 years is a common finding, especially in those who are admitted to nursing or group homes.

### Visual acuity and ophthalmic outcomes 5 years after cataract surgery among children younger than 13 years [^115hvRYG]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Cataract is an important cause of visual impairment in children. Data from a large pediatric cataract surgery registry can provide real-world estimates of visual outcomes and the 5-year cumulative incidence of adverse events.

Objective

To assess visual acuity (VA), incidence of complications and additional eye operations, and refractive error outcomes 5 years after pediatric lensectomy among children younger than 13 years.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective cohort study used data from the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group clinical research registry. From June 2012 to July 2015, 61 eye care practices in the US, Canada, and the UK enrolled children from birth to less than 13 years of age who had undergone lensectomy for any reason during the preceding 45 days. Data were collected from medical record reviews annually thereafter for 5 years until September 28, 2020.

Exposures

Lensectomy with or without implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Best-corrected VA and refractive error were measured from 4 to 6 years after the initial lensectomy. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the 5-year incidence of glaucoma or glaucoma suspect and additional eye operations. Factors were evaluated separately for unilateral and bilateral aphakia and pseudophakia.

Results

A total of 994 children (1268 eyes) undergoing bilateral or unilateral lensectomy were included (504 [51%] male; median age, 3.6 years; range, 2 weeks to 12.9 years). Five years after the initial lensectomy, the median VA among 701 eyes with available VA data (55%) was 20/63 (range, 20/40 to 20/100) in 182 of 316 bilateral aphakic eyes (58%), 20/32 (range, 20/25 to 20/50) in 209 of 386 bilateral pseudophakic eyes (54%), 20/200 (range, 20/50 to 20/618) in 124 of 202 unilateral aphakic eyes (61%), and 20/65 (range, 20/32 to 20/230) in 186 of 364 unilateral pseudophakic eyes (51%). The 5-year cumulative incidence of glaucoma or glaucoma suspect was 46% (95% CI, 28%-59%) in participants with bilateral aphakia, 7% (95% CI, 1%-12%) in those with bilateral pseudophakia, 25% (95% CI, 15%-34%) in those with unilateral aphakia, and 17% (95% CI, 5%-28%) in those with unilateral pseudophakia. The most common additional eye surgery was clearing the visual axis, with a 5-year cumulative incidence of 13% (95% CI, 8%-17%) in participants with bilateral aphakia, 33% (95% CI, 26%-39%) in those with bilateral pseudophakia, 11% (95% CI, 6%-15%) in those with unilateral aphakia, and 34% (95% CI, 28%-39%) in those with unilateral pseudophakia. The median 5-year change in spherical equivalent refractive error was -8.38 D (IQR, -11.38 D to -2.75 D) among 89 bilateral aphakic eyes, -1.63 D (IQR, -3.13 D to -0.25 D) among 130 bilateral pseudophakic eyes, -10.75 D (IQR, -20.50 D to -4.50 D) among 43 unilateral aphakic eyes, and -1.94 D (IQR, -3.25 D to -0.69 D) among 112 unilateral pseudophakic eyes.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, development of glaucoma or glaucoma suspect was common in children 5 years after lensectomy. Myopic shift was modest during the 5 years after placement of an intraocular lens, which should be factored into implant power selection. These results support frequent monitoring after pediatric cataract surgery to detect glaucoma, visual axis obscuration causing reduced vision, and refractive error.

Newcastle Control Score (NCS)

The mean NCS at enrolment was higher (worse) in the surgical group (4.98) compared to the observation (3.43), vision only (3.38) and non-surgical treatment (4.02) groups (Table 1). At follow-up the total mean NCS in the surgery group was significantly reduced, on average more than 60% in both the parental and clinic component scores. There were significant but smaller reductions in the total mean NCS at follow-up in the non-surgical treatment and observation groups reflecting an average 20% reduction in the clinical component and 13% reduction in the parental component respectively.

### Comprehensive adult eye and vision examination [^1165RxLn]. AOA (2023). High credibility.

Comprehensive adult eye and vision examination — evidence statements and benefit–harm profile: Correction of refractive errors "improves vision-specific quality of life and aids in preserving independence in activities of daily living in persons over age 65" (Evidence Grade: B), and "Persons aged 65 years and older who have regular eye examinations were found to experience less decline in vision and improved functional status" (Evidence Grade: D). In asymptomatic patients, "routine comprehensive optometric eye examinations detect a significant number of new eye conditions and/or result in management changes", with detection increasing with age and longer assessment intervals and "the odds of having a significant change" increasing "especially in older individuals" (Evidence Grade: D). The benefits–harms assessment states "Benefits significantly outweigh harms", with potential benefits of "Optimizing visual function and preventing and/or minimizing vision loss through early diagnosis, treatment and management of ocular health conditions", potential risks/harms of "Temporary discomfort and visual disturbances resulting from dilation, allergic responses to diagnostic pharmaceutical agents or other adverse effects", and potential costs noted as "Direct cost of testing". The page lists "None" for value judgments, "Moderate" for the role of patient preferences, "None" for intentional vagueness, and identifies a gap that "Research is needed to determine the optimum frequency of eye examinations in persons 65 years or older to prevent vision loss and maintain visual function and eye health".

### Finely tuned eye movements enhance visual acuity [^1179U6YK]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

We compared performance in the discrimination of 0 logMAR optotypes (the 20/20 line of the eye chart) between two conditions: normal viewing and retinal stabilization. In the former condition, when eye movements normally moved the stimulus on the retina, the contrast of the stimulus was individually adjusted so that the mean percentage of correct identification was close to a threshold of 75% (dotted line in Fig. 4 b). Performance was drastically impaired under retinal stabilization (red arrow in Fig. 4 b). On average across subjects, the proportion of correct responses fell by approximately 25% when eye movements could no longer exert their visual consequences on the retina (p = 0.003; two-tailed paired t -test).

Increasing the size of the optotypes improved performance under retinal stabilization and enabled reestablishing the same threshold level obtained in the normal, unstabilized condition (blue arrow in Fig. 4 b). On average, this happened by enlarging each optotype by approximately 0.15 ± 0.02 logMAR, a loss in the minimum angle of resolution of about 40% (p = 0.002; two-tailed paired t -test). These effects were highly consistent across subjects and statistically significant in each individual observer (p < 0.01; one-sample two-tailed permutation test). They correspond to a visual loss of approximately two lines of the Snellen chart: from the 20/20 line in the presence of normal retinal image motion to the 20/30 line in its absence.

### Finely tuned eye movements enhance visual acuity [^113FxVWs]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Humans critically rely on high visual acuity. Although fine spatial resolution is restricted to the foveola, a tiny region of the retina that covers less than 0.1% of the visual field, its loss has devastating consequences in everyday life, as experienced by subjects affected by deficits in foveal vision.

Individuals with normal or corrected-to-normal vision typically achieve a resolution of 0 logMAR — the 20/20 line of a Snellen chart — or better, which corresponds to the capability of resolving lines as thin as 1 min of arc, an astounding 1/60th of a degree (Fig. 1 a). Since this level of resolution roughly matches the filtering of the opticsand the spacing of receptors within the foveola, it is often assumed that visual acuity is primarily determined by spatial factors, i.e. the spatial rules determining how an image can be discretized with minimal loss of information by a lattice of receptors –. However, the eyes are never stationary, and neurons in the visual system are strongly selective not just for spatial patterns, but also for temporally changing stimuli. Thus, unlike a stationary camera, it is doubtful that human acuity relies on purely spatial mechanisms.

### Trends in prevalence of blindness and distance and near vision impairment over 30 years: an analysis for the global burden of disease study [^113i789c]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Summary

Background

To contribute to the WHO initiative, VISION 2020: The Right to Sight, an assessment of global vision impairment in 2020 and temporal change is needed. We aimed to extensively update estimates of global vision loss burden, presenting estimates for 2020, temporal change over three decades between 1990–2020, and forecasts for 2050.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based surveys of eye disease from January, 1980, to October, 2018. Only studies with samples representative of the population and with clearly defined visual acuity testing protocols were included. We fitted hierarchical models to estimate 2020 prevalence (with 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs]) of mild vision impairment (presenting visual acuity ≥ 6/18 and < 6/12), moderate and severe vision impairment (< 6/18 to 3/60), and blindness (< 3/60 or less than 10° visual field around central fixation); and vision impairment from uncorrected presbyopia (presenting near vision < N6 or < N8 at 40 cm where best-corrected distance visual acuity is ≥ 6/12). We forecast estimates of vision loss up to 2050.

Findings

In 2020, an estimated 43.3 million (95% UI 37.6–48.4) people were blind, of whom 23.9 million (55%; 20.8–26.8) were estimated to be female. We estimated 295 million (267–325) people to have moderate and severe vision impairment, of whom 163 million (55%; 147–179) were female; 258 million (233–285) to have mild vision impairment, of whom 142 million (55%; 128–157) were female; and 510 million (371–667) to have visual impairment from uncorrected presbyopia, of whom 280 million (55%; 205–365) were female. Globally, between 1990 and 2020, among adults aged 50 years or older, age-standardised prevalence of blindness decreased by 28.5% (–29.4 to −27.7) and prevalence of mild vision impairment decreased slightly (–0.3%, −0.8 to −0.2), whereas prevalence of moderate and severe vision impairment increased slightly (2.5%, 1.9 to 3.2; insufficient data were available to calculate this statistic for vision impairment from uncorrected presbyopia). In this period, the number of people who were blind increased by 50.6% (47.8 to 53.4) and the number with moderate and severe vision impairment increased by 91.7% (87.6 to 95.8). By 2050, we predict 61.0 million (52.9 to 69.3) people will be blind, 474 million (428 to 518) will have moderate and severe vision impairment, 360 million (322 to 400) will have mild vision impairment, and 866 million (629 to 1150) will have uncorrected presbyopia.

Interpretation

Age-adjusted prevalence of blindness has reduced over the past three decades, yet due to population growth, progress is not keeping pace with needs. We face enormous challenges in avoiding vision impairment as the global population grows and ages.

### Association between vision impairment and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116bzCcp]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Background

The number of individuals with vision impairment worldwide is increasing because of an ageing population. We aimed to systematically identify studies describing the association between vision impairment and mortality, and to assess the association between vision impairment and all-cause mortality.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, and Global Health database on Feb 1, 2020, for studies published in English between database inception and Feb 1, 2020. We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies that measured the association between vision impairment and all-cause mortality in people aged 40 years or older who were followed up for 1 year or more. In a protocol amendment, we also included randomised controlled trials that met the same criteria as for cohort studies, in which the association between visual impairment and mortality was independent of the study intervention. Studies that did not report age-adjusted mortality data, or that focused only on populations with specific health conditions were excluded. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. We graded the overall certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework. We did a random-effects meta-analysis to calculate pooled maximally adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality for individuals with a visual acuity of < 6/12 versus those with ≥ 6/12; < 6/18 versus those with ≥ 6/18; < 6/60 versus those with ≥ 6/18; and < 6/60 versus those with ≥ 6/60.

Findings

Our searches identified 3845 articles, of which 28 studies, representing 30 cohorts (446088 participants) from 12 countries, were included in the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 17 studies, representing 18 cohorts (47998 participants). There was variability in the methods used to assess and report vision impairment. Pooled HRs for all-cause mortality were 1.29 (95% CI 1.20–1.39) for visual acuity < 6/12 versus ≥ 6/12, with low heterogeneity between studies (n = 15; τ 2 = 0.01, I² = 31.46%); 1.43 (1.22–1.68) for visual acuity < 6/18 versus ≥ 6/18, with low heterogeneity between studies (n = 2; τ 2 = 0.0, I² = 0.0%); 1.89 (1.45–2.47) for visual acuity < 6/60 versus ≥ 6/18 (n = 1); and 1.02 (0.79–1.32) for visual acuity < 6/60 versus ≥ 6/60 (n = 2; τ 2 = 0.02, I² = 25.04%). Three studies received an assessment of low risk of bias across all six domains, and six studies had a high risk of bias in one or more domains. Effect sizes were greater for studies that used best-corrected visual acuity compared with those that used presenting visual acuity as the vision assessment method (p = 0.0055), but the effect sizes did not vary in terms of risk of bias, study design, or participant-level factors (ie, age). We judged the evidence to be of moderate certainty.

Interpretation

The hazard for all-cause mortality was higher in people with vision impairment compared with those that had normal vision or mild vision impairment, and the magnitude of this effect increased with more severe vision impairment. These findings have implications for promoting healthy longevity and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

### EHealth tools for the self-testing of visual acuity: a scoping review [^1128pRhn]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Presentation of results

The presentation of results varied widely. The most common (n = 13) was the Snellen fraction with the majority measured in feet (n = 9). Five of those thirteen tools simply provided information on the scoring of the chart and the user would then be required to interpret the results by following the instructions. For example, the user would be required to determine Snellen score based on which line was read (e.g. the third line would be equivalent to 20/40). The remaining 11 tools automatically provided a Snellen fraction along with an explanation (e.g. "20/100 means that when you stand 20 feet from the chart you can see what a normal person standing 100 feet away can see, 20/100 is considered moderate vision impairment").

Eighteen tools provided a visual performance score but without any further interpretation. For example, some tools provide a percentage score or visual performance categorised as low, medium or high risk. The calculation of risk score was not explained, nor what the "risk" score related to (e.g. OPSM Eye Check by OPSM; Devlyn Vision Screening by Devlyn Vision) Two tools (Vutest and SeeDrivePro by EyeLab Ltd) required a monetary payment in order to retrieve the results.

Four tools produced a simple decimal value with no further clarifications. These decimal scores may be derived from Snellen scores, however this was not detailed (Eye Tester and Eye Tester Pro by Fuso Precision; Eye Checker by Nanny_786; Eye Doctor Trainer — Vision Up by BytePioneers S.R.O.). Two tools provided a dioptre-based prescription for near vision; Nanyang optical recommended the lens strength for the user, and the test by Easee Online provided prescriptions with values relating to sphere, cylinder and vision percentage per eye.

### Screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113PDVHY]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF impaired visual acuity screening — population and definitions: This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 65 years or older in primary care without known impaired visual acuity and not seeking vision care. For this recommendation, impaired visual acuity is defined as best-corrected vision worse than 20/40, and blindness is defined as best-corrected vision less than 20/200 or a visual field of 20 degrees or less. Presbyopia arises as the eyes' lens loses flexibility around age 45 years and affects most individuals at some point in life.

### Validation of home visual acuity tests for telehealth in the COVID-19 era [^117Sjh1r]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Visual acuity (VA) is one of the most important clinical data points in ophthalmology. However, few options for validated at-home VA assessments are currently available.

Objective

To validate 3 at-home visual acuity tests in comparison with in-office visual acuity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Between July 2020 and April 2021, eligible participants with VA of 20/200 or better were recruited from 4 university-based ophthalmology clinics (comprehensive, cornea, glaucoma, and retina clinics). Participants were prospectively randomized to self-administer 2 of 3 at-home VA tests (printed chart, mobile phone app, and website) within 3 days before their standard-of-care clinic visit. Participants completed a survey assessing usability of the at-home tests. At the clinic visit, best-corrected Snellen distance acuity was measured as the reference standard.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The at-home VA test results were compared with the in-office VA test results using paired and unpaired t tests, Pearson correlation coefficients, analysis of variance, χ2 tests, and Cohen κ agreement. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of each at-home test were calculated to detect significant VA changes (≥ 0.2 logMAR) from the in-office baseline.

Results

A total of 121 participants with a mean (SD) age of 63.8 (13.0) years completed the study. The mean in-office VA was 0.11 logMAR (Snellen equivalent 20/25) with similar numbers of participants from the 4 clinics. Mean difference (logMAR) between the at-home test and in-office acuity was -0.07 (95% CI, -0.10 to -0.04) for the printed chart, -0.12 (95% CI, -0.15 to -0.09) for the mobile phone app, and -0.13 (95% CI, -0.16 to -0.10) for the website test. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the printed chart was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.62–0.79), mobile phone app was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.46–0.69), and website test was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.53–0.73).

Conclusions and Relevance

The 3 at-home VA test results (printed chart, mobile phone app, and website) appeared comparable within 1 line to in-office VA measurements. Older participants were more likely to have limited access to digital tools. Further development and validation of at-home VA testing modalities is needed with the expansion of teleophthalmology care.

### Comprehensive pediatric eye and vision examination [^115qsPtq]. AOA (2017). Medium credibility.

Visual development in infants and children — timeline and vulnerability are outlined as follows: "Development of the visual system begins prenatally and continues after birth", and "Basic visual functions develop rapidly during the first year of life". "By 6 months of age, vision has become the dominant sense and forms the basis for perceptual, cognitive, and social development; however, maturation of the visual system continues for several years". "From birth to about 6 years of age, the visual system is susceptible to vision conditions that cause either blurred visual input or abnormal binocular interaction such as interference from amblyogenic bilateral refractive error, amblyogenic anisometropia, constant unilateral strabismus, congenital cataracts, hemangioma, corneal scarring, and any other condition that obstructs vision", and "This interference can lead to amblyopia, which, if left untreated, can cause serious vision loss". Objective testing shows "the visual cortex is capable of achieving 20/20 visual acuity by 6 months of age", while subjective responses are "influenced by verbal and cognitive development".

### Advising patients on visual fitness to drive: implications of revised DVLA regulations [^116H3R8o]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

EU directivesaim to standardise the level of vision required to drive across the EU so that license holders in one member state will meet the requirements to drive in others. However, the directives are open to interpretation as to how they are applied in each member state. In the UK, the directive has been addressed by introducing an acuity standard of 6/12 in addition to the existing number-plate test rather than replacing it. Therefore, the new visual acuity standards for driving require that a Group 1 driver must be able to both achieve the pre-existing standard of reading a number-plate at 20 m and achieve a visual acuity of 6/12 in line with EU regulations.

The DVLA currently offers no guidance to clinicians on which charts to use or how to define an acuity of 6/12. Using a Snellen chart of the format used here, which has the same number of letters and similar spacing on the 6/12 line as the logMAR charts, the 6/12 cut-off best reflects the ability to pass the number-plate test when the acuity is scored as the lowest line that a subject can read in full. Using a definition of being able to read at least half the letters on the line reduces the sensitivity of the cut-off value. On the basis of this study, if a clinician has to use a Snellen chart, it is recommended that the definition of 6/12 be considered as being able to read every letter on the 6/12 line and that a 6/12 line with at least five letters is used.

Consensus-based action statement — patients who will undergo or have undergone ocular surgery or other specialty care should be counseled by their eye doctor regarding their ongoing need for periodic comprehensive eye and vision examinations; evidence quality notes that there is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation, and the benefits and harms assessment states implementation is likely to increase patient understanding of any diagnosed eye or vision problems and improve compliance with any recommended treatment, with benefits established by expert consensus opinion.

### Vision rehabilitation preferred practice pattern ® [^1167cbDF]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Vision rehabilitation trial design — waiting-list controls and comparator selection are highlighted: the use of a waiting list as control can overestimate the effect on VRQOL, since controls were aware of not receiving an intensive program of care. Almost 10 years later, LOVIT II compared the provision of low-vision devices with vision rehabilitation delivered by a therapist versus without and found smaller benefits than the previous LOVIT trial for most domains of the Veterans Affairs Low Vision Visual Functioning Questionnaire, especially for individuals with better-eye vision from 20/63 to 20/200. This clearly shows that selecting the models being compared is a critical decision in trial design, and measuring cost-effectiveness is informative, given the different intensities of interventions. Priority-setting for research will differ by setting and it will be critical to consider the social context and availability of resources, especially in low- and middle-income countries; the process of establishing priorities in different settings should include patient representatives, policymakers, and public health and health professionals, and such priorities should drive the agenda for vision rehabilitation research.

### Screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113zAYWw]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Burden of impaired visual acuity in older adults — prevalence and definitions: The number of persons 60 years or older with impaired visual acuity (defined as best corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40 but better than 20/200) was estimated at 2.91 million in 2015, and the number who are blind (defined as best corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or worse) was estimated at 760 000. Impaired visual acuity is consistently associated with decreased quality of life in older persons, including reduced ability to perform activities of daily living, work, and drive safely, as well as increased risk of falls and other unintentional injuries.

### Screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115AgULB]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Benefits of early detection and treatment — screening trials and therapies for AMD: Four randomized trials (n = 4819) in primary care–applicable settings found no difference between vision screening vs no screening, usual care, or delayed screening in visual acuity, likelihood of vision disorders, or vision-related functional impairment; refractive correction and cataract surgery are effective for refractive errors and cataracts. For wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), four randomized trials (n = 2086) showed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors proved effective in improving visual acuity–related outcomes, including visual acuity gain (≥ 15 letters or 3 lines) (RR, 2.92 [95% CI, 2.10–7.12]), less than 15 letters of visual acuity loss (RR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.22–1.75]), and vision of 20/200 or better (RR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.30–1.66]); only 1 trial (n = 716) reported better vision-related function. Three trials (n = 2738) comparing aflibercept vs ranibizumab found aflibercept was noninferior for visual acuity loss/gain and two of three trials (n = 2457) reported similar improvements in vision-related function. For dry AMD, one systematic review of 19 trials (n = 1162) plus two additional trials (n = 180) — heavily influenced by the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) (n = 3640) — found antioxidant multivitamins were associated with decreased risk of progression to late AMD (OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.58–0.90]; 3 trials; n = 2445) and more than 3 lines of visual acuity loss (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.62–0.96]; 1 trial; n = 1791); zinc was associated with decreased risk of progression to late AMD (OR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.70–0.98]; 3 trials; n = 3790) and decreased risk of less than 3 lines of visual acuity loss (RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.75–1.01]; 2 trials; n = 3791), although the latter did not reach statistical significance; other potential therapies showed no clear effects on AMD progression or visual acuity.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^111cYX5G]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Outcomes — Multiple large studies of cataract surgery, including a review of the Cochrane Library, have repeatedly demonstrated favorable outcomes from cataract surgery (I+, Good, Strong). In a 2013 European Registry of Quality Outcomes for Cataract and Refractive Surgery analysis of 368,526 surgeries, 94.3% had 20/40 or better CDVA and 61.3% had 20/20 or better CDVA, with only 1.7% having worse CDVA postoperatively. IRIS registry data reported 81.7% of 33,437 eyes having CDVA of 20/40 or better by postoperative month 1, and a large multicenter United Kingdom study showed that over 95% of eyes with no ocular comorbidity had a CDVA of 20/40 or better. Predictors of greater improvement include younger age (under 65), less comorbidity, a higher cataract symptom score, and a worse VF-14 (visual function) score, while preoperative Snellen visual acuity was found to be unrelated to improvement; a prospectively validated model also identified younger age, poorer preoperative visual function by ADVS, and absence of diabetes. Even patients with diabetes and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) show substantial improvements after cataract surgery, there is no evidence that AMD accelerates, and improvement in quality of life for those 75 and older is functionally and statistically significant. In symptomatic cataract with preoperative Snellen acuity better than or equal to 20/50, even eyes with 20/20 or better preoperative acuity had improved self-reported visual impairment; neither preoperative best corrected high-contrast Snellen distance acuity nor change in Snellen acuity predicted improvement, and the strongest preoperative indicators were glare disability at low and medium spatial frequencies and the visual function questionnaire score; thus, Snellen visual acuity in isolation does not accurately predict who will benefit from surgery.

### Refractive, visual, and subjective quality of vision outcomes for very high myopia LASIK from-10.00 to-13.50 diopters [^114LcSss]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

To evaluate laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) outcomes, subjective quality of vision (QoV) and patient satisfaction in eyes with very high myopia (VHM) above -10.00 diopters (D).

Methods

Consecutive myopic and myopic-astigmatism eyes with spherical equivalent (SEQ) ranging between -10.00 to -13.50 D underwent LASIK with the WaveLight® Allegretto Wave® Eye-Q 400Hz excimer laser. Treatment accuracy, efficacy, safety, stability, cylinder vectors, and higher-order aberrations were evaluated, together with subjective QoV and night vision disturbances (NVDs).

Results

114 eyes had a preoperative SEQ of -11.02 ± 0.81 D, with a median follow-up of 24months. A total of 72, 84, and 94% of eyes were within ± 0.50, ± 0.75 and ± 1.00 D of intended SEQ (R² = 0.71). The efficacy index was 0.93 ± 0.20, with 51 and 81% of eyes achieving 20/20 and 20/25. The astigmatism correction index was 0.95 ± 0.33. The safety index was 1.05 ± 0.12. The average myopic regression was -0.51 ± 0.38 D. Preoperative QoV scores improved significantly postoperatively (7.5 ± 0.8 vs. 9.1 ± 0.7; P < 0.001), with less NVDs (P < 0.001). Total, spherical and coma root mean square (RMS) postoperative ocular higher-order aberrations were 1.07 ± 0.34, 0.67 ± 0.25, and 0.70 ± 0.40μm.

Conclusions

Very high myopia LASIK between -10.00 to -13.50 D is safe and results in good visual outcomes, with high patient satisfaction and a significant improvement in patient-reported QoV after surgery. Appropriately selected patients within this very high myopia group can be included as LASIK candidates.

### Development of a patient-reported outcome measure to assess symptoms associated with cataract surgery and intraocular lens implants [^114QA2Js]. Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To develop a standardized patient-reported outcome measure of visual perceptions and symptoms for implanted premium and monofocal intraocular lenses (IOLs).

Design

Observational study before and after IOL implants to assess the measure and symptom experience.

Participants

Adults scheduled for binocular implantation of the same IOL type completed the survey at baseline prior to surgery (n = 716) and postoperatively (n = 554). Most respondents were female (64%), White (81%), 61 or older (89%), and had some college or more education (62%).

Methods

Administration was by web survey with mail follow-up and phone reminders.

Main Outcome Measures

Frequency, severity, and level of symptom bother in the last 7 days for 14 symptoms: (1) glare, (2) hazy vision, (3) blurry vision, (4) starbursts, (5) halos, (6) snowballs, (7) floaters, (8) double images, (9) rings and spider webs, (10) distortion, (11) light flashes with eyes closed, (12) light flashes with eyes open, (13) shimmering images, and (14) dark shadows.

Results

The median correlation among having 14 symptoms at baseline was only 0.19. Mean uncorrected binocular visual acuity improved from a preoperative value of 0.47 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR; Snellen 20/59) to a postoperative value of 0.12 (20/26) and best-corrected binocular visual acuity improved from 0.23 logMAR (20/34) preoperative to 0.05 logMAR (20/22) postoperative. The most bothersome symptoms were reduced after surgery: preoperative/postoperative glare (84%/36%), blurry vision (68%/22%), starbursts (66%/28%), hazy vision (63%/18%), snowballs (55%/17%), and halos (52%/22%). All symptoms decreased significantly (P < 0.0001) from before to after surgery except for dark crescent-shaped shadows (4%/4%). The percentage of symptoms rated as quite a bit or extremely bothersome declined from before to after surgery except for dark crescent-shaped shadows (29%/32%): blurry vision (54%/15%), snowballs (52%/14%), glare (49%/15%), and halos (46%/14%). Having monofocal IOL implants was associated with significantly more reduction in halos, starbursts, glare, and rings and spider webs, but less improvement in self-reported general vision.

Conclusions

This study provides support for the 37-item Assessment of IntraOcular Lens Implant Symptoms (AIOLIS) instrument for use to assess symptoms and general perceptions of vision in clinical studies and clinical care.

Neovascular age-related macular degeneration — comparative anti-VEGF outcomes show that ranibizumab and bevacizumab had comparable VA improvements for monthly dosing, and ranibizumab PRN had similar VA improvements compared with a fixed schedule of monthly injections; at 2 years the two drugs remained comparable in both efficacy and safety, but PRN arms did not maintain the visual gains at the end of year 1 compared with monthly arms. The CATT 5-year follow-up study reported that vision gains during the first 2 years were not maintained at 5 years, but 50% of eyes had VA of 20/40 or better; similar results were seen in the 2-year IVAN trial, and presently there does not appear to be a significant difference in efficacy between ranibizumab and bevacizumab. A 2018 meta-analysis of more than 8000 eyes comparing aflibercept 2 mg, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab concluded equivalence for BCVA between bevacizumab and ranibizumab, greater reduction in central macular thickness with ranibizumab than bevacizumab, and comparable efficacy for BCVA and central macular thickness between aflibercept and ranibizumab. Safety findings indicate that if a difference in safety between these anti-VEGF drugs exists, it is minimal (Strong recommendation), and a real-world analysis of 13,859 patients found that all three agents improved VA similarly over 1 year.

### Prevalence of visual impairment in the United States [^112feDZM]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

The prevalence of visual impairment in the US public has not been surveyed nationally in several decades.

Objective

To estimate the number of US individuals aged 12 years or older who have impaired distance vision due to uncorrected refractive error.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), using a multistage probability sampling design, included a vision evaluation in a mobile examination center. Visual acuity data were obtained from 13,265 of 14,203 participants (93.4%) who visited the mobile examination center in 1999–2002. Visual impairment was defined as presenting distance visual acuity of 20/50 or worse in the better-seeing eye. Visual impairment due to uncorrected refractive error was defined as (presenting) visual impairment that improved, aided by automated refraction results, to 20/40 or better in the better-seeing eye.

Main Outcome Measures

Presenting distance visual acuity (measured with usual corrective lenses, if any) and distance visual acuity after automated refraction.

Results

Overall, 1190 study participants had visual impairment (weighted prevalence, 6.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.0%-6.8%), and of these, 83.3% could achieve good visual acuity with correction (95% CI, 80.9%-85.8%). Extrapolating these findings to the general US population, approximately 14 million individuals aged 12 years or older have visual impairment (defined as distance visual acuity of 20/50 or worse), and of these, more than 11 million individuals could have their vision improved to 20/40 or better with refractive correction.

Conclusions

Visual impairment due to uncorrected refractive error is a common condition in the United States. Providing appropriate refractive correction to those individuals whose vision can be improved is an important public health endeavor with implications for safety and quality of life.

### The economics of vision impairment and its leading causes: a systematic review [^1173DAMk]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study design

Included studies were primarily cost of illness (84/138; 61%) or cost analysis (28/138; 20%) studies; there were 17 cost-effectiveness studies (17/138; 12%), Table 2. The age range of included participants varied widely, although studies largely focused on adults (all participants were > 15 years).

Most studies (124/138; 90%) took a prevalence-based rather than an incidence-based approach to estimating costs (Table 2). The perspective used to estimate costs was not stated in 52 studies (38%) and for analysis purposes the reviewers had to assign a study perspective. Approximately one-third (48/138; 35%) of studies reported costs using a societal perspective; and roughly equal proportions used a healthcare system (25/138; 18%) or a payer (23/138; 17%) perspective (Table 2).

Quality assessment of studies

The average quality assessment score across studies was 78% (median 80%, range 35–100%), (supplementary Tables 3 p 9 and 4 p 10–12). The quality items most often met by studies were providing a full or partly adequate description of the methods (135/138 [fully 108, partially 27]) and presenting and discussing the results suitably (136/138 [fully 106, partially 30]). The two items on which studies were weakest were reporting of sensitivity analysis (47/137 [fully 46, partially 1]) and disaggregation of costs (98/132 [fully 78, partially 20]).

### An evaluation of a community-based vision care programme for the elderly [^115MV6dt]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the proportion of the global population over 60 years old will increase from 12 to 22% between 2015 and 2050. Ageing is associated with general functional loss and impairment, including vision. Age-related vision problems and disorders, such as uncorrected refractive error, cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy, are thus expected to become more common. Poor vision affects daily living activities and quality of life and often results in negative consequences such as poor mental health, falls, and increased dependency. More people are expected to experience visual impairment in a society with an ageing population. There is urgency for healthcare and social systems to prepare for this demographic shift in the future.

From 2019 to 2050, the population of adults aged 60 years or above in Hong Kong (HK) is estimated to increase from 25 to 40%. A 2002 population-based study of 3441 elders aged 60 years or above in the Shatin district, a suburban area of HK, found that 41.3% presented with visual acuity (VA) less than 6/18 in at least one eye. This percentage of visual impairment (VI) dropped to 34.5% when a pinhole was used. In addition, 19.5% of subjects presented with VA less than 6/18 in the better eye. The main causes of VI were uncorrected refractive error, cataract and macular degeneration. Over the ensuing 20 years, public healthcare sector spending has been increasing by around 7% per annum which has ensured modern healthcare services are available to all. All these may contribute to improved access to vision care and prevention of VI. A more recent cross-sectional study conducted between 2016 and 2018 found that the prevalence of VI (i.e. VA worse than 20/60 in the better eye) among HK elderly aged 60 years or above, who were recruited from the FAMILY cohort project, was 9.5% (63/661) and 2.0% (13/661) for presenting vision and best-corrected VA respectively. Similarly, uncorrected refractive error and cataracts were the major causes of VI. However, this study has several features which make a direct comparison with the Shatin study problematic. First, the subjects recruited were aged from between 18 to 90 years. With lower participation from older subjects, this study is likely to underestimate the prevalence rate of VI in the general population. Second, the subjects were recruited from a family cohort with some coming from the same family and this raises the potential of the family clustering effect.

### Assessment of near visual acuity in 0–13 year olds with normal and low vision: a systematic review [^111E6ECk]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

In children aged 4–7 years, near visual acuity can be measured with crowded and uncrowded acuity charts. In three of the included papers uncrowded and crowded visual acuities were compared. In children aged 4 to 7 years crowding, i.e. a deterioration of object recognition due to nearby flankers, is a normal phenomenon. When interpreting differences between uncrowded and crowded acuity scores, one should be aware that crowding decreases with age in children with NV. In children with NV, the difference between uncrowded and crowded visual acuity is 1–2 logMAR lines on the visual acuity chart (this entails crowding ratios between 1.25 and 1.6). In children with NV aged 6 years and older differences between uncrowded and crowded visual acuity of ≥ 3 logMAR lines are considered to be increased. In children aged 10 or older crowding is practically absent, therefore a difference of 2 or more logMAR lines between crowded and uncrowded acuity is considered to be too large, because in adults with NV and older children ratios of 1.2 have been reported.

As can be seen in Table 4, the distance at which near visual acuity is assessed, differs considerably across studies. Data from the Boonstra study show that viewing distance does affect near visual acuity measures (Fig. 4). When children look at the chart at a self-chosen distance (which ranged from 5 to 20 cm), the acuity that is measured is ~0.15 logMAR lower than the acuity measured at 40 cm. The rationale behind the 40 cm rule is that accommodation is not expected to play a large role while at shorter distances it does. Furthermore, it is difficult for the experimental leader to monitor viewing distance accurately if a child adopts a self-chosen viewing distance. In general, poorer acuity for near than distance vision has been reported before in subjects with NV and was attributed to errors in accommodation, for example accommodation lags (under-accommodation) or accommodation leads (over-accommodation). Near visual acuity (Snellen equivalent) is calculated by dividing the measurement distance in meters by the M-value. If this distance is reduced without necessity, the outcome is very likely to be lower and not representative for NVA.
