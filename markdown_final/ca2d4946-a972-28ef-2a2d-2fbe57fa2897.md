## Question

Can stress elevate Blood pressure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether stress can elevate blood pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between acute and chronic stress and their physiological effects. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence linking stress to sustained blood pressure elevation and hypertension. Next, I will examine mechanisms, including sympathetic activation, neuroendocrine pathways, and vascular effects. After that, I should review individual variability and risk phenotypes. Finally, I will consider clinical implications and guideline positions, including the role of stress-reduction interventions, and synthesize a cautious, evidence-based conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the basic premise: stress activates the sympathetic–adrenal–medullary and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axes, producing immediate hemodynamic changes that raise heart rate and blood pressure, which is the classic fight-or-flight response. This acute pressor effect is well established and reproducible across studies and populations [^6a07e549] [^3c09f574].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of acute blood pressure responses in controlled settings. In a large neuroimaging cohort exposed to standardized stressors, mean increases of about 4.3 mmHg systolic and 1.9 mmHg diastolic were observed, with substantial interindividual variability, supporting a trait-like reactivity phenotype that generalizes beyond the laboratory [^7a43cd91] [^c1d45238]. I should also note that real-world ambulatory studies using wearable devices show stress-related systolic increases around 9–10 mmHg in high-risk patients, reinforcing clinical relevance of these acute effects in everyday life [^726a3379].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronicity. I need to check whether repeated or sustained stress exposure translates into higher resting blood pressure or incident hypertension. Prospective cohort data indicate that greater cardiovascular reactivity to acute mental stress and impaired post-stress recovery predict future hypertension and adverse cardiovascular status, with modest but consistent effect sizes across meta-analyses and longitudinal studies [^191f48ad] [^c1bdde16]. Mechanistic longitudinal work also links cortisol stress reactivity to incident hypertension, supporting a causal pathway from stress physiology to sustained blood pressure elevation [^5490f1a0].

> I will now examine the mechanisms that plausibly convert acute pressor responses into chronic blood pressure changes. Chronic stress drives sympathetic overactivity, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular remodeling, while also promoting oxidative stress and inflammation; these processes interact to sustain vascular resistance and blood pressure elevation over time [^98a72d7c] [^a695d326] [^bd967a4d]. Let me consider specific mediators: endothelin-1 release during psychosocial stress contributes to vasoconstriction, and stress-induced inflammatory markers such as IL-6 and fibrinogen predict future ambulatory blood pressure, suggesting immune–vascular pathways that amplify risk [^a410e1f9] [^49e326ec].

> But wait, what if individual differences obscure these associations? I should double-check the evidence for a stress-reactive phenotype. Exaggerated blood pressure reactivity is a stable, trait-like characteristic that predicts hypertension, atherosclerosis progression, and cardiovascular mortality independent of traditional risk factors, and central autonomic networks in the brain show multivariate patterns that predict reactivity, supporting a brain–body mechanism of vulnerability [^a7272dbc] [^7a43cd91]. Observational and interventional data also suggest that stress-related blood pressure variability in daily life is clinically meaningful and may be better captured by frequent, context-aware measurements than by isolated clinic readings [^4a7998e1] [^726a3379].

> Next, I should review whether stress-reduction interventions modify blood pressure, because that would strengthen causal inference. Randomized and meta-analytic data show that mindfulness-based stress reduction and other relaxation approaches produce modest reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, typically on the order of about 5–10 mmHg systolic and 2–5 mmHg diastolic in the short term, though heterogeneity is high and long-term durability remains uncertain [^c816af5d] [^ae3582b7]. Guidelines increasingly recommend considering stress management as an adjunct, with transcendental meditation, breathing control, and yoga supported by low- to moderate-grade evidence for blood pressure lowering, while emphasizing that effects are smaller than foundational lifestyle measures like DASH, sodium reduction, and exercise [^e1b9993f] [^05b08428] [^fc5d3eeb].

> I need to ensure I contextualize the clinical significance. Even modest blood pressure reductions can translate into meaningful cardiovascular risk reduction at the population level, and stress-related blood pressure variability and reactivity are clinically relevant because they identify patients at higher risk who may benefit from targeted behavioral strategies and closer monitoring, including ambulatory or home blood pressure assessment to unmask stress-sensitive patterns [^b30b8f21] [^4a7998e1]. Hold on, I should verify guideline positioning: contemporary guidelines list psychosocial stressors as contributors to elevated blood pressure and endorse stress management within comprehensive lifestyle therapy, while noting that evidence quality varies and that stress interventions should complement, not replace, core measures [^599de680] [^74a5cd8b].

> Let me reconsider the original question and synthesize. Yes, stress can elevate blood pressure, both acutely through sympathetic and neuroendocrine activation and, with repeated or chronic exposure, via sustained effects on vascular tone, endothelial function, and neurohormonal regulation that contribute to hypertension risk; individual susceptibility varies, and stress-reduction strategies can produce modest blood pressure benefits, though high-quality, long-term trials are still needed to confirm durability and hard outcomes [^bd967a4d] [^ae3582b7] [^c816af5d].

---

Stress can acutely and chronically elevate blood pressure through **sympathetic activation** [^98a72d7c] and **neuroendocrine responses** (catecholamines, cortisol) [^6a07e549] that increase cardiac output and vascular resistance [^ea97f9f4]. Acute stress typically causes transient rises of 10–20 mmHg, while chronic stress can sustain elevations and contribute to hypertension [^bd967a4d] [^c4b96b5e]. Individual vulnerability varies with genetics, age, and comorbidities [^48d15ff7], and stress-reduction strategies (mindfulness, meditation, breathing) can lower blood pressure by about 5–10 mmHg [^ae3582b7] [^fc5d3eeb], though long-term durability is uncertain [^36335137]. Clinically, stress is a recognized contributor to hypertension and is included in guidelines for prevention and management [^1c2d9ccb] [^e1b9993f].

## Physiological mechanisms linking stress to blood pressure elevation

Stress activates interconnected systems that acutely and chronically raise blood pressure:

- **Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation**: Acute stress triggers SNS outflow, increasing heart rate, contractility, and peripheral vasoconstriction, thereby raising blood pressure [^98a72d7c] [^6a07e549].

- **Neuroendocrine responses**: Stress increases catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) and cortisol, which enhance vascular tone, sodium retention, and fluid volume, sustaining blood pressure elevation [^6a07e549] [^ea97f9f4].

- **Endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress**: Chronic stress impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation and increases oxidative stress, promoting vascular remodeling and hypertension [^a695d326] [^c3426a49].

---

## Acute stress and blood pressure

Acute stress causes **immediate, transient blood pressure increases** of about 10–20 mmHg in systolic pressure, driven by sympathetic activation and catecholamine release [^6a07e549] [^726a3379]. These responses are typically short-lived and return to baseline after the stressor resolves, but repeated episodes can contribute to vascular injury and chronic risk [^0c964179].

---

## Chronic stress and sustained blood pressure elevation

Chronic stress is associated with **persistent blood pressure elevation** and increased hypertension risk via sustained SNS activity, HPA axis dysregulation, and stress-related behaviors (poor diet, inactivity, sleep disturbance) [^bd967a4d] [^0174ae19]. Prospective data show that greater stress reactivity and impaired recovery predict incident hypertension and cardiovascular events [^191f48ad] [^c1bdde16].

---

## Individual variability in stress-induced blood pressure responses

Blood pressure responses to stress vary with **genetics, age, sex, and comorbidities** [^48d15ff7]. Exaggerated reactivity is a stable trait linked to future hypertension and cardiovascular disease, reflecting central autonomic and vascular vulnerability [^a7272dbc] [^c1d45238].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies and meta-analyses

Multiple studies and meta-analyses support a **modest but meaningful blood pressure reduction** with stress-reduction interventions:

| **Intervention** | **Systolic bp reduction** | **Diastolic bp reduction** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mindfulness-based stress reduction | 6–11 mmHg | 2–5 mmHg | Moderate [^c816af5d] [^1b0e34bf] |
| Transcendental meditation | 4–5 mmHg | 2–3 mmHg | Moderate [^fc5d3eeb] [^32c2af63] |
| Breathing control | 5–7 mmHg | 3–5 mmHg | Moderate [^fc5d3eeb] [^32c2af63] |
| Yoga | 5–9 mmHg | 2–5 mmHg | Low-to-moderate [^fc5d3eeb] [^32c2af63] |

---

Effects are generally **short-term (≤ 3 months)** [^ae3582b7], with uncertain durability; larger, longer trials are needed [^36335137].

---

## Clinical implications and guidelines

Stress is a recognized contributor to hypertension; guidelines recommend **stress management** as part of comprehensive care [^1c2d9ccb] [^e1b9993f]. Clinicians should assess stress, educate patients on its cardiovascular impact, and offer evidence-based stress-reduction strategies alongside lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy [^0174ae19].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current research

Key limitations include **short follow-up**, small samples, and heterogeneity in interventions and outcomes [^ae3582b7]. Long-term randomized trials with hard endpoints are needed to clarify durability and clinical significance [^36335137].

---

Stress elevates blood pressure through **sympathetic and neuroendocrine mechanisms**; acute rises are transient, but chronic stress can sustain elevations and contribute to hypertension. Stress-reduction interventions yield modest, short-term blood pressure reductions and are reasonable adjuncts within guideline-based care, though long-term efficacy remains uncertain [^bd967a4d] [^ae3582b7].

### Clinical significance of stress-related increase in blood pressure: current evidence in office and out-of-office settings [^879049ec]. Hypertension Research (2018). Low credibility.

High blood pressure is the most significant risk factor of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases worldwide. Blood pressure and its variability are recognized as risk factors. Thus, hypertension control should focus not only on maintaining optimal levels but also on achieving less variability in blood pressure. Psychosocial stress is known to contribute to the development and worsening of hypertension. Stress is perceived by the brain and induces neuroendocrine responses in either a rapid or long-term manner. Moreover, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation might be further involved in the modulation of blood pressure elevation associated with stress. White-coat hypertension, defined as high clinic blood pressure but normal out-of-office blood pressure, is the most popular stress-related blood pressure response. Careful follow-up is necessary for this type of hypertensive patients because some show organ damage or a worse prognosis. On the other hand, masked hypertension, defined as high out-of-office blood pressure but normal office blood pressure, has received considerable interest as a poor prognostic condition. The cause of masked hypertension is complex, but evidence suggests that chronic stress at the workplace or home could be involved. Chronic psychological stress could be associated with distorted lifestyle and mental distress as well as long-lasting allostatic load, contributing to the maintenance of blood pressure elevation. Stress issues are common in patients in modern society. Considering psychosocial stress as the pathogenesis of blood pressure elevation is useful for achieving an individual-focused approach and 24-h blood pressure control.

### A brain phenotype for stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity [^a7272dbc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute psychological stressors evoke rapid cardiovascular reactions, including rises in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). These stressor‐evoked reactions provide presumptive hemodynamic and metabolic support for adaptive and defensive behavioral action (eg, fight‐or‐flight). 1 Individuals differ, however, in the extent to which they exhibit stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactivity. Some have a reliable tendency to exhibit large‐magnitude, or “exaggerated,” stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactions that disproportionately exceed the metabolic demands engendered by a given psychological stressor. 2, 3, 4 Compared with their less reactive counterparts, individuals exhibiting a phenotype for exaggerated stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactivity—especially BP reactivity—are at greater risk for future hypertension, an accelerated progression of preclinical atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. 5, 6, 7 Moreover, the risk conferred by stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactivity is unaccounted for by conventional risk factors for CVD. 5 Accordingly, understanding the sources of stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactivity is relevant for determining the mechanisms of stress‐related CVD risk.

### Does increased oxidative stress cause hypertension? [^49937e0d]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Hypertension is associated with increased vascular oxidative stress; however, there is still a debate whether oxidative stress is a cause or a result of hypertension. Animal studies have generally supported the hypothesis that increased blood pressure is associated with increased oxidative stress; however, human studies have been inconsistent. Oxidative stress promotes vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and hypertrophy and collagen deposition, leading to thickening of the vascular media and narrowing of the vascular lumen. In addition, increased oxidative stress may damage the endothelium and impair endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation and increases vascular contractile activity. All these effects on the vasculature may explain how increased oxidative stress can cause hypertension. Treatment with antioxidants has been suggested to lower oxidative stress and therefore blood pressure. However, to date, clinical studies investigating antioxidant supplements have failed to show any consistent benefit. It is noteworthy that lowering blood pressure with antihypertensive medications is associated with reduced oxidative stress. Therefore, it seems that oxygen stress is not the cause, but rather a consequence, of hypertension.

### Exercise blood pressure: clinical relevance and correct measurement [^aa51e38c]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) is a mandatory safety measure during graded intensity clinical exercise stress testing. While it is generally accepted that exercise hypotension is a poor prognostic sign linked to severe cardiac dysfunction, recent meta-analysis data also implicate excessive rises in submaximal exercise BP with adverse cardiovascular events and mortality, irrespective of resting BP. Although more data is needed to derive submaximal normative BP thresholds, the association of a hypertensive response to exercise with increased cardiovascular risk may be due to underlying hypertension that has gone unnoticed by conventional resting BP screening methods. Delayed BP decline during recovery is also associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Thus, above and beyond being used as a routine safety measure during stress testing, exercise (and recovery) BP may be useful for identifying high-risk individuals and also as an aid to optimise care through appropriate follow-up after exercise stress testing. Accordingly, careful attention should be paid to correct measurement of exercise stress test BP (before, during and after exercise) using a standardised approach with trained operators and validated BP monitoring equipment (manual or automated). Recommendations for exercise BP measurement based on consolidated international guidelines and expert consensus are presented in this review.

Lifestyle modification for blood pressure—narrative context: Lifestyle modification approaches are critically important strategies to slow the increase in blood pressure (BP) and delay or prevent the onset of hypertension; once patients have been diagnosed with hypertension, specific lifestyle and nonpharmacological strategies can lower BP, slow progression of BP elevation, reduce the amount of medication needed to control BP, and prevent cardiovascular (CVD) events and mortality. A Bayesian network meta-analysis assessed the comparative effectiveness of 22 lifestyle and stress-reduction strategies for BP lowering, finding the DASH eating plan ranked as the most effective intervention for BP lowering, followed in order by aerobic exercise, isometric resistance training, low-sodium/high-potassium salt interventions, and comprehensive lifestyle interventions; meditation and breathing control appeared to be the most effective stress-reduction strategies.

### Stress-induced blood pressure elevation self-measured by a wearable watch-type device [^4a7998e1]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) variation is necessary for human survival. Such variation arises from homeostatic and allostatic circulatory processes in response to changes in the body’s internal physiological status and external environmental conditions. Excessive BP variability has been described as a strong risk factor for cardiovascular events independent of the average BP values.

Psychological and physical stress are known to contribute to both acute and long-lasting BP variability. Studies conducted in laboratory settings have shown that the acute BP reactivity to emotional stress differs among individuals. A Chinese cohort study reported that a long-term psychological intervention improved the BP, health-related quality of life, and stroke prevalence of subjects.These findings suggest that for the goal of personalized hypertension management, it is necessary to determine the levels of stress-induced BP elevation in individual patients. A relationship between emotional states and BP variability measured by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) has been described,, but further investigations of BP variability in real-life contexts rather than laboratory settings will be needed to identify the “true” risk in our daily lives, which are characterized by exposure to a wide range of internal and external stresses. Because the levels and types of daily stress vary widely on different days, a single day’s BP measurement by ABPM is not sufficient to assess the true BP variability in an individual subject.

A newly developed wearable wrist-type BP monitoring (WBPM) device, the “HeartGuide,” measures absolute BP values using the oscillometric method.The HeartGuide enables wearers to self-measure their BP on a daily basis, whenever they want by setting their wrist at heart level. In our previous comparison study, we observed that the BP values measured by a WBPM in out-of-office setting were acceptable agreement with those measured by an ABPM.The primary aim of the present study was to determine whether stress-induced BP variation can be self-measured by a WBPM as accurately as by ABPM.

### Effects of stress on the development and progression of cardiovascular disease [^b2cfe7ae]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of disease burden globally, which underlies the continuing need to identify new complementary targets for prevention. Over the past 5-10 years, the pooling of multiple data sets into 'mega-studies' has accelerated progress in research on stress as a risk and prognostic factor for cardiovascular disease. Severe stressful experiences in childhood, such as physical abuse and household substance abuse, can damage health and increase the risk of multiple chronic conditions in adulthood. Compared with childhood stress and adulthood classic risk factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure, and high serum cholesterol levels, the harmful effects of stress in adulthood are generally less marked. However, adulthood stress has an important role as a disease trigger in individuals who already have a high atherosclerotic plaque burden, and as a determinant of prognosis and outcome in those with pre-existing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. In real-life settings, mechanistic studies have corroborated earlier laboratory-based observations on stress-related pathophysiological changes that underlie triggering, such as lowered arrhythmic threshold and increased sympathetic activation with related increases in blood pressure, as well as pro-inflammatory and procoagulant responses. In some clinical guidelines, stress is already acknowledged as a target for prevention for people at high overall risk of cardiovascular disease or with established cardiovascular disease. However, few scalable, evidence-based interventions are currently available.

### Sex-divergent blood pressure associations with multiorgan system metabolic stress-brief report [^7a74eb4e]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2025). Medium credibility.

Highlights

Women compared with men consistently exhibited a larger magnitude of increased systolic blood pressure per unit for all metabolic stress types.
Blood pressure increases in women were most significant in the preclinical ranges of metabolic stress markers, before overt organ-specific or systemic disease (ie, obesity, diabetes, liver fibrosis, and chronic kidney disease).
The greater vascular sensitivity to metabolic stress in women is not organ specific and may represent an early precursor to observed sex differences in cardiovascular outcomes.

Decades of clinical trial and observational study data have consistently shown that women experience greater cardiovascular disease risk than men in the setting of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. The reasons for this persistent sex disparity remain unclear. While theoretically attributable to more frequent clustering of metabolic traits in women than men, the excess risk in women is seen to persist even after adjustment for these factors. Intriguingly, recent studies have suggested the vascular response to similar doses of chronic metabolic stress may be more pronounced in females than males over the life course. Given that aggregate metabolic stress may arise from disease involving ≥1 distinct organ systems, including the liver and kidney, it is possible that associated excess vascular risk is not only sex biased but also predominantly related to a particular metabolic organ system or systemic process. To investigate this possibility, which would inform treatment approaches, we examined sex-specific systolic blood pressure (SBP) relations with graded severity of organ-specific and systemic measures of metabolic stress.

### Associations between mental health, blood pressure and the development of hypertension [^c4b96b5e]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

With regard to the development of blood pressure increases over the life course and eventually the pathophysiology of arterial HTN, our findings are consistent with the notion of feedback loops wherein arousing emotional stimuli and stressors elevate blood pressure, which in turn activates baroreceptor pathways that induce analgesia and decrease the perceived affective magnitude of a stressor. While psychosocial stress is increasingly accepted as a risk factor for the development of hypertension, blood pressure adjustments — via baroreceptor signalling — may link stress to a rewarding mechanism decreasing perceived stress. Reinforcement by repeated stress exposure may eventually lead (or contribute) to increases in blood pressure and the development of essential HTN,,–. Our data further emphasise inter-individual differences: Those individuals who later developed HTN on average showed lower mental health scores when adjusting for SBP. In addition, our moderation analysis yielded that the development of HTN was associated with a stronger negative correlation between mental health and blood pressure at baseline, years before the HTN diagnosis. While the observed inter -individual differences cannot be readily interpreted as indicative of intra -individual mechanisms, it is nevertheless tempting to speculate that people at higher risk of developing HTN require higher blood pressure levels to sustain the same mental health outcomes. These individuals may find themselves on a relatively steeper trajectory towards HTN due to the stronger mood-lifting effect of blood pressure increases. Taken together we propose that (i) feedback loops between blood pressure and rewarding emotional processing during periods of stress may play a role in the pathophysiology of blood pressure increases and HTN and that (ii) alterations of these feedback loops characterised by a shifted blood pressure - mental health relationship may increase HTN risk in affected individuals. Based on our data, we cannot differentiate between potential reasons for the altered blood pressure-mental health relationship in the mostly middle-aged participants, which may include genetics, life-style factors, such as nutrition or the environment, previous exposure to acute and chronic stress, or other factors. Clearly, there is a need for prospective longitudinal studies clarifying this issue.

### Lay perspectives on hypertension and drug adherence: systematic review of qualitative research [^0f0563bb]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Stress and symptoms

The nature of the connection between hypertension and stress has been researched extensively. Acute stress has been shown to temporarily increase blood pressure levels.Evidence from observational studies has also shown that chronic stress can be associated with a sustained rise in high blood pressure.In the medical literature, however, stress is considered in the context of other important risk factors for hypertension, both modifiable and non-modifiable: age, ethnicity, family history, obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, and alcohol and salt intake.While participants in our review widely reported avoiding stressful situations, a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of relaxation interventions for people with hypertension found that they did not substantially improve blood pressure levels, nor did the trials find good evidence of an effect on cardiovascular disease or mortality.From the medical perspective, stress plays a small part in hypertension, whereas a recurring theme in the studies presented here was that stress was by far the most important cause.

Likewise, the biomedical literature suggests that symptoms are more likely to be connected with anxiety and stress than blood pressure itself. Although people with hypertension in observational studies have been found to report symptoms, these studies also found that symptoms did not coincide with periods of raised blood pressure when measured clinically.It was also found that these symptoms were significantly more likely in anxious people. A larger study in the general population found the same association with nervousness, but also found no link with periods of high blood pressure.

Benefits and adverse effects

Side effects were a widely reported reason for self adjusting or stopping drugs. Participants in these studies described a range of adverse effects of treatment, many of which are listed in the medical literature, including leg swelling, urinary frequency, fatigue, and impotence.Other longer term fears about the drugs, such as the perception of addiction “building up” over time, or acting as sedatives, are not present in the medical literature. A fear of addiction is not exclusive to hypertension: qualitative studies have found that participants with other chronic medical problems reported identical views.Conversely, participants in several studies in this review reported seeing treatment as essential, stating they would not contemplate missing even a single day. The responses from some participants suggest they thought that treatment abolished any risk of cardiovascular disease.The benefit assumed by these participants is much greater than the small absolute reductions in risk found in clinical trials.

### Mental stress and hypertension, an evolutionary framework: some historical perspectives of the 1960 World Health Organization prague hypertension meeting [^dc861096]. Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Emotional stress acutely and repetitively causing blood pressure increase or aggravating existing hypertension is usually not reflected by norepinephrine and epinephrine increase but by a sudden rise of dopamine, the third "defensive" catecholamine coping with the damaging neuropsychological and cardiovascular actions of the first two. This double-edged sympathetic response to emotional stress evolves during human lifespan and long-term evolution of hypertension. In the course of philogenesis it carries a potential mismatch between the normal physiology of the human dopaminergic system and current environmental (emotional particularly) conditions in industrialized countries. This offers a rational support to a mental stress-cardiovascular diseases relationship proposed 40 years ago in a WHO report which followed a memorable 1960 Prague Hypertension Meeting.

### Systolic blood pressure response during exercise stress testing: the henry ford exercIse testing (FIT) project [^76d1b2aa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in those with decreased systolic blood pressure response during exercise stress testing. During exercise, systolic arterial blood pressure is expected to rise 20 mm Hg per metabolic equivalents of task as a result of increases in cardiac output.However, when exercise systolic blood pressure decreases below resting values, this often signifies underlying cardiac pathology. Patients with exercise-induced hypotension have been shown to have an increased risk of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and obstructive CAD, thus predisposing to a higher risk of cardiac events.Abnormalities in the autonomic nervous system that occur during exercise stress testing are also possibly detected in persons with decreased systolic blood pressure responses. Autonomic imbalance has been linked to the development of heart failure, and similar disturbances possibly occur in those with decreased exercise systolic blood pressure response.Although several explanations exist, further research is needed to determine the underlying mechanisms associated with the increased risk of adverse events in those with decreased systolic blood pressure response during exercise stress testing.

Currently, the American Heart Association recommends that persons with drops in systolic blood pressure >10 mm Hg below resting values terminate exercise stress testing.These recommendations have been based on studies from male populations with limited generalizability to females and minority populations.–Our results suggest that the risk for adverse outcomes occurs with modest elevations in systolic blood pressure, and this risk is not limited to decreases in systolic blood pressure below resting values. Additionally, our results were similar between men and women and also between whites and nonwhites. In aggregate, our results suggest that even those with presumably “normal” exercise blood pressure responses (eg, increases by 1 to 20 mm Hg) merit closer evaluation for underlying coronary heart disease, and this suggestion is not limited to males or specific subpopulations. Therefore, a closer examination of current recommendations regarding exercise stress testing termination and exercise systolic blood pressure response is needed.

### Pain and blood pressure: short-term physiological benefit, long-term pathological harm? [^63fe0f75]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pain is known to prompt a physiological response with an acute increase in blood pressure. A systematic review published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia demonstrates a relationship between chronic pain and hypertension. The biological mechanisms contributing to the complex relationship between chronic pain and hypertension are not yet fully understood. However, clinicians delivering chronic pain or hypertension services should proactively assess for both issues and provide a holistic approach to management.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) management—stress reduction states that in adults with or without hypertension, stress reduction through transcendental meditation may be reasonable to prevent or treat elevated BP and hypertension, as an adjunct to lifestyle or medication interventions, and that in adults with or without hypertension, other forms of stress management, such as breathing control techniques or yoga, may be reasonable to prevent or treat elevated BP and hypertension, as an adjunct to lifestyle or medication interventions.

### Effect and acceptability of mindfulness-based stress reduction program on patients with elevated blood pressure or hypertension: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^c816af5d]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR) may reduce blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension or elevated BP. However, some important parameters (such as asleep BP) have not been investigated in previous reviews, and a well-conducted meta-analysis is lacking. This meta-analysis investigates the effect and acceptability of MBSR on patients with elevated BP or hypertension. Relevant articles were searched in multiple databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and APA PsycInfo. Included studies were randomized controlled trials that involved patients with an elevated BP, had a control group, and investigated the effect of MBSR. The mean office and out-of-office (including 24-hour, daytime, and asleep) systolic BP and diastolic BP, psychological outcomes (depression/anxiety/stress), and dropout rate were compared between the MBSR arm and the control arm using a random-effects model. Quality assessment was conducted based on the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Twelve studies were included, and only one was considered having low risk of bias. MBSR decreased the office systolic BP and diastolic BP by 6.64 and 2.47 mmHg at postintervention, respectively; the reduction in diastolic BP was sustained until 3 to 6 months after the recruitment. Our meta-analyses did not find a significant reduction in out-of-office BP after MBSR. MBSR reduced depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms. The dropout rate from MBSR arm was 15% and was similar to that of control arm. The current evidence is limited by lack of high-quality and adequately powered trials with long-term follow-up. Furthermore, out-of-office BP was only reported by few trials.

### Evaluating blood pressure response patterns to exercise stress testing [^16ebf13e]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A hypertensive response to exercise unmasks hypertension and is associated with future cardiovascular events. Yet, there is heterogeneity in blood pressure response patterns to exercise by age and sex, and some high-risk trajectories may go undetected if only focusing on peak blood pressure.

Methods

We analyzed blood pressure data from 13945 patients who underwent a Bruce protocol exercise tolerance test between 2016 and 2020, including the rate of change across stages. We used latent class analysis to identify distinct blood pressure trajectories and assessed their association with individual and composite outcomes of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, revascularization, and death.

Results

Women had lower mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest (128 mmHg versus 132 mmHg; 78 mmHg versus 80 mmHg) and through stages 1 to 3 of the Bruce protocol (stage 1: 140 mmHg versus 144 mmHg; 78 mmHg versus 80 mmHg; stage 2: 153 mmHg versus 157 mmHg; 79 mmHg versus 81 mmHg; stage 3: 159 mmHg versus 167 mmHg; 80 mmHg versus 82 mmHg). Systolic blood pressure increased more slowly in women. Three distinct systolic blood pressure trajectories emerged, with steeper trajectories associated with older populations and men. Systolic Classes II and III, characterized as an elevated baseline and a gradual rise (Class II) and a steep rise (Class III) with exercise, were associated with cardiovascular outcomes. Yet, only 1.4% and 34% of patients in Class II and III, respectively, met traditional criteria for hypertensive response to exercise, suggesting missed opportunities for prevention and treatment.

Conclusions

Blood pressure response to exercise varies by sex; models incorporating trajectories of blood pressure could more fully capture individuals at higher risk for future cardiovascular events.

### Stressor-evoked brain activity, cardiovascular reactivity, and subclinical atherosclerosis in midlife adults [^0c964179]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Acute psychological stressors, defined in a stress typology framework,as short‐term demands that are appraised as taxing or exceeding one's coping resources,typically raise blood pressure (BP) and alter other parameters of cardiovascular physiology in most people.,There are wide and stable (phenotypic) differences across people, however, in the magnitude, patterning, duration, and direction of stressor‐evoked cardiovascular, particularly BP, reactions.According to several conceptual frameworks on psychological stress, BP reactions to acute stressors arise from predictive processes that are instantiated in brain systems for visceral control, which are thought to adjust cardiovascular physiology to meet the anticipated metabolic demands that are necessary to cope with acute stressors.,Notably, some people have a trait‐like phenotype to exhibit larger than average rises in BP that may exceed the metabolic demands of a stressor.When assessed by standard stressor batteries and testing paradigms, the magnitude of stressor‐evoked BP reactions generalizes from the laboratory to predict those measured in daily life via ambulatory BP monitoring.The latter evidence has been interpreted to support the possibility that a phenotype to repeatedly express large‐magnitude stressor‐evoked BP reactions over the life course may confer cardiovascular risk via their cumulative pathophysiological effects on the vasculature.

In the context of cardiovascular health, for example, epidemiological evidence demonstrates that greater stressor‐evoked BP reactivity predicts vascular pathology,and early death,consistent with the interpretation that large BP reactions to acute stressors may eventuate in vascular risk, reflected by arterial changes and dysfunction.,,,,,These pathogenic effects may result from repeated pressor influences that injure the endothelial layer of blood vessels via turbulent (nonlaminar) blood flow and shear stress.At the vascular level, such injury may increase the permeability of the endothelium to lipoproteins, promote the release of mitogenic substances, contribute to the proliferation of intimal smooth muscle cells, and disrupt the lipid metabolism of endothelial cells.The effects of a phenotype to exhibit large‐magnitude stressor‐evoked BP reactivity may thus manifest as endothelial damage and dysfunction, as well as a hypertrophy or thickening of arteries and other blood vessels.Consistent with these interpretations, exaggerated stressor‐evoked BP reactivity predicts end points of the latter pathological changes, including hypertension and a surrogate marker of preclinical vascular disease, namely, carotid artery thickening.

### Reactive oxygen species in hypertension [^a695d326]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension is a leading risk factor for stroke, heart disease and chronic kidney disease. Multiple interacting factors and organ systems increase blood pressure and cause target-organ damage. Among the many molecular elements involved in the development of hypertension are reactive oxygen species (ROS), which influence cellular processes in systems that contribute to blood pressure elevation (such as the cardiovascular, renal, immune and central nervous systems, or the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system). Dysregulated ROS production (oxidative stress) is a hallmark of hypertension in humans and experimental models. Of the many ROS-generating enzymes, NADPH oxidases are the most important in the development of hypertension. At the cellular level, ROS influence signalling pathways that define cell fate and function. Oxidative stress promotes aberrant redox signalling and cell injury, causing endothelial dysfunction, vascular damage, cardiovascular remodelling, inflammation and renal injury, which are all important in both the causes and consequences of hypertension. ROS scavengers reduce blood pressure in almost all experimental models of hypertension; however, clinical trials of antioxidants have yielded mixed results. In this Review, we highlight the latest advances in the understanding of the role and the clinical implications of ROS in hypertension. We focus on cellular sources of ROS, molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress and alterations in redox signalling in organ systems, and their contributions to hypertension.

### Acute pressor response to psychosocial stress is dependent on endothelium-derived endothelin-1 [^a410e1f9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The acute experience of psychosocial stress induces a profound physiological reaction, leading to a rapid increase in blood pressure. 1, 2, 3 Acute stress responses are thought to prepare the body for action in life‐threatening situations. 4 However, the modern human experience can repeatedly provoke the acute stress response in situations that are not necessarily life threatening, and abundant evidence now suggests that long‐term exposure to psychosocial stress over time contributes to cardiovascular disease (CVD). 5, 6 The largest study supporting this connection demonstrated that stress‐provoking psychosocial factors have an independent association with acute myocardial infarction that is similar in magnitude to traditional cardiovascular risk factors. 7 Despite this, far less is known about the mechanisms through which stress‐induced physiological processes contribute to the development of CVD.

Prior studies have identified endothelin‐1 (ET‐1) as a psychosocial stress‐responsive factor that may represent a mechanistic mediator of the connection between stress and CVD. 8 ET‐1 is a nanomolar potent peptide produced by diverse cell types throughout the body that functions in autocrine and paracrine signaling. 9, 10 Multiple studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma ET‐1 levels in response to laboratory‐induced acute psychosocial stress in healthy, at risk, and diseased human subjects. 2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 In population studies, psychosocial risk factors were associated with elevated plasma ET‐1 levels, 17, 18 and acute psychosocial stress‐induced acute coronary syndrome was associated with a robust elevation in plasma ET‐1 levels. 19 In rodents, experimental acute psychosocial stress, in the form of restraint with air jet stress, leads to an increase in plasma ET‐1 levels in both wild‐type and prehypertensive rats. 20, 21 Despite these studies, the cellular source of stress‐induced plasma ET‐1 remains unclear, because this ET‐1 could be derived from the vascular endothelium, immune cells, neuronal cells, or other potential cellular sources. Interestingly, both acute and chronic stress hormones have been shown to increase ET‐1 release in cultured endothelial cells. 22, 23, 24 Taken together, these studies demonstrate that a stress‐mediated increase in plasma ET‐1 is a consistent phenomenon that is conserved between humans and experimental animals.

Psychosocial stress and hypertension—the relationship between obesity and psychosocial stress is bidirectional; acute mental stress may increase sympathetic nervous response with increased release of catecholamines leading to increased heart rate, increased cardiac output, vasoconstriction, and increased blood pressure; in some patients, chronic stress may contribute to glucocorticoid excess with potential increases in blood pressure.

### Heightened resting neural activity predicts exaggerated stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity [^91b090d8]. Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Individuals who express relatively large-magnitude or "exaggerated" blood pressure (BP) reactions to behavioral stressors are presumably at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. As shown by recent neuroimaging studies, individuals who express exaggerated stressor-evoked BP reactivity also express heightened neural activity in corticolimbic brain areas that centrally regulate the cardiovascular system. These studies, however, have exclusively examined BP reactivity and concomitant neural activity during stressor exposure. If exaggerated BP reactivity originates in part from a centrally regulated and dispositional cardiovascular response tendency, then heightened resting (prestressor) corticolimbic activity may predict the subsequent expression of exaggerated stressor-evoked BP reactivity. To test this hypothesis, perfusion MRI was used to quantify resting regional cerebral blood flow (an indirect metabolic measure of neural activity) in men (n=19) and women (n=20) aged 20 to 37 years who subsequently performed cognitive stressor tasks to evoke BP reactivity. Individuals who expressed larger task-induced rises in systolic and diastolic BP also expressed higher resting regional cerebral blood flow in 4 functionally related corticolimbic areas: the dorsal and perigenual anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal, and insular cortices. Specifically, resting regional cerebral blood flow in these areas accounted, respectively, for 40% and 31% of the variance in systolic (P=0.001) and diastolic (P=0.008) BP reactivity, after accounting for total resting cerebral blood flow, resting BP, task performance, and task-related ratings of unpleasantness, arousal, and perceived psychological control. Heightened resting corticolimbic activity may represent a neurobiological correlate of an individual's predisposition for exaggerated stressor-evoked BP reactivity and possibly related cardiovascular risk.

Hypertension - the chronic elevation of blood pressure - is a major human health problem. In most cases, the root cause of the disease remains unknown, but there is mounting evidence that many forms of hypertension are initiated and maintained by an elevated sympathetic tone. This review examines how the sympathetic tone to cardiovascular organs is generated, and discusses how elevated sympathetic tone can contribute to hypertension.

Causes of hypertension—elevated blood pressure (BP) reflects behavioral, environmental, hormonal, and genetic influences; diet quality is significantly associated with elevated BP, with higher sodium intake, lower potassium intake and alcohol overuse predominant, and low intake of fiber, calcium, magnesium, and plant protein also influencing BP; weight gain, overweight or obesity, and insulin resistance contribute across the lifespan; sleep disturbances and psychosocial stressors can exacerbate BP while higher physical activity and fitness can ameliorate increases; environmental exposures and chemical toxins including air pollution and heavy metals are implicated; BP is a highly heritable trait, yet all genetic loci described to date explain <10% of BP variance.

### Heat stress and baroreflex regulation of blood pressure [^bdcff824]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2008). Low credibility.

In healthy, noninjured, individuals, passive (i.e., nonexercising) whole-body heating has the potential to cause significant cardiovascular stress that may be second only to the cardiovascular stress associated with exercise. For example, such a heat stress can increase heart rate to well over 100 beats min(-1) with cardiac output increasing upward to 13 L min(-1). This increase in cardiac output is necessary to maintain blood pressure due to profound reductions in total vascular conductance associated with cutaneous vasodilation. These responses are accompanied with elevations in sympathetic activity and reductions in vascular conductance (i.e., increased vascular resistance) from noncutaneous beds. While heat-stressed, blood pressure control is compromised resulting in orthostatic intolerance. A plausible explanation for such an event is that heat stress impairs baroreflex responsiveness perhaps due to the reduced range by which baroreflexes can increase heart rate, cardiac output, sympathetic activity, and vascular resistance during a hypotensive challenge. Given that dynamic exercise has the potential to cause large increases in internal temperature, possibly a component of the response to exercise, with respect to baroreflex control of blood pressure, may be affected by the thermal load during the exercise bout. Within this context, the purpose of this review was to summarize findings investigating the effects of heat stress on baroreflex regulation of blood pressure.

Lifestyle modification for hypertension prevention and control—narrative evidence emphasizes importance and comparative ranking. Lifestyle modification approaches (Table 12) are described as critically important to slow the increase in blood pressure (BP) and delay or prevent the onset of hypertension, and once hypertension is diagnosed these strategies can lower BP, slow progression, reduce medication needed, and prevent cardiovascular disease events and mortality. A Bayesian network meta-analysis assessed the comparative effectiveness of 22 lifestyle and stress-reduction strategies for BP lowering. The DASH eating plan ranked as the most effective intervention for BP lowering, followed by aerobic exercise; isometric resistance training, low-sodium/high-potassium salt interventions, and comprehensive lifestyle interventions. Meditation and breathing control appeared to be the most effective stress-reduction strategies.

### Stress-induced blood pressure elevation self-measured by a wearable watch-type device [^5eddfcf0]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

There are several possible limitations to the present study. First, the present post hoc analysis on stress-induced BP elevation used about two-thirds of all 956 paired BP readings to compare BP values in the stressful negative emotion and the positive emotion with less stress. Because the 314 paired readings were omitted from the present analysis, the results could be limited. However, the additional analysis using the dataset which exclude minimal data demonstrated the similar results to the present results. Second, we analyzed the BP measurements of ABPM and WBPM only over a 24-hour period. A previous study reported that the effects of mental stress (especially in working adults) exhibit day-by-day variability.Data from multiple days are required to detect the precise BP variability of an individual. Finally, the self-measurements by WBPM were obtained just after the ABPM measurements at 30-minute intervals, although the HeartGuide device is designed to be able to measure BP anytime. With this study protocol using a fixed time interval, the WBPM measurements might not detect the maximum stress-induced BP elevation. However, our findings demonstrated that stress-induced BP elevation could be detected even by scheduled measurements. Further studies with a self-measuring protocol under stressful conditions would more accurately detect stress-induced BP increases.

Self-measurement of BP by a new wearable watch-type device was found to detect elevated ambulatory BP levels and BP variability triggered by emotional stress and location with an accuracy comparable to that of automatic measurements by ABPM. The new WBPM device, which measures BP frequently at any location to detect abnormal BP elevations induced by multiple factors under ambulatory and daily conditions, will facilitate personalized hypertension management in the near future.

### A brain phenotype for stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity [^8288bbaf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The present findings provide new evidence for a multivariate brain pattern that predicts individual differences in stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactivity. This suggests the possibility of an identifiable brain phenotype or brain biomarker that reflects stress‐related CVD risk. This possibility agrees with recent findings demonstrating that brain activity linked to psychological stress forecasts clinical CVD events. 59 Accordingly, the present findings are relevant not only for furthering the understanding the neural bases of individual differences in cardiovascular stress physiology, but also for understanding the neural pathways that mechanistically link stressful experiences and CVD in at risk and clinical populations.

### Impaired cardiovascular recovery following stress predicts 3-year increases in blood pressure [^c1bdde16]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether variation in the rate of cardiovascular recovery following exposure to acute psychological stress predicts changes in blood pressure longitudinally, independently of blood pressure at baseline and other covariates.

Design

A 3-year longitudinal study.

Participants

A total of 209 men and women aged 45-59 years at baseline, with no history of cardiovascular disease including hypertension.

Method

Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, cardiac index and total peripheral resistance at rest, during two moderately stressful behavioural tasks and up to 45 min post-stress. Stress reactivity was defined as the difference in values between tasks and baseline, and post-stress recovery as the difference between recovery levels and baseline.

Outcome Measures

Resting blood pressure measured at baseline and 3 years later. Seven individuals had been prescribed hypertensive medication on follow-up.

Results

Increases in systolic blood pressure (SBP) were predicted by impaired post-stress recovery of SBP (P < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (P < 0.001) and total peripheral resistance (P = 0.003), independently of baseline blood pressure, age, gender, socio-economic status, hypertensive medication, body mass and smoking. The adjusted odds of an increase in SBP > or = 5 mmHg were 3.50 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 10.8] for individuals with poor compared with effective post-stress recovery of SBP. Three-year increases in diastolic pressure were predicted by impaired recovery of SBP (P < 0.001) and DBP (P = 0.009) pressure and by heart rate variability during tasks (P = 0.002), independently of covariates.

Conclusions

Impaired post-stress recovery and less consistently heightened acute stress reactivity may index disturbances in the regulation of cardiovascular stress responses that contribute to longitudinal changes in blood pressure in middle-aged men and women.

### Stress-induced blood pressure elevation self-measured by a wearable watch-type device [^f65aff22]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications of WBPM

By using the present validated WBPM device, which self-measures stress-induced BP levels as accurately as ABPM, the quality of BP control could be significantly improved in several ways. First, by collecting an increased number of ambulatory BP measurements under different ambulatory conditions, the WBPM device would increase the accuracy of hypertension diagnosis, especially for masked hypertension, as well as the accuracy of the ambulatory BP status and daily BP control status, which are essentially based on the average of BP measurements. Second, the increased number of repeated BP measurements afforded by WBPM also enables the detection of various types of ambulatory and day-by-day BP variability under different daily conditions.

There is accumulating evidence indicating that increased BP variability poses a risk of cardiovascular disease and organ damage.Some research groups have evaluated diurnal BP variability using ABPM,, and others evaluated day-by-day variability using home blood pressure monitoringto unveil the risk of BP variability in different time phases. As the cardiovascular risk of BP variability is greater in high-risk patients, the early detection of exaggerated BP variability is clinically important in such patients. Because the ability of a WBPM device to self-measure BP anytime and anywhere allows the measurement of BP at each moment under stressful conditions—which is impossible with the scheduled measurements by ABPM and home blood pressure monitoring—the use of WBPM will provide important information for the individual management of BP and BP variability in everyday life.

### A brain phenotype for stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity [^7a43cd91]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals who exhibit large-magnitude blood pressure (BP) reactions to acute psychological stressors are at risk for hypertension and premature death by cardiovascular disease. This study tested whether a multivariate pattern of stressor-evoked brain activity could reliably predict individual differences in BP reactivity, providing novel evidence for a candidate neurophysiological source of stress-related cardiovascular risk.

Methods and Results

Community-dwelling adults (N=310; 30-51 years; 153 women) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging with concurrent BP monitoring while completing a standardized battery of stressor tasks. Across individuals, the battery evoked an increase systolic and diastolic BP relative to a nonstressor baseline period (M ∆systolic BP/∆diastolic BP=4.3/1.9 mm Hg [95% confidence interval=3.7-5.0/1.4-2.3 mm Hg]). Using cross-validation and machine learning approaches, including dimensionality reduction and linear shrinkage models, a multivariate pattern of stressor-evoked functional magnetic resonance imaging activity was identified in a training subsample (N=206). This multivariate pattern reliably predicted both systolic BP ( r =0.32; P <0.005) and diastolic BP ( r =0.25; P <0.01) reactivity in an independent subsample used for testing and replication (N=104). Brain areas encompassed by the pattern that were strongly predictive included those implicated in psychological stressor processing and cardiovascular responding through autonomic pathways, including the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and insula.

Conclusions

A novel multivariate pattern of stressor-evoked brain activity may comprise a phenotype that partly accounts for individual differences in BP reactivity, a stress-related cardiovascular risk factor.

### Stress-induced increases in interleukin-6 and fibrinogen predict ambulatory blood pressure at 3-year follow-up [^49e326ec]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The biological mechanisms underlying the association between psychological stress and hypertension are poorly understood. Increased plasma concentrations of the inflammatory proteins interleukin-6 and fibrinogen are commonly reported both in hypertensive patients and in people subject to chronic psychological stress. Recent laboratory studies have also shown that acute psychological stress increases plasma interleukin-6 and fibrinogen concentrations in healthy individuals.

Objective

To investigate the relationship between stress-induced inflammatory responses and blood pressure using a longitudinal design.

Methods

Participants were 153 individuals from the Whitehall II cohort. Blood pressure, plasma interleukin-6 and fibrinogen were assessed in response to an acute laboratory stressor, and ambulatory blood pressure was monitored on a separate day. Three years later, a follow-up day of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was carried out.

Results

Individual differences in systolic pressure, fibrinogen and interleukin-6 stress responses predicted ambulatory blood pressure at the 3-year follow-up. Larger increases in ambulatory systolic pressure over the 3-year period were predicted by larger acute fibrinogen and interleukin-6 stress responses, independently of previous ambulatory blood pressure, acute blood pressure stress responses, age, sex, body mass and smoking.

Conclusion

Given the important roles of interleukin-6 and fibrinogen in hypertensive pathophysiology, these results indicate that psychological stress could promote hypertension through stimulating these inflammatory proteins.

### Greater daily psychosocial stress exposure is associated with increased norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction in young adults [^d6128118]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In response to stress, multiple cognitive, behavioral, and physiological feedback mechanisms are activated in order to protect the body from perceived threats and maintain homeostasis. However, it is now evident that a dysregulated acute stress response or chronic exposure to psychological stress can precipitate the development of both physical and mental health problems. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 In line with this, the INTERHEART study, spanning 52 countries and including ~25 000 individuals, prospectively linked chronic stress to increased cardiovascular risk, 6 an association that was independent of, and similar in magnitude to, that imposed by traditional cardiovascular risk factors (eg, aging, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, etc.). Despite this compelling epidemiological evidence, the mechanisms converting psychological stress into pathophysiological cardiovascular outcomes remain incompletely understood.

Activation of the sympathetic‐adrenal‐medullary axis is a critical component of the acute stress response. In this regard, acute psychological stress elicits large increases in plasma norepinephrine, at least in some individuals, 7, 8, 9 the downstream effects of which include activation of adrenergic receptor‐mediated signaling pathways and subsequent increases in vasoconstrictor tone. However, excessive stress‐induced increases in sympathetic activity have been proposed to mediate the link between stress and cardiovascular disease, 3, 7, 10, 11, 12 likely via the deleterious effect of excessive sympathetic outflow on the vasculature and its contribution to sustained increases in tonic blood pressure. Psychological stress causes transient impairments in vascular endothelial function, 13, 14, 15 in part, via overactivation of vasoconstrictor mechanisms. 15 Interestingly, longitudinal data suggest that heightened cardiovascular responsiveness to stress‐induced sympathetic activation is predictive of the future development of hypertension only in individuals with high amounts of daily life stress. 16 This suggests that antecedent psychological stress exposure is potentially causally related to dysregulated sympathetic control of the vasculature. Although there is some evidence supporting a link between high amounts of daily life stress and increased stress‐induced norepinephrine release, 17 to our knowledge, no studies have directly examined the influence of daily psychosocial stress on microvascular adrenergic vasoconstrictor responsiveness. Thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to assess whether common and mundane everyday psychosocial stressors modulate microvascular reactivity to direct exogenous administration of the sympathetic transmitter norepinephrine in healthy young adults. We hypothesized that increased daily psychosocial stress exposure would be positively related to increased norepinephrine‐induced vasoconstriction.

### Associations between mental health, blood pressure and the development of hypertension [^a9d67a7a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We preregistered and confirmed a conceptional replication that higher SBP related to better mood ratings: Our findings are consistent with studies reporting positive effects of elevated blood pressure on mental health, including decreased depressive symptoms –, better quality of life,, and reduced self-reported stress –. We extend these findings, which were based on either cross-sectional designs or shorter follow-up periods (1-5 years), by demonstrating that baseline SBP remained a significant predictor of mental health up to 10 years later. The positive effects of high blood pressure on mood might be related to research findings showing that higher blood pressure diminishes emotional experience in experimental manipulations –. It is also well established that elevated blood pressure robustly reduces the perception of physical pain,,,, but also social pain. It has therefore been hypothesised that elevated blood pressure relates to a generalised attenuation of emotional valence processing,. Our fMRI findings are consistent with this notion, suggesting an impact of blood pressure on the processing of (negative) emotional faces, even at a follow-up after 10 years. Importantly, while affective attenuation might relate to coping mechanisms to lift mood in stressful situations, it could reinforce staying in potentially harmful circumstances over prolonged periods of time. This may lead to further blood pressure increases and eventually to HTN (see below),,–.

### Clinical effectiveness of stress-reduction techniques in patients with hypertension: systematic review and meta-analysis [^dcdec54e]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

A systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on patient-relevant outcomes and blood pressure was conducted to assess the clinical effectiveness of stress-reduction techniques in adults with essential hypertension.

Methods

Systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified as part of a systematic search in six electronic databases ending September 2012. RCTs comparing stress-reduction techniques versus no such techniques with a follow-up of at least 24 weeks and published in English or German were included. Outcomes of interest were death, cardiovascular morbidity/mortality, end-stage renal disease, health-related quality of life, adverse events, changes in blood pressure, and changes in antihypertensive medication. When appropriate, meta-analyses were used to combine data.

Results

Seventeen RCTs analyzing different stress-reduction techniques such as biofeedback, relaxation or combined interventions were identified. Data were not reported for most of the patient-relevant outcomes, and meta-analyses could only be used to evaluate effects on blood pressure. The data indicated a blood pressure-lowering effect, but the studies had methodological shortcomings and heterogeneity between them was high. Mean group differences for DBP ranged from -10 to 1mmHg and for SBP from -12 to 10mmHg. In terms of antihypertensive medication, no favorable effects of stress-reduction techniques could be identified.

Conclusions

The available RCTs on stress-reduction techniques used for at least 24 weeks appeared to indicate a blood pressure-lowering effect in patients with essential hypertension, but this should be interpreted with caution because of major methodological limitations. A benefit of specific stress-reduction techniques in hypertensive patients remains unproven.

### Effectiveness of stress management and relaxation interventions for management of hypertension and prehypertension: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^8a0c626f]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated to affect about 30% of the adult population (aged 30-79 years) and is one of the leading attributable causes of deaths in men and women.Hypertension is known to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial disease, among other conditions.

Antihypertensive agents are commonly used to treat hypertension and are known to reduce some of the risks associated with the disease.Adherence to antihypertensive drug treatments is poor, however, with estimates of only 62-75% adherence in high income countries, and even lower estimates in low and middle income countries.Consequently, interest in alternatives to drug treatments to control blood pressure has increased. Most international guidelines now include recommendations for behavioural and lifestyle changes that can improve control of blood pressure, such as advice on stopping smoking, and recommendations on physical exercise, weight loss, and diet.High stress levels have long been considered a risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease,and there is interest in whether relaxation techniques can modify this risk. Many different relaxation techniques exist, ranging from simple, self-administered techniques (such as breathing control and mindfulness) to meditative movement practices (including yoga and tai chi), to biofeedback methods. Previous reviews have reported that some of these methods have potentially beneficial effects on blood pressure.

### Stress and cancer-NCI-national cancer institute (...) [^3c09f574]. NCI (2022). Medium credibility.

The body responds to external stressors by releasing stress hormones that increase blood pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar levels. This response, often referred to as the fight-or-flight response, helps a person act with greater strength and speed to escape a perceived threat. Although the fight-or-flight response helps the body manage momentary stress, when this response is caused by long-term, or chronic, stress it can be harmful. Research has shown that people who experience chronic stress can have digestive problems, heart disease, high blood pressure, and a weakened immune system. People who experience chronic stress are also more prone to having headaches, sleep trouble, difficulty concentrating, depression, and anxiety and to getting viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Can stress cause cancer. Although chronic stress can lead to many health problems, whether it is linked to cancer is not clear.

Studies conducted to date have had varying results. For example, .
- One case-control study among Canadian men found an association between workplace stress and the risk of prostate cancer, whereas a similar study did not find such an association.
- A prospective study among more than 100, 000 UK women reported no association between the risk of breast cancer and perceived stress levels or adverse life events in the preceding 5 years.
- A 15-year prospective study of Australian women at increased risk of familial breast cancer found no association between acute and chronic stressors, social support, optimism, or other emotional characteristics and the risk of breast cancer.
- In a 2008 meta-analysis of 142 prospective studies among people in Asia, Australasia, Europe, and America, stress was associated with a higher incidence of lung cancer.
- A 2019 meta-analysis of nine observational studies in Europe and North America also found an association between work stress and risk of lung, colorectal, and esophageal cancers.
- A meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies in Europe found no link between work stress and the risk of lung, colorectal, breast, or prostate cancers. Even when stress appears to be linked to cancer risk, the relationship could be indirect. For example, people under chronic stress may develop certain unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking, overeating, becoming less active, or drinking alcohol, that are themselves associated with increased risks of some cancers. How does stress affect people who have cancer.

### Estrogen receptor-α in the medial amygdala prevents stress-induced elevations in blood pressure in females [^ffa12f88]. Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Psychological stress contributes to the development of hypertension in humans. The ovarian hormone, estrogen, has been shown to prevent stress-induced pressor responses in females by unknown mechanisms. Here, we showed that the antihypertensive effects of estrogen during stress were blunted in female mice lacking estrogen receptor-α in the brain medial amygdala. Deletion of estrogen receptor-α in medial amygdala neurons also resulted in increased excitability of these neurons, associated with elevated ionotropic glutamate receptor expression. We further demonstrated that selective activation of medial amygdala neurons mimicked effects of stress to increase blood pressure in mice. Together, our results support a model where estrogen acts on estrogen receptor-α expressed by medial amygdala neurons to prevent stress-induced activation of these neurons, and therefore prevents pressor responses to stress.

### Effectiveness of stress management and relaxation interventions for management of hypertension and prehypertension: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^ae3582b7]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Objective

To assess whether relaxation and stress management techniques are useful in reducing blood pressure in individuals with hypertension and prehypertension.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, PsycInfo, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) from inception to 23 February 2024, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) from inception to 27 February 2024.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Studies published in English of adults with hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90mm Hg) or prehypertension (blood pressure ≥120/80mm Hg but <140/90 mm Hg). Studies that compared non-pharmacological interventions used to promote relaxation or reduce stress with each other, or with a control group (eg, no intervention, waiting list, or standard care). Where possible, network meta-analysis was used to compare the efficacy of the different interventions. Studies were assessed with the risk of bias 2 tool (RoB2), and those at high risk of bias were excluded from the primary analysis. The certainty of the evidence was assessed with CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis) and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation).

Results

182 studies were included (166 for hypertension and 16 for prehypertension). Results from a random effects network meta-analysis showed that, at short term follow-up (≤3 months), most relaxation interventions appeared to have a beneficial effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for individuals with hypertension. Between study heterogeneity was moderate (τ=2.62-4.73). Compared with a passive comparator (ie, no intervention, waiting list, or usual care), moderate reductions in systolic blood pressure were found for breathing control (mean difference -6.65 mm Hg, 95% credible interval -10.39 to -2.93), meditation (mean difference -7.71mm Hg, -14.07 to -1.29), meditative movement (including tai chi and yoga, mean difference -9.58mm Hg, -12.95 to -6.17), mindfulness (mean difference -9.90mm Hg, -16.44 to -3.53), music (mean difference -6.61mm Hg, -11.62 to -1.56), progressive muscle relaxation (mean difference -7.46mm Hg, -12.15 to -2.96), psychotherapy (mean difference -9.83mm Hg, -16.24 to -3.43), and multicomponent interventions (mean difference -6.78mm Hg, -11.59 to -1.99). Reductions were also seen in diastolic blood pressure. Few studies conducted follow-up for more than three months, but effects on blood pressure seemed to lessen over time. Limited data were available for prehypertension; only two studies compared short term follow-up of relaxation therapies with a passive comparator, and the effects on systolic blood pressure were small (mean difference -3.84mm Hg, 95% credible interval -6.25 to -1.43 for meditative movement; mean difference -0.53mm Hg, -2.03 to 0.97 for multicomponent intervention). The certainty of the evidence was considered to be very low based on the CINeMA framework, owing to the risk of bias in the primary studies, potential publication bias, and imprecision in the effect estimates.

Conclusions

The results of the study indicated that relaxation and stress management techniques might have beneficial short term effects on blood pressure for people with hypertension, but the effectiveness of these interventions is still uncertain. Future studies should ensure rigorous methods are used to minimise the risk of bias, and a longer duration of follow-up to establish whether these effects persist.

### Acute psychosocial stress modulates neural and behavioral substrates of cognitive control [^71251dba]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

4.2 Physiological effects of stress

Systolic blood pressure was significantly elevated for the stress group relative to the control group, providing physiological evidence to corroborate the increased subjective ratings of stress for the stress group. However, although participants rested for 15 min after arriving at the imaging center, cortisol levels did not increase from the baseline level sampled at T0, and the final two cortisol measurements were significantly lower than the baseline level. This suggests that anticipation of the fMRI experiment may itself have been a stressor, which may have increased cortisol levels prior to the experiment. These levels then resolved to what may be considered the true baseline (T3/T4) after the experimental task ended. Although blood pressure and subjective ratings of stress increased for the group who performed the TSST relative to the control group, the stress group did not display significantly greater cortisol levels. While it is possible that the stress of the TSST was not enough to significantly increase the participants' already elevated cortisol levels, it may be that we missed the peak of the cortisol increase, which usually occurs about 20 min after a stressor (Kirschbaum et al.). It took longer for participants to enter the scanner than anticipated, so that our T2 sample was not acquired until approximately 40 min after the stressor. These results highlight some of the limitations of using cortisol measurements in an fMRI experiment and suggest that blood pressure and subjective ratings can provide additional useful measures of stress.

### Sensitization of hypertension: the impact of earlier life challenges: excellence award for hypertension research 2021 [^4aba52b7]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects over 1 billion individuals worldwide. Because the cause of hypertension is known only in a small fraction of patients, most individuals with high blood pressure are diagnosed as having essential hypertension. Elevated sympathetic nervous system activity has been identified in a large portion of hypertensive patients. However, the root cause for this sympathetic overdrive is unknown. A more complete understanding of the breadth of the functional capabilities of the sympathetic nervous system may lead to new insights into the cause of essential hypertension. By employing a unique experimental paradigm, we have recently discovered that the neural network controlling sympathetic drive is more reactive after rats are exposed to mild challenges (stressors) and that the hypertensive response can be sensitized (ie, hypertensive response sensitization [HTRS]). We have also found that the induction of HTRS involves plasticity in the neural network controlling sympathetic drive. The induction and maintenance of the latent HTRS state also require the functional integrity of the brain renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the presence of several central inflammatory factors. In this review, we will discuss the induction and expression of HTRS in adult animals and in the progeny of mothers with prenatal obesity/overnutrition or with maternal gestational hypertension. Also, interventions that reverse the effects of stressor-induced HTRS will be reviewed. Understanding the mechanisms underlying HTRS and identifying the beneficial effects of maternal or offspring early-life interventions that prevent or reverse the sensitized state can provide insights into therapeutic strategies for interrupting the vicious cycle of transgenerational hypertension.

### Sex-divergent blood pressure associations with multiorgan system metabolic stress-brief report [^4745ba95]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In 2 large independent cohorts of ambulatory adults, we found that women compared with men consistently demonstrated a larger magnitude and an earlier onset of vascular sensitivity in the setting of metabolic disease stress of varying types, including both systemic and organ-specific sources of metabolic stress. Sex differences in the slope of SBP increase were especially pronounced in relation to increasing levels of metabolic stress within the normal range, suggesting a greater sensitivity in women during the transition from metabolic health to metabolic disease. Given that recent publications have highlighted inherently different age-related trajectories in blood pressure across genetic risk and between women and men,we adjusted for age and other cardiovascular comorbidities, finding that the pattern remained primarily consistent. In age-stratified analyses, the trends largely remained significant in the subgroup aged ≤60 years, further supporting that the differences in SBP response are pronounced in younger women compared with younger men. In our large-sized ambulatory patient cohort, sex differences in slope of SBP elevation persisted across both normal and abnormal metabolic stress measurement values suggesting that women retain a greater vascular sensitivity to systemic and organ-specific stress from the earliest through the latest stages of metabolic disease. These results are consistent with prior longitudinal studies demonstrating that women compared with men exhibit generally steeper trajectories in SBP elevation over time,particularly in the setting of greater total burden of cardiometabolic risk factors.Our analyses extend from prior work by examining potential variation in sex differential SBP elevations in relation to distinct organ-specific measures of metabolic stress. In particular, we included measures of metabolic liver and of metabolic kidney stress, given increasing recognition of their contributions to cardiovascular disease.Our results not only revealed consistency of sex-divergent SBP elevations across organ-specific measures but also parallel sex-specific excess in SBP elevations in relation to a rise in metabolic measures even within the normal range. Overall, our findings suggest that efforts to mitigate vascular disease risk in women should consider targeting a wide spectrum of metabolic stressors and that such targeting should begin early on in younger populations and well before the onset of clinically evident metabolic disease.

### Contemplative meditation reduces ambulatory blood pressure and stress-induced hypertension: a randomized pilot trial [^cd0b0658]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

A total of 52 pharmacologically untreated subjects with essential hypertension were randomly allocated to either 8 weeks of contemplative meditation combined with breathing techniques (CMBT) or no intervention in this observer-blind controlled pilot trial.

### A brain phenotype for stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity [^45fd9d79]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Acute stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactions arise from proximal changes in autonomic nervous system outflow to the heart and vasculature, typified by increases in the activity of the sympathetic limb and decreases in the parasympathetic limb of the autonomic nervous system. 8 These autonomic changes are generated and regulated by evolutionarily conserved brain areas. 9, 10, 11 Collectively, these areas are referred to as a “central autonomic network” or, more inclusively, as brain areas for visceral control. 12, 13, 14 Based on human functional neuroimaging research, animal models, and patient lesion studies, brain areas for visceral control encompass cell groups within the medial and orbital prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, hippocampus, extended amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, pons, and medulla. 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Distributed patterns of neural signaling among these brain areas regulate autonomic nervous system activity to coordinate hemodynamic function with behavior across a range of contexts and experiences, especially those that are appraised by individuals as psychologically stressful. 13 In this regard, brain areas for visceral control may provide a substrate for centrally orchestrating behavioral and stress‐related influences on CVD risk through autonomic and hemodynamic mechanisms. An expanding corpus of research supports this possibility: Patterns of functional activity within brain areas for visceral control have been related in meta‐analyses of human neuroimaging studies to stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactivity, as well as indicators of autonomic cardiovascular control and other systemic physiological markers of CVD risk. 12, 13, 18, 19 Thus, individual differences in the functionality of brain areas for visceral control may correspond to a central nervous system source of variability in stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactivity and possible vulnerability to stress‐related CVD risk.

### Associations between depressive, anxiety, stress symptoms and elevated blood pressure: findings from the CHCN-BTH cohort study and a two-sample mendelian randomization analysis [^f2ff0221]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to determine whether depressive, anxiety, stress symptoms were associated with the risk of elevated blood pressure by performing longitudinal cohort and Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses.

Methods

We used data from the Cohort Study on Chronic Disease of Community Natural Population in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (CHCN-BTH) from 2017 to 2021. The Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale was used to evaluate the depressive, anxiety, stress symptoms. The longitudinal associations between depressive, anxiety, stress symptoms and elevated blood pressure were estimated using Cox proportional regression models. Two-sample MR analysis was performed using the Inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger to explore the causal relationships between depressive, anxiety, stress symptoms and elevated blood pressure.

Results

In total, 5624 participants were included. The risk of SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg was significantly higher in participants with baseline anxiety symptoms (HR = 1.48, 95 % CI: 1.03 to 2.12, P = 0.033; HR = 1.56, 95 % CI: 1.05 to 2.32, P = 0.028), especially in men and individuals with higher educational levels, independent of baseline depression and anxiety at the two-year follow-up. The two-sample MR analysis showed positive associations between depressive, anxiety, stress symptoms and elevated blood pressure.

Limitation

Self-reported mental health symptoms, relatively shorter follow-up duration and the European-derived genome-wide association study data for MR analysis.

Conclusions

Anxiety symptoms were positively associated with elevated blood pressures in the longitudinal analysis independent of depression, stress, and other confounders. The results were verified in MR analysis, providing evidence for causal effects of anxiety symptoms on the risk of elevated blood pressure.

### A brain phenotype for stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity [^c1d45238]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Individual differences in stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactivity, particularly BP reactivity, have long been implicated in risk for CVD. 4, 45 These individual differences are stable over time (ie, they show high repeatability) and are moderately generalizable from laboratory to daily life contexts, suggesting a trait‐like phenotypic dimension of stress sensitivity and related CVD vulnerability. 41 There is now cumulative epidemiological evidence that stressor‐evoked BP reactivity relates to increased prospective risk for a range of adverse cardiovascular outcomes independently of conventional cardiovascular risk factors, albeit with associations of modest effect size. 5 To better understand the mechanisms that may contribute to individual differences in stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactivity, this epidemiological work has been extended recently to neuroimaging studies that have attempted to characterize the intermediary brain systems and circuits that may link or transduce the processing (eg, appraisal) of psychological stressors to autonomic and neuroendocrine signaling along effector pathways that regulate the cardiovascular system. These studies have identified a number of brain areas that are capable of centrally orchestrating behavioral influences on CVD risk through peripheral physiological mechanisms. 13 Among the brain areas most consistently related in previous work to stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactivity—as well as some markers of autonomic cardiovascular control, inflammation, and arterial markers of preclinical vascular disease—are areas within the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, extended amygdala, hippocampus, and hindbrain and brainstem cell groups. 1, 13, 16 It has been proposed that signaling patterns between these areas may serve to calibrate the magnitude of physiological (eg, cardiovascular) reactions to anticipated self‐relevant demands (eg, stressors) to support contextually adaptive behavioral coping processes. 13, 46, 47 Moreover, an individual's propensity to exhibit “ mis ‐calibrations” between brain and physiological activity may reflect a dimension of individual difference that underlies the expression of “exaggerated” (metabolically excessive or pathophysiological) autonomic, inflammatory, and cardiovascular reactions, including stressor‐evoked BP reactions that have been linked to preclinical CVD. 46, 47, 48 In speculation, such “mis‐calibrations” or “cardiovascular‐metabolic uncoupling” may be reflected on the individual (person) level by a stronger expression of activity within the multivariate pattern identified in the present study.

### Stress-induced blood pressure elevation self-measured by a wearable watch-type device [^726a3379]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study population consisted of outpatients with cardiovascular risk factors (98% of the subjects were hypertensive), and their SBP increase in response to emotional stress was 9.3 mm Hg when self-measured by the WBPM device and 10.7 mm Hg when automatically measured by the ABPM device. In a study of normotensive subjects, the SBP increase measured by ABPM during an angry state was 4 mm Hg.Another investigation also indicated that the effect of emotional stress on BP might be greater in individuals with labile BP.This discrepancy in results might therefore be due to the difference in the subjects’ hypertension status, concomitant risk factors, and vascular conditions.

Effects of different ambulatory conditions

The location of subjects (worksite, home, and outside home) was also significantly associated with the SBP difference, independently of emotional factors, body position, and other confounding factors. The results shown in Table 3 indicate that the SBP level could increase by approximately 12.5 mm Hg when hypertensive subjects were exposed to emotional stress at a worksite (worksite: 4.6 mm Hg; negative: 7.9 mm Hg).

In the laboratory setting, an excessive BP response to psychological stress, per se, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. A study of healthy young adults revealed that BP reactivity to psychological stress is associated with cardiovascular risk.A meta-analysis demonstrated that greater reactivity to stress is associated with future poor cardiovascular status.The Chinese cohort study mentioned earlier reported that 2 years of psychological intervention could lower BP.Stress could therefore be both an acute and a chronic risk factor for the cardiovascular state, and adequate management of stress-induced BP variability is important.

We speculated that the BP-related cardiovascular risk conferred by psychological stress might be more sensitively detected under real-world ambulatory conditions than specific laboratory conditions. In individuals who experience a greater response to psychological stress, the stress-induced elevation in BP in an ambulatory setting might be exaggerated in combination with other pressor conditions such as location, physical activity, smoking status, and air conditioning, resulting in more exaggerated BP variability under real-world daily ambulatory conditions. These personal characteristics of stress-induced BP elevation could be detected repeatedly using self-measured WBPM.

### Greater cardiovascular responses to laboratory mental stress are associated with poor subsequent cardiovascular risk status: a meta-analysis of prospective evidence [^191f48ad]. Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

An increasing number of studies has tested whether greater cardiovascular responses to acute mental stress predict future cardiovascular disease, but results have been variable. This review aimed quantitatively to evaluate the association between cardiovascular responses to laboratory mental stress and subsequent cardiovascular risk status in prospective cohort studies. We searched general bibliographic databases, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed, up to December 2009. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, quality, and estimates of associations. There were 169 associations (36 articles) of stress reactivity and 30 associations (5 articles) of poststress recovery in relation to future cardiovascular risk status, including elevated blood pressure, hypertension, left ventricular mass, subclinical atherosclerosis, and clinical cardiac events. The overall meta-analyses showed that greater reactivity to and poor recovery from stress were associated longitudinally with poor cardiovascular status (r=0.091 [95% CI: 0.050 to 0.132], P<0.001, and r=0.096 [95% CI: 0.058 to 0.134], P<0.001, respectively). These findings were supported by more conservative analyses of aggregate effects and by subgroup analyses of the methodologically strong associations. Notably, incident hypertension and increased carotid intima-media thickness were more consistently predicted by greater stress reactivity and poor stress recovery, respectively, whereas both factors were associated with higher future systolic and diastolic blood pressures. In conclusion, the current meta-analysis suggests that greater responsivity to acute mental stress has an adverse effect on future cardiovascular risk status, supporting the use of methods of managing stress responsivity in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.

### A brain phenotype for stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity [^d331b4fe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Our findings are novel insofar as we have identified a multivariate pattern across the whole brain that may identify individuals exhibiting relatively greater stress sensitivity. Moreover, the methodological approach that was used to identify the whole‐brain pattern may prove useful in other contexts to predict other dimensions of physiological stress responding and possibly clinical events. Hence, future studies may be able to identify individuals who more strongly exhibit a multivariate brain pattern that predicts clinically meaningful outcomes (eg, disease progression, new events, etc). 52 In a recent and foundational illustration of the plausibility of such a brain‐based approach to predict CVD risk, Tawakol et al 59 demonstrated that elevated levels of basal metabolic activity within the amygdala predicted future CVD events above and beyond conventional CVD risk factors. An open question is whether multivariate and network‐based approaches used in the present study would add to the predictive value of such single‐region–based approaches and complement conventional CVD risk‐prediction approaches. Moreover, it will be important to test whether adjunctive stress management interventions that are designed to protect against CVD risk 60 affect particular multivariate patterns of stress‐related brain activity (brain biomarkers) linked to physiological mediators of CVD risk, including cardiovascular reactivity. If so, this would suggest the possible utility of surrogate brain biomarkers for use (eg, monitoring, intervention refinement, etc) in novel and neurobiologically informed intervention or prevention efforts in cardiovascular behavioral medicine.

### Disentangling the links between psychosocial stress and cardiovascular disease [^549af7b5]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Stress is a pervasive component of the human experience. While often considered an adversity to be ignored, chronic stress has important pathological consequences, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Stress also increases the prevalence and severity of several CVD risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Yet even after adjustment, stress' attributable CVD risk is similar to those risk factors, suggesting it is a particularly potent contributor. Nevertheless, there has been insufficient study of mechanisms linking stress to CVD or of methods to attenuate stress' pathological impact. This review covers the current concepts of how stress impacts CVD and emerging approaches to mitigate stress-attributable CVD risk.

### Cardiovascular responsivity to stress in adolescents with and without persistently elevated blood pressure [^6fba8353]. Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to compare the cardiovascular responses to behavioural stressors of three groups of adolescents who differed in blood pressure status across assessments.

Design

Casual blood pressure of adolescents who were identified as having elevated blood pressure during a school screen was re-evaluated in the laboratory. The adolescents were classified into two groups: (i) those with consistently elevated blood pressure across school and laboratory assessments and (i) those with labile blood pressure whose blood pressure in the laboratory was below 130/80 mmHg. A comparison group of adolescents with consistently normal blood pressure was also included.

Methods

Cardiovascular parameters were assessed during rest and during two behavioural stressors, the evaluated speaking task and the mirror tracing task.

Results

Adolescents with elevated blood pressure were more vascularly responsive across stressors than adolescents with labile blood pressure, who, in turn, were more reactive than adolescents with normal blood pressure.

Conclusions

These results suggest that vascular reactivity to behavioural stressors may be useful in predicting risk of hypertension because of its sensitivity in distinguishing adolescents with consistently elevated blood pressure from those with labile blood pressure and those with normal blood pressure.

VIII. STRESS REDUCTION AND MINDFULNESS

What is known and what is new?

Psychosocial stress is associated with an increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular events. Patients with psychological distress may develop a sudden increase in BP, which may usually normalize when the distress is relieved. However, people who suffer from stress related to posttraumatic stress disorder have an increased risk of hypertension and history of poor medication adherence. Importantly, post-COVID-19 pandemic-related stress, anxiety and depression may contribute to poorer BP control in patients with hypertension. Stress is also associated with unhealthy habits such as poor diet or overeating and weight gain, heavy drinking and/or smoking and sedentary behaviours, increasing risk of hypertension and CVD.

Stress reduction can be achieved through a number of strategies, such as meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, deep breathing exercise and mindfulness. In recent years, mindfulness practices, defined as the awareness, including self-understanding, wisdom and compassion that comes from intentionally focusing on the present moment, have received interest as an alternative approach for the treatment of chronic diseases.

The mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program has been demonstrated to have a broad efficacy in improving physical and mental well being, as well as promoting office BP reduction. A recent meta-analysis encompassing 12 studies reported that MBSR lessons of at least 8 weekly sessions of MBSR and over 30 min of meditation practices daily reduced stress, mood swings and SBP and DBP by 6.6 and 2.5 mmHg, respectively, in patients with hypertension.

A systematic review also reported that 45 min of yoga every day reduced SBP by 6.5 mmHg and DBP by 2.8 mmHg after a 12-week program.

Cognitive behavioural therapy helps individuals to identify and change negative thoughts and behaviours that contribute to stress. A meta-analysis of 15 RCTs revealed a reduction in SBP (8.7 mmHg), DBP (5.8 mmHg), cholesterol levels, depressive and anxiety symptoms and improved sleep. Alternatively, other stress reduction techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, self-soothing, gratitude and acts of kindness, learning problem-solving and goal-setting techniques can reduce stress levels and are better accepted than MBSR by some patients. In addition, increasing physical activity, social connectedness and sleep hygiene (where warranted) can also be explored.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

2025 High Blood Pressure Guideline—lifestyle interventions for prevention and treatment specify that maintaining or achieving a healthy weight, following a heart-healthy eating pattern (such as DASH [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension]), reducing sodium, increasing dietary potassium, adopting a moderate physical activity program, managing stress, and reducing or eliminating alcohol intake are strongly recommended to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure and hypertension.

### Cardiovascular reactivity patterns and pathways to hypertension: a multivariate cluster analysis [^fa31411c]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Substantial evidence links exaggerated mental stress induced blood pressure reactivity to future hypertension, but the results for heart rate reactivity are less clear. For this reason multivariate cluster analysis was carried out to examine the relationship between heart rate and blood pressure reactivity patterns and hypertension in a large prospective cohort (age range 55-60 years). Four clusters emerged with statistically different systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate reactivity patterns. Cluster 1 was characterised by a relatively exaggerated blood pressure and heart rate response while the blood pressure and heart rate responses of cluster 2 were relatively modest and in line with the sample mean. Cluster 3 was characterised by blunted cardiovascular stress reactivity across all variables and cluster 4, by an exaggerated blood pressure response and modest heart rate response. Membership to cluster 4 conferred an increased risk of hypertension at 5-year follow-up (hazard ratio=2.98 (95% CI: 1.50-5.90), P<0.01) that survived adjustment for a host of potential confounding variables. These results suggest that the cardiac reactivity plays a potentially important role in the link between blood pressure reactivity and hypertension and support the use of multivariate approaches to stress psychophysiology.

### Incorporation of biomarkers into risk assessment for allocation of antihypertensive medication according to the 2017 ACC / AHA high blood pressure guideline: a pooled cohort analysis [^263cbda7]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was a novel consideration for antihypertensive medication initiation in the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure (BP) guideline. Whether biomarkers of chronic myocardial injury (high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T ≥6 ng/L] and stress (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] ≥100 pg/mL) can inform cardiovascular (CV) risk stratification and treatment decisions among adults with elevated BP and hypertension is unclear.

Methods

Participant-level data from 3 cohort studies (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Dallas Heart Study, and Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) were pooled, excluding individuals with prevalent CV disease and those taking antihypertensive medication at baseline. Participants were analyzed according to BP treatment group from the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association BP guideline and those with high BP (120 to 159/<100 mmHg) were further stratified by biomarker status. Cumulative incidence rates for CV event (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heart failure), and the corresponding 10-year number needed to treat to prevent 1 event with intensive BP lowering (to target systolic BP <120 mmHg), were estimated for BP and biomarker-based subgroups.

Results

The study included 12 987 participants (mean age, 55 years; 55% women; 21.5% with elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T; 17.7% with elevated NT-proBNP) with 825 incident CV events over 10-year follow-up. Participants with elevated BP or hypertension not recommended for antihypertensive medication with versus without either elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T or NT-proBNP had a 10-year CV incidence rate of 11.0% and 4.6%, with a 10-year number needed to treat to prevent 1 event for intensive BP lowering of 36 and 85, respectively. Among participants with stage 1 or stage 2 hypertension recommended for antihypertensive medication with BP <160/100 mmHg, those with versus without an elevated biomarker had a 10-year CV incidence rate of 15.1% and 7.9%, with a 10-year number needed to treat to prevent 1 event of 26 and 49, respectively.

Conclusions

Elevations in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T or NT-proBNP identify individuals with elevated BP or hypertension not currently recommended for antihypertensive medication who are at high risk for CV events. The presence of nonelevated biomarkers, even in the setting of stage 1 or stage 2 hypertension, was associated with lower risk. Incorporation of biomarkers into risk assessment algorithms may lead to more appropriate matching of intensive BP control with patient risk.

### Meditation and cardiovascular risk reduction: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^4eb25b04]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The mechanism(s) whereby meditation lowers blood pressure when it occurs has not been fully elucidated. 77 Possibly, the long‐term neurophysiological changes that occur with meditation 35, 36, 37, 78 may lead to autonomic nervous system–mediated changes in blood pressure. One study of 15 participants with hypertension and chronic kidney disease reported a decrease in muscle sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure during mindfulness meditation, 79 but no such long‐term data exist. The impact of stress reduction on blood pressure remains to be better defined.

Reported reductions of systolic blood pressure with meditation vary widely. The heterogeneity in results reflects the various study populations, study designs, data ascertainment protocols, study duration, baseline blood pressure, and blood pressure measurement techniques used. Limitations to clinical interpretation include high drop‐out rates, bias in data ascertainment, and lack of attention to statistical power, control participants, and methods of blood pressure measurements. 46, 80 The ability to generalize the findings is limited by the lack of reproducibility of results.

### Vascular stress signaling in hypertension [^ebd8604c]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Cells respond to stress by activating a variety of defense signaling pathways, including cell survival and cell death pathways. Although cell survival signaling helps the cell to recover from acute insults, cell death or senescence pathways induced by chronic insults can lead to unresolved pathologies. Arterial hypertension results from chronic physiological maladaptation against various stressors represented by abnormal circulating or local neurohormonal factors, mechanical stress, intracellular accumulation of toxic molecules, and dysfunctional organelles. Hypertension and aging share common mechanisms that mediate or prolong chronic cell stress, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress and accumulation of protein aggregates, oxidative stress, metabolic mitochondrial stress, DNA damage, stress-induced senescence, and proinflammatory processes. This review discusses common adaptive signaling mechanisms against these stresses including unfolded protein responses, antioxidant response element signaling, autophagy, mitophagy, and mitochondrial fission/fusion, STING (signaling effector stimulator of interferon genes)-mediated responses, and activation of pattern recognition receptors. The main molecular mechanisms by which the vasculature copes with hypertensive and aging stressors are presented and recent advancements in stress-adaptive signaling mechanisms as well as potential therapeutic targets are discussed.

### Effectiveness of stress management and relaxation interventions for management of hypertension and prehypertension: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^dbc968d8]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

The results of our systematic review and network meta-analysis indicate that relaxation or stress management techniques might result in meaningful reductions in blood pressure at up to three months of follow-up. Uncertainty exists about this effect, however, because of the risk of bias in the primary studies, the potential for publication bias in this area, and imprecision in the effect estimates, meaning that the observed changes in blood pressure might be too small to affect cardiovascular or cerebrovascular outcomes. The effect on blood pressure could also diminish over time but we have less confidence in these results because few studies conducted long term follow-up and we did not explicitly analyse the effects of treatment over time. We found that many relaxation interventions had already stopped, or their frequency had been reduced, before later follow-up assessments were undertaken. This finding might have had a considerable effect on their reported efficacy.

### Screening for hypertension in adults: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^8bd6e627]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF hypertension screening—population, definitions, and risk factors. This recommendation applies to adults 18 years or older without known hypertension. Increasing blood pressure predicts an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Generally, the threshold used to define hypertension vs normal blood pressure by various organizations ranges from 130/80 mm Hg or greater to 140/90 mm Hg or greater. Hypertension (also referred to as “sustained hypertension”) is when a person has repeatedly high blood pressure measurements over time and in various settings. Although all adults should be screened for hypertension, risk factors that increase a person’s risk for the condition include older age, Black race, family history, excess weight and obesity, lifestyle habits (lack of physical activity, stress, and tobacco use), and dietary factors (diet high in fat or sodium, diet low in potassium, or excessive alcohol intake).

### Long-term effects of stress reduction on mortality in persons > or = 55 years of age with systemic hypertension [^21391b21]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Psychosocial stress contributes to high blood pressure and subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Previous controlled studies have associated decreasing stress with the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program with lower blood pressure. The objective of the present study was to evaluate, over the long term, all-cause and cause-specific mortality in older subjects who had high blood pressure and who participated in randomized controlled trials that included the TM program and other behavioral stress-decreasing interventions. Patient data were pooled from 2 published randomized controlled trials that compared TM, other behavioral interventions, and usual therapy for high blood pressure. There were 202 subjects, including 77 whites (mean age 81 years) and 125 African-American (mean age 66 years) men and women. In these studies, average baseline blood pressure was in the prehypertensive or stage I hypertension range. Follow-up of vital status and cause of death over a maximum of 18.8 years was determined from the National Death Index. Survival analysis was used to compare intervention groups on mortality rates after adjusting for study location. Mean follow-up was 7.6 +/- 3.5 years. Compared with combined controls, the TM group showed a 23% decrease in the primary outcome of all-cause mortality after maximum follow-up (relative risk 0.77, p = 0.039). Secondary analyses showed a 30% decrease in the rate of cardiovascular mortality (relative risk 0.70, p = 0.045) and a 49% decrease in the rate of mortality due to cancer (relative risk 0.49, p = 0.16) in the TM group compared with combined controls. These results suggest that a specific stress-decreasing approach used in the prevention and control of high blood pressure, such as the TM program, may contribute to decreased mortality from all causes and cardiovascular disease in older subjects who have systemic hypertension.

### Oxidative stress and hypertension [^c3426a49]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

A link between oxidative stress and hypertension has been firmly established in multiple animal models of hypertension but remains elusive in humans. While initial studies focused on inactivation of nitric oxide by superoxide, our understanding of relevant reactive oxygen species (superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and peroxynitrite) and how they modify complex signaling pathways to promote hypertension has expanded significantly. In this review, we summarize recent advances in delineating the primary and secondary sources of reactive oxygen species (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases, uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria), the posttranslational oxidative modifications they induce on protein targets important for redox signaling, their interplay with endogenous antioxidant systems, and the role of inflammasome activation and endoplasmic reticular stress in the development of hypertension. We highlight how oxidative stress in different organ systems contributes to hypertension, describe new animal models that have clarified the importance of specific proteins, and discuss clinical studies that shed light on how these processes and pathways are altered in human hypertension. Finally, we focus on the promise of redox proteomics and systems biology to help us fully understand the relationship between ROS and hypertension and their potential for designing and evaluating novel antihypertensive therapies.

### Reactive oxygen species and vascular biology: implications in human hypertension [^2289cebb]. Hypertension Research (2011). Low credibility.

Increased vascular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS; termed oxidative stress) has been implicated in various chronic diseases, including hypertension. Oxidative stress is both a cause and a consequence of hypertension. Although oxidative injury may not be the sole etiology, it amplifies blood pressure elevation in the presence of other pro-hypertensive factors. Oxidative stress is a multisystem phenomenon in hypertension and involves the heart, kidneys, nervous system, vessels and possibly the immune system. Compelling experimental and clinical evidence indicates the importance of the vasculature in the pathophysiology of hypertension and as such much emphasis has been placed on the (patho)biology of ROS in the vascular system. A major source for cardiovascular, renal and neural ROS is a family of non-phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (Nox), including the prototypic Nox2 homolog-based NADPH oxidase, as well as other Noxes, such as Nox1 and Nox4. Nox-derived ROS is important in regulating endothelial function and vascular tone. Oxidative stress is implicated in endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, hypertrophy, apoptosis, migration, fibrosis, angiogenesis and rarefaction, important processes involved in vascular remodeling in hypertension. Despite a plethora of data implicating oxidative stress as a causative factor in experimental hypertension, findings in human hypertension are less conclusive. This review highlights the importance of ROS in vascular biology and focuses on the potential role of oxidative stress in human hypertension.

### High home blood pressure variability associates with exaggerated blood pressure response to cold stress [^e91b9045]. American Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Exaggerated sympathetic cardiovascular (CV) reactivity to stress associates with elevated risk for clinical and preclinical end points of CV disease. It would be useful to identify these individuals, preferably from feasible measurements commonly used in health care. Our study examined the association between home blood pressure (BP) variability and cardiac workload response to whole-body cold exposure.

Methods

Seventy-five men (55-65 years, 46 hypertensive) measured BP at home twice in the morning and evening for a week. We computed systolic home BP variability as SD of daily means and divided the subjects into groups demonstrating either high or low BP variability. They were exposed to whole-body cold exposure (-10 °C, wind 3 m/second, 15 minutes, winter clothes, standing). BP and heart rate were measured at 3-minute intervals during, and 15 minutes before and after the exposure. Rate-pressure product (RPP) was calculated to represent cardiac workload.

Results

Subjects with high systolic home BP variability demonstrated a greater RPP increase in cold conditions compared to those with low BP variability [mean change from baseline (95% CI): 1,850 (1,450 to 2,250) bpm × mm Hg vs. 930 (610, 1,250) bpm × mm Hg, P < 0.01]. This was related to the augmented systolic BP change [31(28, 35) mm Hg vs. 23(20, 26) mm Hg, P < 0.01]. Home BP variability correlated with cold-related RPP (rS = 0.34, P = 0.003) and systolic BP (rS = 0.38, P < 0.001) responses.

Conclusions

Moderate whole-body cold exposure increased BP and cardiac workload more among those with higher systolic home BP variability, independently of home BP level. Elevated home BP variability may indicate augmented sympathetically mediated vascular reactivity for environmental stressors.

### Acute psychosocial stress modulates neural and behavioral substrates of cognitive control [^6a07e549]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Acute stress (hereafter “stress”) stems from the perception of situations or contexts as threatening and taxing to one's adaptive capacity (Lazarus,), and is accompanied by a multilevel response comprising physiological, psychological, and behavioral dimensions. Physiologically, stress activates the body's regulatory and neuroendocrine systems, including the sympathetic–adrenal–medullary (SAM) and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axes, which have complementary and often overlapping effects (Ulrich‐Lai & Herman,). These systems and their hormonal outputs produce a coordinated physiological response that supports adaptive coping with stress and the maintenance of homeostasis. Shortly after a stressful event, increases in SAM activity induces the canonical “fight‐or‐flight” response, with effects including hypervigilance and elevations in levels of stress mediators (e.g. epinephrine and norepinephrine), heart rate, blood pressure, and peripheral vasoconstriction. Compared to the rapid, short‐lived SAM axis response, the HPA axis response is delayed and prolonged. Its primary action is the gradual release of glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol) shortly after stress exposure, reaching peak levels about 15–20 min after stress exposure (Droste et al.). In the immediate aftermath of stress, cortisol acts to restore energy reserves to promote recovery. On a longer timescale, it acts to downregulate SAM and HPA activity after the stressor has passed (Joëls et al.; Joëls & Baram,; Ulrich‐Lai & Herman,).

### Effectiveness of stress management and relaxation interventions for management of hypertension and prehypertension: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^36335137]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

We noted several shortcomings in the evidence base. Few studies included data on cardiovascular events or mortality alongside data on blood pressure. Treating hypertension is necessary because of its recognised effect on morbidity and mortality. Assessing whether relaxation interventions also have an effect on these outcomes is therefore critical. Longer term follow-up is clearly necessary to acquire sufficient data for these rarer outcomes. The duration of relaxation interventions was typically short, even for studies that had longer term follow-up. Few studies conducted follow-up for >1 year and the effect on blood pressure at these later time points was much less certain. Hypertension is a chronic condition, likely to require long term drug treatments or behavioural changes. As such, interventions that are used for a brief period, or provide only short term benefits, are unlikely to be clinically useful. Too few studies exist, however, to assess whether the beneficial effects of relaxation are maintained when the techniques are practised for longer than three months. Future studies must clearly report whether participants were still using relaxation methods at the time of the outcome assessment, with details on adherence to the relaxation schedule. These factors might strongly influence the effectiveness of the different relaxation and stress management techniques.

Stress-reduction and mindfulness interventions—blood pressure effects in adults—are summarized as follows: Transcendental meditation lowers systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) by approximately 5/2 mm Hg in patients without and with hypertension, meditation appears somewhat less effective than lifestyle interventions, breathing control interventions lower SBP/DBP by approximately 5/3 mm Hg in people with and without hypertension, and yoga of diverse types lowers blood pressure with low- to moderate-grade evidence.

### A brain phenotype for stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity [^f1604801]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

At present, however, there are several problematic features of existing human neuroimaging studies on the putative central nervous system (brain) bases of individual differences in stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactivity (eg, BP reactivity). These features not only limit our understanding of the brain mechanisms of stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactivity, but also the broader clinical and translational use of functional neuroimaging methods in stress‐related CVD research. Specifically, neuroimaging methods, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are well suited for testing whether variability in stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactivity is predicted by variability in brain activation to psychological stressors. Precisely determining this “brain‐body” or “brain‐physiology” relationship, however, requires moving beyond standard neuroimaging analysis approaches. First and foremost, typical fMRI analysis approaches test the degree to which a location in the brain (eg, a voxel) is active, given that a particular feature variable is present (eg, the likelihood of a voxel changing in activity given the presence of a stressor). 20 This approach, however, suffers from 2 critical problems: First, the analysis is typically implemented on a voxel‐by‐voxel basis, resulting in a massive multiple statistical testing problem when applied to all voxels in the brain. Second, in the context of predicting a given response (eg, BP reactivity) from brain activity, the direction of the statistical problem needs to be reversed: Hence, the analysis must determine the likelihood of a response variable, such as BP reactivity, given a collection of voxel activity patterns distributed across the brain. Critically, this reversal dramatically increases the dimensionality of the problem, because the number of voxels measured in the brain (ie, predictor variables) is much larger than the typical number of participants in most fMRI studies. Another limitation of conventional fMRI analytics is that they rarely test the predictive utility of a given model on an independent test sample. This undermines the ability to determine whether an observed brain‐physiology association will generalize to different groups of people, which, in turn, constrains inferences about reliability, generalizability, and the magnitude of effect sizes across contexts. 21, 22 Overcoming these limitations in conventional fMRI analysis with multivariate and cross‐validation methods, however, allows for identifying generalizable “brain phenotypes” for stressor‐evoked BP reactivity that could be broadly applied and tested in future translational research on at‐risk individuals and clinical patient samples.

### A brain phenotype for stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity [^775d2878]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

We note that we used a standardized psychological stressor battery that was modeled after batteries used in epidemiological studies of stress‐related CVD risk. 7 This stressor‐battery controls for individual differences in task engagement and motor responding through performance titration procedures. We have also found, in previous work, that cardiovascular and behavioral responding to tasks of this battery is reliable across neuroimaging and laboratory‐based testing contexts. 31 Accordingly, it may be appropriate for developing stress reactivity norms across a variety of populations. However, although the task may entail core dimensions of stressful experiences, including time pressure, loss of control, negative feedback, uncertainty, and conflict, it may lack direct correspondence to daily life stressors of personal or social relevance. Accordingly, future work in this area should use a range of stressors to test whether the brain pattern identified here is sensitive to diverse stressors or predicts other (eg, neuroendocrine) parameters of stress physiology across stressor contexts. In addition, clinical cardiovascular events (eg, arrhythmia, ischemia) are also common under conditions of acute psychological stress, 61, 62 and future work should determine whether the brain pattern identified here could, in part, account for the expression of clinical events through autonomic pathways.

We appreciate that the current sample consisted of an otherwise healthy group of midlife individuals who were mostly white, not on medications that could affect the cardiovascular system, and without a history of clinical CVD or other chronic illnesses, possibly limiting generalizability. In this regard, an important direction will be to determine whether the brain pattern identified here also predicts aspects of stress reactivity in diverse clinical and demographic samples across a range of contexts. We further appreciate that stress‐related psychiatric disorders are highly comorbid with CVD and confer risk for future CVD events. 63 Thus, it may be possible to test whether individuals with these disorders more strongly exhibit the stress‐related brain pattern identified here or whether an entirely different brain phenotype among these individuals accounts for some of the comorbidity between such psychiatric and cardiovascular outcomes. Finally, we note that there was appreciable variance in stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactivity that was unaccounted for by the multivariate brain pattern, and there was a decline in the accuracy of the pattern to predict increasingly greater levels of stressor‐evoked cardiovascular reactivity. These observations underscore the need for model refinement in future work. Moreover, it will be important for future studies to simultaneously account for other possible sources of individual differences in cardiovascular reactivity, including genetic influences and individual differences in peripheral receptor sensitivity to autonomic and neuroendocrine outflow to the heart and vasculature. 2

### Stress, psychiatric disease, and obesity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^4919bdb0]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Acute stress and potential endocrine responses—acute mental stress involves catecholamine-driven sympathetic activation and is associated with cardiopulmonary and metabolic changes. Increased short-term sympathomimetic activity (catecholamines such as norepinephrine and epinephrine) corresponds with acute cardiopulmonary responses including increased blood pressure, vasoconstriction, increased heart rate and contractility, bronchial dilation, impaired blood flow to kidney, adverse acute cardiac events, and increased respiratory rate, and with acute metabolic responses including increased glucose levels, increased insulin resistance, increased hepatic glycogenolysis, increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, and increased adipose tissue lipolysis; acute psychosocial stress can increase the risk of acute cardiovascular complications, acute stress can contribute to increased blood sugar and increased respiratory rate resulting in dyspnea, and while acute stress typically decreases hunger, those under chronic mental stress may engage in emotional eating when encountering acute mental stress.

### Beneficial and harmful effects of exercise in hypertensive patients: the role of oxidative stress [^1d7d16da]. Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

Oxidative stress has been implicated in the development and progression of hypertension. This review presents a comprehensive summary of original investigations focused on exercise-induced oxidative stress in hypertensive individuals. Single bouts of exercise can induce an acute state of oxidative stress. Chronic low-to-moderate exercise training improves the antioxidative defense and reduces the disease severity. However, the data that are currently available on the chronic intensive interval training-induced modification of the redox state in hypertensive patients are insufficient to draw adequate conclusions.

### Baroreflex activation therapy in hypertension [^8cf412ad]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

The sympathetic nervous system is an effective homeostatic mechanism for modulating hemodynamics in times of stress and illness. Unfortunately, in some patients, this mechanism escapes physiologic control and through various mechanisms leads to resistant hypertension. Antihypertensive drug therapy is successful only to a point, leaving a significant percentage of patients nationwide with blood pressure measurements above guidelines despite being treated with at least three agents at maximally tolerated doses, consistent with a diagnosis of resistant hypertension. Novel methods of modifying the activity of the sympathetic nervous system have been studied in animals, and this review discusses the data in support of one of the techniques at the forefront of non-pharmacologic blood pressure therapy.

### Association between high perceived stress over time and incident hypertension in black adults: findings from the Jackson heart study [^2a9f25da]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Psychosocial stress is thought to be implicated in the development of hypertension. 1 Blacks experience greater exposure to specific chronic stressors, such as discrimination and low socioeconomic status, and report higher overall stress levels compared with whites. 2, 3, 4, 5 However, strong evidence of a prospective association between stress and hypertension in blacks has been elusive. 1, 6, 7, 8 For example, a previous analysis of the JHS (Jackson Heart Study), a community‐based cohort of blacks, found no association between multiple measures of stress and incident hypertension. 6 Other large cohort studies have failed to demonstrate effects of perceived discrimination and job stress on incident hypertension among blacks. 7, 8 Whether these findings suggest that effects of stress on hypertension differ in this population or reflect methodological limitations (eg, assessment of stress) is unknown. Chronic stressors often cluster, and the specific source(s) of stress may be less important than overall perceived stress level. 2, 9, 10 Furthermore, most earlier studies have examined the association of stress assessed at a single occasion with incident hypertension, even though exposure to stressful events and circumstances can change over time. High levels of chronic stress over time are more likely than transient stress to contribute to sustained behavioral and physiological changes that increase hypertension risk. 11, 12 It is also possible that there are sex differences in the effects of chronic stress on hypertension. In a previous cross‐sectional study of the JHS, higher stress was associated with a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity in women, but not in men. 13 Several prospective studies have also demonstrated stronger effects of stress on blood pressure (BP) and incident hypertension among women. 14, 15, 16

Given the disproportionately high burden of hypertension in blacks, 17, 18 determining whether chronic stress increases the risk of hypertension onset in this population is an important question that could inform nonpharmacological prevention strategies. 19 We tested the association between chronic stress and incident hypertension using annual assessments of perceived stress over up to 13 years in the JHS, a community‐based cohort of blacks. We hypothesized that higher perceived stress over time (ie, chronic stress) would be associated with increased risk of incident hypertension, independent of baseline level of perceived stress. Moreover, given past evidence of sex differences in the experience and effects of stress, 1, 14, 15, 16, 20 we conducted secondary analyses to explore whether the association between chronic stress and incident hypertension was stronger in women than in men.

### Effect of adapted mindfulness training in participants with elevated office blood pressure: the MB-BP study: a randomized clinical trial [^ca6a8d00]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Mindfulness involves the self‐regulation of attention so that it is maintained on immediate experience and adopting a particular orientation towards one's experiences in the present moment, characterized by curiosity, openness, and acceptance.Mindfulness also involves remembering to bring one's wisdom into the present moment.Wisdom in the context of elevated BP can include knowledge that evidence‐based practices, such as physical activity, diet, limited alcohol consumption, and antihypertensive medication adherence, can improve well‐being. Evidence is emerging about the impact of mindfulness‐based programs on BP control. For example, in a systematic review and meta‐analysis of 8 studies, SBP was reduced by 6.6 (95% CI, −11.7 to −1.5) mm Hg in participants who received a mindfulness‐based program compared with control at immediate postintervention.However, prior studies were limited by typically having small sample sizes, modest generalizability, and short‐term follow‐up.Furthermore, prior trials tested mindfulness‐based programs that were not adapted to patients with high BP.We hypothesized that a mindfulness‐based program that was adapted to direct the mindfulness skills of attention control, self‐awareness, and emotion regulation to patients' relationship with diet, physical activity, alcohol consumption, stress reactivity, and antihypertensive medication adherence would result in clinically significant reductions in BP compared with enhanced usual care. The theoretical framework is described elsewhere,and shown in Figure S1. We also hypothesized that the adapted mindfulness training would result in improved health behaviors that are relevant to BP control, such as physical activity, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern, alcohol consumption, and antihypertensive medication use.

### Cortisol responses to mental stress and incident hypertension in healthy men and women [^5490f1a0]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Heightened cardiovascular responses to mental stressors are associated with future risk of hypertension. The role of cortisol, a key stress hormone produced by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, remains unclear.

Objective

Our objective was to examine the association between cortisol responses to laboratory-induced mental stress and incident hypertension.

Design and Setting

This was a prospective substudy of the Whitehall II cohort with 3 years follow-up of an occupational cohort.

Participants

Participants included 479 initially healthy men and women (mean age, 62.7 ± 5.6 yr), without history or objective signs of cardiovascular disease or hypertension at study entry.

Intervention

At the baseline assessment, salivary cortisol was measured in response to mental stressors, consisting of a 5-min Stroop task and a 5-min mirror tracing task.

Main Outcome Measures

Blood pressure was measured at study entry and at 3 yr follow-up for the determination of hypertension.

Results

There was considerable variation in the cortisol stress response, with approximately 40% of the sample responding to the stress tasks with an increase in cortisol of at least 1 mmol/liter. Over the 3 yr follow-up, 15.9% of the sample developed hypertension. There was an association between cortisol stress reactivity (per sd) and incident hypertension (odds ratio = 1.59; 95% confidence interval = 1.17-2.17) after adjustments for age, sex, resting cortisol, blood pressure at study entry, employment grade, smoking, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin, use of statins, and blood lipids.

Conclusion

These data support the notion that cortisol reactivity, an index of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function, is one of the possible mechanisms through which psychosocial stress may influence the risk of hypertension.

### Effect of adapted mindfulness training in participants with elevated office blood pressure: the MB-BP study: a randomized clinical trial [^b30b8f21]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this largest RCT to date comparing an adapted mindfulness training intervention (MB‐BP) with an enhanced usual care control for individuals with elevated office BP, we found that MB‐BP was associated with a 5.9 (95% CI, −8.7 to −2.0) mm Hg reduction in BP from baseline to 6 months and outperformed the enhanced usual care control group by 4.5 (95% CI, −9.0 to −0.1) mm Hg in prespecified unadjusted analyses, and 4.3 (95% CI, −8.7 to 0.1) mm Hg in post hoc analyses adjusted for baseline randomization strata (ie, sex and hypertension status). Given that a recent meta‐analysis of 344 716 participants showed that a 5‐mm Hg reduction in SBP translated into a 10% lowering of major cardiovascular events in RCTs, these findings are clinically relevant.

Exploratory mechanistic analyses showed that the MB‐BP intervention resulted in a substantial improvement in mindfulness compared with control (P <0.001). Plausible mechanisms with evidence that they were impacted by MB‐BP were sedentary activity (P =0.02), DASH diet (P =0.08), and perceived stress (P =0.05), recognizing a larger sample size may be needed for fully powered investigations on mechanisms that have small‐to‐medium effects. It is important to recognize that participants were not selected on these health behaviors, and not all needed to change every one of these behaviors (ie, floor effects). Future adequately powered analyses focused on participants who had poor levels of health behaviors targeted by MB‐BP at baseline will provide further insights on the role of MB‐BP in influencing behavior change.

### Effectiveness of stress management and relaxation interventions for management of hypertension and prehypertension: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^c0281e7a]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

As with all interventions, assessing whether they have a meaningful effect, and not only a statistically significant effect, on an outcome is important.For many of our results, the wide credible intervals meant that it was not clear whether the interventions had a major effect (reduced systolic blood pressure by >5 mm Hg) or a trivial effect (reduced blood pressure by ≤5 mm Hg). This doubt was reflected in the CINeMA and GRADE ratings of the certainty of the evidence. Some studies have indicated that smaller changes in systolic blood pressure might also have substantial effects on cardiovascular outcomes.If this finding were true, it would give us more confidence that these interventions have an important effect on blood pressure.

Because of the limited data reported, we could not draw firm conclusions about aspects of equality, diversity, and inclusion in this review, but some features might be useful to consider when planning future studies. Mean age across the included studies was about 52 years, despite the fact that the highest prevalence of hypertension is in those aged >60 years.This finding could reflect an assumption that younger participants might be more able and willing to undertake stress management interventions, or prefer these to drug treatments. Also, individuals from non-white ethnic backgrounds were under-represented in the review, despite these groups being at greater risk of hypertension.Some groups who might struggle to access healthcare also seemed to be under-represented in the studies (eg, those with mental health disorders, individuals in rural settings, and people who were unemployed or retired). Finally, interventions were sometimes not considered suitable for individuals with physical disabilities (mobility, sight, or hearing problems), resulting in the exclusion of these participants from the studies, rather than modifying the interventions to allow for their inclusion.

Conclusions

The results of our study indicated that many relaxation interventions show promise for reducing blood pressure in the short term but the longer term effects are unclear. Future studies in this area should include adequate follow-up to establish whether the effects on blood pressure persist over time, both while the relaxation interventions are ongoing and after they have been completed. Researchers should also use rigorous study methods and reporting to minimise the risk of bias in the results. Finally, we encourage researchers to assess all relevant outcomes, including cardiovascular events and adverse events, as well as blood pressure itself.

### Management of hypertensive patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors [^fb321b7d]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Most hypertensive patients have additional cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, as stressed in all recent guidelines from expert committees, an evaluation of all risk factors and an assessment of each patient's individual risk status is needed before deciding upon the need for therapy and the type of therapy to be given. In particular, attention must be directed at those risk factors that may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension: obesity, excessive sodium intake, physical inactivity, and stress. If active therapy is needed for established hypertension, all modifiable unhealthy lifestyles should be addressed along with appropriate drug therapy.

### Blood pressure and pulse responses to three stressors: associations with sociodemographic characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors [^e34a1407]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular reactivity is hypothesized to increase the risk of hypertension and other CVD-related conditions. However, studies to date are inconclusive. We compared the association of blood pressure and pulse responses to three stressors (postural challenge, handgrip test, mental arithmetic) with sociodemographic characteristics and CVD risk factors. We included 782 participants from the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Study. Blood pressure and pulse responses to stressors were defined as the difference between post- and pre-stress measurements. Stepwise regression analyses examined change in SBP and pulse in response to stressors as a function of sociodemographic and CVD risk factors. Age, race, and gender were forced into models and other variables (education, BMI, waist circumference, resting SBP and DBP, cigarette smoking, LDL and HDL cholesterol, glucose, and antihypertensive medications (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, ace inhibitors)) were retained if P<0.10. Age was a significant predictor of SBP response to all stressors. The SBP response to a change in posture was not related to other variables. The SBP response to mental arithmetic was significantly higher among men, those with larger waists, higher SBP, beta-blocker users, and lower among smokers. SBP response to the handgrip was significantly higher among those with higher SBP and beta-blocker users. Similarly, the association of the pulse response to the risk factors varied considerably across the stressors. Overall, the socio-demographic and CVD risk factors accounted for between 9 and 14% of the variance in the SBP response to the stressors and from between 4 and 12% of the variance in the pulse response to the three stressors. The associations between sociodemographic and CVD risk factors and the SBP and pulse response to stress were modest and inconsistent across stressors. The findings suggest that cardiovascular reactivity is a concept that needs to be defined in reference to specific stressors so that mechanisms leading to responses can be better understood.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of mindfulness-based stress reduction for arterial hypertension [^1b0e34bf]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Arterial hypertension is a major public health issue. Non-pharmacological approaches like Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) might be a promising addition to conventional therapy. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the effects of MBSR on systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) among individuals with prehypertension or hypertension. We searched Medline/PubMed, Scopus and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from their inception until August 1st 2021. RCTs were included that compared MBSR to any control intervention in participants with diagnosed prehypertension (120-139/80-89mmHg) or hypertension (≥140/≥90mmHg). Mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Risk of Bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. Seven RCTs with 429 participants were included. Very low quality of evidence was found for positive effects of MBSR on SBP (MD=-11.26mmHg, 95%CI=-20.24 to -2.29, p=0.01) but no evidence for effects on DBP levels (MD=-3.62mmHg, 95%CI=-8.52 to 1.29, p=0.15) compared to waitlist control. Compared to active control, very low quality of evidence was found for positive effects on DBP (MD=-5.51mmHg, 95%CI=-10.93 to -0.09, p=0.05) but no effects on SBP levels (MD=-4.33mmHg, 95%CI=-12.04 to 3.38, p=0.27). Overall, the studies showed a high degree of heterogeneity. The effects found were robust against selection, detection, and attrition bias. Only one RCT reported safety data. MBSR may be an option for lowering blood pressure in people with prehypertension to hypertension. More and larger high-quality studies are needed to substantiate our findings.

Stress‑reduction and mindfulness‑based interventions—blood pressure effects: Transcendental meditation can lower BP in patients without and with hypertension, with mean reductions of approximately 5/2 mm Hg in SBP/DBP, although meditation appears to be somewhat less effective than BP‑lowering lifestyle interventions such as the DASH eating plan, structured exercise programs, or low‑sodium/higher‑potassium intake. There is moderate‑grade evidence that breathing control interventions lower SBP/DBP by approximately 5/3 mm Hg in people with and without hypertension, and there is low to moderate‑grade evidence that yoga of diverse types lowers BP.

### Stress-induced sodium excretion: a new intermediate phenotype to study the early genetic etiology of hypertension? [^2dde196b]. Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Impaired stress-induced pressure natriuresis, ie, an inadequate compensatory increase in urinary sodium excretion (U(Na)V) in response to a stress-induced blood pressure increase, may lead to the premature development of essential hypertension. To assess the heritability of baseline U(Na)V, stress U(Na)V, and the U(Na)V response to stress (Delta U(Na)V=stress U(Na)V- baseline U(Na)V), we studied 396 black and 494 white twins, including monozygotic and dizygotic twins of the same as well as the opposite sex (mean age: 17.6+/-3.3 years; range: 11.9 to 30.0 years). Bivariate genetic model fitting was performed to examine the extent to which genetic and environmental factors are common or specific to baseline and stress U(Na)V. Heritability estimates for Delta U(Na)V can be derived from these bivariate models. All of the bivariate analyses were performed separately in whites and blacks, because univariate models for baseline U(Na)V showed significant ethnic differences in heritability estimates. Best-fitting models showed that the heritability of stress U(Na)V was 0.42 in whites and 0.58 in blacks. Only 15% and 11% of the total variance could be attributed to genetic factors common to baseline and stress U(Na)V in whites and blacks, respectively. After removal of all of the shared influences with baseline U(Na)V, heritabilities for stress U(Na)V were 0.32 in whites and 0.57 in blacks. Heritability estimates for Delta U(Na)V were 0.36 in whites and 0.39 in blacks. In summary, this study establishes Delta U(Na)V and stress U(Na)V as heritable phenotypes that may be used to study the genetic etiology of early hypertension development.

### Stress and cardiovascular disease: an update [^bd967a4d]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Psychological stress is generally accepted to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but results have varied in terms of how stress is measured and the strength of the association. Additionally, the mechanisms and potential causal links have remained speculative despite decades of research. The physiological responses to stress are well characterized, but their contribution to the development and progression of CVD has received little attention in empirical studies. Evidence suggests that physiological responses to stress have a fundamental role in the risk of CVD and that haemodynamic, vascular and immune perturbations triggered by stress are especially implicated. Stress response physiology is regulated by the corticolimbic regions of the brain, which have outputs to the autonomic nervous system. Variation in these regulatory pathways might explain interindividual differences in vulnerability to stress. Dynamic perturbations in autonomic, immune and vascular functions are probably also implicated as CVD risk mechanisms of chronic, recurring and cumulative stressful exposures, but more data are needed from prospective studies and from assessments in real-life situations. Psychological assessment remains insufficiently recognized in clinical care and prevention. Although stress-reduction interventions might mitigate perceived stress levels and potentially reduce cardiovascular risk, more data from randomized trials are needed.
