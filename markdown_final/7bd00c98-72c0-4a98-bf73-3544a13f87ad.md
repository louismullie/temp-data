Hypertension treatment

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hypertension treatment thresholds, targets, and initial therapy choices across major guidelines, with explicit self-verification and citations throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic thresholds and how they differ by guideline. Then, I should verify treatment initiation thresholds and whether they are risk-based. Next, I will examine blood pressure targets by guideline and special populations. After that, I need to check initial pharmacologic strategies, including monotherapy versus combination therapy and single-pill combinations. Finally, I will consider adherence, monitoring, and special situations like resistant hypertension and device-based therapies, and I will reconcile apparent contradictions where they arise.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic thresholds because everything downstream depends on them. The ACC/AHA 2017 guideline defines hypertension as ≥ 130/80 mmHg, whereas ESC/ESH 2018 and most other societies historically used ≥ 140/90 mmHg, and the 2024 ESC update introduces a new categorization with "nonelevated" < 120/70, "elevated" 120–139/70–89, and "hypertension" ≥ 140/90, which reframes earlier initiation discussions without changing the ≥ 140/90 definition of hypertension itself [^113a1pp9].

> Wait, let me verify treatment initiation thresholds because this is where guidelines diverge and where risk stratification matters. The WHO 2021 guideline recommends pharmacologic treatment at ≥ 140/90 mmHg for most adults, with consideration of treatment at 130–139 mmHg if high cardiovascular risk is present, aligning with a risk-based approach rather than a single universal threshold [^116oYz48]. The ESC 2024 guideline explicitly recommends initiating pharmacotherapy at ≥ 130/80 mmHg if cardiovascular risk is sufficiently high after 3 months of lifestyle intervention, which operationalizes risk-based initiation at lower pressures than older thresholds [^1177dRHK]. By contrast, JNC 8 recommended initiating pharmacotherapy at ≥ 150/90 mmHg for adults ≥ 60 years and at ≥ 140/90 mmHg for adults < 60 years, reflecting a more conservative, largely age-based threshold strategy [^115CjvEw]. I should double-check that these differences are real and not just wording; yes, these are substantive differences across societies and eras, with contemporary European and global guidance moving toward earlier initiation in higher-risk individuals [^115PhMLy] [^113a1pp9].

> Hold on, I should verify blood pressure targets next, because this is where clinicians often anchor decisions. The 2023 ESH guideline recommends a general target of < 130/80 mmHg for adults aged 18–64 years, reflecting more intensive BP lowering in appropriately selected patients [^114K5RMJ]. The ESC 2024 guideline sets a default systolic target of 120–129 mmHg when tolerated, with relaxed targets in older adults, those with frailty, orthostatic symptoms, or limited life expectancy, which is notably more intensive than many prior frameworks [^113a1pp9]. In contrast, AAFP guidance continues to endorse a standard target of < 140/90 mmHg to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, emphasizing simplicity and broad applicability in primary care [^111qiJtZ] [^112Q6Uqo]. For adults ≥ 65 years, ESC/ESH 2018 advised targeting 130–140/ < 80 mmHg and cautioned against targeting SBP < 120 mmHg due to potential harm in older or higher-risk cohorts, which tempers the impulse to intensify indiscriminately in the elderly [^114FFvZw]. I need to ensure I note that JNC 8 favored < 150/90 mmHg for ≥ 60 years, reinforcing a more conservative target in older adults, particularly when tolerance or orthostasis is a concern [^115CjvEw].

> Let me consider initial pharmacologic strategy, and I should confirm whether monotherapy or combination therapy is preferred. Contemporary ESH 2023 and ESC guidance favor initiating with a two-drug combination in most patients, typically pairing a renin–angiotensin system blocker (ACE inhibitor or ARB) with either a calcium channel blocker or a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, reserving monotherapy for select low-risk grade 1 cases or frail older adults [^111rJjTU] [^111yornR]. The WHO 2021 guideline also supports early use of single-pill combinations to improve adherence and simplify care pathways, which is crucial for real-world control rates [^116oYz48]. But wait, what if I overstate the evidence for hard outcomes with initial combination therapy? I should double-check: Cochrane reviews have not demonstrated definitive differences in mortality or major cardiovascular events between starting with combination therapy versus monotherapy due to small numbers and very low certainty, so the preference for initial combination therapy is largely driven by faster BP control, adherence, and mechanistic synergy rather than proven superiority in hard outcomes at initiation [^115Q3UvG] [^113i4TjW]. Still, given the magnitude of BP reduction needed in many patients and adherence advantages, starting with two drugs in a single-pill combination is a reasonable default in most newly diagnosed adults with BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg or high-risk profiles [^111rJjTU] [^112XTFfx].

> I need to check which drug classes are considered first-line and whether any are discouraged. Across ACC/AHA, ESC/ESH, and WHO, the core first-line classes are thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, with beta-blockers reserved for compelling indications such as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, ischemic heart disease, or arrhythmias rather than routine first-line use in otherwise uncomplicated hypertension [^113u9ZD3] [^115udNgw] [^117DKjSW]. Meta-analytic data suggest beta-blockers, particularly atenolol, are less effective than other classes for stroke prevention and should not remain first choice in primary hypertension, reinforcing their relegation to second-line or indication-specific roles [^117T5Dgx]. Let me reconsider whether ARBs were underrepresented in older outcome trials; yes, early Cochrane analyses had limited ARB data, but contemporary practice and guidelines include ARBs as fully validated first-line options with outcome benefit via BP lowering, so I should not underuse them in appropriate patients [^115FQHjS] [^115udNgw].

> Next, I should review adherence and implementation, because poor control is often a systems problem rather than a pharmacology problem. Nonadherence accounts for a substantial proportion of apparent treatment resistance, and pill burden strongly correlates with lower adherence; single-pill combinations materially improve adherence and, by extension, BP control, which is why guidelines increasingly emphasize SPCs and simplified regimens [^115mfqqb] [^112XTFfx]. I should confirm that standardized treatment protocols and HEARTS-based implementation tools can help close the control gap; indeed, many programs show improved control when using stepwise, protocolized care with defined drugs, doses, and follow-up intervals, though most protocols still have room for better alignment with current guidance and dosing precision [^112YM6UM]. But wait, what if I assume device therapies can solve nonadherence? Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; renal denervation and other device-based approaches remain investigational for routine care pending more robust, sham-controlled outcome data, so they should not replace pharmacologic adherence strategies outside trials [^116PW9c6] [^113zk56i].

> I will now examine special populations and risk-based nuances, and I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize. In older adults, especially ≥ 85 years or those with frailty or symptomatic orthostasis, guidelines advise more conservative initiation and targets, sometimes accepting < 150/90 mmHg or individualized "as low as reasonably achievable" approaches to avoid hypotension, falls, or cognitive compromise [^113a1pp9] [^112XqMSk]. For patients with established cardiovascular disease, intensive targets may reduce myocardial infarction or heart failure in some analyses, but Cochrane reviews suggest no clear mortality benefit and more adverse events with lower targets, so I should individualize and monitor closely rather than reflexively intensify [^115xdVCE] [^113QhbJd]. In Black patients, JNC 8 emphasized initial therapy with a thiazide-type diuretic or calcium channel blocker, reflecting trial evidence and population-specific response patterns, which remains a reasonable starting point absent compelling indications for other classes [^115CjvEw]. For chronic kidney disease with albuminuria, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred due to renal outcome benefits, and this should guide initial selection even if BP is only modestly elevated [^115CjvEw].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and double-check internal consistency. For a typical adult with confirmed office BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg, I would initiate lifestyle modification and, in most cases, start a two-drug single-pill combination such as an ARB plus a calcium channel blocker or a thiazide-like diuretic, aiming for < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, with earlier intensification at 2–4 week intervals if not at target and attention to home BP monitoring to guide titration [^111rJjTU] [^114K5RMJ]. If the patient is high risk with BP 130–139/80–89 mmHg, I would consider pharmacotherapy after a short lifestyle trial, consistent with ESC 2024 and WHO risk-based framing, documenting the rationale and patient preferences [^1177dRHK]. For adults ≥ 65 years or those with frailty or orthostatic symptoms, I would target 130–140/ < 80 mmHg and avoid SBP < 120 mmHg, reassessing falls risk, cognition, and renal perfusion as I titrate [^114FFvZw]. Throughout, I should verify adherence at every visit, minimize pill burden with SPCs, and escalate promptly to avoid therapeutic inertia, which is a major driver of suboptimal control [^115mfqqb] [^116ECqxA].

> Finally, I should acknowledge and reconcile the apparent contradictions so clinicians understand why guidelines differ. The ACC/AHA 2017 expansion to ≥ 130/80 mmHg for diagnosis and treatment reflects epidemiologic risk and trial data like SPRINT, whereas JNC 8's more conservative thresholds and targets reflect a stricter RCT-evidence lens and concern about overtreatment in older adults, and ESH/ESC 2023–2024 integrate both risk and tolerance into more intensive but individualized targets [^115PhMLy] [^115CjvEw] [^114K5RMJ]. These differences are real but not irreconcilable; they reflect varying evidence hierarchies, population priorities, and value judgments, and they converge on the core principle that BP lowering reduces cardiovascular events, with the optimal threshold and target depending on baseline risk, age, frailty, and patient preferences [^113vwMGX] [^117DKjSW].

Hypertension treatment centers on **lifestyle modification for all patients** [^117DKjSW] and **pharmacotherapy when BP is ≥ 140/90 mmHg** or ≥ 130/80 mmHg with high cardiovascular risk [^1177dRHK] [^116K17V8]. First-line drugs include **thiazide-like diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel blockers** [^113u9ZD3]; beta-blockers are reserved for specific indications [^117DKjSW]. Most patients require **combination therapy** to reach targets, with single-pill combinations preferred to improve adherence [^111rJjTU] [^112XTFfx]. Targets are generally **< 130/80 mmHg** for most adults [^114K5RMJ] if tolerated, with **< 140/90 mmHg** for older or frail patients [^114FFvZw] [^113a1pp9]. Regular monitoring, adherence support, and addressing resistant hypertension are essential to reduce cardiovascular risk [^114ugJqL] [^114PEfYz].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle changes are **first-line for all patients** and can lower BP by 5–10 mmHg [^117DKjSW]:

- **Dietary approaches**: DASH diet with reduced sodium and increased potassium [^114kPFtG].
- **Weight loss**: Aim for BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m².
- **Physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise.
- **Alcohol moderation**: ≤ 1 drink/day (women), ≤ 2 drinks/day (men).
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended.

---

## Pharmacological treatment

### Indications for pharmacological therapy

Pharmacotherapy is indicated for **BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg** [^114VgvVL] after lifestyle measures, or for **BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg** with high cardiovascular risk [^1177dRHK] [^112A21uM].

---

### First-line antihypertensive agents

The **major drug classes** recommended are:

| **Drug class** | **Examples** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Thiazide-like diuretics | Chlorthalidone, indapamide | General first-line; especially effective in black patients [^113u9ZD3] [^115CjvEw] |
| ACE inhibitors | Lisinopril, enalapril | - Diabetes <br/> - CKD <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Post-MI [^115CjvEw] |
| ARBs | Losartan, valsartan | - ACE inhibitor intolerance <br/> - Diabetes <br/> - CKD <br/> - Heart failure [^115CjvEw] |
| Calcium channel blockers | Amlodipine, felodipine | - Elderly <br/> - Isolated systolic hypertension <br/> - Black patients [^115CjvEw] |
| Beta-blockers | Metoprolol, carvedilol | - Heart failure <br/> - CAD <br/> - Arrhythmias <br/> - Not first-line otherwise [^115qwZwT] [^117T5Dgx] |

---

### Combination therapy

Most patients require **combination therapy** to reach targets; **single-pill combinations** are preferred to improve adherence and control [^111rJjTU] [^115mfqqb].

---

## Blood pressure targets

BP targets vary by guideline and patient characteristics: **general population** < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated (ESH 2023) [^114K5RMJ], **older adults** 130–140/ < 80 mmHg (ESC/ESH 2018) [^114FFvZw], and **frail or limited lifespan** < 140/90 mmHg or as tolerated [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Initial follow-up**: Reassess in 4–6 weeks after starting or changing therapy.
- **Ongoing monitoring**: Every 3–6 months once stable.
- **Home BP monitoring**: Encouraged to improve adherence and control [^notfound].

---

## Management of resistant hypertension

Resistant hypertension is **BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg despite three agents (including a diuretic) or controlled on ≥ 4 agents** [^notfound]. Evaluation includes identifying secondary causes and confirming adherence; **treatment** involves adding a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (e.g. spironolactone) [^114ugJqL], considering renal denervation or baroreceptor activation in specialized centers [^116PW9c6] [^113zk56i].

---

## Special populations

- **Elderly**: Cautious titration; avoid SBP < 120 mmHg [^114FFvZw].
- **Diabetes/CKD**: Prefer ACE inhibitors or ARBs; target < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated [^115CjvEw] [^114K5RMJ].
- **Pregnancy**: Methyldopa, labetalol, nifedipine; avoid ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and thiazides.

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging options include **renal denervation** for resistant hypertension (under evaluation) [^112xHnWi] and **novel agents** such as aprocitentan (dual endothelin receptor antagonist) for resistant hypertension [^11377raU].

---

Effective hypertension management requires **lifestyle change, evidence-based pharmacotherapy, and risk-stratified targets**, with **combination therapy and adherence support** to achieve control and reduce cardiovascular risk [^117DKjSW].

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116K17V8]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, < 14% of adults with hypertension have BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mmHg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines, developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling. The guidelines recommend BP threshold to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single pill combination medications, and use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. Strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient's values, resource considerations and cost-effectiveness; health equity; acceptability, and feasibility consideration of different treatment options. The goal of the guideline is to facilitate standard approaches to pharmacological treatment and management of hypertension which, if widely implemented, will increase the hypertension control rate world-wide.

### European guidelines for hypertension in 2024: a comparison of key recommendations for clinical practice [^113vwMGX]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality globally. Suboptimal control of elevated blood pressure places a substantial burden on health-care systems worldwide. Several factors contribute to this suboptimal control, such as limited awareness of hypertension, lack of appropriate diagnosis and poor control of blood pressure among those with a diagnosis. These factors can be due to patient non-adherence to treatment, inertia among health-care professionals and low uptake and implementation of clinical guideline recommendations. From 2003 to 2018, the European Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Cardiology jointly published four sets of guidelines on hypertension. However, the two societies released separate guidelines on hypertension in 2023 and 2024, respectively. These two sets of European guidelines agree on most recommendations, but some differences have been identified. In this Expert Recommendation, we highlight the key consensus recommendations from the two guidelines; compare differing approaches to the definition, classification, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension; and aim to help health-care professionals in their decision-making to improve the management of hypertension and to reduce the burden of hypertension-associated outcomes and premature deaths.

### What is new and different in the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension? [^113a1pp9]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2024, the European Society of Cardiology released a new guideline for the management of elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension. The guideline introduced a new BP categorization: (1) nonelevated (office BP < 120/70 mmHg) for which drug treatment is not recommended, (2) elevated (120–139/70–89 mmHg) for which drug treatment is recommended based on cardiovascular disease risk and follow-up BP level, and (3) hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg) for which prompt confirmation and drug treatment are recommended in most individuals. The initial default systolic BP treatment target is 120 to 129 mmHg; however, relaxed targets (BP as low as reasonably achievable) are recommended in case of treatment intolerance, adults ≥ 85 years, symptomatic orthostasis, moderate-to-severe frailty, or limited life expectancy. Here, we summarize what is new and different in the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines, relative to other major international hypertension guidelines in Europe and America. Our aim is to reconcile any uncertainty clinicians may have about implementing these various guidelines in patient care.

### Evidence-based medicine in hypertension: what type of evidence? [^113FxGF1]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Although placebo-controlled trials have been a powerful instrument to answer the question whether blood pressure lowering in hypertensive patients were beneficial or not, event-based trials comparing different active treatments have been less successful, and have generated the opinion that blood pressure lowering is the only relevant beneficial mechanism. Several limitations of these event-based trials should be considered, however only a proportion of the patients have received the initial randomized treatment alone, the goal reducing blood pressure level has rarely been achieved and small blood pressure differences have often been underestimated, patients have been randomized to given regimens as if blood pressure of all them should be equally responsive to different agents, and, finally, most trials have only included elderly or complicated hypertensive. The hypothesis is advanced that blood pressure lowering and ancillary properties of antihypertensive agents may play a different role at various stages of the continuum of cardiovascular disease. Only when hypertension-related complications are not too advanced, the different ability of different antihypertensive agents to influence subclinical organ damage progression ("intermediate" endpoints) may be capable of influencing morbidity and mortality over a longer term than that usually explored by event-based trials.

Conclusions

In the above guidelines, the WHO provides the most current and relevant evidence-based global public health guidance on the initiation of treatment with pharmacological agents for hypertension in adults. The guidelines are expected to be valid for a period of 5 years. This period reflects the fact that new research findings are likely to become available in the meantime but also represents a feasible time frame, considering the costs, time and other resources that are needed to update such guidelines. If the evidence base or user needs change before the 5-year mark, consideration will be given to producing updates sooner. More large randomized controlled trials, powered for CVD and/or mortality outcomes, are needed to shed light on the research gaps mentioned in discussion above especially for subpopulations that have not been adequately represented in previous trials.

### Hypertension guidelines: criteria that might make them more clinically useful [^113ZmA3w]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease prevention depends on reduction of risk factors, including hypertension. Guidelines designed to improve management of hypertension are widely available. Their purpose is to assemble the available data from basic biomedical science, epidemiology, and clinical science in an accessible form with which physicians and patients can make reasoned decisions for individual cases. However, guidelines have been neither widely accepted, nor effectively implemented. We recommend a strategy for guideline preparation designed to yield a product more user friendly, accessible, and effective. Guideline recommendations and the evidence used to make them should be based on an explicit grading system. Relevant clinical as well as nonclinical factors must be considered. Moreover, because the goal of antihypertensive therapy is to prevent cardiovascular events, and the likelihood of such events is determined by multifactor or absolute risk assessment, risk, rather than level of blood pressure (BP), should determine the need for therapy. Similarly, the benefit of therapy must be assessed by reduction in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114eZ6aq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Clinical trial design principles and outcomes definitions for device-based therapies for hypertension: a consensus document from the hypertension academic research consortium [^111gnkci]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite its recognition as the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, the awareness, treatment, and control of blood pressure (BP) have plateaued if not modestly declined. In the United States alone, for example, more than half of individuals with hypertension — representing > 29 million people — are estimated to have BP exceeding professional society and guideline-recommended treatment goals. As the most commonly diagnosed condition and largest contributor to mortality in industrialized countries, hypertension is present in > 1 in 3 individuals, and the risk of cardiovascular mortality doubles for every 20 mm Hg and 10 mm Hg increase in the systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively. With population growth and aging, the global prevalence of hypertension and associated adverse outcomes are expected to continue to escalate.

Irrespective of baseline hypertension severity, even moderate reductions in BP translate into clinically meaningful reductions in cardiac, renal, and cerebral vascular-related adverse events. Recent large randomized clinical trials have also demonstrated the clinical benefits of more intensive BP reduction, leading to revision of guideline-directed treatment goals to further lower SBP and DBP standards. Countering evidence-based efforts to improve BP with a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical therapies are routine challenges in clinical practice that include patient intolerance of medication-related adverse effects, general nonadherence with prescribed therapy, and physician inertia for treatment of an illness that remains largely silent until onset of clinically irreversible conditions.

### Selected highlights in the updated treatment of hypertension [^113sZH5C]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertension remains the leading international risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature death but, despite effective treatments, hypertension remains significantly underdiagnosed and undertreated. In the present review paper, we provide a selected update on recent developments of interest in the management of hypertension. We focus on summarizing four topics that we believe are worth highlighting to a clinical audience: (1) the evidence and strong motivation for new lower systolic BP treatment targets; (2) new studies reporting on the efficacy of renal denervation in the management of hypertension; (3) interesting new data to inform the great salt debate; and (4), perhaps most importantly, pioneering new work highlighting the huge potential of multi-disciplinary care in the management of hypertension.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^115PhMLy]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension clinical practice guidelines for management of high blood pressure/hypertension are influential documents. Both guidelines are comprehensive, were developed using rigorous processes, and underwent extensive peer review. The most notable difference between the 2 guidelines is the blood pressure cut points recommended for the diagnosis of hypertension. There are also differences in the timing and intensity of treatment, with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommending a somewhat more intensive approach. Overall, there is substantial concordance in the recommendations provided by the 2 guideline-writing committees, with greater congruity between them than their predecessors. Additional harmonization of future guidelines would help to underscore the commonality of their core recommendations and could serve to catalyze changes in practice that would lead to improved prevention, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, worldwide.

### Interventional procedures and future drug therapy for hypertension [^112xxF6V]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects > 1 billion people globally and is the number one risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although many different classes of antihypertensive drug are available, side effects of drugs resulting in variable patient adherence are problematic. Additional drug therapies are therefore needed with excellent tolerability profiles in addition to proven safety and efficacy. Moreover, for those patients who either do not wish to take drugs lifelong or who experience disabling adverse effects from drug therapy, non-pharmacological measures over and above lifestyle modification are urgently required. We consider the newly emerging field of interventional procedures for hypertension and also what is on the horizon for novel pharmacological approaches to improve BP control.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115mfqqb]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Drug treatment strategy for hypertension — contributors to poor blood pressure (BP) control and proposed approach: Only ~40% of patients with hypertension are treated and, of these, only ~35% are controlled to a BP of < 140/ 90 mmHg; evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) shows BP control can be achieved in most recruited patients and that no more than 5–10% exhibit resistance to the selected regimen; treatment inertia contributes to suboptimal BP control with many patients remaining on monotherapy and/or suboptimal doses; adherence is a much more important factor than previously recognised; almost all patients in RCTs have required combinations of drugs, and non‑adherence rises with pill burden, being usually < 10% with a single pill, ~20% with two pills, and ~40% with three pills, with very high rates in those receiving four or more pills; consequently, the most effective evidence‑based strategy is one that encourages combination treatment in most patients, enables the use of SPC therapy for most patients, encourages adherence, and follows a simple, pragmatic algorithm with SPC therapy as initial therapy in most patients except those with BP in the high–normal range and in frail older patients.

### Guideline-driven management of hypertension: an evidence-based update [^114ugJqL]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Several important findings bearing on the prevention, detection, and management of hypertension have been reported since publication of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline. This review summarizes and places in context the results of relevant observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and meta-analyses published between January 2018 and March 2021. Topics covered include blood pressure measurement, patient evaluation for secondary hypertension, cardiovascular disease risk assessment and blood pressure threshold for drug therapy, lifestyle and pharmacological management, treatment target blood pressure goal, management of hypertension in older adults, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, resistant hypertension, and optimization of care using patient, provider, and health system approaches. Presenting new information in each of these areas has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, treatment, and control which remain essential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the future.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115xdVCE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the third update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (systolic/diastolic 135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 mmHg to 160mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, we used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 mmHg to 160 mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs that involved 9595 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Six of seven RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. We also considered other issues, such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined, to downgrade the certainty of the evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 7 studies, 9595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure (CHF)) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 3 studies, 801 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.77 mmHg, 95% CI -12.82 to -4.73; 7 studies, 8657 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets at one year were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.23; 7 studies, 8699 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### Hypertension [^116fBeCJ]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Raised blood pressure is the biggest single contributor to the global burden of disease and to global mortality. The numbers of people affected and the prevalence of high blood pressure worldwide are expected to increase over the next decade. Preventive strategies are therefore urgently needed, especially in less developed countries, and management of hypertension must be optimised. Genetic advances in some rare causes of hypertension have been made lately, but the aggregate effect on blood pressure of all the genetic loci identified to date is small. Hence, intervention on key environmental determinants and effective implementation of trial-based therapies are needed. Three-drug combinations can control hypertension in about 90% of patients but only if resources allow identification of patients and drug delivery is affordable. Furthermore, assessment of optimal drug therapy for each ethnic group is needed.

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 2019: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensives to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. Other issues such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined were also considered to downgrade the quality evidence.

Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 2 studies, 690 participants; very low-quality evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.90 mmHg, 95% CI -13.24 to -4.56; 6 studies, 8546 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.24; 6 studies, 8588 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116oYz48]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

In 1978, the World Health Organization (WHO) published one of the earliest clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of arterial hypertension, which were later updated in 1999 and 2003. In 2007, the WHO published some recommendations for the management of hypertension in guidelines for the assessment and management of total CVD risk. However, these are now outdated considering new evidence and practices. Guidance is particularly needed now on some controversial issues, such as the threshold level of BP at which to start pharmacological treatment and whether laboratory testing and CVD risk assessment are needed before initiating antihypertensive pharmacological therapy. In the past decade, the WHO included diagnosis and management of hypertension in a total CVD risk approach as part of the WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (WHO PEN) 2007, 2010, and 2013. However, this approach preceded recent advances in the pharmacological management of hypertension. More recently, the WHO has provided information about the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the Global HEARTS Initiative including the HEARTS Technical Package and the HEARTS in the Americas Program. However, these too provide general practical information and not specific guidelines and recommendations. The WHO Essential Medicines List includes ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and thiazide diuretics for management of hypertension. In June 2019, single-pill combination antihypertensive medications were added to the WHO Essential Medicines List.

Herein, we summarize the recommendations of the 2021 WHO Guidelines for the Pharmacological Treatment of Hypertension in Adults. They include guidance on the BP threshold for the initiation of pharmacological treatment for hypertension, initial and longer-term visit intervals for follow-up of treated patients, treatment target BP levels, and the best use of health care workers for management of hypertension. The 2021 WHO hypertension guidelines aim to provide the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for pharmacological treatment of hypertension in nonpregnant adults, with a particular focus on practice in middle- and low-income countries.

Although these guidelines do not address modifiable risk factors for hypertension such as unhealthy diet, overweight, obesity, physical inactivity, or consumption of alcohol, a comprehensive treatment plan for hypertension should address these risk factors through lifestyle modifications and other interventions. Likewise, treatment of hypertension should be accompanied by management of other CVD risk factors such as cigarette smoking, diabetes, lipid abnormalities, and comorbid conditions.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115RaCrb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2018: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov.

We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. We found no change in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; low-quality evidence). Studies reported more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower target group by 8.9/4.5 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group, but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence of a difference in total mortality, serious adverse events, or total cardiovascular events between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower or to a standard blood pressure target. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on adverse events, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to examine this topic.

### Prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: synopsis of the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association hypertension guideline [^116VRena]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) released a clinical practice guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) in adults. This article summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2014, the ACC and the AHA appointed a multidisciplinary committee to update previous reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. The committee reviewed literature and commissioned systematic reviews and meta-analyses on out-of-office BP monitoring, the optimal target for BP lowering, the comparative benefits and harms of different classes of antihypertensive agents, and the comparative benefits and harms of initiating therapy with a single antihypertensive agent or a combination of 2 agents.

Recommendations

This article summarizes key recommendations in the following areas: BP classification, BP measurement, screening for secondary hypertension, nonpharmacologic therapy, BP thresholds and cardiac risk estimation to guide drug treatment, treatment goals (general and for patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and advanced age), choice of initial drug therapy, resistant hypertension, and strategies to improve hypertension control.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Hypertension diagnosis, treatment, and control in India [^111J1rpW]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the gaps in the hypertension care continuum (diagnosis, treatment, and control), and how do they vary by state, district, and sociodemographic groups in India?

Findings

In this 2019–2021 national survey study of 1.7 million respondents, 28.1% had hypertension, of whom 36.9% received a diagnosis; 44.7% of those who received a diagnosis (17.7% of the total with hypertension) reported taking medication, and 52.5% of those treated (8.5% of the total with hypertension) achieved blood pressure control. Most of the variability in the hypertension care continuum was observed within, not between, states.

Meaning

This study suggests that differences between states and between districts in states indicate the need for targeted, decentralized solutions to improve the hypertension care continuum in India.

### Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension [^115tJF58]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors need to know what blood pressure (BP) target they should try to achieve. The standard of clinical practice for some time has been ≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this standard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard reduces mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine if lower BP targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard BP targets (≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (1966–2008), EMBASE (1980–2008), and CENTRAL (up to June 2008); references from review articles, clinical guidelines, and clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing patients randomized to lower or to standard BP targets and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (JAA, MIP) independently assessed the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; total cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

No trials comparing different systolic BP targets were found. Seven trials (22,089 subjects) comparing different diastolic BP targets were included. Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p < 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.25), congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59–1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81–1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating patients to lower than standard BP targets, ≤ 140–160/90–100 mmHg, does not reduce mortality or morbidity. Because guidelines are recommending even lower targets for diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, we are currently conducting systematic reviews in those groups of patients.

### Renal denervation in the antihypertensive arsenal-knowns and known unknowns [^113zk56i]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

GUIDELINES

Summarizing what International Hypertension guidelines say about renal denervation for the treatment of hypertension is straight forward, they do not say very much. The evaluation of treatment of hypertension with drug therapy, through randomized clinical trials is one of the most studied areas in clinical medicine. Guideline developers have benefited from a wealth of data from clinical outcome trials, demonstrating the effectiveness of drug treatments at reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Consequently, this has become the gold standard for recommending a new treatment. This is a high bar for new device-based treatments such as renal denervation because the studies with device-based treatments have been relatively small and of short duration, thus, assessing the impact of the intervention on morbidity and mortality has so far, been impossible, and is unlikely to happen. It could be argued that BP lowering per se, is a powerful surrogate for future benefit, irrespective of the means of achieving it. This concept has been applied to treatment recommendations in existing guidance for most lifestyle interventions advocated for hypertension, and also for the drug treatment of resistant hypertension. However, drug therapy for hypertension is now largely generic and low cost and economic considerations assume increasing importance in guidelines. To this end, the BP lowering efficacy of renal denervation appears modest, and the predictability (i.e. who will respond?) and durability of any BP lowering response remains uncertain. The inconsistency in the findings of some of the early RCTs also fueled concern about the efficacy, at the time major guidelines in the US and Europe were being developed for release in 2017 and 2018 respectively. This has been compounded by the recognition that much of the so called 'unmet need' to address poor BP control rates, relates to untaken medication, i.e. problems of adherence to multipill drug treatment, and that the recommendation in current guidelines advocating for wider use of single pill combinations of therapy should begin to address deficiencies in BP control. Mindful of all these considerations, none of the existing hypertension treatment guidelines across the world formally recommend renal denervation for routine clinical use to treat hypertension, outside of the context of clinical trials. Most of the current international hypertension guidelines have not even considered or commented on renal denervation for the treatment of hypertension. The position of various guidelines covering all regions of the world are summarized the table below. Whether this will change when new guideline committees begin considering their guideline updates, remains open to question because the challenges outlined above

### Cost-effectiveness of initiating pharmacological treatment in stage one hypertension based on 10-year cardiovascular disease risk: a Markov modeling study [^115a8EaY]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is one of the most important reversible risk factors for global morbidity and mortality. Pharmacological treatment of hypertension reduces all-cause mortality and incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, including heart attacks and strokes.

Recommendations for antihypertensive drug treatment in England are based, wherever possible, on the cost-effectiveness of treatment, with a threshold of < £20 000/quality-adjusted life-year (≈$29 000/QALY). Previous UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for treatment initiation in those with stage 1 hypertension was consensus-based and suggested treatment for those aged under 80 with a 10-year CVD risk of 20% or greater.

The systematic review comparing antihypertensive drug treatment at different blood pressure (BP) thresholds, undertaken as part of updating the NICE hypertension in adults guideline, showed a reduction in CVD events from antihypertensive treatment for people with stage 1 hypertension (clinic BP 140–159/90–99 mm Hg). However, uncertainty remained about the cost-effectiveness of treatment in this population because at lower absolute risk levels, the number needed to treat was higher, and the balance of benefits and risks varied with different CVD risk levels.

In providing evidence for the 2019 NICE hypertension guideline, this study aimed to establish the 10-year CVD risk level at which initiation of antihypertensive treatment in people with stage 1 hypertension was cost-effective.

### Hypertension pharmacogenomics: in search of personalized treatment approaches [^113y48m4]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2016). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular and renal diseases are associated with many risk factors, of which hypertension is one of the most prevalent. Worldwide, blood pressure control is only achieved in ∼50% of those treated for hypertension, despite the availability of a considerable number of antihypertensive drugs from different pharmacological classes. Although many reasons exist for poor blood pressure control, a likely contributor is the inability to predict to which antihypertensive drug an individual is most likely to respond. Hypertension pharmacogenomics and other 'omics' technologies have the potential to identify genetic signals that are predictive of response or adverse outcome to particular drugs, and guide selection of hypertension treatment for a given individual. Continued research in this field will enhance our understanding of how to maximally deploy the various antihypertensive drug classes to optimize blood pressure response at the individual level. This Review summarizes the available literature on the most convincing genetic signals associated with antihypertensive drug responses and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Future research in this area will be facilitated by enhancing collaboration between research groups through consortia such as the International Consortium for Antihypertensives Pharmacogenomics Studies, with the goal of translating replicated findings into clinical implementation.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^1168APub]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the 2017 Guideline, 68 million individuals had uncontrolled hypertension and were recommended for antihypertensive therapy; of these, 35 million were untreated, and 33 million were receiving treatment but had not attained target BP levels. We advocate for the application of risk stratification to guide priority interventions in both cohorts, informing optimal escalation strategies for those inadequately controlled, and prioritizing interventions to address nontreatment in the untreated population. Drawing a parallel with lipid-lowering therapy, it is both rational and evidence-based to ensure that individuals at the highest risk receive the most effective — and, where appropriate, more intensive — therapeutic regimens. We propose that BP-lowering interventions should be classified by intensity, analogous to lipid-lowering therapies: low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to reductions in systolic BP of < 10, 10 to 19, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively. Those at the highest absolute risk should generally be prioritized for high-intensity regimens, provided adverse effects do not preclude their use. Achieving a mean SBP of ≤ 120 mm Hg is essential to maintain the majority of BP readings below 130/80 mm Hg over time, given the natural intraindividual variability in BP. Thus, all patients with untreated mean SBP > 140 mm Hg will require high-intensity regimens to attain and sustain optimal BP control and minimize cardiovascular risk. The substantial expansion of high-intensity therapy should therefore be directed primarily towards individuals at the highest absolute risk and with the greatest gap to achieving optimal BP. Given the heightened urgency in patients with high predicted risk, immediate pharmacological intervention — potentially with dual therapy — should be considered as the default strategy. Naturally, this approach must be tailored to patient preferences and tolerability; nonetheless, the evidence increasingly supports early, decisive intervention in those most likely to benefit.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^115Q3UvG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias, and performed data entry. The primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial), and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarised data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This update included one new study in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. As none of the four included studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment, we asked investigators for data for this subgroup. One study (PREVER-treatment 2016) used a combination of thiazide-type diuretic/potassium-sparing diuretic; as the former is not indicated in monotherapy, we analysed this study separately. The three original trials in the main comparison (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants) included outpatients, mostly European and white people. Two trials only included people with type 2 diabetes; the remaining trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia, or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. It is very uncertain whether combination therapy versus monotherapy reduces total mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 21.72), cardiovascular mortality (zero events reported), cardiovascular events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.41), serious adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92), or withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.35); all outcomes had 568 participants, and the evidence was rated as of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and for using a subgroup that was not defined in advance. The confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit. The PREVER-treatment 2016 trial, which used a combination therapy with potassium-sparing diuretic (monotherapy: 84 participants; combination therapy: 116 participants), included outpatients. This trial was conducted in Brazil and had a follow-up of 18 months. The number of events was very low and confidence intervals very wide, with zero events reported for cardiovascular mortality and withdrawals due to adverse events. It is very uncertain if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants, and hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the review question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^115ogRoy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension, but currently systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each. Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. Data from trials clearly indicate that, for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of < 150 mm Hg and a DBP of < 90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower — SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg. As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy. Because controlling BP to < 140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^1174mEMA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

Primary Objective

To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane clinical trial register, using standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

Main Results

Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension guidelines — blood pressure control gap and contributors: Despite the overwhelming evidence of treatment benefit, on average, < 50% of patients with treated hypertension achieve an SBP target of < 140 mmHg, and physician inertia and poor adherence to treatment, especially when based on multiple pills, are recognised as major factors contributing to poor BP control.

### Standardized treatment protocols for hypertension: global availability, characteristics, and alignment with the hypertension guideline recommendations [^112YM6UM]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension control is suboptimal globally. Implementing evidence-based, simple, standardized treatment protocols (STPs) has been instrumental in effectively and efficiently improving treatment and control of hypertension. We aimed to identify, characterize, and critically appraise hypertension STPs.

Methods

We defined STP as a series of steps for the pharmacological treatment of primary hypertension, with information on target population, BP threshold for treatment initiation, target BP, specific drugs/classes/doses, and follow-up frequency. STPs for adult patients were identified from the websites of relevant health organizations, Google search, and through expert consultations (until July 2023). STPs for secondary, gestational, or malignant hypertension or those that were templates/samples were excluded. Included STPs were critically appraised using HEARTS in the Americas Checklist for hypertension management in primary care and compared with the 2021 WHO hypertension management guideline recommendations.

Results

Fifty STPs were identified. All STPs had a stepwise treatment approach, involved guideline-recommended first-line drugs, and 98% consisted of at least four steps. Majority (54%) recommended monotherapy with calcium channel blockers as first-line treatment. Only 44% STPs recommended treatment initiation with combination therapy, and 16% recommended single-pill combinations. Most (62%) had dose-intensification as the second step. Most (74%) STPs did not provide complete dosing information. Only one STP mentioned a target time for achieving BP control. On average, STPs scored a performance of 68% on the HEARTS Checklist.

Conclusion

Several STPs are available globally; however, most of them have enormous scope for improvement through interventions aimed at alignment with the latest evidence-based guidelines and multistakeholder engagement.

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance.

### Consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension [^113UamHE]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Box.
Criteria for Classification of Recommendations

We found inconsistent guidance for a disconcertingly high proportion of reference recommendations. This suggests that clinicians evaluating and treating hypertension are often faced with impossible expectations, in that following one guideline's recommendations would mean going against recommendations from another guideline.

Regardless of measures taken to improve CPG development, a high degree of consistency and strong guidance may be unrealistic in hypertension management. The direct evidence for precise actions is often limited, the thresholds for action are often more continuous than binary, and the relative importance of benefits and harms is sensitive to an individual patient's values and preferences.

HYPERTENSION GUIDELINE AND TREATMENT CONTROVERSIES

Hypertension care is complex. Multiple guidelines with different treatment thresholds, diagnostic criteria, and target goals introduce potential program, communication, and management complexity may have contributed to the decline in controlled BP. The 2017 AHA/ACC BP guidelineand the report from members initially appointed to the Joint National Committee (JNC-8)have been the subject of debate and inconsistent implementation by some professional organizations and clinicians. For example, the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommended that patients with hypertension who are 60 years and older should be treated to a systolic BP target of < 150 mm Hg, aligning with the JNC-8 writing group recommendation, but conflicting with JNC-7 and the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline. It is unclear whether these inconsistencies contribute to reduced BP control. Of note, hypertension control to < 140/ < 90 mm Hg declined more in adults 40–59 years than in those 60 years and older. This finding suggests that factors other than the JNC-8 report and ACP/AAFP recommendations for a higher systolic BP target may contribute to the broad-based decline in hypertension control.

Management of hypertension in this country is confounded by continual changes in recommended target blood pressure (BP) goals and a nonhomogeneous patient population who have a variety of demographic and clinical characteristics that influence treatment. This paper focuses on three major elements in managing hypertension: BP and the importance of reducing it to acceptably low levels; concomitant risk factors or cardiovascular and renal target involvement; and drug therapy that may confer prognostic advantages beyond those predicted by BP effects.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^116auiTu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

While JNC 8 offers improvements over JNC 7 with a laudable dedication to high‐quality randomized evidence‐based recommendations, it leaves open some areas of improvement for the new ACC/AHA committee. By focusing solely on RCTs, we are left with areas of uncertainty where high‐quality observational studies could help elucidate effective recommendations to ultimately achieve the goal of improving hypertension control and the health of our patients. By creating a higher SBP treatment threshold for people > 60 years old, the very group who are at the highest CVD risk, implementation of JNC 8 recommendations could mean that > 6 million people in this category may not be started on treatment and an additional 13.5 million may have their treatment target liberalized, with potential detrimental consequences. 29

While the previous BP target of < 140/90 mm Hg could be liberalized for patients who are frail or > 80 years old, adopting these new guidelines in persons aged 60 to 80 years may lead to a resurgence of stroke rates. More research is needed, particularly on the use of estimated ASCVD risk cut‐points to inform therapeutic antihypertensive targets, but the new ACC/AHA hypertension guideline committee should consider a risk‐based treatment approach for adults > 60 years of age by; for example, initiating BP treatment for those with SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg based on a ≥ 7.5% 10‐year ASCVD risk score. Finally, the results from SPRINT will further undermine the JNC 8 recommendations and will likely result in a paradigm shift in how we treat hypertension.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to indications for treatment, general population, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating BP-lowering treatment in patients meeting the following criteria only from ≥ 140/90 mmHg under close monitoring of treatment tolerance, recognizing that the benefit of reducing CVD outcomes is uncertain in these patients:

- pre-treatment symptomatic orthostatic hypotension

- age ≥ 85 years

- clinically significant moderate-to-severe frailty

- limited predicted lifespan (< 3 years).

### Non-pharmacological aspects of blood pressure management: what are the data? [^114kPFtG]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects 29% of US adults and is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological data support contribution of several dietary and other lifestyle-related factors to the development of high blood pressure (BP). Several clinical trials investigated the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions and lifestyle modifications to reduce BP. Best evidence from randomized controlled trials supports BP-lowering effects of weight loss, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and dietary sodium (Na(+)) reduction in those with prehypertension, with more pronounced effects in those with hypertension. In hypertensive participants, the effects on BP of DASH combined with low Na(+) alone or with the addition of weight loss were greater than or equal to those of single-drug therapy. Trials where food was provided to participants were more successful in showing a BP-lowering effect. However, clinical studies with long-term follow-up revealed that lifestyle modifications were difficult to maintain. Findings from controlled trials of increased potassium, calcium, or magnesium intake, or reduction in alcohol intake revealed modest BP-lowering effects and are less conclusive. The reported effects of exercise independent of weight loss on BP are inconsistent.

### Reconciling multiple hypertension guidelines to promote effective clinical practice [^1177QiTj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

The new Joint National Committee 8 (JNC-8) blood pressure guidelines were recently published, and there are some major changes from JNC-7. There are also differences between JNC-8 and hypertension guidelines created by major organizations in North America and around the world published from 2013 to the present. In the face of conflicting evidence, it is difficult for practicing clinicians to reconcile these differences and to incorporate new guidance into their practice. This commentary will identify similarities and differences between guidelines, provide some literature context in the areas of differing recommendations, and then provide advice to enhance patient care.

### Developing hypertension guidelines: an evolving process [^114X8KMZ]. American Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertension guidelines provide up-to-date information and recommendations for hypertension management to healthcare providers, and they facilitate translation of new knowledge into clinical practice. Guidelines represent consensus statements by expert panels, and the process of guideline development has inherent vulnerabilities. Between 1977 and 2003, under the direction of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) issued 7 reports. The evolution of the JNC recommendations reflects the acquisition of observational and clinical trial data and the availability of newer antihypertensive drugs. Despite 5 years in preparation, NIH did not release a JNC 8 report and recently made the decision to withdraw from issuing guidelines. The responsibility for issuing hypertension-related guidelines was transferred to the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology. Without the endorsement of the NIH or the AHA, JNC 8 committee members recently published their guideline report. Notably, there have been discrepancies of JNC recommendations over time as well as discrepancies with recommendations of other professional organizations. The Institute of Medicine recently recommended criteria for "trustworthy" guidelines. Criticisms of the guideline process, and of the guidelines themselves, should not obscure their likely contribution to improved hypertension control and to decreases of mortality rates of stroke and cardiovascular disease over the past several decades. Nevertheless, translation of guidelines into clinical practice remains a challenge.

### Novel pharmacological approaches to lowering blood pressure and managing hypertension [^11377raU]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension is the leading cause of death globally, primarily due to its strong association with cardiovascular disease. The global prevalence of hypertension has surged over the past three decades, driven by rising rates of diabetes mellitus and obesity. Despite current antihypertensive therapies, only a small proportion of patients with hypertension achieve adequate blood pressure control, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies. In this Review we explore the challenges and emerging opportunities in hypertension management. Aprocitentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, is the first agent from a novel class of antihypertensive drug to be licensed since 2007 and exemplifies innovative treatments on the horizon. Here we also address the complex factors contributing to poor hypertension control, including genetic influences, lifestyle factors, therapeutic inertia and poor patient adherence. We discuss the limitations of existing therapies and highlight promising new pharmacological approaches to hypertension management. Integrating these novel treatments alongside current pharmaceuticals combined with improved diagnostic and management strategies could substantially reduce the global burden of hypertension and associated cardiovascular disease.

The guideline specifies a target range because the lower safety boundary assumes greater importance when BP is targeted to lower levels, and when SBP is lowered to < 120 mmHg in patients included in randomized controlled trials (older and higher-risk patients with comorbidities and cardiovascular disease), the risk of harm appears to increase and outweigh the benefits.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^1148paiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually try to achieve a blood pressure target. That target is the blood pressure value below which the optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. "The lower the better" approach that guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years was challenged during the last decade due to lack of evidence from randomised trials supporting that strategy. For that reason, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice during the last years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of trying to achieve lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to know whether the benefits outweigh harms when attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/ 90 mm Hg) for the treatment of patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were: to determine if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP associated with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension; and to determine if there is a change in withdrawals due to adverse events with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets", in patients with elevated blood pressure.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to May 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients allocated to lower or to standard blood pressure targets (see above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JAA, VL) independently assessed the included trials and extracted data. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, end stage renal disease, and other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean SBP and DBP, withdrawals due to adverse effects, and mean number of antihypertensive drugs used. We assessed the risk of bias of each trial using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: This update includes 11 RCTs involving 38,688 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. This represents 7 new RCTs compared with the original version. At baseline the mean weighted age was 63.1 years and the mean weighted blood pressure was 155/91 mm Hg. Lower targets do not reduce total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 11 trials, 38,688 participants; high-certainty evidence) and do not reduce total serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.08; 6 trials, 18,165 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that the benefits of lower targets do not outweigh the harms as compared to standard blood pressure targets. Lower targets may reduce myocardial infarction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96; 6 trials, 18,938 participants, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.4%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 250 over 3.7 years) and congestive heart failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92; 5 trials, 15,859 participants, ARR 0.6%, NNTB 167 over 3.7 years) (low-certainty for both outcomes). Reduction in myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure was not reflected in total serious adverse events. This may be due to an increase in other serious adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.59; 6 trials. 18,938 participants, absolute risk increase (ARI) 3%, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 33 over four years) (low-certainty evidence). Participants assigned to a "lower" target received one additional antihypertensive medication and achieved a significantly lower mean SBP (122.8 mm Hg versus 135.0 mm Hg, and a lower mean DBP (82.0 mm Hg versus 85.2 mm Hg, than those assigned to "standard target".

Authors' Conclusions

For the general population of persons with elevated blood pressure, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower blood pressure target rather than a standard target (≤ 140/90 mm Hg) do not outweigh the harms associated with that intervention. Further research is needed to see if some groups of patients would benefit or be harmed by lower targets. The results of this review are primarily applicable to older people with moderate to high cardiovascular risk. They may not be applicable to other populations.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: a global comparison [^113f1nZY]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, there are many local, national and international guidelines produced by different organisations that give recommendations for the management of hypertension. Studies comparing these guidelines have shown variation in recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and treatment targets for patients with hypertension. However, these studies compared a small number of guidelines, mainly from HICs and offered only a brief insight into their similarities and differences. Hence, scope exists to compare hypertension guidelines on a far larger scale and, importantly, across income settings.

As a condition for which the affected population predominantly live in LMICs, knowledge of variation in recommendations made to clinicians treating patients with hypertension in these settings remains poorly understood. This study aims to address this deficiency by examining the extent of variation across clinical practice guidelines for the management of hypertension internationally. The primary aim is to determine whether variation exists between CPGs for the management of hypertension through analysis of national and international guidelines from different income settings. Specifically, this study aims to compare the following:
Diagnostic thresholds for hypertension and staging of hypertension
Recommended treatment strategies for uncomplicated primary hypertension (in the absence of comorbidities)
Target BP for patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension
Whether different targets are recommended for the elderly and other at-risk subpopulations

### Clinical trial design principles and outcomes definitions for device-based therapies for hypertension: a consensus document from the hypertension academic research consortium [^11391nTT]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical implications of hypertension in addition to a high prevalence of both uncontrolled blood pressure and medication nonadherence promote interest in developing device-based approaches to hypertension treatment. The expansion of device-based therapies and ongoing clinical trials underscores the need for consistency in trial design, conduct, and definitions of clinical study elements to permit trial comparability and data poolability. Standardizing methods of blood pressure assessment, effectiveness measures beyond blood pressure alone, and safety outcomes are paramount. The Hypertension Academic Research Consortium (HARC) document represents an integration of evolving evidence and consensus opinion among leading experts in cardiovascular medicine and hypertension research with regulatory perspectives on clinical trial design and methodology. The HARC document integrates the collective information among device-based therapies for hypertension to better address existing challenges and identify unmet needs for technologies proposed to treat the world's leading cause of death and disability. Consistent with the Academic Research Consortium charter, this document proposes pragmatic consensus clinical design principles and outcomes definitions for studies aimed at evaluating device-based hypertension therapies.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

High-value care in hypertension for adults aged 60 years or older — most patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 150 mm Hg or greater who receive antihypertensive medications will benefit, with acceptable harms and costs, from treatment to a blood pressure (BP) target of less than 150/90 mm Hg. When prescribing drug therapy, clinicians should select generic formulations over brand-name drugs, which have similar efficacy, reduced cost, and therefore better adherence, and clinicians should consider the patient's treatment burden. Because some patients may have falsely elevated readings in clinical settings ("white-coat hypertension"), it is important to ensure accurate BP measurement before initiating or changing treatment of hypertension, and the most accurate measurements come from multiple BP measurements made over time.

### Should beta blockers remain first choice in the treatment of primary hypertension? A meta-analysis [^117T5Dgx]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Beta blockers have been used widely in the treatment of hypertension and are recommended as first-line drugs in hypertension guidelines. However, a preliminary analysis has shown that atenolol is not very effective in hypertension. We aim to substantially enlarge the data on atenolol and analyse the effect of different beta blockers.

Methods

The Cochrane Library and PubMed were searched for beta blocker treatment in patients with primary hypertension. Data were then entered into the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager package and were summarised in meta-analyses. 13 randomised controlled trials (n = 105 951) were included in a meta-analysis comparing treatment with beta blockers with other antihypertensive drugs. Seven studies (n = 27 433) were included in a comparison of beta blockers and placebo or no treatment.

Findings

The relative risk of stroke was 16% higher for beta blockers (95% CI 4–30%) than for other drugs. There was no difference for myocardial infarction. When the effect of beta blockers was compared with that of placebo or no treatment, the relative risk of stroke was reduced by 19% for all beta blockers (7–29%), about half that expected from previous hypertension trials. There was no difference for myocardial infarction or mortality.

Interpretation

In comparison with other antihypertensive drugs, the effect of beta blockers is less than optimum, with a raised risk of stroke. Hence, we believe that beta blockers should not remain first choice in the treatment of primary hypertension and should not be used as reference drugs in future randomised controlled trials of hypertension.

Why it is important to do this review

Proper understanding of the evidence for beta‐blocker therapy in hypertension requires a regularly updated systematic, comprehensive, and appropriate analysis of all currently available data. In 2007, we published a Cochrane Review which re‐assessed the place of beta‐blockers as first‐line therapy for hypertension relative to each of the other major classes of antihypertensive drugs. An update of the review was published in 2012. The current review is an update of the 2012 review.

### Clinical trial design principles and outcomes definitions for device-based therapies for hypertension: a consensus document from the hypertension academic research consortium [^114PEfYz]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Nonadherence to medications is recognized as a major factor in reducing BP treatment effectiveness and contributes to perceived "treatment resistance" in patients with hypertension. Indeed, nonadherence is highly prevalent (in up to 50% of patients), especially in patients diagnosed with severe hypertension. In individuals with perceived treatment-resistant hypertension, 50% of treatment resistance may be explained by nonadherence ("pseudoresistance"). In addition to adverse clinical events, there are numerous adverse consequences of suboptimal adherence to antihypertensive medications including a confounding effect on BP outcomes in clinical trials of device-based therapy for hypertension. Moreover, the time course of poor adherence can be variable, with fluctuating adherence over time, further confounding measurements of effectiveness.

Reasons for poor adherence to treatment are multifactorial. Treatment-, patient-, provider- and health care system–related factors affect medication nonadherence in patients with hypertension, but predicting nonadherence remains challenging. Several indirect and direct methods have been developed to assess treatment adherence. Assessing medication adherence helps guide medical treatment, avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful treatment intensification, decrease the number of medical visits at specialized clinics, and allow implementation of strategies to improve medication adherence. Medication monitoring and informing patients about testing have been shown to improve BP control, and adherence to antihypertensive medications is associated with lower cardiovascular risk. Inclusion of adherence assessment in clinical trials as described in this section is important for interpreting study outcomes, at least in the early development phase of device-based therapies, to inform the treatment effect.

INTRODUCTION

The European Society of Hypertension (ESH) published several guidelines (GLs) for the management of arterial hypertension in recent years to help physicians and patients make decisions in particular disease conditions. The last one was published in 2023, the ESH 2023 guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension.

The year 2023 marks the 20th anniversary of the hypertension guidelines of the ESH, which were published for the first time in 2003. It is evident that guidelines – based on past collected knowledge – are important regarding diagnosis and treatment, to prevent or delay the adverse effects of hypertension.

Several studies conducted in the past few decades have shown that clinical practice guidelines, for the management of cardiovascular diseases, include a small percentage, less than 15%, of the recommendations which are supported by Level A evidence, meaning that multiple randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses providing the highest level of evidence are not present. Furthermore, these studies also have demonstrated a steady temporal trend or small increase in Level A evidence. Based on a recent study comparing 50 clinical practice guidelines from 2011 to 2022, 16% of the recommendations were supported by the highest quality of evidence, Level A, at the same time, there was a slight global increase in Level A in recent years.

There are no systematic methods to measure quantitatively the helpfulness or quality of GLs, that is, how much help they provide to the physicians. Moreover, previous assessments/methods also pose several questions. Whether the previous analysis could provide an objective 'result' on the helpfulness of a GL, for example, based on: the frequency of recommendations and evidence, the frequency of evidence at each class of recommendation (Level by Class), or vice versa the frequency of recommendations in each level of evidence (Class by Level)? These questions underline the need to further develop the methods of assessing GLs, which can be improved by including implementation advice and translating scientific Evidence into Recommendations.

The ESH 2023 guideline was a further development of the 2018 guideline, in terms of structure and function, covering more than 40 new aspects in detail. In addition, several new clinical trials were completed in recent years, thus we have hypothesized that the 2023 guideline will provide greater help to clinicians in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. We also hypothesized that our method provides an objective assessment of the usefulness of a guideline, as a kind of 'quality control', and allows comparison of various medical guidelines.

### New drugs, procedures, and devices for hypertension [^112xHnWi]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Successful treatment of hypertension is difficult despite the availability of several classes of antihypertensive drug, and the value of strategies to combat the effect of adverse lifestyle behaviours on blood pressure. In this paper, we discuss two promising therapeutic alternatives for patients with resistant hypertension: novel drugs, including new pharmacological classes (such as vasopeptidase inhibitors and aldosterone synthase inhibitors) and new molecules from present pharmacological classes with additional properties in blood-pressure or metabolism pathways; and new procedures and devices, including stimulation of arterial baroreceptors and catheter-based renal denervation. Although several pharmacological targets have been discovered with promising preclinical results, the clinical development of novel antihypertensive drugs has been more difficult and less productive than expected. The effectiveness and safety of new devices and procedures should be carefully assessed in patients with resistant hypertension, thus leading to a new era of outcome trials and evidence-based guidelines.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: a global comparison [^114B8PeJ]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study identified 48 national and international guidelines for the management of hypertension. BP thresholds for the diagnosis and staging of hypertension, as well as BP target recommendations, were largely consistent across guidelines and across income settings. However, recommendations on antihypertensive drug therapy at each treatment step differed greatly, with guidelines from higher-income settings offering greater clinician autonomy in choice of antihypertensive drugs and dual-combination therapies, in contrast to lower-income settings, which may reflect drug costs or availability. The variation seen may represent the lack of a robust evidence base on management, particularly for lower-income settings, given research is focused on higher-income countries. Further research is needed to explore the reasons for such divergence in guidelines to better inform those involved in their creation and the clinicians using them.

### Interventional procedures and future drug therapy for hypertension [^112un9nv]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension management poses a major challenge to clinicians globally once non-drug (lifestyle) measures have failed to control blood pressure (BP). Although drug treatment strategies to lower BP are well described, poor control rates of hypertension, even in the first world, suggest that more needs to be done to surmount the problem. A major issue is non-adherence to antihypertensive drugs, which is caused in part by drug intolerance due to side effects. More effective antihypertensive drugs are therefore required which have excellent tolerability and safety profiles in addition to being efficacious. For those patients who either do not tolerate or wish to take medication for hypertension or in whom BP control is not attained despite multiple antihypertensives, a novel class of interventional procedures to manage hypertension has emerged. While most of these target various aspects of the sympathetic nervous system regulation of BP, an additional procedure is now available, which addresses mechanical aspects of the circulation. Most of these new devices are supported by early and encouraging evidence for both safety and efficacy, although it is clear that more rigorous randomized controlled trial data will be essential before any of the technologies can be adopted as a standard of care.

Further sham-controlled studies are needed before device-based therapies can be recommended for the routine treatment of hypertension outside of the framework of clinical trials, and the guideline states that use of device-based therapies is not recommended for the routine treatment of hypertension, unless in the context of clinical studies and RCTs, until further evidence regarding their safety and efficacy becomes available.

### Cost-effectiveness of hypertension therapy according to 2014 guidelines [^112aH9Xf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

On the basis of the 2014 guidelines for hypertension therapy in the United States, many eligible adults remain untreated. We projected the cost-effectiveness of treating hypertension in U.S. adults according to the 2014 guidelines.

Methods

We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model to simulate drug-treatment and monitoring costs, costs averted for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained by treating previously untreated adults between the ages of 35 and 74 years from 2014 through 2024. We assessed cost-effectiveness according to age, hypertension level, and the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease or diabetes.

Results

The full implementation of the new hypertension guidelines would result in approximately 56,000 fewer cardiovascular events and 13,000 fewer deaths from cardiovascular causes annually, which would result in overall cost savings. The projections showed that the treatment of patients with existing cardiovascular disease or stage 2 hypertension would save lives and costs for men between the ages of 35 and 74 years and for women between the ages of 45 and 74 years. The treatment of men or women with existing cardiovascular disease or men with stage 2 hypertension but without cardiovascular disease would remain cost-saving even if strategies to increase medication adherence doubled treatment costs. The treatment of stage 1 hypertension was cost-effective (defined as < $50,000 per QALY) for all men and for women between the ages of 45 and 74 years, whereas treating women between the ages of 35 and 44 years with stage 1 hypertension but without cardiovascular disease had intermediate or low cost-effectiveness.

Conclusions

The implementation of the 2014 hypertension guidelines for U.S. adults between the ages of 35 and 74 years could potentially prevent about 56,000 cardiovascular events and 13,000 deaths annually, while saving costs. Controlling hypertension in all patients with cardiovascular disease or stage 2 hypertension could be effective and cost-saving.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^112fR7qf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease with a major associated risk for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with hypertension require more than one antihypertensive agent to achieve and maintain guideline-recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. Identifying the most appropriate combination therapy for each patient based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Increasingly, single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are available. These offer potential advantages, including simplification of treatment regimens, more convenient drug administration and reduced healthcare costs. Evidence from meta-analyses has shown that the use of antihypertensive SPCs compared with corresponding free-drug combinations is associated with significantly greater rates of treatment adherence to medication and potential advantages in terms of BP improvements and adverse effects. A large retrospective database study of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in two-drug SPCs has also shown greater levels of adherence compared with the corresponding free-pill ARB/CCB regimens. Treatment adherence is an important issue for a chronic disease such as hypertension, with improvements in adherence expected to result in better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced CV and renal morbidity/mortality. This review will consider the choice of agents for combination therapy using two-drug SPCs and the rationale for using particular combinations in patients with hypertension and renal impairment.

Why should early combination therapy be considered?

Worldwide guidelines recommend combination therapy as a first-line treatment option for hypertension likely not to be controlled on monotherapy (e.g. 20/10 mmHg above target BP) because of evidence showing that only a minority of patients will achieve and maintain BP goals on monotherapy. The recent re-appraisal of the European guidelines also recommended the preferential use of SPCs to improve adherence.

There are a number of compelling reasons why early combination therapy should be used in patients with hypertension (Table 1), including lack of efficacy with monotherapy, greater BP control and attenuation of side effects associated with monotherapeutic treatment. In addition, hypertensive patients with comorbidities, such as renal disease, might benefit from additional effects of multiple antihypertensive agents, beyond those related to BP lowering.

### Cost-effectiveness of hypertension treatment according to 2017 American college of cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines [^11379kV2]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Compared with the 2003 Seventh Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7) guideline, the 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guideline (ACC/AHA 2017) expanded hypertension diagnostic criteria to blood pressure (BP) ≥ 130/80 mmHg and intensified treatment goals to < 130/80 mmHg. The cost-effectiveness of ACC/AHA 2017 guideline treatment has not been quantified.

Methods

We used the Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Policy Model to simulate hypertension treatment according to ACC/AHA 2017 compared with JNC7 in untreated US adults aged 35 to 79 years. Outcomes were projected over 10 years and included CVD events and deaths, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and total health care costs (ie, costs of antihypertensive treatment and costs of health care utilization for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular care, regardless of payer). Cost-effectiveness was calculated from a health care sector perspective as incremental health care costs divided by incremental QALYs.

Results

Under ACC/AHA 2017, 4.9 million more US adults are indicated for treatment and 14.9 million are recommended more intensive treatment goals compared with JNC7. Over 10 years, ACC/AHA 2017 versus JNC7 treatment would cost $48300 per QALY gained ($38300/QALY in men; $65200/QALY in women). Overall, 34% of CVD events prevented by ACC/AHA 2017 versus JNC7 would be from expanded diagnosis (at $120900/QALY gained), and 66% from intensified BP treatment goals (at $18900/QALY gained). Cost-effectiveness improved with a longer time horizon ($17600 per QALY gained at 30 years) and when generic drug costs were assumed in place of median US drug costs ($27900 per QALY gained in 10 years). ACC/AHA 2017 is cost-saving in adults with BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg and prior CVD or 10-year CVD risk ≥ 10%.

Conclusions

Initiating hypertension treatment according to the ACC/AHA 2017 guideline in untreated US adults is cost-effective compared with JNC7 at 10 years. Prioritizing low-cost generic medicines and intensive BP treatment of high-CVD-risk adults with BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg returns the most value.

### Screening strategies for hypertension [^1169MT2Q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a major public health challenge affecting more than one billion people worldwide; it disproportionately affects populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where health systems are generally weak. The increasing prevalence of hypertension is associated with population growth, ageing, genetic factors, and behavioural risk factors, such as excessive salt and fat consumption, physical inactivity, being overweight and obese, harmful alcohol consumption, and poor management of stress. Over the long term, hypertension leads to risk for cardiovascular events, such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, disability, and premature mortality. Cardiovascular events can be preventable when high-risk populations are targeted, for example, through population-wide screening strategies. When available resources are limited, taking a total risk approach whereby several risk factors of hypertension are taken into consideration (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle factors, diabetes, blood cholesterol) can enable more accurate targeting of high-risk groups. Targeting of high-risk groups can help reduce costs in that resources are not spent on the entire population. Early detection in the form of screening for hypertension (and associated risk factors) can help identify high-risk groups, which can result in timely treatment and management of risk factors. Ultimately, early detection can help reduce morbidity and mortality linked to it and can help contain health-related costs, for example, those associated with hospitalisation due to severe illness and poorly managed risk factors and comorbidities.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of different screening strategies for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension.

Search Methods

An Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS-Web), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) Bireme, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) without language, publication year, or publication status restrictions. The searches were conducted from inception until 9 April 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs (NRCTs), that is, controlled before and after (CBA), interrupted time series (ITS), and prospective analytic cohort studies of healthy adolescents, adults, and elderly people participating in mass, targeted, or opportunistic screening of hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of all retrieved studies was done in Covidence. A team of reviewers, in pairs, independently assessed titles and abstracts of identified studies and acquired full texts for studies that were potentially eligible. Studies were deemed to be eligible for full-text screening if two review authors agreed, or if consensus was reached through discussion with a third review author. It was planned that at least two review authors would independently extract data from included studies, assess risk of bias using pre-specified Cochrane criteria, and conduct a meta-analysis of sufficiently similar studies or present a narrative synthesis of the results.

Main Results

We screened 9335 titles and abstracts. We identified 54 potentially eligible studies for full-text screening. However, no studies met the eligibility criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is an implicit assumption that early detection of hypertension through screening can reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality, but this assumption has not been tested in rigorous research studies. High-quality evidence from RCTs or programmatic evidence from NRCTs on the effectiveness and costs or harms of different screening strategies for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality is lacking.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: a global comparison [^115xcWg5]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the largest single contributor to the global burden of disease, affecting an estimated 1.39 billion people worldwide. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) can aid in the effective management of this common condition, however, inconsistencies exist between CPGs, and the extent of this is unknown. Understanding the differences in CPG recommendations across income settings may provide an important means of understanding some of the global variations in clinical outcomes related to hypertension.

Aims

This study aims to analyse the variation between hypertension CPGs globally. It aims to assess the variation in three areas: diagnostic threshold and staging, treatment and target blood pressure (BP) recommendations in hypertension.

Methods

A search was conducted on the MEDLINE repository to identify national and international hypertension CPGs from 2010 to May 2020. An additional country-specific grey-literature search was conducted for all countries and territories of the world as identified by the World Bank. Data describing the diagnosis, staging, treatment and target blood pressure were extracted from CPGs, and variations between CPGs for these domains were analysed.

Results

Forty-eight CPGs from across all World Bank income settings were selected for analysis. Ninety-six per cent of guidelines defined hypertension as a clinic-based BP of ≥ 140/90mmHg, and 87% of guidelines recommended a target BP of < 140/90mmHg. In the pharmacological treatment of hypertension, eight different first-step, 17 different second-step and six different third-step drug recommendations were observed. Low-income countries preferentially recommended diuretics (63%) in the first-step treatment, whilst high-income countries offered more choice between antihypertensive classes. Forty-four per cent of guidelines, of which 71% were from higher-income contexts recommended initiating treatment with dual-drug therapy at BP 160/100mmHg or higher.

Conclusion

This study found that CPGs remained largely consistent in the definition, staging and target BP recommendations for hypertension. Extensive variation was observed in treatment recommendations, particularly for second-line therapy. Variation existed between income settings; low-income countries prescribed cheaper drugs, offered less clinician choice in medications and initiated dual therapy at later stages than higher-income countries. Future research exploring the underlying drivers of this variation may improve outcomes for hypertensive patients across clinical contexts.

EUROPEAN SOCIETY OF HYPERTENSION GUIDELINES

Historically, essential hypertension represents one of the first clinical conditions for which diagnostic and therapeutic clinical guidelines have been developed. The first official guideline paper dates back to 1977 when the Joint National Committee in the United States released the document, which was revised few years later in a new paper jointly issued by an 'ad hoc' Committee of the WHO in conjunction with the International Society of Hypertension (ISH). During the last decade of the XX century, updated versions of the guidelines document have been prepared by the previously mentioned organizations in collaboration with American scientific societies. The first guideline document prepared by European Societies dates back to 2003, when the ESH together with the European Society of Cardiology jointly signed the European guidelines document. New guidelines followed in 2007, 2013 and 2018, the latter being as previously mentioned, the most frequently cited paper in the worldwide medical literature. The new guidelines document, released during the 32nd European Meeting on Hypertension held in Milan in 2023 and published in the Journal of Hypertension, represents the most updated document on the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension.

Although an in-depth analysis of the guidelines is beyond the scope of this article, it should be mentioned that the 2023 guidelines document addresses a number of critical issues in the field of hypertension diagnosis and treatment, also offering to the readers elements of novelties. These include, for example, the thresholds and targets of the blood pressure-lowering intervention, the relevance of out-of-office blood pressure measurements, the modern quantification of cardiovascular risk, the greater use of organ damage measures, the upgrading of beta-blocking drugs to the level of major antihypertensive agents and the wider choice of drug combination between major drugs, with confirmation of their strategic role as first-line and subsequent treatment in the majority of patients. Finally, emphasis has been given to the treatment strategies based on renal denervation, particularly but not exclusively in drug-resistant hypertension, and to the patient's follow-up modalities, including the careful assessment of nonadherence as a fundamental barrier to the long-term blood pressure control.

Finally, given the importance of primary care providers in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the hypertensive state, ESH has decided to provide a novel concise format of the guidelines, the so called '2024 Clinical Practice Guidelines', for implementation into current clinical practice. The four pillars of these practice guidelines include the accurate diagnostic approach, the assessment of the patient's cardiovascular risk profile, the careful selection of the treatment strategy and the long-term evaluation of the blood pressure response.

Carey RM, Moran AE, Whelton PK. Treatment of Hypertension: A Review. JAMA. 2022; 328: 1849–1861. doi: 10.1001/jama.2022.19590 Importance. Observations First-line therapy for hypertension is lifestyle modification, including weight loss, healthy dietary pattern that includes low sodium and high potassium intake, physical activity, and moderation or elimination of alcohol consumption. The BP-lowering effects of individual lifestyle components are partially additive and enhance the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy. The decision to initiate antihypertensive medication should be based on the level of BP and the presence of high atherosclerotic CVD risk.

First-line drug therapy for hypertension consists of a thiazide or thiazidelike diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker such as enalapril or candesartan, and a calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine and should be titrated according to office and home SBP/DBP levels to achieve in most people an SBP/DBP target. Randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of BP lowering to reduce the risk of CVD morbidity and mortality. An SBP reduction of 10 mm Hg decreases risk of CVD events by approximately 20% to 30%. Despite the benefits of BP control, only 44% of US adults with hypertension have their SBP/DBP controlled to less than 140/90 mm Hg.

Conclusions and Relevance Hypertension affects approximately 116 million adults in the US and more than 1 billion adults worldwide and is a leading cause of CVD morbidity and mortality. First-line therapy for hypertension is lifestyle modification, consisting of weight loss, dietary sodium reduction and potassium supplementation, healthy dietary pattern, physical activity, and limited alcohol consumption. When drug therapy is required, first-line therapies are thiazide or thiazidelike diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers.

### Abstract… [^115qwZwT]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Choice of Agents Figure 1 is an algorithm that can guide combination therapy in patients with hypertension. 1, 6 JNC8, ESC, and ACC/AHA guidelines agree that for most patients, combination therapy should include a thiazide diuretic, a CCB, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARB. They further agree that a patient should not take an ACEI and ARB simultaneously. 4–6 Therapy should be escalated at one-month intervals using any of the three accepted strategies.
6. 4 JNC8 recommends that for black patients, at least one agent should be a thiazide diuretic or CCB. 6 Other drug classes may be considered for patients who do not achieve adequate blood pressure control on maximal triple therapy, or for those with comorbidities such as heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease with proteinuria. 4–6 Table 4 lists fixed-dose combination medications that are currently available. 1, 5.

Special Populations These general antihypertensive therapy recommendations complement treatment recommendations for each disease state. In some cases, antihypertensive medications may be used to treat the underlying disease regardless of blood pressure. For this reason, these recommendations should be used in conjunction with disease-specific guidelines. 31 The JNC8 found insufficient evidence to recommend preferential use of ACEIs or ARBs in patients with heart failure and hypertension 6; however, the JNC8 recommendations were published before the PARADIGM-HF results. The beta blockers carvedilol, extended-release metoprolol, and bisoprolol have shown improvements in morbidity and mortality. One of these agents should be initiated in patients with HFrEF unless they have contraindications. 32–34 Beta blockers are usually added once the patient no longer has symptoms of volume overload.

DIABETES Using a fixed-dose combination of an ACEI and a thiazide diuretic in adults with diabetes, the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension trial showed that a blood pressure decrease of 5. 6/2. 2 mm Hg led to lower rates of microvascular and macrovascular events and of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

### JNC 8 guidelines for the management of hypertension in… [^113PQ4sc]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In the general population, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg or higher in adults 60 years and older, or 140/90 mm Hg or higher in adults younger than 60 years.
- In patients with hypertension and diabetes, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, regardless of age.
- Initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, or ARB in the general nonblack population or a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker in the general black population.
- If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased, or a second medication should be added.

In the general population of adults 60 years and older, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when the systolic pressure is 150 mm Hg or higher, or when the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or higher. Patients should be treated to a target systolic pressure of less than 150 mm Hg and a target diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. Treatment does not need to be adjusted if it results in a systolic pressure lower than 140 mm Hg, as long as it is not associated with adverse effects on health or quality of life. There is no evidence that treating patients with CKD to a lower blood pressure goal slows the progression of the disease. Similarly, there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials showing that treatment to a systolic pressure of less than 140 mm Hg improves health outcomes in adults with diabetes and hypertension.

Pharmacologic Treatment In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial anti-hypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial treatment should include a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker. If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased or a second medication should be added. Blood pressure should be monitored and the treatment regimen adjusted until the target blood pressure is reached.
