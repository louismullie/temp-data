## Question

A 22-year-old woman presents to the cardiology clinic for follow-up. She has a history of rheumatic fever at age 12 and was diagnosed with moderate aortic stenosis due to rheumatic heart disease. She has not had any recurrent episodes of rheumatic fever since her initial diagnosis. She is otherwise healthy and is not currently taking any regular medications. On review of her chart, you note that she has not received any prophylactic antibiotics since she turned 18.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what is the most appropriate next step regarding secondary prevention of rheumatic fever in this patient?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step regarding secondary prevention of rheumatic fever in a 22-year-old woman with a history of rheumatic fever and moderate aortic stenosis from rheumatic heart disease, who has not received prophylactic antibiotics since age 18. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's risk category and whether she still meets indications for secondary prophylaxis. Then, I should verify the recommended duration of prophylaxis based on carditis and residual valvular disease. Next, I will consider the preferred antibiotic regimen and dosing frequency, including any risk-stratification adjustments for severe valvular disease. Finally, I will outline implementation details, adherence strategies, and follow-up plans, and I will double-check for any exceptions or special circumstances that might modify the plan.

> Let me first confirm the risk category and indication. The patient has documented rheumatic heart disease with moderate aortic stenosis, which constitutes persistent valvular disease after rheumatic carditis; this places her in the highest-risk group for recurrence and progression, for whom secondary prophylaxis is indicated indefinitely or at least until stringent criteria are met, and even then many guidelines favor lifelong prophylaxis in the presence of residual disease [^c23fe201] [^9fb8e24f].

> Wait, let me verify the duration rules so I don't overstate this. The ACC/AHA guideline specifies that patients with rheumatic fever with carditis and residual heart disease should receive prophylaxis for at least 10 years or until age 40, whichever is longer, and lifelong prophylaxis is reasonable in high-risk settings; given her current age of 22 and established moderate aortic stenosis, she clearly has not met the minimum duration and should continue prophylaxis now and for the foreseeable future [^c23fe201].

> I should confirm the preferred regimen and dosing. Intramuscular benzathine penicillin G is the cornerstone and generally superior to oral agents for preventing recurrence; the standard interval is every 4 weeks, with consideration of every 3 weeks in high-incidence settings or in patients with breakthrough recurrences despite adherence, so I would start with 1.2 million units IM every 4 weeks unless local epidemiology or prior failures suggest a 3-week schedule [^992ea5c8] [^c23fe201].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about injections in someone with valvular disease. I need to check for risk stratification regarding severe valvular disease and vasovagal events. The AHA presidential advisory notes that patients with severe valvular disease, including severe aortic stenosis, may be at elevated risk of cardiovascular compromise from IM benzathine penicillin; in such cases, oral prophylaxis can be considered, balancing somewhat lower efficacy against injection risks, so if she has severe AS physiology or prior vasovagal/syncopal episodes, I would pivot to oral penicillin V 250 mg twice daily with explicit adherence support and close follow-up [^8a800bab] [^61d01b6d].

> Let me consider alternatives if penicillin allergy or intolerance emerges. For patients with true penicillin allergy, sulfadiazine 1 g daily is an option; if there is sulfonamide allergy as well, a macrolide such as azithromycin can be used, though macrolide resistance and drug interactions must be considered and this is less preferred than penicillin-based strategies [^c23fe201] [^1122465f].

> Next, I should review adherence and systems supports because effectiveness hinges on actually receiving therapy. I will arrange enrollment in a registry or structured program where available, reinforce the importance of on-time injections, and if using oral therapy, ensure twice-daily dosing with adherence checks; data show that receiving at least 80% of scheduled doses substantially reduces recurrence risk, and programmatic strategies improve outcomes in real-world settings [^ccef6c6d] [^6e3a2c72].

> I will now examine follow-up and monitoring. Periodic clinical review and echocardiography are appropriate to track valve disease progression and reassess prophylaxis needs; while echocardiography informs severity and progression, the decision to stop prophylaxis in residual disease is generally deferred until stringent criteria are met, and many patients with established RHD continue prophylaxis lifelong, so I should set expectations accordingly and coordinate with cardiology for longitudinal care [^c23fe201] [^2c9ad11d].

> But wait, what if someone argues that stopping at age 21 is acceptable because she has not had recurrences since childhood? I should double-check that nuance. The 10-year or age-21 rule applies to patients without carditis or without residual heart disease; once there is persistent valvular disease, the minimum is 10 years or until age 40, and many guidelines extend to lifelong prophylaxis, so stopping now would be inappropriate and would expose her to nontrivial recurrence risk and further valve injury [^c23fe201] [^9fb8e24f].

> Final recommendation: I need to ensure the plan is explicit and actionable. Immediately restart secondary prophylaxis with benzathine penicillin G 1.2 million units intramuscularly every 4 weeks, consider every 3 weeks if high risk or breakthrough occurs, and if severe valvular disease physiology or vasovagal risk is present, switch to oral penicillin V 250 mg twice daily with reinforced adherence; continue prophylaxis for at least 10 years or until age 40, and in the presence of residual moderate aortic stenosis, plan for lifelong prophylaxis unless future echocardiography shows resolution and a specialist review supports discontinuation, with cardiology follow-up and registry enrollment to support continuity and outcomes [^c23fe201] [^992ea5c8] [^8a800bab].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **restart secondary prophylaxis with intramuscular benzathine penicillin G every 4 weeks** [^992ea5c8] because she has rheumatic heart disease with moderate aortic stenosis, which mandates lifelong prophylaxis [^c23fe201] [^9fb8e24f]. If IM penicillin is contraindicated or not tolerated, use **oral penicillin V 250 mg twice daily** [^c23fe201] or sulfadiazine 1 g daily [^45e24e00] as alternatives. Discontinuing prophylaxis at 18 was inappropriate; **lifelong prophylaxis is required** to prevent recurrence and progression of valve disease [^c23fe201] [^9fb8e24f].

---

## Indications for secondary prophylaxis

Secondary prophylaxis is indicated for patients with a history of rheumatic fever, particularly when there is evidence of rheumatic heart disease [^c23fe201]. The ACC/AHA guidelines explicitly recommend secondary prophylaxis for patients with rheumatic heart disease, including those with valvular involvement such as aortic stenosis [^f40d8073] [^a92f9583]. The rationale is that recurrent episodes of acute rheumatic fever can cause further valvular damage, leading to progression of heart disease and increased morbidity and mortality [^9fb8e24f].

---

## Duration of secondary prophylaxis

The duration of secondary prophylaxis depends on the presence of carditis and residual heart disease:

- **Rheumatic fever with carditis and residual heart disease**: Lifelong prophylaxis is recommended [^c23fe201].
- **Rheumatic fever with carditis but no residual heart disease**: Prophylaxis for 10 years or until age 21, whichever is longer [^c23fe201].
- **Rheumatic fever without carditis**: Prophylaxis for 5 years or until age 21, whichever is longer [^c23fe201].

In this patient, the presence of moderate aortic stenosis — a residual valvular lesion — **warrants lifelong secondary prophylaxis** [^c23fe201].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

The preferred antibiotic for secondary prophylaxis is **benzathine penicillin G**, administered intramuscularly every 4 weeks [^992ea5c8]. Alternative regimens include oral penicillin V 250 mg twice daily or sulfadiazine 1 g daily for patients who cannot tolerate intramuscular injections or have contraindications to penicillin [^c23fe201] [^45e24e00].

---

## Risks associated with discontinuing prophylaxis

Discontinuing secondary prophylaxis in patients with rheumatic heart disease significantly increases the risk of recurrent acute rheumatic fever, which can exacerbate existing valvular lesions and lead to further cardiac complications, including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and infective endocarditis [^9fb8e24f] [^70be7934]. Therefore, it is critical to maintain continuous prophylaxis in these patients [^c23fe201].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements consistently recommend lifelong secondary prophylaxis for patients with rheumatic heart disease, particularly those with residual valvular lesions such as aortic stenosis [^c23fe201] [^9fb8e24f]. The ACC/AHA guidelines emphasize the importance of secondary prophylaxis in preventing recurrence and progression of rheumatic heart disease [^f40d8073] [^a92f9583].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's history of rheumatic fever and moderate aortic stenosis, **lifelong secondary prophylaxis with benzathine penicillin G every 4 weeks is indicated** [^c23fe201]. If intramuscular injections are not feasible, oral penicillin V or sulfadiazine may be considered as alternatives [^c23fe201] [^45e24e00]. Discontinuing prophylaxis at age 18 was inappropriate, and prophylaxis should be resumed immediately to prevent recurrence and progression of rheumatic heart disease [^9fb8e24f].

Key points
- Acute rheumatic fever is a delayed sequela of some group A streptococcal infections.
- It affects many organ systems and has a varied clinical presentation.
- One manifestation, carditis, may result in long-term disability or death.
- Treatment involves antibiotics, which help prevent recurrent episodes. Overview Cause Acute rheumatic fever is a delayed sequela of pharyngitis and skin infections, such as impetigo, due to Streptococcus pyogenes. These bacteria are also called group A Streptococcus. Streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infection typically precedes the onset of acute rheumatic fever by 1 to 5 weeks. The exact disease process isn't fully known. However, the disease is in part due to an autoimmune response to S. pyogenes infection involving multiple organ systems. Keep Reading: Group A Strep Bacteria and How They Spread.

Manifestations by organ system Organ systems involved commonly include the
- Cardiovascular system
- Central nervous system
- Integumentary system
- Musculoskeletal system Cardiovascular system Carditis is the major cardiac manifestation of acute rheumatic fever. It occurs in 50% to 70% of first episodes and is associated with valvulitis. Central nervous system Chorea, also called Sydenham's chorea or St. Vitus dance, is the major central nervous system manifestation. Chorea often appears after the other manifestations of acute rheumatic fever. It also can appear as the only manifestation of acute rheumatic fever. Integumentary system Subcutaneous nodules and erythema marginatum are the two major skin manifestations. Nodules are most commonly present in patients with carditis. Musculoskeletal system Polyarthritis is the major musculoskeletal manifestation. Risk factors Certain factors increase the risk of someone developing acute rheumatic fever.

Age The incidence of acute rheumatic fever is highest in children between the ages of 5 and 15 years. Acute rheumatic fever is rare in children 3 years of age and younger in the United States. First-onset acute rheumatic fever is rare in adults, although recurrence may occur through adulthood. Close contact Crowding increases the risk of spreading group A strep bacteria and thus increases the risk of developing acute rheumatic fever. These settings include:
- Daycare centers and schools
- Detention or correctional facilities
- Homeless shelters
- Military training facilities History of acute rheumatic fever Individuals with a history of acute rheumatic fever have an increased risk of recurrence with subsequent streptococcal infections. The risk of recurrence after streptococcal infection is highest within the first few years after the initial attack and then declines.

Inadequate or lack of antibiotic treatment In approximately one-third of patients, acute rheumatic fever follows subclinical streptococcal infections or infections for which medical attention was not sought. Clinical features Clinical features Acute rheumatic fever is usually characterized by fever. Other symptoms depend on the affected organ systems. Carditis Clinical signs of carditis include
- Cardiomegaly
- Congestive heart failure
- New heart murmur
- Pericardial effusion
- Pericardial friction rub Additionally, a prolonged PR interval can be seen on electrocardiography. Subclinical carditis may also be present. In these cases, classic murmurs may not be appreciated on physical exam. Valve disease is found solely by echocardiography/Doppler studies. Chorea Chorea is a neurological disorder characterized by abrupt, purposeless, non-rhythmic, involuntary movements.

### Failure of oral penicillin as secondary prophylaxis for rheumatic heart disease: a lesson from a low-prevalence rheumatic fever region [^245b095a]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Our patient is an 18-year-old Caucasian woman from the UK who developed severe mitral stenosis on a history of childhood acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). She had been reporting of her oral penicillin secondary prophylaxis regimen since diagnosis. At the age of 15years, a new murmur was discovered during routine cardiac follow-up. An echocardiogram confirmed moderate-severe mitral stenosis. One year later, her exercise tolerance significantly deteriorated and she subsequently underwent balloon valvuloplasty of her mitral valve to good effect. Our case emphasises the evidence base supporting the use of monthly intramuscular penicillin injection to prevent ARF recurrence and RHD progression; it also emphasises the reduced efficacy of oral penicillin prophylaxis in this context. It particularly resonates with regions of low rheumatic fever endemicity. The long-term cardiac sequelae of ARF can be devastating; prescribing the most effective secondary prophylaxis regimen is essential.

### Is primary prevention of rheumatic fever the missing link in the control of rheumatic heart disease in Africa? [^b683c331]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease continue to be major public health problems in the developing world, particularly in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Because of its cost effectiveness, secondary prophylaxis is advocated as the principal means of disease prevention and control. However, in developing countries, valvular damage, due to earlier, unrecognized episodes of rheumatic fever, has already occurred by the time secondary prophylaxis is instituted. Secondary prophylaxis cannot reduce the incidence of new cases of rheumatic fever and has not been shown to alter the natural history of rheumatic valvular disease. Experience from several regions of the world suggests that incorporation of a strategy of primary antibiotic prophylaxis into a comprehensive program for disease control can reduce the incidence of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. In this article, we argue that a strategy of primary antibiotic prophylaxis, with appropriate modifications, can be successfully implemented in resource-poor settings across the world and should be a key component of any rheumatic heart disease control program. This, we believe, is essential for reducing the global burden of rheumatic heart disease.

Summary box

Important scientific issues around the rheumatic heart disease (RHD) secondary prevention paradigm remain unresolved.
We need a better understanding of RHD epidemiology to guide programmes, policies, and clinical and public health practice.
We need better strategies to find and diagnose people affected by acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and RHD.
We urgently need better tools to manage acute RF and slow the progression of RHD.
New and existing technologies for ARF and RHD need to be better integrated into healthcare systems.

### Valvular aspects of rheumatic heart disease [^2d4959ae]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease remain major global health problems. Although strategies for primary and secondary prevention are well established, their worldwide implementation is suboptimum. In patients with advanced valvular heart disease, mechanical approaches (both percutaneous and surgical) are well described and can, for selected patients, greatly improve outcomes; however, access to centres with experienced staff is very restricted in regions that have the highest prevalence of disease. Development of diagnostic strategies that can be locally and regionally provided and improve access to expert centres for more advanced disease are urgent and, as yet, unmet clinical needs. We outline current management strategies for valvular rheumatic heart disease on the basis of either strong evidence or expert consensus, and highlight areas needing future research and development.

ACC/AHA 2020 valvular heart disease—prevention of valve disease (Stage A): On a worldwide basis, rheumatic fever remains the primary cause of VHD; global health systems outcomes studies are needed to identify impediments to successful primary and secondary prevention of rheumatic heart disease. Other approaches to prevention, such as vaccine development, and delaying disease progression once valve damage is present should also be explored. Disease prevention in patients at risk of other types of valve disease is needed, including the control of known cardiovascular risk factors, and some subgroups at risk of calcific aortic stenosis (AS) can be identified, such as those with a congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) or elevated lipoprotein(a) levels; however, there are no known therapies to prevent valve dysfunction in these patients. Basic science studies on the genetic and pathobiological causes of valve dysfunction will provide insight into mechanisms of disease that might allow identification of patients at risk and allow early intervention to prevent disease initiation.

Echocardiographic screening in acute rheumatic fever—diagnostic role and criteria are outlined: echocardiography significantly enhances the diagnostic yield of carditis in suspected cases because mild and moderate pathological valvular regurgitations may be missed with auscultation alone. A longer duration of secondary prophylaxis is recommended to prevent the recurrence of rheumatic fever in patients with valvulitis. In 2015, the use of echocardiography was formally incorporated into the revised Jones criteria as a tool to diagnose rheumatic carditis, with subclinical carditis recognized as a major criterion for diagnosis of ARF.

Health system level

Guidelines for diagnosis, management and prophylaxis of ARF/RHD have been evolving, but still are fewer than needed and usually not evidence based. For the prevention of recurrence of ARF, the WHO recommends 3–4 weekly intramuscular BPG, the duration depending on age, time since the last episode of ARF, perceived risk of streptococcal infection and presence of RHD.In practice, monthly injections have been used to simplify the regimen and promote better adherence in patients with low health literacy and socioeconomic constraints, despite lack of strong evidence to support this approach. Patients should be divided into low-risk and elevated-risk groups, based on symptoms and the severity of underlying heart disease, and those with elevated risk (severe mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis and aortic insufficiency), decreased left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and no symptoms, should be considered for oral prophylaxis.In addition, multifaceted strategies for vasovagal risk reduction during BPG injections have been suggested, but no consensus guidelines have been widely adopted.

Managing RHD requires continuous linkage to the health system; this constitutes a major burden to already poor families and under-resourced health systems in most endemic areas. To do so, increased emphasis on health systems strengthening efforts, which are horizontal programmes across the health system, are needed as opposed to conventional vertical disease silos, which may undermine existing or much-needed community-led efforts. These efforts may be adapted to specifically address RHD by adopting a diagonal approach, whereby both vertical (RHD) and horizontal (health systems) needs are addressed, and community-level efforts are respected. These health systems usually lack the needed trained workforce, technology and infrastructure for the diagnosis and management, as well as to deal with primary, secondary and tertiary prevention.The health systems in endemic areas are equally ill prepared to integrate care across the lifespan for those affected, as they are typically based on vertical child and maternal health programmes. Moreover, health sector priorities and interventions to prevent and manage non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries in low-income and lower-middle-income countries have primarily adopted elements of the WHO Global Action Plan for NCDs 2013–2020–which are more easily externally funded– but do not include RF/RHD prevention and control.

### Penicillin reactions in patients with severe rheumatic heart disease: a presidential advisory from the American Heart Association [^8a800bab]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Secondary antibiotic prophylaxis with regular intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (BPG) is the cornerstone of rheumatic heart disease management. However, there is a growing body of evidence that patients with rheumatic heart disease who have severe valvular heart disease with or without reduced ventricular function may be dying from cardiovascular compromise following BPG injections. This advisory responds to these concerns and is intended to: (1) raise awareness, (2) provide risk stratification, and (3) provide strategies for risk reduction. Based on available evidence and expert opinion, we have divided patients into low- and elevated-risk groups, based on symptoms and the severity of underlying heart disease. Patients with elevated risk include those with severe mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, and aortic insuffiency; those with decreased left ventricular systolic dysfunction; and those with no symptoms. For these patients, we believe the risk of adverse reaction to BPG, specifically cardiovascular compromise, may outweigh its theoretical benefit. For patients with elevated risk, we newly advise that oral prophylaxis should be strongly considered. In addition, we advocate for a multifaceted strategy for vasovagal risk reduction in all patients with rheumatic heart disease receiving BPG. As current guidelines recommend, all low-risk patients without a history of penicillin allergy or anaphylaxis should continue to be prescribed BPG for secondary antibiotic prophylaxis. We publish this advisory in the hopes of saving lives and avoiding events that can have devastating effects on patient and clinician confidence in BPG.

### Research priorities for the secondary prevention and management of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease: a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop report [^ece7fe9f]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

For over 70 years, we have known that individuals affected by acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) experience poor outcomes when they are repeatedly exposed to group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection or recurrent episodes of ARF.Evidence and international consensus since that time have supported the use of continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis (‘secondary prevention’) to prevent such recurrences. Secondary prevention is the cornerstone of WHO-endorsed ARF and RHD control programmesand has been argued to be the most cost-effective strategy for reducing RHD mortality.

Despite the widespread acceptance of secondary prevention, several critical scientific and practical questions remain unresolved. For example, formulations of penicillin, the antimicrobial of choice, have not been modernised, and guidelines for its duration and dose are based on historical practices.In addition, susceptibility to and patterns of presentation of ARF and RHD are probably driven by genetic factors and systemic autoimmunity, but the mechanisms of pathogenesis, markers for diagnosis and therapeutics remain incompletely understood and largely unexplored.Finally, when large-scale secondary prevention programmes have been deployed—largely in better resourced countries, such as Australia—they have not achieved the expected level of success,suggesting that we need to reconsider long-standing assumptions and truisms about treatment approaches and programme implementation.

In November 2021, the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute held a workshop on research for RHD prevention and control. This paper is a report from the Secondary Prevention Working Group that was tasked with identifying critical gaps in scientific knowledge regarding RHD secondary prevention and management. These topics presented in this paper were identified through literature review and deliberation among the Working Group members. We view them as the most urgent and highest-priority research topics in RHD secondary prevention and management. The research priorities centre around four pillars, further elaborated in this report:

We need a better understanding of RHD epidemiology to guide programmes, policies and practice.
We need better strategies to find and diagnose people affected by ARF and RHD.
We urgently need better tools to manage ARF and slow the progression of RHD.
New and existing technologies need to be better integrated into healthcare systems.

Key points
- Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory condition that can affect the heart, joints, brain, and skin.
- Rheumatic fever can develop if strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo aren't treated properly.
- Symptoms often include fever and painful, tender joints.
- Treatment focuses on managing inflammation and symptoms.
- Serious complications include long-term heart damage. What it is Rheumatic fever is a condition that can inflame or make the heart, joints, brain, and skin swell. It's thought to be an immune response to an earlier bacterial infection. As the body's defense system, the immune system is important in fighting off infections. But when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, it causes inflammation. Rheumatic fever can develop after infections caused by group A Streptococcus, specifically: . Symptoms Rheumatic fever can develop about 1 to 5 weeks after a group A strep infection.

Common symptoms Symptoms can include:
- Arthritis
- Chorea
- Fatigue
- Fever Arthritis is most common in the knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists. Uncommon symptoms Rarely, symptoms can include:
- Nodules near joints
- Rash with pink rings and a clear center Heart-related symptoms Symptoms of rheumatic fever can also include symptoms of congestive heart failure:
- Chest pain
- Fast heartbeat
- Shortness of breath In addition, someone with rheumatic fever can have:
- A new heart murmur
- An enlarged heart
- Fluid around the heart. Complications If rheumatic fever is not treated promptly, rheumatic heart disease may occur. Rheumatic heart disease weakens the valves between the chambers of the heart. Severe rheumatic heart disease can require heart surgery and result in death. Risk factors Anyone can get rheumatic fever after having strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo.

Some factors can increase the risk of getting it. Age Rheumatic fever is more common in children than adults. Most common: School-age children Rare: Children younger than 3 years old and adults. Group settings Crowded conditions can increase the risk of getting strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo. Thus, these settings can increase the risk for rheumatic fever if those infections are not treated properly. These settings include:
- Daycare centers and schools
- Detention or correctional facilities
- Homeless shelters
- Military training facilities Other health factors Someone who had rheumatic fever is more likely to get it again if they get another group A strep infection. How it spreads People can't catch rheumatic fever from someone else because it's an immune response, not an infection. However, if someone with rheumatic fever is still infected with group A strep bacteria, they can spread the bacteria to others.

Group A strep bacteria are contagious. Keep Reading: Causes and How the Bacteria Spread. Prevention There are things people can do to protect themselves and others from group A strep infections. Preventive antibiotics also help protect people with rheumatic fever from getting it again. Keep Reading: Preventing Group A Strep Infection. Testing and diagnosis There's no single test used to diagnose rheumatic fever. Instead, healthcare providers can look for signs of illness and check the patient's medical history. They can also use many tests, including:
- Blood test to look for antibodies of a recent group A strep infection
- Echocardiography or echo
- Electrocardiogram or EKG
- Throat swab to look for a group A strep infection.

Secondary prevention of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) involves continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis among affected individuals and is recognised as a cornerstone of public health programmes that address these conditions. However, several important scientific issues around the secondary prevention paradigm remain unresolved. This report details research priorities for secondary prevention that were developed as part of a workshop convened by the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in November 2021. These span basic, translational, clinical and population science research disciplines and are built on four pillars. First, we need a better understanding of RHD epidemiology to guide programmes, policies, and clinical and public health practice. Second, we need better strategies to find and diagnose people affected by ARF and RHD. Third, we urgently need better tools to manage acute RF and slow the progression of RHD. Fourth, new and existing technologies for these conditions need to be better integrated into healthcare systems. We intend for this document to be a reference point for research organisations and research sponsors interested in contributing to the growing scientific community focused on RHD prevention and control.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^c23fe201]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Rheumatic fever—secondary prevention in rheumatic heart disease is indicated (COR 1, LOE C-EO), with recommended antibiotic regimens and durations as follows: Penicillin G benzathine 1.2 million U intramuscularly every 4 wk, Penicillin V potassium 250 mg orally twice daily, or Sulfadiazine 1 g orally once daily; for patients allergic to penicillin and sulfonamide, a macrolide or azalide antibiotic may be used, noting that macrolide antibiotics should not be used with medications that inhibit cytochrome P450 3A. Administration every 3 wk is recommended in certain high-risk situations. For duration, rheumatic fever with carditis and residual heart disease (persistent valvular heart disease) requires 10 y or until patient is 40 y of age (whichever is longer); with carditis but no residual heart disease, 10 y or until patient is ≥21 y of age (whichever is longer); without carditis, 5 y or until patient is ≥21 y of age (whichever is longer). In patients with documented valvular heart disease, the duration of rheumatic fever prophylaxis should be ≥10 y or until the patient is 40 y of age (whichever is longer), and lifelong prophylaxis may be recommended if the patient is at high risk of group A streptococcus exposure; secondary rheumatic heart disease prophylaxis is required even after valve replacement.

### Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of rheumatic fever recurrence and progression to rheumatic heart disease [^64855e53]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Rheumatic fever is a non-suppurative, inflammatory sequela of group A Streptococcus pharyngitis that can occur at two to four weeks after infection. Following an episode of rheumatic fever, there is a risk of developing rheumatic heart disease (RHD) later in life that carries significant risk of morbidity and mortality. RHD remains the largest global cause of cardiovascular disease in the young (age < 25 years). The historical literature provides inconclusive evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis is beneficial in reducing the risk of recurrence of rheumatic fever and development of RHD. Antibiotics are thought to work by reducing the carriage of group A Streptococcus and thus reducing the risk of infection. This review was commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) for an upcoming guideline.

Objectives

1. To assess the effects of long-term antibiotics versus no antibiotics (control) for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever recurrence and associated sequelae in people with previous rheumatic fever or RHD. 2. To assess the effects of long-term intramuscular penicillin versus long-term oral antibiotics for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever recurrence and associated sequelae in people with previous rheumatic fever or RHD.

Search Methods

We systematically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, clinical trial registers, ISRCTN.com and reference lists without restrictions on language or date up to 10 March 2024.

Selection Criteria

We sought randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised trials, described in any language, including participants with previous rheumatic fever and/or RHD of any age, based in community or hospital settings. Studies were included if they compared firstly antibiotic prophylaxis with no antibiotic prophylaxis, and, secondly, intramuscular penicillin prophylaxis versus oral antibiotic prophylaxis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standardised methodological, Cochrane-endorsed procedures and performed meta-analyses with risk ratios (RR) and Peto odds ratios (Peto OR). Our primary outcomes were recurrence of rheumatic fever, progression or severity of RHD and cardiac complications. Our secondary outcomes were obstetric complications (maternal and foetal events), mortality, treatment adherence, adverse events and acceptability to participants. We performed comprehensive assessments of risk of bias and certainty of evidence, applying the GRADE methodology.

Main Results

We included 11 studies (seven RCTs and four quasi-randomised trials) including 3951 participants. The majority of the included studies were conducted in the USA, UK and Canada during the 1950s to 1960s. Most participants with previous rheumatic fever had been diagnosed using the modified Jones criteria (mJC) (four studies), were an average of 12.3 years of age and 50.6% male. We assessed the majority of the included studies to be at high risk of bias, predominantly relating to blinding and attrition bias. Comparison one: antibiotics versus no antibiotics Pooled meta-analysis of six RCTs provides moderate-certainty evidence that antibiotics overall (oral or intramuscular) probably reduce the risk of recurrence of rheumatic fever substantially (0.7% versus 1.7%, respectively) (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.69; 1721 participants). People with early or mild RHD likely have the greatest capacity to benefit from intramuscular antibiotic prophylaxis (8.1%) compared to no antibiotics (0.7%) (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.29; 1 study, 818 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Antibiotics may not affect mortality in people with late-stage RHD (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.94; 1 study, 994 participants; low-certainty evidence). Antibiotics may not affect the risk of anaphylaxis (Peto odds ratio (OR) 7.39, 95% CI 0.15 to 372; 1 study, 818 participants; low-certainty evidence) or sciatic nerve injury (Peto OR 7.39, 95% CI 0.15 to 372; 1 study, 818 participants; low-certainty evidence) compared with no antibiotics, but probably have an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions (RR 137, 8.51 to 2210; 2 studies, 894 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and local reactions (RR 29, 1.74 to 485; 1 study, 818 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Comparison two: intramuscular antibiotics versus oral antibiotics Pooled analysis of two RCTs showed that prophylactic intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin likely reduces recurrence of rheumatic fever substantially when compared to oral antibiotics (0.1% versus 1%, respectively) (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.26; 395 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Furthermore, it is unclear whether intramuscular benzyl penicillin is superior to oral antibiotics in reducing the risk of mortality in the context of RHD (Peto OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.12; 1 study, 431 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no data available on progression of latent RHD or adverse events including anaphylaxis, sciatic nerve injury, delayed hypersensitivity/allergic reactions and local reactions to injection.

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis likely reduces the risk of recurrence of rheumatic fever compared to no antibiotics, and that intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin is probably superior to oral antibiotics (approximately 10 times better). Moreover, intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin likely reduces the risk of progression of latent RHD. Evidence is scarce, but antibiotics compared with no antibiotics may not affect the risk of anaphylaxis or sciatic nerve injury, but probably carry an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions and local reactions. Antibiotics may not affect all-cause mortality in late-stage RHD compared to no antibiotics. There is no evidence available to comment on the effect of intramuscular penicillin over oral antibiotics for progression of latent RHD and adverse events, and little evidence for all-cause mortality. It is important to interpret these findings in the context of major limitations, including the following: the vast majority of the included studies were conducted more than 50 years ago, many before contemporary echocardiographic studies; methodology was often at high risk of bias; outdated treatments were used; only one study was in latent RHD; and there are concerns regarding generalisability to low socioeconomic regions. This underlines the need for ongoing research to understand who benefits most from prophylaxis.

### Rheumatic heart disease [^a639bf6c]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Rheumatic heart disease, often neglected by media and policy makers, is a major burden in developing countries where it causes most of the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in young people, leading to about 250,000 deaths per year worldwide. The disease results from an abnormal autoimmune response to a group A streptococcal infection in a genetically susceptible host. Acute rheumatic fever--the precursor to rheumatic heart disease--can affect different organs and lead to irreversible valve damage and heart failure. Although penicillin is effective in the prevention of the disease, treatment of advanced stages uses up a vast amount of resources, which makes disease management especially challenging in emerging nations. Guidelines have therefore emphasised antibiotic prophylaxis against recurrent episodes of acute rheumatic fever, which seems feasible and cost effective. Early detection and targeted treatment might be possible if populations at risk for rheumatic heart disease in endemic areas are screened. In this setting, active surveillance with echocardiography-based screening might become very important.

### Introduction to aortic stenosis [^65e72bcb]. Circulation Research (2013). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is perhaps the most common of all valvular heart diseases in the developed nations of the world. Once primarily caused by rheumatic fever, the most common pathogenesis today is an active inflammatory process with some features that are similar to atherosclerosis. Because of this shift, the age at onset of severe obstruction has changed from the sixth decade 50 years ago to the eighth decade in most individuals today. The onset of symptoms remains a key determinant of outcome, although the later age at onset may make it difficult to discern if aortic stenosis or other age-related comorbidities is the cause of the symptoms. Once symptoms of aortic stenosis develop, life expectancy is shortened to ≈3 years unless the mechanical obstruction to left ventricular outflow is relieved by aortic valve replacement. Traditionally performed during cardiac surgery, aortic valve replacement now may be performed safely and effectively using transcatheter techniques, potentially revolutionizing the approach to this potentially fatal disease.

### Acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in indigenous populations [^90312c7f]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease are diseases of socioeconomic disadvantage. These diseases are common in developing countries and in Indigenous populations in industrialized countries. Clinicians who work with Indigenous populations need to maintain a high index of suspicion for the potential diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever, particularly in patients presenting with joint pain. Inexpensive medicines, such as aspirin, are the mainstay of symptomatic treatment of rheumatic fever; however, antiinflammatory treatment has no effect on the long-term rate of progression or severity of chronic valvular disease. The current focus of global efforts at prevention of rheumatic heart disease is on secondary prevention (regular administration of penicillin to prevent recurrent rheumatic fever), although primary prevention (timely treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis to prevent rheumatic fever) is also important in populations in which it is feasible.

Progression from mild RHD to severe RHD

Six individuals progressed from mild RHD to severe RHD while prescribed SP; 4 of these people had a documented recurrence of ARF in the intervening period, and 2 did not. The small sample size meant regression analyses were not appropriate. Time to severe RHD ranged from 4 to 54 months. Adherence between the most recent mild RHD classification and first severe RHD classification ranged from 53% to 100%. Five of the 6 people received <80% of their BPG doses. Characteristics of each individual are presented in Table 6.

Improvement from severe RHD to mild RHD

Five people improved from severe RHD to mild RHD according to available echocardiogram reports and cardiologist reviews; again, the small sample size precluded regression analyses. Time to RHD improvement ranged from 19 to 51 months; adherence ranged from 56% to 85%. Three of the 5 people received ≥80% of their BPG doses. Table 7 reports individual characteristics.

### Use of Doppler echocardiography to support the decision to discontinue secondary prophylaxis for patients with rheumatic fever and normal cardiac auscultation [^0a7d9bd4]. Pediatric Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Secondary prophylaxis remains the safest way to prevent or minimize heart valve damage in patients with rheumatic fever. However, criteria to determine the duration of prophylaxis have not been well established. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and Doppler echocardiographic profile of patients with rheumatic fever and a normal clinical examination at least 5 years after the first episode and to discuss the contribution of Doppler echocardiography in supporting the decision to discontinue secondary prophylaxis. An observational longitudinal study analyzing 183 patients with rheumatic fever and a normal clinical examination 5 years or more after the initial attack was conducted. The patients underwent Doppler echocardiography to study the severity of mitral or aortic valvular disease. Of the 183 patients, 77 (42 %) had clinical carditis. Subclinical chronic heart disease occurred for 79 % of the patients with previous clinical carditis and for 25 % of the patients without clinical carditis. Of the 35 patients with previous clinical carditis who were in the period of discontinued prophylaxis, residual valvular heart disease was observed in all, whereas of the 62 patients without clinical carditis, only 27 % showed residual valvular heart disease. Considering Doppler echocardiographic criteria, prophylaxis would be continued for 13 (34 %) of the patients with previous clinical carditis and for only 2 (3 %) of those without clinical carditis. Return of cardiac auscultation to normal is not always accompanied by return of Doppler echocardiographic findings to normal. Criteria regarding Doppler echocardiographic findings and valve morphology should be evaluated by the time secondary prophylaxis is discontinued. However, further studies are needed to demonstrate whether prolonged prophylaxis provides any benefit to patients with persistent echocardiographic findings.

### Tertiary prevention and treatment of rheumatic heart disease: a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute working group summary [^f674b211]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a neglected chronic disease preceded by untreated, uncontrolled and/or repetitive group A Streptococcal (GAS) infections and the consequent episodes of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). RHD cases have significantly declined in high-income countries (HICs). However, the same cannot be said for low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In select HICs, RHD remains prevalent in populations living in rural or remote areas or who have poorer access to healthcare services. As a result, while absolute and relative burdens have improved over time, Indigenous Peoples, immigrant communities and disenfranchised populations (eg, homeless people) remain at risk for ARF and RHD, as has been observed in Australia, Canada, the USA and some island states.The disease is endemic in the world’s poorest billion, with its highest burden seen among children, adolescents, young adults, females and pregnant women in LMICs. According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study in 2019, more than 40 million people worldwide are affected, and there are >350 000 new cases every year.Among patients with RHD, >300 000 deaths and >630 000 cases of severe heart failure (HF) occur annually.The most common causes of death are haemodynamic decompensation secondary to HF and arrythmias, sudden cardiac arrest and thromboembolic events.

Preventative interventions are an essential component of effective healthcare models, deployed during distinct stages of disease acquisition and progression to improve outcomes. These strategies are implemented during the symptomatic phase, to reduce the severity of the disease, as well as of any associated sequelae. Tertiary care, in the form of HF management and rehabilitation, is currently the primary treatment option available for the majority of the patients with RHD. While HF treatment has been shown to improve outcomes for patients with mild to moderate valvular disease, patients with severe valvular disease, especially mitral stenosis, usually require valvular replacement or valvuloplasty to improve quality of life.Women of childbearing age living in RHD endemic regions are especially vulnerable to complications of RHDleading to significant maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.Moreover, as a result of different cultures, traditions and associated potential gender roles, women may have poorer access to preventive and healthcare services, thereby increasing the risk of developing RHD and related complications.

### How many doses make a difference? An analysis of secondary prevention of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease [^98c4ce74]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We show for the first time that increased adherence to SP is associated with a reduction in ARF recurrence in our setting. An association with improved clinical outcome was observed across all levels of increasing adherence, but for practical purposes at programmatic level and for healthcare providers, monitoring dichotomized measures of adherence may be the most feasible approach, particularly where the quality of adherence data is uncertain. RHD Control Programs could continue using a target of ≥80%, but further examination of “breakthrough” recurrences is required. For those already diagnosed with ARF or RHD, SP up to the recommended age limit is crucial, but the majority of cases already have RHD at baseline, limiting the potential benefit of SP. The social determinants of health must therefore be addressed alongside innovative approaches including GAS vaccine development and ongoing initiatives to support adherence, in order to reduce the burden of this disease.

Rheumatic involvement of all four heart valves is rare. A 35 year old woman presented with gradually progressive exertional dyspnoea for the preceding 10 years. On evaluation she was in atrial fibrillation with congestive heart failure. Clinical examination found evidence of stenosis of the mitral aortic and tricuspid valves with a history of rheumatic fever in childhood. Transthoracic echocardiography showed the involvement of all four cardiac valves. Few reports are available in the literature describing rheumatic quadrivalvar damage. Operator awareness of possible rheumatic involvement of all four valves is essential for appropriate diagnosis.

The global burden of rheumatic heart disease continues to be significant although it is largely limited to poor and marginalized populations. In most endemic regions, affected patients present with heart failure. This statement will seek to examine the current state-of-the-art recommendations and to identify gaps in diagnosis and treatment globally that can inform strategies for reducing disease burden. Echocardiography screening based on World Heart Federation echocardiographic criteria holds promise to identify patients earlier, when prophylaxis is more likely to be effective; however, several important questions need to be answered before this can translate into public policy. Population-based registries effectively enable optimal care and secondary penicillin prophylaxis within available resources. Benzathine penicillin injections remain the cornerstone of secondary prevention. Challenges with penicillin procurement and concern with adverse reactions in patients with advanced disease remain important issues. Heart failure management, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of endocarditis, oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, and prosthetic valves are vital therapeutic adjuncts. Management of health of women with unoperated and operated rheumatic heart disease before, during, and after pregnancy is a significant challenge that requires a multidisciplinary team effort. Patients with isolated mitral stenosis often benefit from percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty. Timely heart valve surgery can mitigate the progression to heart failure, disability, and death. Valve repair is preferable over replacement for rheumatic mitral regurgitation but is not available to the vast majority of patients in endemic regions. This body of work forms a foundation on which a companion document on advocacy for rheumatic heart disease has been developed. Ultimately, the combination of expanded treatment options, research, and advocacy built on existing knowledge and science provides the best opportunity to address the burden of rheumatic heart disease.

### Penicillin reactions in patients with severe rheumatic heart disease: a presidential advisory from the American Heart Association [^6b2d8801]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Secondary antibiotic prophylaxis with regular intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (BPG) is the cornerstone of rheumatic heart disease management. However, there is a growing body of evidence that patients with rheumatic heart disease who have severe valvular heart disease with or without reduced ventricular function may be dying from cardiovascular compromise following BPG injections. This advisory responds to these concerns and is intended to: (1) raise awareness, (2) provide risk stratification, and (3) provide strategies for risk reduction. Based on available evidence and expert opinion, we have divided patients into low‐ and elevated‐risk groups, based on symptoms and the severity of underlying heart disease. Patients with elevated risk include those with severe mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, and aortic insuffiency; those with decreased left ventricular systolic dysfunction; and those with no symptoms. For these patients, we believe the risk of adverse reaction to BPG, specifically cardiovascular compromise, may outweigh its theoretical benefit. For patients with elevated risk, we newly advise that oral prophylaxis should be strongly considered. In addition, we advocate for a multifaceted strategy for vasovagal risk reduction in all patients with rheumatic heart disease receiving BPG. As current guidelines recommend, all low‐risk patients without a history of penicillin allergy or anaphylaxis should continue to be prescribed BPG for secondary antibiotic prophylaxis. We publish this advisory in the hopes of saving lives and avoiding events that can have devastating effects on patient and clinician confidence in BPG.

Approach 3: Drug discovery and development for secondary prevention

Existing clinical guidelines give preference to 3–4 weekly intramuscular benzathine penicillin G over other drug regimens.These recommendations come from decades-old studies showing that penicillin can reduce recurrences of ARF and that injectable, long-acting forms are more effective than oral forms.However, there are important reasons to re-evaluate these recommendations. The data are based on four small randomised controlled trials (around 1000 patients), all from the USA, in an era that predated echocardiography. Endpoints for these studies included recurrent ARF and GAS pharyngitis; the studies did not measure clinically relevant outcomes, such as progression of heart disease, mortality and adverse events. The quality of these studies was also low, with most having unclear treatment allocation and blinding and absence of prophylaxis adherence data, among other concerns.Further, the oral penicillin given in these studies used a less bioavailable form of oral penicillin (30% compared with >60% in modern formulations).

Older studies support the notion that oral penicillin is associated with a low frequency of ARF recurrence, comparable to intramuscular penicillin. In addition, oral penicillin remains an option in most major guidelines and is already preferred by many practitioners. What is needed are new experimental research studies to definitively establish the appropriateness of oral versus intramuscular penicillin in patients representing a range of RHD severity.

Research is also needed to explore new preparations of penicillin and to explore the efficacy of alternate antibiotic regimens. Very long-acting formulations of penicillin—such as subcutaneous or implantable products—have the potential for improved pharmacokinetic properties and may allow for better adherence.More importantly, antimicrobials that are equivalent or superior to benzathine penicillin—in terms of efficacy, safety and acceptability to patients—are desperately needed but do not appear near on the research horizon.

### Long-term outcomes from acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease: a data-linkage and survival analysis approach [^10b1fe80]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The NT RHD Register has previously been used to investigate ARF and RHD occurrence, progression, and survival for a population with a very high RHD burden.This study used a data-linkage approach to refine and expand that work to include adverse outcomes other than death and the influence of chronic disease comorbidity on adverse outcomes. Linking hospital inpatient data to the RHD Register enabled us to more accurately identify the timing of the onset of RHD, to identify the occurrence of serious complications, and to document chronic disease comorbidities in ARF and RHD patients.

Our results confirm the previous findingsthat the progression from ARF to RHD is rapid and is occurring faster than documented ARF recurrences; RHD incidence was almost 10 times higher than the incidence of ARF recurrence in the year after the first ARF episode. Secondary prophylaxis with penicillin is important for reducing ARF recurrence and the consequent worsening of heart valve damage, but the high proportion of patients with RHD at or shortly after their first diagnosed ARF episode demonstrates the limitations of secondary prevention and the importance of primordial and primary preventive strategies.

Secondary prophylaxis with penicillin is recommended to continue for 10 years after a diagnosis of ARF or to age 21, whichever comes later, according to Australian and New Zealand guidelines.US guidelines differ slightly, recommending penicillin for only 5 years or to age 21 after ARF without carditis,and Gordon et alindicate that a 5-year duration is commonly used in Canada. In the 10- to 14-year interval after the initial ARF diagnosis, we found an ARF recurrence rate of 1.41 per 100 person-years overall and 2.52 per 100 person-years among patients ≤12 years of age. This contrasts somewhat with our previous study that also confirmed decreasing recurrence risk in each year after ARF diagnosis (9%/y) but found that the risk fell to 0 by 10 years.These findings support the longer secondary prophylaxis duration recommended in our national guidelinesbut indicate that continuing low-level risk may persist thereafter, again emphasizing the fundamental importance of broader control strategies than secondary prophylaxis alone. Recommending penicillin for >10 years would be difficult to justify given the need to balance morbidity related to needle administration against the low risk of further recurrences more than a decade after the last ARF episode.

### How many doses make a difference? An analysis of secondary prevention of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease [^71346460]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In this cohort, 3 of 5 individuals who improved from severe RHD to mild RHD achieved ≥80% adherence, but only 1 of 6 whose RHD significantly worsened achieved high adherence, and this case—individual number 6 (Table 6)—appeared to have had evolving carditis from a protracted severe episode of ARF, and antibiotic adherence in this context was unlikely to have been able to affect their outcome.

Before the introduction of antibiotic prophylaxis, it was observed that heart valve lesions may resolve in ≈10% of patients, 36 but prophylaxis has been shown to dramatically improve prognosis, and Tompkins et al reported in 1972 that acute mitral regurgitation resolved in 70% of patients with ARF who were adherent to 4‐weekly BPG for at least 5 years. 37 These early studies used auscultation to determine disease severity rather than echocardiography, 38 so direct comparison with our study findings is not possible. A more recent study measured changes in valve lesion severity and all patients prescribed SP (n=6) had regression of mild lesions, but the methods of measuring valvular structure and function and calculating adherence were not described. A fourth study used valvular regurgitation as an indication of disease severity; regurgitation improved in 7 of the 13 people who received ≥75% of doses and did not improve in any of the people who were not adherent (n=4). 35 Our findings add to the existing body of literature by illustrating that even severe RHD can markedly improve, but this is uncommon.

Of the 131 survivors who were included in the secondary antibiotic prophylaxis analysis, all were prescribed intramuscular benzathine penicillin G at the time of diagnosis. However, only 67 (51%) patients had complete data available for review and were included in this subanalysis. Conversely, 64 (49%) patients had incomplete data due to hard-copy records that were lost, damaged, or otherwise incomplete. Of 67 patients with fully available data, 40 (60%) had more than 80% adherence to secondary antibiotic prophylaxis and 27 (40%) had less than 80% adherence to secondary antibiotic prophylaxis. Analysis of the 67 patients with complete data showed no association between adherence category and risk of cardiac-related mortality (HR 2·1 [95% CI 0·2–19·8]).

There was no statistically significant difference between those included in the study and those who were lost to follow-up in regard to age at diagnosis, sex, PR interval, mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, aortic regurgitation, or the presence of any major or minor Jones criteria (appendix p 3).

### Penicillin for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever [^2f87eace]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

People with a history of rheumatic fever are at high risk of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever and developing rheumatic heart disease following a streptococcal throat infection. Giving penicillin to these people can prevent recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever and subsequent rheumatic heart disease. However, there is no agreement on the most effective method of giving penicillin.

Objectives

To assess the effects of penicillin compared to placebo and the effects of different penicillin regimens and formulations for preventing streptococcal infection and rheumatic fever recurrence.

Search Strategy

We searched the Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2001), MEDLINE (1997 to July 2000), EMBASE (1998 to July 2000), reference lists of articles and we contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised studies comparing (i) penicillin with control, (ii) oral with intramuscular penicillin (iii) 2- or 3-weekly with 4-weekly intramuscular penicillin in patients with previous rheumatic fever.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Nine studies were included (n=3008). Data were not pooled because of heterogeneity. Overall, the methodological quality of included studies was poor. Three trials (n= 1301) compared penicillin with control. Only one of three studies showed that penicillin reduced rheumatic fever recurrence (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.92) and streptococcal throat infection (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97). Four trials (n=1098) compared intramuscular with oral penicillin and all showed that intramuscular penicillin reduced rheumatic fever recurrence and streptococcal throat infections compared to oral penicillin. One trial (n= 360) compared 2-weekly with 4-weekly intramuscular penicillin. Penicillin given every two-weeks was better at reducing rheumatic fever recurrence (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.83) and streptococcal throat infections (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.85). One trial (n= 249) showed 3-weekly intramuscular penicillin injections reduced streptococcal throat infections (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92) compared to 4-weekly intramuscular penicillin.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Intramuscular penicillin seemed to be more effective than oral penicillin in preventing rheumatic fever recurrence and streptococcal throat infections. Two-weekly or 3-weekly injections appeared to be more effective than 4-weekly injections. However, the evidence is based on poor quality of trials.

The need to establish an international ARF/RHD clinical network

As underscored throughout this report, the volume of clinical research on ARF and RHD has steadily increased in recent years, but research efforts have often been fragmented and of variable quality, leaving many key questions unanswered. The existing landscape of relatively small-scale, localised studies is both ineffective and inefficient. Without having the momentum of practice-changing research, it can be challenging to engage researchers and clinicians. The failure to work together on clinical research leads to missed opportunities to improve the lives of people and communities affected by RHD.

Research networks allow for the study of several related questions in large numbers of patients, magnifying the impact of resources.For example, acute coronary syndrome registries led to tools such as the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events score, which helps optimise patient care for this condition.Due to its protracted nature, RHD presents problems associated both with rare diseases, for example, the relatively small number of identified ARF cases and scarce tissue specimens for laboratory-based research, and with commonly encountered ones, for example, the large number of patients with established valve disease and their wide variation in treatment patterns and outcomes. Multinational studies can effectively address these problems. Further, demonstrating improvements in clinical outcomes relies on high-quality, adequately powered studies. These studies often require many more participants than can be recruited from single centres or even from one country.

In addition, a network centred on South-South collaborations that target marginalised, Indigenous, and resource-limited populations will have the greatest potential to generate practice-changing outcomes and address stark inequities in the distribution of research initiatives. This network could build research capacity in low-income and middle-income countries that would generate benefits beyond RHD. Related efforts have already produced useful results.What is needed is catalytic support for a research network that includes a coordinating role, for example, harmonising study protocols and overseeing the equitable distribution of resources across diverse sites. An early priority for this network would be developing a portfolio of trials that tackle many of the issues discussed previously regarding new ARF treatments and better approaches to secondary prevention.

### Outcomes of rheumatic fever in Uganda: a prospective cohort study [^d7e91eb2]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatic heart disease is an acquired chronic valvular disease that is the cumulative outcome of severe or recurrent episodes of acute rheumatic fever, an acute systemic inflammatory condition that results from pharyngeal or skin and soft tissue infections with group A Streptococcus pneumonia.Through prevention efforts, rheumatic heart disease has largely been eliminated from high-income countries, but the disease remains the number one cause of cardiovascular-based morbidity and mortality and disability-adjusted life-years in young people worldwide, the burden of which is overwhelmingly borne in resource-limited settings such as sub-Saharan Africa. Over 40 million people have rheumatic heart disease, which accounts for over 300 000 deaths annually.Secondary antibiotic prophylaxis with intramuscular benzathine penicillin G is the only intervention known to reduce progression and poor outcomes along the continuum from acute rheumatic fever to rheumatic heart disease, although the uptake of benzathine penicillin G remains suboptimal in areas where acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease are most endemic.

The past decade has seen a relative increase in research around rheumatic heart disease, but there has not been a parallel increase in research regarding its antecedent illness acute rheumatic fever. In part, this is because acute rheumatic fever is difficult to diagnose and characterise in resource-limited settings.Although acute rheumatic fever rarely leads to mortality in high-income countries, there is a substantial knowledge gap in our understanding of the clinical presentation, burden, and outcomes related strictly to acute rheumatic fever in resource-limited settings. Importantly, this deficit also hinders any improvements in the diagnosis, management, and outcomes of patients with acute rheumatic fever, particularly regarding prevention and therapeutics.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed with the terms “acute rheumatic fever” OR “rheumatic heart disease” AND “outcomes” OR “predictors” OR “mortality” OR “recurrence” for papers in English and French published between Jan 1, 1995, and Aug 9, 2023. There were no contemporary studies from sub-Saharan Africa reporting outcomes after acute rheumatic fever. Existing studies on outcomes primarily concentrated on retrospective cohorts from South America, southeast Asia, and Oceania that used tertiary patient data collected from hospital or government mortality records and were unable to distinguish outcomes related to acute rheumatic fever from those related to rheumatic heart disease.

Acute rheumatic fever follow-up with echocardiography—Serial echocardiography should be performed in patients diagnosed with or suspected to have acute rheumatic fever (ARF), as the cumulative incidences of ARF recurrence and RHD at 10 years are as high as almost 20 % and 51.9 %, respectively; however, there is a lack of systematic prospective scientific studies to make specific recommendations on the frequency and duration of serial echocardiograms after ARF, and recommended frequency for patients with established valvular heart disease, including chronic RHD, has been previously published.

Third, we need to leverage the latest genetic data available (eg, from large consortia) to test causal relationships of different complex traits, biomarkers and drugs on RHD via Mendelian randomisation.This may assist in the discovery of novel RHD risk factors, intermediate phenotypes or outcomes and candidate drugs.

Risk stratification

Ultimately, a more nuanced approach to antibiotic prescription and duration would ensure optimal outcomes and efficient use of limited resources. Good risk stratification would leverage a range of variables, including initial echocardiographic presentation, environmental risks and potentially genetic risks. A simplified score to predict RHD outcome at the time of presentation was recently developed and validated retrospectively in cohorts in Uganda and Brazil; another study found that it had good performance in discriminating cases in other countries.

Risk stratification has relevance for children found to have latent RHD. In a trial of secondary prevention among children with latent RHD, nearly half showed echocardiographic improvement, with most having normal echocardiograms after 2 years whether they received antibiotic prophylaxis or not.A planned subanalysis of risk factors for progression among these children is ongoing, and a follow-up study will refine recommendations around the duration of secondary prevention in this group (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05211024).

Health States

Patients on the NT RHD register are categorized as having mild, moderate, or severe RHD (Priority level 3, 2, and 1, respectively), as outlined in the Australian RHD guidelines. 13 We used this classification to describe disease severity (Table 1). Patients' priority levels are allocated by physicians, and are updated with each clinical encounter. It was assumed that patients remained in the same priority level each month between clinical encounters. Patients who require surgery are automatically assigned a “Severe” priority level (Priority 1) in the register; however, we modeled surgery as an explicit health state (Priority 1a). In cases where surgery was required at diagnosis, we modeled the assignment of the “Severe” priority level followed by a delay of less than 1 week before transition to the “Severe–Surgery” state. This change was required only at diagnosis to confine the initial states of RHD to mild, moderate, and severe.

Table 1 
RHD Health State Definitions a (Adapted From the Australian Guideline for Prevention, Diagnosis and Management of Acute Rheumatic Fever and Rheumatic Heart Disease, 2012) 13

According to the Australian RHD guidelines, a patient may transition to the “Inactive” state if they have completed a minimum of 10 years antibiotic prophylaxis after their most recent episode of ARF, and if there are minimal valvular changes on echocardiogram at the time of final review. Possible transitions between RHD states are illustrated in Figure 1.

Our analysis did not include 2 factors that could potentially affect the course of disease. Secondary prophylaxis data have only been entered into the register since 2007, and were therefore considered too incomplete to be useful. Recurrences of ARF were also difficult to capture, as they relied on a previous diagnosis of ARF, and some of our cohort had never had a previously recorded episode of ARF.

Data Quality Assessment and Exclusions

The date of RHD diagnosis was defined as the date of diagnosis recorded on the register unless there were clinical reviews before the recorded diagnosis date, in which case the date of first review was used as a surrogate. If a priority level had not been assigned within 1 year of a recorded RHD diagnosis, individual clinical records were reviewed and, where possible, a priority level was allocated based on available clinical information (including clinician notes and echocardiogram reports) contained in the register. Cases were excluded if there was insufficient clinical information to permit allocation of a priority level at diagnosis.

### Penicillin reactions in patients with severe rheumatic heart disease: a presidential advisory from the American Heart Association [^61d01b6d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

RISK MITIGATION

Based on the available evidence presented in this advisory, the expert working group believes patients with RHD who have severe valvular heart disease or heart failure may be at elevated risk of cardiovascular compromise and sudden death following BPG administration. In addition, the benefit of secondary prophylaxis is questionable given that the purpose of secondary prophylaxis is to prevent progression to severe valve lesions. Thus, we believe the risk of adverse reactions to BPG in patients at elevated risk outweighs its theoretical benefit. For these patients at elevated risk, we newly advise that oral prophylaxis, if reliably available and affordable, should be strongly considered (Table 1). We recognize in making this recommendation that there are availability concerns associated with oral prophylaxis in some settings, which will need to be considered. In many cases, regular prescribing of oral long‐term prophylaxis would require a commitment from government in order to ensure availability. Additionally, although unequivocally inferior, reducing the risk of acute rheumatic fever recurrence by 87% compared with 96% with BPG, high adherence to oral penicillin provides reasonable protection against recurrent group A beta‐haemolytic streptococci infection (71% versus 91% with BPG),and eliminates the risk of injection‐related vasovagal syncope, which may lead to increased mortality in this elevated‐risk group. Guidelines for oral prophylaxis can be drawn from American Heart Association (AHA)or World Health Organization (WHO)recommendations or from local guidelines and best practices, where they exist. Adherence support for those taking oral prophylaxis deserves special attention (at least twice‐daily dosing) and should be tailored as needed to promote high adherence.

Introduction

Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is the consequence of an abnormal immune response to an infection by β‐hemolytic Group A streptococcus (GAS) bacteria. There are several possible manifestations of ARF including fever and sore joints; the valves of the heart may also be damaged and residual scarring is called rheumatic heart disease (RHD). ARF and RHD continue to cause significant morbidity and premature mortality in disadvantaged populations; in 2015 there were ≈33 million people living with RHD worldwide. 1

Studies conducted in the 1930s showed for the first time that sulphonamide antibiotics could prevent ARF, and subsequent studies found that penicillin was superior to sulphonamides. 2 Penicillin eradicated GAS, whereas sulphonamides did not prevent carriage, and the dosing regimens were simpler, which improved adherence. 2 The first penicillin formulations studied involved multiple daily doses or several injections. 2, 3 Benzathine penicillin G (BPG) was subsequently proven to be the most effective formulation for eradicating GAS and only 1 intramuscular dose was required. 3 BPG remains the antibiotic of choice for primary and secondary prophylaxis of ARF. In accordance with guidelines published by the World Health Organization, 4 in many settings efforts to control RHD focus on providing a long‐term regimen of regular injections of BPG to people with a history of ARF or RHD (referred to as secondary prophylaxis [SP]) in order to prevent recurrent ARF. The painful nature of the injections, the protracted duration of the regimen (at least 10 years in Australia), and limited resources in many settings where ARF and RHD are prevalent mean delivering SP is challenging. 5 Increased adherence to BPG has been reported to reduce the likelihood of recurrent ARF in several populations, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 but there has been limited investigation of the effect of different levels of adherence, the methods used to calculate adherence are not always clearly described, self‐reported adherence is often used, and there is no rigorous evidence that the widely used target of ≥80% of doses is optimal or superior to other thresholds. To improve the effectiveness of RHD control programs internationally, a robust analysis of the association between adherence to SP and clinical outcomes is required.

### Incidence of acute rheumatic fever in Northern and Western Uganda: a prospective, population-based study [^6e07d843]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Overall, we can conclude that acute rheumatic fever exists at an increased prevalence in low-resource settings such as Uganda, even though routine diagnosis remains uncommon. Although these incidence data have probably underestimated the cases of acute rheumatic fever in two districts, they show that opportunity exists to improve community sensitisation and health-care worker training to increase awareness of the condition. Ultimately, this leads to diagnosing more children with acute rheumatic fever before they develop rheumatic heart disease, so that they can be offered secondary prophylaxis. A group A streptococcus vaccine will probably be the most effective strategy to prevent rheumatic heart disease. Until that time, novel strategies are needed to improve acute rheumatic fever diagnosis in low-resource settings.

### Epidemiology and prevention of valvular heart diseases and infective endocarditis in Africa [^f9705763]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Valvular heart diseases in Africa affect mainly children and young adults and are a result of rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is a preventable disease, but in Africa the combination of a lack of resources, lack of infrastructure, political, social and economic instability, poverty, overcrowding, malnutrition and lack of political will contributes to the persistence of a high burden of rheumatic fever, rheumatic valvular heart diseases and infective endocarditis. Combating and eradicating rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart diseases requires economic development and implementation of best practices of primary and secondary prevention measures. The barriers to achieving this goal in Africa are numerous, but not insurmountable.

### Outcomes of echocardiography-detected rheumatic heart disease: validating a simplified score in cohorts from different countries [^6991d993]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Globally, rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is the most prevalent acquired cardiovascular disease in children and young adults, affecting 40.5 million people and causing 306 000 deaths annually.RHD is strongly associated with poor socioeconomic conditions, resulting in an uneven global distribution. The highest burden of disease is seen in low‐ and middle‐income countries, where access to health resources is frequently suboptimal. In such settings, RHD diagnosis is frequently delayed so that at time of diagnosis the patient has established late sequelae and markedly symptomatic valve disease.RHD is a preventable disease and the role of primary prevention and secondary prophylaxis following a diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever is standard. Nonetheless, approaches for the management of latent RHD – RHD diagnosed by echocardiographic screening absent a history of acute rheumatic fever – remains controversial.

Latent RHD, is a relatively new diagnostic category.,Diagnostic definitions were initially heterogeneous. However, in 2012 the World Heart Federation (WHF) published standardised criteria for the diagnosis of latent RHD (ie, a diagnosis of RHD based on echocardiographic findings in patients that were asymptomatic without a known history of acute rheumatic fever). The WHF criteria define 3 diagnostic categories (definite RHD, borderline RHD, and normal),based on functional and morphological findings of the left‐sided valves.

Although diagnostic standardization enabled meaningful comparisons between RHD screening studies (a crucial step for research purposes) the prognosis of latent RHD and the impact of interventions such as secondary prophylaxis and intensive clinical follow‐up are still under investigation.Considering that disease progression, particularly from borderline to definite RHD, is considered a serious adverse health outcome,,,efforts have been made to identify subpopulations at highest risk of progression so as to target them with secondary prevention initiatives. For example, in Africa a subdivision of the definite category has been proposed based on the hazard for echocardiographic and clinical progression in those with different valvular manifestations of definite RHD.In addition, Nunes and colleagues developed a simplified echocardiographic score derived from screening studies in Brazil and Uganda which showed good discrimination of risk of progression in 2.3 years in a separate Ugandan population subset.Although follow‐up in this study was short‐term, the simplified echocardiography score holds promise as a tool for guiding patient care. However, a wider application of the score requires robust external validation in different settings.

### Echocardiography for latent rheumatic heart disease in first degree relatives of children with acute rheumatic fever: implications for active case finding in family members [^f3a44172]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Siblings <20 years of age diagnosed with definite RHD were recommended to commence benzathine penicillin secondary prophylaxis as per guidelines, based on the rationale that benzathine penicillin secondary prophylaxis prevents recurrences of ARF and worsening of RHD. New Zealand has a proven record of high adherence to benzathine penicillin secondary prophylaxis for individuals with RHD detected by echocardiography. We shared the uncertainty of the diagnosis of borderline RHD with the families and recommended enhanced surveillance with interval follow up echocardiography and education regarding the importance of primary prevention. Some families still chose to embark on secondary prevention usually influenced by the diagnosis of ARF in the index case or other family members with RHD.

Our study did not address the wider issue of population screening for RHD, nor the detail of which subsets of RHD should be offered secondary prophylaxis.

There is also currently a lack of international consensus regarding the appropriateness (or otherwise) of commencing adults with newly diagnosed and previously unrecognized RHD on benzathine penicillin secondary prophylaxis. However, there are other benefits of making a new diagnosis in adulthood including referral to cardiology services, potentially also improving pregnancy outcomes for women with RHD in their childbearing years.

Non-rheumatic cardiac abnormalities were detected in 2% of siblings and 10% of parents. We have previously emphasised that not all valvular heart disease found by echocardiographic screening in children is rheumatic. The high prevalence of non-rheumatic abnormalities in adults is in keeping with previous New Zealand echocardiographic screening studies in young adults of Māori and Pacific ethnicity. It must be anticipated that a number of non-rheumatic abnormalities will be found when echocardiographic screening is undertaken, some of which require physician follow-up.

### Outcomes of rheumatic fever in Uganda: a prospective cohort study [^05795251]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome measures were mortality, cardiac-related mortality, and acute rheumatic fever recurrence. Mortality was reported by the caregiver in the re-recruitment contact call and cross-referenced with registry records, and was based off of verbal autopsy. To avoid the acute period, recurrence was defined as any episode occurring at least 3 months after the initial diagnosis that was diagnosed by a clinician and communicated to the patient or caregiver or documented in the registry. The secondary outcome measures were change in mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and carditis category between baseline and follow-up echocardiograms, and any covariate that imparted increased risk of all-cause mortality.

Statistical analysis

Summary statistics were used to describe distribution (n, percentage) and central tendency (median, IQR) of baseline demographic and clinical variables and raw event rates and incidence rates were calculated for mortality, cardiac mortality, and acute rheumatic fever recurrence.

Follow-up time accrued from the date of acute rheumatic fever diagnosis until the date of death or censoring. Patients were censored on the date in which they were lost to follow-up or at the end of the follow-up period (Sept 1, 2022). Incidence rates were computed by dividing the number of new events over follow-up by the person-years at risk and multiplying them by 1000 to obtain rates per 1000 person-years of follow-up. All-cause mortality, cardiac-related mortality, and acute rheumatic fever recurrence were also evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analyses showing the probability of event-free survival over the study's observation period. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for correlates of mortality were identified using Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age and sex. A p value of less than 0·05 was considered significant. Baseline and follow-up echocardiographic data were assessed using summary statistics. Statistical analysis was conducted using R version 4.2.1.

Abbreviations ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate CRP = C-reactive protein mm = millimeters mg/dl = milligrams per deciliter. Initial acute rheumatic fever illness Criteria The presence of the following indicates a high probability of an initial acute rheumatic fever illness in any risk population:
- 2 major manifestations
- 1 major and 2 minor manifestations More than 1 joint manifestation: Classify them as either one major or one minor criteria, not both.

For example, if there's evidence of arthritis, then arthralgia doesn't count as a minor criteria. More than 1 cardiac manifestation: Classify them as either one major or one minor criteria, not both. For example, if there's evidence of carditis, then a prolonged PR interval doesn't count as a minor criteria. Preceding infection In most cases, there should also be evidence of preceding group A streptococcal infection. Evidence to support an antecedent group A streptococcal infection include:
- Positive throat culture or rapid streptococcal antigen test
- Elevated or rising streptococcal antibody titer. Presumptive diagnosis In some instances, a presumptive diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever can be made without fulfilling the Jones criteria. Use clinical judgement regarding diagnosis and antibiotic prophylaxis in areas of high acute rheumatic fever incidence when lacking clinical evidence.

### Acute rheumatic fever (...) [^6027edc5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Acute rheumatic fever is a delayed sequela of some group A streptococcal infections.
- It affects many organ systems and has a varied clinical presentation. One manifestation, carditis, may result in long-term disability or death.
- Treatment involves antibiotics, which help prevent recurrent episodes.
- As of July 10, 2025, there is a voluntary recall of Bicillin L-A, a preferred antibiotic to prevent recurrences. Find details in the Prevention section below.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with acute rheumatic fever. Overview Cause Acute rheumatic fever is a delayed sequela of pharyngitis and skin infections, such as impetigo, due to Streptococcus pyogenes. These bacteria are also called group A Streptococcus. Streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infection typically precedes the onset of acute rheumatic fever by 1 to 5 weeks. The exact disease process isn't fully known.

However, the disease is in part due to an autoimmune response to S. pyogenes infection involving multiple organ systems. Keep ReadingGroup A Strep Bacteria and How They Spread. Manifestations by organ system Organ systems involved commonly include the
- Cardiovascular system
- Central nervous system
- Musculoskeletal system
- Skin Cardiovascular system Carditis is the major cardiac manifestation of acute rheumatic fever. It occurs in 50% to 70% of first episodes and is associated with valvulitis of the mitral valve, or less commonly, the aortic valve. Central nervous system Chorea, also called Sydenham's chorea or St. Vitus dance, is the major central nervous system manifestation. Chorea often appears after the other manifestations of acute rheumatic fever. It also can appear as the only manifestation of acute rheumatic fever. Musculoskeletal system Arthritis is present in up to 75% of episodes.

Polyarthritis of the large joints is the most common musculoskeletal manifestation. Skin Subcutaneous nodules and erythema marginatum are the two major skin manifestations but occur in <10% of episodes. Nodules are most commonly present in patients with carditis. Risk factors Certain factors increase the risk of someone developing acute rheumatic fever. Age The incidence of acute rheumatic fever is highest in children between the ages of 5 and 15 years. Acute rheumatic fever is rare in children 3 years of age and younger in the United States. First-onset acute rheumatic fever is rare in adults over 35 years of age, although recurrence may occur through adulthood. Inadequate or lack of antibiotic treatment In approximately one-third of patients, acute rheumatic fever follows subclinical streptococcal infections or infections for which medical attention was not sought. Clinical features Clinical features Acute rheumatic fever is usually characterized by fever.

Other symptoms depend on the affected organ systems. Carditis Clinical signs of carditis include
- Cardiomegaly
- Congestive heart failure
- New heart murmur
- Pericardial effusion
- Pericardial friction rub Additionally, a prolonged PR interval can be seen on electrocardiography. Subclinical carditis may also be present. In these cases, classic murmurs may not be appreciated on physical exam. Valve disease is found solely by echocardiography/Doppler studies. Chorea Chorea is a neurological disorder characterized by abrupt, purposeless, non-rhythmic, involuntary movements. It's often associated with muscle weakness and emotional lability. Erythema marginatum Erythema marginatum is an erythematous, non-pruritic, non-painful macular lesion on the trunk or proximal extremities. Lesions are transient and tend to extend outward with central clearing and are often described as serpiginous.

### Anti-inflammatory treatment for carditis in acute rheumatic fever [^790de30d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatic heart disease remains an important cause of acquired heart disease in developing countries. Although prevention of rheumatic fever and management of recurrences have been well established, optimal management of active rheumatic carditis remains unclear. This is an update of a review published in 2003, and previously updated in 2009 and 2012.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harmful and beneficial, of anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin, corticosteroids and other drugs in preventing or reducing further valvular damage in patients with acute rheumatic fever.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2013, Issue 9 of 12), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1948 to 2013 October Week 1), EMBASE (Ovid, 1980 to 2013 Week 41) and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1982 to 17 October 2013). We last searched Index Medicus (1950 to April 2001) in 2001. We checked reference lists of identified studies and applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing anti-inflammatory agents (e.g. aspirin, steroids, immunoglobulins, pentoxifylline) versus placebo or controls, or comparing any of the anti-inflammatory agents versus one another, in adults and children with acute rheumatic fever diagnosed according to Jones, or modified Jones, criteria. The presence of cardiac disease one year after treatment was the major outcome criterion selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the methodology outlined in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration were used.

Main Results

No new studies were included in this update. Eight randomised controlled trials involving 996 people were selected for inclusion in the review. Researchers compared several steroidal agents such as corticotrophin, cortisone, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin versus aspirin, placebo or no treatment. Six trials were conducted between 1950 and 1965; one was done in 1990 and the final study was published in 2001. Overall there were no observed significant differences in risk of cardiac disease at one year between corticosteroid-treated and aspirin-treated groups (six studies, 907 participants, risk ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.15). Similarly, use of prednisone (two studies, 212 participants, risk ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.52 to 2.45) compared with aspirin did not reduce the risk of heart disease after one year. Investigators in five studies did not report adverse events. The three studies reporting on adverse events reported substantial adverse events. However, all results should be interpreted with caution because of the age of the studies and the substantial risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Little evidence of benefit was found when corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulins were used to reduce the risk of heart valve lesions in patients with acute rheumatic fever. The antiquity of most of the trials restricted adequate statistical analysis of the data and acceptable assessment of clinical outcomes by current standards. In addition, risk of bias was substantial, so results should be viewed with caution. New randomised controlled trials in patients with acute rheumatic fever are warranted to assess the effects of corticosteroids such as oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone and the effects of other new anti-inflammatory agents. Advances in echocardiography will allow more objective and precise assessments of cardiac outcomes.

### Clinical impact and costs of echocardiographic screening for rheumatic heart disease [^c5ccc1b7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

An 18‐year‐old lies in bed in a lower‐income country. He has just experienced an embolic stroke that originated on his infected mechanical mitral prosthesis, placed 2 years prior for severe rheumatic mitral stenosis. This true story is paradigmatic of the burdens created by rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in developing nations and underserved regions of developed nations. What if this tragedy could have been prevented by simple diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis so he never developed RHD? What if he had been started on secondary prophylaxis for rheumatic fever after echocardiographic screening for early RHD when he was in grade school? The basic issue is whether we can prevent RHD in low‐resource settings by a combination of primary prevention, screening for early disease, and secondary therapy to prevent progressive valve damage. However, there are many other public health needs and not enough funding in low‐resource settings. Agencies tasked with finding best use of limited resources often have little data to help guide difficult decisions.

RHD is rare in higher‐income countries but still ravages the populations of lower/middle‐income countries, afflicting patients from grade school age to older adulthood. There are upwards of 33 million patients with RHD, 275 000 deaths per year, and over 9 million Disability‐Adjusted Life Years lost. 1 The prevalence peaks between 25 and 40 years of age, with a female predominance. 2, 3 Heart failure symptoms, infective endocarditis, sudden death, atrial fibrillation, and embolic stroke are frequent complications. 4 RHD is caused by repeated bouts of acute rheumatic fever with a subsequent immunological reaction to group A Streptococcus infection. Damage to heart values, most often the mitral valve, is characterized by thickening of the valve leaflets tips, fusion of the commissures between the leaflets, and chordal shortening, thickening, and fusion. Penicillin prophylaxis is indicated in patients with subclinical and clinical RHD to prevent repeat episodes of acute rheumatic fever and thereby circumvent or delay progression to more severe disease. 5

In this context, echocardiographic screening for RHD makes sense: The burden of disease is considerable, there is an intervention that is indicated to alleviate the burden, and echocardiographic screening identifies more candidates for the intervention than other screening methods. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 But money is always a factor, and the 2 papers by Cannon et al 15, 16 in this issue of JAHA provide important insights into disease progression and cost utility of echocardiographic screening.

### Acute rheumatic fever [^55fb354a]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and its chronic sequela, rheumatic heart disease (RHD), have become rare in most affluent populations, but remain unchecked in developing countries and in some poor, mainly indigenous populations in wealthy countries. More than a century of research, mainly in North America and Europe, has improved our understanding of ARF and RHD. However, whether traditional views need to be updated in view of the epidemiological shift of the past 50 years is still to be established, and improved data from developing countries are needed. Doctors who work in populations with a high incidence of ARF are adapting existing diagnostic guidelines to increase their sensitivity. Group A streptococcal vaccines are still years away from being available and, even if the obstacles of serotype coverage and safety can be overcome, their cost could make them inaccessible to the populations that need them most. New approaches to primary prevention are needed given the limitations of primary prophylaxis as a population-based strategy. The most effective approach for control of ARF and RHD is secondary prophylaxis, which is best delivered as part of a coordinated control programme.

Key research topic 3: improve diagnosis of RHD

Suggested approaches

Approach 1: Improve our understanding of RHD risk

While it has long been established that there are both genetic and environmental risks for developing RHD, the nuances of those risks are unclear. We have yet to fully understand the drivers of risk between GAS infection and development of ARF, the factors that influence if a person who suffers from ARF will develop chronic RHD, and how this knowledge could improve identification of high-risk individuals. Understanding why only some affected by ARF go on to develop RHD can help us tailor recommendations regarding use and duration of secondary prevention based on individual risk to reduce the burden on healthcare systems and patients and rationalise the long-term use of antibiotics.

Environmental susceptibility

Most of the differences in RHD risk across populations are probably the result of environmental factors, but the contribution of individual factors is less clear, since most are associated with conditions of socioeconomic disadvantage.The best-described environmental risk is household crowding,which may also be the most amenable to targeted interventions. Little has been done in research for primordial RHD prevention, but a pilot study of a community-led programme including primordial and primary prevention in Northern Australia suggests this approach could be feasible.Future research on environmental susceptibility as it relates to secondary prevention should focus on improving the understanding of risk for progression, need for cardiac intervention and mortality. This work could identify important environmental modifications and have an impact of risk stratification to inform secondary prevention strategies and duration.

### Acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease among children-American Samoa, 2011-2012 (...) [^70be7934]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute rheumatic fever is a nonsuppurative, immune-mediated consequence of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Recurrent or severe acute rheumatic fever can cause permanent cardiac valve damage and rheumatic heart disease, which increases the risk for cardiac conditions. Using data from medical records, acute rheumatic fever incidence was calculated as 1. 1 and
1. 5 cases per 1, 000 children aged ≤18 years in 2011 and 2012, respectively; 49% of those with acute rheumatic fever subsequently received a diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease. Noncompliance with recommended prophylaxis with BPG after physician-diagnosed acute rheumatic fever was noted for 22 of 65 patients. Rheumatic heart disease point prevalence was 3. 2 cases per 1, 000 children in August
2013.

Establishment of a coordinated acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease control program in American Samoa, likely would improve diagnosis, treatment, and patient compliance with BPG prophylaxis. In addition, hospital patient registries for BPG prophylaxis were reviewed to identify additional acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease patients. Duplicate cases were excluded. Medical records for all identified patients were reviewed to verify acute rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease diagnoses and BPG prophylaxis noncompliance, which included recorded missed or late doses. Acute rheumatic fever incidence was 1. 1 and
1. 5 cases per 1, 000 children, for 2011 and 2012, respectively. Of 65 children with physician-diagnosed acute rheumatic fever during 2011–2012, a total of 32 subsequently received a diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease.

Acute rheumatic fever patients were predominantly male; median age at acute rheumatic fever diagnosis was 11 years. The 41 patients with available data were of Polynesian or Fijian origin. Twelve patients had a diagnosis of pharyngitis noted in the medical record during the 6 weeks preceding acute rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease diagnosis. Noncompliance with post–acute rheumatic fever prophylaxis with BPG was noted for 22 patients. Among 32 rheumatic heart disease patients with data, 21 received a diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease without a previous acute rheumatic fever diagnosis noted in the medical record, indicating that certain patients did not seek care or did not receive a diagnosis until after the disease had progressed. The point prevalence of rheumatic heart disease was 3. 2 cases per 1, 000 children in August
2013.

Of 34 pharyngitis diagnoses made during 2011–2012 and reviewed in acute rheumatic fever patient records, three were made using rapid antigen detection testing, 15 were made using throat culture, and 16 were made without any diagnostic testing. Acute rheumatic fever, characterized primarily by carditis, chorea, and polyarthritis, occurs a minimum of 2–3 weeks after an episode of untreated or inadequately treated pharyngitis. Acute rheumatic fever does not cause lasting damage to the nervous tissue or joints. However, damage to heart valves can be irreversible and is worsened by repeat episodes of acute rheumatic fever. Permanent valvular damage, or rheumatic heart disease, increases the risk for infective endocarditis, stroke, heart failure, and premature death, and might necessitate valve replacement surgery.

### Research priorities for the secondary prevention and management of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease: a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop report [^2e0f3880]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Suggested approaches

To improve global estimates of RHD burden, we need two critical types of data that do not currently exist. First, we need longitudinal studies of disease progression, complication rates and excess mortality risk among representative samples of persons with RHD in the general population, not highly biased samples from tertiary hospitals. Second, we need detailed, nationally representative cause-of-death data for RHD—perhaps in tandem with measurements of other cardiovascular diseases—in countries that do not currently have good vital registration systems.

These two types of data could be obtained by establishing surveillance sites with sufficient resources to do frequent screening for RHD among the public and follow individuals for many years, with linkages to healthcare utilisation datasets and death certification. In principle, these sites could have substantial benefits beyond RHD, for example, by screening for other structural heart diseases and doing assessments related to ischaemic heart disease and stroke and their major risk factors. The Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites model could be adapted to gain insights into long-term trends in cardiovascular-specific outcomes in the general population.Such research efforts should be done in partnership with local governments to strengthen health information systems and vital registration systems rather than compete with or inadvertently undermine them.

Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) affects ≈40 million people and claims nearly 300000 lives each year. The historic passing of a World Health Assembly resolution on RHD in 2018 now mandates a coordinated global response. The American Heart Association is committed to serving as a global champion and leader in RHD care and prevention. Here, we pledge support in 5 key areas: (1) professional healthcare worker education and training, (2) technical support for the implementation of evidence-based strategies for rheumatic fever/RHD prevention, (3) access to essential medications and technologies, (4) research, and (5) advocacy to increase global awareness, resources, and capacity for RHD control. In bolstering the efforts of the American Heart Association to combat RHD, we hope to inspire others to collaborate, communicate, and contribute.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for rheumatic fever, more specifically with respect to risk stratification, AAP/AHA 2009 guidelines recommend to recognize that adult patients with acute pharyngitis have a much lower incidence of group A Streptococcus infections, and the risk of an initial attack of ARF is extremely low even in patients with an undiagnosed and untreated episode of group A Streptococcus pharyngitis.

Regarding preventative measures for rheumatic fever, more specifically with respect to primary prevention, testing, IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to do not test for GAS pharyngitis in < 3 years old pediatric patients because ARF is rare in this age group and the incidence of streptococcal pharyngitis and the classic presentation of streptococcal pharyngitis are uncommon. Consider testing selected patients of this age group in the presence of risk factors, such as an older sibling with group A streptococcal infection.

### Quantifying infective endocarditis risk in patients with predisposing cardiac conditions [^0c87cd19]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The high proportion of individuals with a previous history of IE (21%), prosthetic (24%), or repaired heart valves (19%) who had a poor outcome and died during an IE admission is not surprising, and most guidelines recognize such individuals as ‘high risk’. The significant number of individuals with CIEDs who develop IE and die (30%), however, has only recently been highlighted. Moreover, the high proportions with a previous history of rheumatic fever (30%) or non-rheumatic valve disease (24%) who have a poor outcome and die are unexpected and concerning. Several factors could explain this. Not being labelled ‘high risk’ could result in a lower index of suspicion for the early diagnosis of IE and an inappropriate sense that treatment need not be as intense as for those labelled ‘high risk’, leading to delayed diagnosis, less effective treatment, and worse outcomes. It is also possible that using hospital admission data to identify ‘moderate-risk’ individuals, we selected those with more severe disease or co-morbidities that could increase their risk of IE (including health care-related IE).

### Acute rheumatic fever [^cf0082e1]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Acute rheumatic fever is caused by an autoimmune response to throat infection with Streptococcus pyogenes. Cardiac involvement during acute rheumatic fever can result in rheumatic heart disease, which can cause heart failure and premature mortality. Poverty and household overcrowding are associated with an increased prevalence of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, both of which remain a public health problem in many low-income countries. Control efforts are hampered by the scarcity of accurate data on disease burden, and effective approaches to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever is entirely clinical, without any laboratory gold standard, and no treatments have been shown to reduce progression to rheumatic heart disease. Prevention mainly relies on the prompt recognition and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, and avoidance of recurrent infection using long-term antibiotics. But evidence for the effectiveness of either approach is not strong. High-quality research is urgently needed to guide efforts to reduce acute rheumatic fever incidence and prevent progression to rheumatic heart disease.

### Ethnically disparate disease progression and outcomes among acute rheumatic fever patients in new zealand, 1989-2015 [^0a49b995]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a rare inflammatory condition triggered in response to untreated group A Streptococcus infection. ARF rates peak among children 5–14 years of age. ARF may permanently damage cardiac valves, producing chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD), a serious, sometimes fatal, condition that may require surgery. Approximately half the children who experience an initial episode of ARF sustain cardiac damage, which persists as RHD for ≈15%–50%. Repeated ARF attacks (recurrent ARF) can produce new, and worsen existing, cardiac damage. If long-term prophylaxis (intramuscular injections of benzathine penicillin G [BPG]) is not administered regularly, ≈50% of ARF patients will experience recurrent ARF. Secondary prophylaxis is complicated by access to healthcare, cultural appropriateness of care delivery, injection-related discomfort, and health literacy. RHD can also develop without any previously recognized ARF. The World Health Organization recommends establishing patient registers to assist with best-practice patient management in areas where ARF persists. New Zealand lacks a national ARF register, despite a significant disease burden.

### How many doses make a difference? An analysis of secondary prevention of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease [^b36d96c9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

This study used data from Australia's Northern Territory (NT) to determine the association between adherence and clinical outcomes for people living with ARF or RHD. To strengthen efforts to increase adherence to SP in the NT, where rates of RHD in the Indigenous population remain among the highest in the world, 15 factors associated with adherence were also explored.

### Prevention of infective endocarditis: guidelines from the American Heart Association: a guideline from the American Heart Association rheumatic fever, endocarditis and Kawasaki disease committee, council on cardiovascular disease in the young, and the council on clinical cardiology, council on cardiovascular surgery and anesthesia, and the quality of care and outcomes research interdisciplinary working group [^eb49fe19]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association antibiotic regimens—general principles for dental prophylaxis specify that an antibiotic for prophylaxis should be administered in a single dose before the procedure; if the preprocedural dose is inadvertently not given, the dosage may be administered up to two hours after the procedure, and administration after the procedure should be considered only when the patient did not receive the preprocedural dose. When fever or other manifestations of systemic infection are present, it is important to obtain blood cultures and other relevant tests before administration of antibiotics intended to prevent infective endocarditis.

Characteristics of joint involvement among the cohort

Carditis was found in 160 patients (52%); 147 (92%) had mitral valve insufficiency and 109 (68%), aortic valve insufficiency. Other valve manifestations included tricuspid regurgitation (2%), mitral stenosis (2%), pulmonary valve incompetence (0.6%), and moderate aortic stenosis (0.3%). Steroid therapy was given to 31 patients with severe carditis (19.5% of carditis patients; 10% of all patients). The remaining carditis patients received acetylsalicylic acid. Cardiac failure developed in 21 patients (13% of patients with cardiac involvement) Five of these patients required admission to the intensive care unit (during the years 2017-2018); one patient died (0.3% overall mortality), a fifteen-year-old male with trisomy 21 and normal previous cardiac screen. He presented with fever, elevated inflammatory markers and severe carditis, with consequent rupture of chordae tendinae of the mitral valve. He passed away during urgent surgical valve replacement attempt. Patients who had carditis were significantly older than those who did not (mean age 10.28 ± 3.14 years vs 8.97 ± 3.66 years, P < 0.001). Residual heart disease was found in 64% of the patients with carditis.

Inflammatory markers were markedly elevated. At admission, CRP was positive in 269 patients (87.6%) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in 278 (90.5%).

Chorea was found in 47 patients (15%). Chorea was present for a mean of 218.5 ± 482.8 days. It was twice as common in girls (P = 0.01).

Skin manifestations were rare: 16 patients (5.2%) had erythema marginatum and 2 (0.7%) had subcutaneous nodules.

Antecedent GAS infection and antibiotic treatment

Recent pharyngitis was reported by 175 patients (57%), of whom, according to patient reports, 63 (36%) received appropriate antibiotic therapy, 44 (25%) received partial treatment, and the remainder were untreated. The median time from onset of pharyngitis to hospital admission was 14 days (mean 22.32 ± 19.8 days).

### Acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease [^88b16398]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is the result of an autoimmune response to pharyngitis caused by infection with group A Streptococcus. The long-term damage to cardiac valves caused by ARF, which can result from a single severe episode or from multiple recurrent episodes of the illness, is known as rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and is a notable cause of morbidity and mortality in resource-poor settings around the world. Although our understanding of disease pathogenesis has advanced in recent years, this has not led to dramatic improvements in diagnostic approaches, which are still reliant on clinical features using the Jones Criteria, or treatment practices. Indeed, penicillin has been the mainstay of treatment for decades and there is no other treatment that has been proven to alter the likelihood or the severity of RHD after an episode of ARF. Recent advances - including the use of echocardiographic diagnosis in those with ARF and in screening for early detection of RHD, progress in developing group A streptococcal vaccines and an increased focus on the lived experience of those with RHD and the need to improve quality of life - give cause for optimism that progress will be made in coming years against this neglected disease that affects populations around the world, but is a particular issue for those living in poverty.
