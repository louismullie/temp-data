## Question

Is there a limit to how many cortisone knee injections one can get?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a fixed maximum number of cortisone injections allowed for the knee and how to frame a safe, evidence-based limit for repeat intra-articular corticosteroid injections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what authoritative guidelines say about frequency and any explicit limits. Then, I should verify whether any society specifies a hard lifetime maximum or if the guidance is interval-based and response-driven. Next, I will review safety data that would inform a practical ceiling, especially around cartilage effects, systemic steroid exposure, and infection risk around arthroplasty. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, individualized recommendation that balances efficacy, safety, and preoperative planning, while checking for exceptions in inflammatory arthritis versus osteoarthritis contexts [^115dgTTi].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the strength of recommendations, because I need to ensure we are talking about knee osteoarthritis rather than inflammatory arthritis, where the risk–benefit calculus can differ. The American College of Rheumatology recommends intra-articular corticosteroids for knee osteoarthritis, aligning with contemporary primary care and orthopaedic guidance, but recommendations emphasize short-term benefit and careful selection rather than indefinite repetition [^117E31KR] [^115ormU1] [^114NBF9J].

> Now, I should verify whether any guideline states a strict maximum number of injections per lifetime or per year. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: major U.S. guidelines do not endorse a hard lifetime maximum. Instead, they focus on minimum intervals between injections and stopping when benefit plateaus or surgery is planned. AAHKS survey data show near-universal use of a three-month minimum interval, with no consensus on a lifetime cap, and ASRA-aligned guidance suggests a minimum of 2–3 weeks up to about 3 months between injections, stopping when pain relief is adequate or has plateaued, rather than setting a numeric lifetime limit [^111ESBR7] [^112tzMaA] [^111Z1r2e].

> Wait, let me verify the interval recommendations more precisely, because I initially thought some sources might imply a hard annual cap. The AAHKS survey indicates most surgeons use a three-month minimum interval, and ASRA suggests 2–3 weeks as a pharmacologic minimum, extending toward 3 months in routine practice, with the series stopped when relief is achieved or plateaus; this supports spacing rather than a fixed quota, and it avoids implying carte blanche for frequent repetition [^111ESBR7] [^112tzMaA] [^111Z1r2e].

> I will now examine safety signals that would reasonably constrain repetition, especially cartilage effects. A pivotal 2-year randomized trial of triamcinolone 40 mg every 12 weeks showed greater cartilage volume loss without corresponding pain benefit versus saline, which is a red flag for repeated exposure; observational series also describe accelerated radiographic progression in a subset after injections, and contemporary reviews caution about structural harm with repeat dosing, reinforcing a conservative stance on frequency and cumulative exposure [^115mbTQs] [^114D6J6b] [^117Qsmgo].

> Next, I should review systemic steroid exposure and bone health, because repeated injections can contribute to cumulative glucocorticoid burden. ASRA suggests considering a maximum cumulative whole-body triamcinolone-equivalent dose of about 200 mg per year and 400 mg per 3 years in postmenopausal women, given concerns about bone mineral density effects; routine series of injections should be avoided, with subsequent injections only after observing response and recurrence of pain, which operationalizes a cautious ceiling rather than a rigid number [^117YSrHA].

> Hold on, I should verify perioperative infection risk, since this often drives pre-replacement limits. Multiple analyses indicate that ipsilateral intra-articular corticosteroid injection within 3 months of knee or hip arthroplasty increases the odds of periprosthetic joint infection, with the highest risk in the 0–2 to 4-week window; guidelines and meta-analyses recommend avoiding injections within 3 months preoperatively, and some data suggest no increased risk beyond 6 months, which is why many surgeons enforce a 3-month steroid-free interval before arthroplasty [^115ntCma] [^1168mgUA] [^117VJiiZ].

> Let me consider the efficacy horizon, because if benefit wanes quickly, the rationale for frequent reinjection weakens. High-quality evidence and meta-analyses consistently show short-term pain relief up to about 2–6 weeks, with uncertain or minimal benefit by 12–26 weeks; this limited durability argues against routine quarterly injections absent compelling short-term indications, and supports spacing and reassessment rather than automatic repetition [^1169S5Jd] [^113fWaJr] [^114T2keQ].

> But wait, what if the patient has inflammatory arthritis rather than osteoarthritis; does the same cap apply? I should double-check that nuance. EULAR guidance for inflammatory arthritis advises avoiding more than 3–4 corticosteroid injections in the same joint per year, acknowledging low-quality evidence; this is stricter than osteoarthritis practice patterns and reflects concern for cartilage toxicity with repeated local steroid exposure in inflamed joints, so a lower annual ceiling is reasonable in IA when used for flares [^115dgTTi].

> Let me synthesize a practical, individualized approach, and I need to ensure it aligns with the evidence. A reasonable framework is to use the lowest effective dose, typically 40 mg triamcinolone for the knee, space injections at least 12 weeks apart when possible, and limit to no more than 3–4 per year in most patients, with a working cumulative target of under 200 mg triamcinolone-equivalent per year when feasible; stop if relief is inadequate or plateaus, and avoid injections within 3 months of planned arthroplasty. Shared decision-making should incorporate diminishing returns, cartilage concerns, diabetes control, and the patient's goals, including consideration of noninvasive alternatives like structured physical therapy, which can yield more durable improvements in function and quality of life for some patients [^111Z1r2e] [^111ESBR7] [^117YSrHA] [^1168mgUA] [^112AFQoG] [^1179ZeNd].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. There is no universally endorsed fixed maximum number of knee corticosteroid injections across a lifetime; authoritative guidance emphasizes minimum intervals, response-driven stopping, and vigilance for cumulative risks. Given cartilage harm without added pain benefit with frequent dosing, systemic steroid exposure, and increased infection risk near arthroplasty, a conservative, individualized ceiling of roughly 3–4 injections per year with at least 12-week spacing, attention to cumulative dose, and avoidance within 3 months of surgery is prudent, with stricter limits in inflammatory arthritis and a lower threshold to pivot to noninvasive therapies if benefits wane [^111ESBR7] [^111Z1r2e] [^115mbTQs] [^115ntCma] [^115dgTTi].

---

There is **no absolute lifetime limit** on cortisone knee injections, but best practice is to keep them to **3–4 per year** [^115dgTTi] with at least 3 months between injections to minimize cartilage damage and other risks [^111ESBR7] [^111Z1r2e]. Most guidelines advise using the lowest effective dose [^111Z1r2e] and avoiding injections within 3 months of planned knee arthroplasty due to increased infection risk [^115ntCma]. If relief wanes or complications arise, consider alternatives such as hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma, or physical therapy [^115Gyjhn].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several professional organizations provide **guidelines on the frequency and number of cortisone injections** for knee osteoarthritis:

- **American College of Rheumatology (ACR)**: Recommends intra-articular corticosteroid injections for knee osteoarthritis, emphasizing short-term relief and careful patient selection [^117E31KR].

- **American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)**: Suggests intra-articular corticosteroids for short-term relief in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, noting potential risks with repeated injections [^114NBF9J].

- **European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)**: Advises limiting corticosteroid injections to no more than 3–4 per year per joint, acknowledging limited evidence but aiming to minimize cartilage damage and other risks [^115dgTTi].

---

## Risks associated with repeated cortisone injections

While cortisone injections provide short-term relief, repeated use carries **potential risks**:

- **Cartilage damage**: Repeated injections may accelerate cartilage degeneration and joint destruction, particularly with frequent use [^115mbTQs].

- **Infection**: Although rare, there is a risk of septic arthritis, especially with repeated injections or improper technique [^116QTEAk].

- **Systemic effects**: Repeated injections can cause systemic corticosteroid effects, including adrenal suppression and osteoporosis [^114KhHjc] [^117YSrHA].

- **Periprosthetic joint infection**: Recent injections within three months before knee arthroplasty increase the risk of postoperative infection [^115ntCma].

---

## Clinical evidence on the maximum number of injections

There is **no definitive evidence** establishing an absolute maximum number of cortisone injections. However, studies and expert consensus suggest:

- **Frequency**: Most clinicians limit injections to 3–4 per year, with at least a three-month interval between injections [^115dgTTi] [^111ESBR7].

- **Cumulative dose**: Some guidelines suggest a cumulative limit of 200 mg of triamcinolone per year to minimize systemic and local risks [^117YSrHA].

- **Individualized approach**: The number of injections should be tailored based on patient response, disease severity, and risk factors [^117YSrHA].

---

## Factors influencing the number of injections

Several factors influence the **appropriate number of injections** for a given patient:

| **Factor** | **Influence on injection frequency** |
|-|-|
| Disease severity | More severe osteoarthritis may require more frequent injections initially, but long-term use should be limited [^111Z1r2e] |
| Patient response | Patients experiencing significant relief may receive more injections, but efficacy often diminishes with repeated use [^111ESBR7] |
| Age and comorbidities | Older patients or those with diabetes, osteoporosis, or immunosuppression may require more cautious use [^115kH4Ru] |
| Surgical considerations | Injections should be avoided within three months before planned knee arthroplasty due to infection risk [^115ntCma] |

---

## Alternative treatments

Given the potential risks of repeated cortisone injections, **alternative treatments** should be considered:

- **Hyaluronic acid injections**: May provide longer-lasting relief than corticosteroids in some patients [^111gheWv].

- **Platelet-rich plasma (PRP)**: Emerging evidence suggests potential benefits, though more research is needed [^113WCSdG].

- **Physical therapy**: Strongly recommended for knee osteoarthritis management, providing long-term benefits without the risks associated with repeated injections [^112AFQoG].

---

## Clinical judgment and patient-specific factors

Ultimately, the decision regarding the number of cortisone injections should be based on **clinical judgment**, patient-specific factors, and shared decision-making. Regular reassessment of pain relief, function, and adverse effects is essential to determine the ongoing appropriateness of injections [^117YSrHA].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Limit injections**: Generally, limit to 3–4 injections per year, with at least three-month intervals between injections [^115dgTTi].

- **Monitor response**: Reassess patient response and adjust treatment plan accordingly [^117YSrHA].

- **Consider alternatives**: Explore alternative treatments if injections are no longer effective or risks outweigh benefits [^112AFQoG].

- **Avoid pre-surgery injections**: Avoid injections within three months before planned knee arthroplasty [^115ntCma].

---

There is **no absolute limit** on the number of cortisone knee injections, but best practice is to limit them to 3–4 per year with at least three-month intervals. The decision should be individualized based on patient response, disease severity, and risk factors, with regular reassessment and consideration of alternative treatments.

### Common practices in intra-articular corticosteroid injection for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis: a survey of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons membership [^111ESBR7]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Knee osteoarthritis nonoperative management options remain limited. Our aim is to define the current American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) members' practices and perceptions in terms of the frequency, formulation, use of concomitant aspiration, maximum lifetime number of injections, efficacy, interval between injection and surgery and complication rates.

Methods

A 22-question survey based on Likert scale response anchors was approved and distributed by the AAHKS Research Committee to its membership by email during the Spring 2019 meeting. Data were managed with REDCap software.

Results

Membership response totaled 537 of 2365 (22.7%) members. Highlights include every respondent using intra-articular corticosteroid injections (ICIs) in their practice, and most use a three-month minimum interval, although the preferred interval is longer. Near consensus was found waiting three months before surgery. There was a great variability in the number of injections allowed, and injections before surgery were very common. Nearly all responders use a local anesthetic mixture with the cortisone injection, but there was great variation in corticosteroid type: methylprednisolone (42%), triamcinolone (41%), betamethasone (13.3%), and dexamethasone (3.7%).

Conclusion

The results of our survey indicate the majority of the AAHKS members who completed the survey use ICIs routinely for treatment of knee osteoarthritis. There was near consensus in ICIs, which is effective with decreasing efficacy over serial injections, and an absolute minimum interval between injections was believed by most to be three months with no clearly defined lifetime limit and strong consensus for a three-month preoperative interval. The formulation of steroid, local anesthetic, and skin preparation technique varied greatly.

Knee osteoarthritis intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) dosing — repeat IACS are associated with small volume cartilage loss (Level of certainty: high). Recommendations state that IACS for knee osteoarthritis should use the lowest effective doses of corticosteroids while increasing the time interval between repeat injections when possible (Grade A), and that the recommended initial maximum intra-articular knee triamcinolone acetonide dose is 40 mg, or another particulate corticosteroid equivalent (Grade A).

### Corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee: meta-analysis [^1135Az5c]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee and to identify numbers needed to treat.

Data Sources

Cochrane controlled trials register, Medline (1966 to 2003), Embase (1980 to 2003), hand searches, and contact with authors.

Inclusion Criteria

Randomised controlled trial in which the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee could be ascertained.

Results

In high quality studies, the pooled relative risk for improvement in symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee at 16–24 weeks after intra-articular corticosteroid injections was 2.09 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.7) and the number needed to treat was 4.4. The pooled relative risk for improvement up to two weeks after injections was 1.66 (1.37 to 2.0). The numbers needed to treat to get one improvement in the statistically significant studies was 1.3 to 3.5 patients.

Conclusion

Evidence supports short term (up to two weeks) improvement in symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee after intra-articular corticosteroid injection. Significant improvement was also shown in the only methodologically sound studies addressing longer term response (16–24 weeks). A dose equivalent to 50 mg of prednisone may be needed to show benefit at 16–24 weeks.

Intra-articular corticosteroid injection frequency and cumulative dose — survey practice and suggestion: An American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons survey of common injection practices yielded 537 members' responses, and most used a 3-month minimum interval between repeat IACS in the same joint. Based on the available pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, we suggest a minimum interval of 2–3 weeks, up to 3 months, and the series of injections should be stopped when there is complete or acceptable pain relief or when the relief has plateaued, taking into consideration the maximum cumulative dose. Almost all responders used a local anesthetic mixture with the CSI, there were no distinctly defined early or lifetime limits, and there was a strong consensus for a 3-month corticosteroid-free preoperative interval.

### Injectable corticosteroids in treatment of arthritis of the knee [^112TNUby]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Injection of corticosteroid preparations for the local treatment of musculoskeletal disorders affecting the knee, such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, has been used widely since the 1950s. This local therapy minimizes systemic toxicity and can result in rapid improvement in symptoms, most often as an adjunctive therapy for acute or severe symptom flares. The evidence assessing safety and efficacy is reviewed and analyzed. Intra-articular knee injection technique is described and is a procedure that is easy to learn and can be performed quickly in an office or hospital setting.

Intra-articular corticosteroids and radiographic joint space narrowing — trial and observational data are as follows: a knee RCT used 40 mg IA triamcinolone every 3 months versus saline for up to 2 years, was powered with 34 patients per group to detect a 0.125 mm difference at 2 years, and found no difference between groups at either 1-year or 2-year follow-up. An observational series assessed 30 individuals with OA and 35 with RA who had a minimum of 15 knee CSIs over 4 years and a maximum of 167 injections over 8 years (semi-quantitative 0–4 scale).

Clinical Question

Are intra-articular corticosteroids associated with improvement in pain and physical function compared with sham injection or no intervention in patients with knee osteoarthritis?

Bottom Line

Intra-articular corticosteroids may be associated with moderate improvement in pain and a small improvement in physical function up to 6 weeks after injection. However, the quality of the evidence is low.

### Critical appraisal of intra-articular glucocorticoid injections for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee [^115eFtzG]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Intra-articular (IA) injections of glucocorticoids (GCs) have been shown to decrease pain, increase mobility, and improve quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Concerns about cartilage loss with IA GCs have prompted reconsideration of their use in knee OA. This review has three objectives: 1) critically review the clinical, molecular, and structural effects of IA GCs in knee OA; 2) provide a design for a clinical trial aimed at improving our understanding of the long-term consequences of IA GCs; and 3) provide practical guidance on the use of IA GCs in patients with knee OA based on current information.

Design

A narrative review of current literature on the use of IA GCs for OA of the knee.

Results

Important questions remain to be fully answered with respect to IA GCs, including long-term effects on all aspects of the structural and molecular environment of the knee, and identification of factors that can reliably predict a positive or negative response to IA GCs.

Conclusions

While awaiting results from an appropriately designed study, several provisional statements regarding IA GCs can be put forward: 1) IA GCs appear to be a relatively safe option that is effective in specific patients with symptomatic knee OA; 2) there is no definitive evidence that IA GCs accelerate joint deterioration to an important extent or hastens the requirement for knee replacement; and 3) there are few contraindications to IA GCs and injection-associated complications are rare when IA GCs are delivered with proper technique.

### The efficacy, accuracy and complications of corticosteroid injections of the knee joint [^115mdEYU]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Corticosteroid knee injections are being increasingly used in the conservative management of knee osteoarthritis. The procedure is usually performed in secondary care by orthopaedic surgeons and rheumatologists, but as the role of general practitioners in chronic disease management expands, joint injections are now frequently being performed in primary care. It is commonly perceived amongst clinicians that the benefits of corticosteroid knee joint injections in treating symptomatic knee osteoarthritis significantly outweigh the risks of complications.

Methods

The evidence in the literature for the benefits, accuracy, safety and complications of corticosteroid knee injections in osteoarthritis is reviewed. The perception that serious complications are rare is addressed, and the incidence of infectious complications is estimated.

Results and Conclusions

Short-term symptomatic relief is the only evidence-based benefit of corticosteroid injection of an osteoarthritic knee. Accurate intra-articular placement is not achieved in up to 20% of injections and varies considerably with the anatomical approach used. There is no evidence that a medial approach is more accurate. The incidence of serious infectious complications following knee joint injections ranges widely, and may be as high as 1 in 3,000 and potentially far higher in high-risk patients for whom specialist management is advised.

### Intra-articular corticosteroid for knee osteoarthritis [^113fWaJr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Knee osteoarthritis is a leading cause of chronic pain, disability, and decreased quality of life. Despite the long-standing use of intra-articular corticosteroids, there is an ongoing debate about their benefits and safety. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of intra-articular corticosteroids compared with sham or no intervention in people with knee osteoarthritis in terms of pain, physical function, quality of life, and safety.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE (from inception to 3 February 2015), checked trial registers, conference proceedings, reference lists, and contacted authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared intra-articular corticosteroids with sham injection or no treatment in people with knee osteoarthritis. We applied no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for pain, function, quality of life, joint space narrowing, and risk ratios (RRs) for safety outcomes. We combined trials using an inverse-variance random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Results

We identified 27 trials (13 new studies) with 1767 participants in this update. We graded the quality of the evidence as 'low' for all outcomes because treatment effect estimates were inconsistent with great variation across trials, pooled estimates were imprecise and did not rule out relevant or irrelevant clinical effects, and because most trials had a high or unclear risk of bias. Intra-articular corticosteroids appeared to be more beneficial in pain reduction than control interventions (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.22), which corresponds to a difference in pain scores of 1.0 cm on a 10-cm visual analogue scale between corticosteroids and sham injection and translates into a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 8 (95% CI 6 to 13). An I(2) statistic of 68% indicated considerable between-trial heterogeneity. A visual inspection of the funnel plot suggested some asymmetry (asymmetry coefficient -1.21, 95%CI -3.58 to 1.17). When stratifying results according to length of follow-up, benefits were moderate at 1 to 2 weeks after end of treatment (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.27), small to moderate at 4 to 6 weeks (SMD -0.41, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.21), small at 13 weeks (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.00), and no evidence of an effect at 26 weeks (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.11). An I(2) statistic of ≥ 63% indicated a moderate to large degree of between-trial heterogeneity up to 13 weeks after end of treatment (P for heterogeneity ≤ 0.001), and an I(2) of 0% indicated low heterogeneity at 26 weeks (P = 0.43). There was evidence of lower treatment effects in trials that randomised on average at least 50 participants per group (P = 0.05) or at least 100 participants per group (P = 0.013), in trials that used concomittant viscosupplementation (P = 0.08), and in trials that used concomitant joint lavage (P ≤ 0.001). Corticosteroids appeared to be more effective in function improvement than control interventions (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.09), which corresponds to a difference in functions scores of -0.7 units on standardised Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) disability scale ranging from 0 to 10 and translates into a NNTB of 10 (95% CI 7 to 33). An I(2) statistic of 69% indicated a moderate to large degree of between-trial heterogeneity. A visual inspection of the funnel plot suggested asymmetry (asymmetry coefficient -4.07, 95% CI -8.08 to -0.05). When stratifying results according to length of follow-up, benefits were small to moderate at 1 to 2 weeks after end of treatment (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.14), small to moderate at 4 to 6 weeks (SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.09), and no evidence of an effect at 13 weeks (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.10) or at 26 weeks (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.28). An I(2) statistic of ≥ 62% indicated a moderate to large degree of between-trial heterogeneity up to 13 weeks after end of treatment (P for heterogeneity ≤ 0.004), and an I(2) of 0% indicated low heterogeneity at 26 weeks (P = 0.52). We found evidence of lower treatment effects in trials that randomised on average at least 50 participants per group (P = 0.023), in unpublished trials (P = 0.023), in trials that used non-intervention controls (P = 0.031), and in trials that used concomitant viscosupplementation (P = 0.06). Participants on corticosteroids were 11% less likely to experience adverse events, but confidence intervals included the null effect (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.23, I(2) = 0%). Participants on corticosteroids were 67% less likely to withdraw because of adverse events, but confidence intervals were wide and included the null effect (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.05 to 2.07, I(2) = 0%). Participants on corticosteroids were 27% less likely to experience any serious adverse event, but confidence intervals were wide and included the null effect (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.67, I(2) = 0%). We found no evidence of an effect of corticosteroids on quality of life compared to control (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.28, I(2) = 0%). There was also no evidence of an effect of corticosteroids on joint space narrowing compared to control interventions (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.46).

Authors' Conclusions

Whether there are clinically important benefits of intra-articular corticosteroids after one to six weeks remains unclear in view of the overall quality of the evidence, considerable heterogeneity between trials, and evidence of small-study effects. A single trial included in this review described adequate measures to minimise biases and did not find any benefit of intra-articular corticosteroids. In this update of the systematic review and meta-analysis, we found most of the identified trials that compared intra-articular corticosteroids with sham or non-intervention control small and hampered by low methodological quality. An analysis of multiple time points suggested that effects decrease over time, and our analysis provided no evidence that an effect remains six months after a corticosteroid injection.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis, accounting for a disproportionate level of disability and health care expenditures worldwide. It is the eighth most expensive of 154 health conditions to manage in the US, costing more than $80 billion in 2016. The knee is one of the more common joints affected by osteoarthritis, with its prevalence doubling during the last 70 years. Knee osteoarthritis may begin early in life and progresses slowly, providing opportunities for nonsurgical treatment options.

Effective nonsurgical treatment options are available for knee OA that should be considered before surgery. The American College of Rheumatology provides guidelines that include 6 strongly and 8 conditionally recommended nonpharmacological interventions, as well as 3 strongly and 4 conditionally recommended pharmacological treatments. With so many choices, patients and clinicians often find it challenging to establish optimal treatment plans. One critical component for decision-making is the cost and accessibility of the intervention.

### The magnitude and duration of the effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injections on pain severity in knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11368Xmr]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aims of the study were to clarify the evidence on the magnitude and duration of treatment effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for knee osteoarthritis compared with placebo, to evaluate a treatment effect by steroid type, and to describe the reported adverse effects.

Design

Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched. The risk of systematic bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration's domain-based evaluation framework.

Results

The final sample included eight randomized controlled studies with follow-ups from 1 to 26 wks. The risk of systematic bias was considered low in five and high in three studies. The pooled standardized mean difference was -0.58 (95% confidence interval = -0.88 to -0.27) and number needed to treat 5.1 (95% confidence interval = 10.0 to 3.7). The heterogeneity was considerable. The pooled effect size approached the level of statistical insignificance at 4 mos. The pooled risk ratio of adverse effects was insignificant 0.95 (95% confidence interval = 0.34 to 2.55).

Conclusions

The intra-articular corticosteroid had a mild to moderate effect on pain severity up to 3 mos after the injection-much longer than it had previously been reported. The effect may vary substantially in different patient groups and appropriate patient selection is important. The risk of adverse effects was low.

### Intra-articular corticosteroid injections for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis: what the orthopaedic provider needs to know [^111k87Nn]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid injections have been used for decades in the management of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee and remain a common practice. The pain relief from a steroid injection is thought to work by reducing inflammation within the arthritic knee. Substantial variability remains among providers with regard to the technique used to perform the procedure, including the site of the injection, the medications injected, and the level of sterility. The success of steroid injections in relieving arthritic knee pain most often occurs in the short term. However, the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections varies within the published literature. The latest American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline does not support conclusive recommendations about the use of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Providers should be aware of the adverse effects and potential complications of these injections when using them in clinical practice.

Knee intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injections — Ultrasound-guided (USG) injections are more efficacious than landmark-assisted injections; triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg, relief is shorter (up to 6 weeks), and we suggest a minimum 2-week interval between injections.

Intra-articular corticosteroids — Intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids could provide short-term relief for patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee, with Strength of Recommendation: Moderate (downgrade). Overall pain and function improved with intra-articular corticosteroids; however, such effect lasted only up to 3 months. Analyses differentiating extended versus immediate release found that extended release IA steroids can be used over immediate release to improve patient outcomes (Moderate strength recommendation). The recommendation has been downgraded one level because of potential risk in accelerating osteoarthritis from injections. For implementation safety, the AAOS Patient Safety Committee recommends avoiding musculoskeletal corticosteroid injections for two weeks before and one week after COVID vaccine administration. The cost-effectiveness of different intra-articular therapies is still to be determined.

### Do glucocorticoid injections increase the risk of knee osteoarthritis progression over 5 Years? [^111ecCA8]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Recent findings have demonstrated that intraarticular (IA) glucocorticoid injections can be deleterious for knees with osteoarthritis (OA). This study was undertaken to assess, in a real-life setting, the risk of knee OA progression in patients who received IA glucocorticoid injections over a 5-year follow-up period.

Methods

We used marginal structural modeling with inverse probability of treatment weighting to determine the causal association between IA glucocorticoid injections and the 5-year risk of disease progression in patients with symptomatic knee OA from the Knee and Hip Osteoarthritis Long-term Assessment cohort. OA progression was defined as an incident total knee replacement (TKR) and/or radiographic worsening (Kellgren/Lawrence [K/L] grade or joint space narrowing [JSN]). We also examined these outcomes in knees that received IA hyaluronan (IAHA) injections.

Results

Among the 564 patients with knee OA included in the study sample, 51 (9.0%) and 99 (17.5%) received IA glucocorticoid or IAHA injections, respectively, and 414 (63.1%) did not receive any injection during follow-up. Compared to untreated knees, those treated with IA glucocorticoid injections had a similar risk of incident TKR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.20, 4.14]; P = 0.91) or K/L grade worsening (HR 1.33 [95% CI 0.64, 2.79]; P = 0.44). IAHA injections had no effect on the risk of TKR (HR 0.81 [95% CI 0.14, 4.63]; P = 0.81) or K/L grade worsening (HR 1.36 [95% CI 0.85, 2.17]; P = 0.20). Similar results were obtained for JSN, and when TKR and radiographic outcomes were combined.

Conclusion

In this study, IA glucocorticoid injections for symptomatic knee OA did not significantly increase the 5-year risk of incident TKR or radiographic worsening. These findings should be interpreted cautiously and replicated in other cohorts.

Recommendations Regarding Injection-Based Therapies

Corticosteroid Injections

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IAC or IACS) injections were pioneered by Dr Jollander in 1953. The first trial for IAC injections was performed by White and Norton in 1958. IAC injections have become standard therapy for patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, there is still debate on the efficacy of IAC injections for knee OA. A Cochrane review in 2015 evaluated 27 trials with a total of 1767 participants comparing IAC injections with a sham injection or no treatment for patients with knee OA. The quality of evidence was "low" due to a high or unclear risk of bias in many studies. There was also a significant amount of inconsistencies regarding the dosage of corticosteroid and the type of corticosteroid used. The review did find IAC injections reduced pain and improved function more effectively than control interventions. The authors reported an improvement of pain after IAC injection was moderate at 1–2 weeks post-injection, mild to moderate at 4–6 weeks, and minor at 13 weeks. There was no statistically significant evidence of treatment effect at 26 weeks. The Cochrane review concluded, given the poor quality and variability in the studies, it is uncertain if there is a significant advantage of IAC injections for knee OA after 6 weeks post-injection.

Conversely, a more recent systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the magnitude and duration of the effect of IAC for knee OA found moderate evidence for IAC injections to reduce pain related to knee OA. The treatment effect was up to 3 months after the injection in the meta-analysis. The number needed to treat was 10. Unfortunately, as was such the case in the Cochrane review, there is significant heterogeneity between studies evaluating IAC for knee OA. The inconsistency between the Cochrane review and the meta-analysis underscores the need for RCTs with specific corticosteroids used and a fixed-dose to consider further the efficacy of pain relief and duration of effect (see Table 11).

Evidence Table Regarding Intra-Articular Corticosteroid Injections

In summary, IAC may provide short-term mild-to-moderate pain relief for patients with knee osteoarthritis.

In 1955, intra-articular injection of corticosteroids (particularly hydrocortisone acetate) was reported to be effective in 80% of arthritic joints, but the transitory nature of the effect "limited its practical value as a therapy". Subsequently, more potent synthetic corticosteroids replaced hydrocortisone for intra-articular indications; controlled clinical studies of these analogs also demonstrated short-term effects. Pharmacokinetic study indicated the efflux of corticosteroids from the joint within hours of injection.

Osteoarthritic pain represents a major health problem for aging and increasingly obese populations. Modern evidence-based management guidelines from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommend a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies, including joint replacement. In practice, the utility of oral pharmacotherapy is limited by modest efficacy and side effects, and the treatment effect of intra-articular hyaluronic acid preparations has been questioned. Despite the short-term efficacy, and perhaps reflecting the paucity of effective alternatives, intra-articular corticosteroid use is common. Among beneficiaries with knee osteoarthritis identified from a 1999 to 2013 Medicare 5% sample, > 25% of the nearly 12 million people with knee osteoarthritis received intra-articular corticosteroid injections; the fraction of newly diagnosed knee patients receiving intra-articular corticosteroids increased from 0.27 to 0.45 during the time period.

Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections for osteoarthritis (OA) are strongly recommended for patients with knee and/or hip OA and conditionally recommended for patients with hand OA. Trials of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections have demonstrated short-term efficacy in knee OA, and intraarticular glucocorticoid injection is conditionally, rather than strongly, recommended for hand OA given the lack of evidence specific to this anatomic location. There are insufficient data to judge the choice of short-acting over long-acting preparations or the use of low rather than high doses.

Knee osteoarthritis — randomized trials comparing intra-articular corticosteroids: In a small study on knee OA, 57 patients were randomized to either TH 20 mg or MPA 40 mg, and the TH group had a statistically greater reduction in pain (visual analog scale (VAS)) at week 3; in another small single-blind study, 42 patients with knee OA were randomized to either TH 20 mg or the combination of 6 mg betamethasone acetate and betamethasone disodium phosphate, with TH showing superior clinical benefits at week 1 and treatment failure more common in the betamethasone group (n = 12) versus TH (n = 5); in a randomized study of inflammatory knee arthritis, 100 patients (89 with RA) received either TA 80 mg or MPA 80 mg, with no differences in time to relapse, pain, swelling, range of movement, or adverse effects at 4, 12, or 24 weeks, and research to date has not demonstrated long-term superiority of any corticosteroid preparation for IA knee injections.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) dosing, imaging selection, injection intervals, efficacy duration, and adverse effects are summarized for musculoskeletal injections. US requires expertise; hence the physician should employ the imaging modality with which they are most experienced and comfortable. There is little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another. For dosing, a dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg TA for shoulder IACS, the most commonly used dose for hip IACS was 40 mg TA or MPA, and triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS. For frequency, we suggest a minimum interval of 2–3 weeks between injections, up to 3 months, and overall, IACS results in short-term (4 weeks to 3 months) pain relief. Adverse effects from IACS are related to the procedure and corticosteroid exposure and include an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage, reduction of BMD, and PJI.

### The efficacy and duration of intra-articular corticosteroid injection for knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review of level I studies [^111qoaWJ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review of the current literature to determine the efficacy and duration of intra-articular corticosteroid injection in reducing pain caused by knee osteoarthritis and to determine whether the type of corticosteroid used affected these results. Following an electronic search of multiple databases and a review of reference lists from various articles, we found six trials in five papers that compared corticosteroid versus placebo and four papers that compared different corticosteroids. Results of corticosteroid compared with placebo showed both a statistically and clinically significant reduction in pain at 1 week, with an average difference between groups of 22%. Two of four trials showed triamcinolone to be more effective in pain reduction than other corticosteroids. We concluded that intra-articular corticosteroids reduce knee pain for at least 1 week and that intra-articular corticosteroid injection is a short-term treatment of a chronic problem.

### Effect of intramuscular vs intra-articular glucocorticoid injection on pain among adults with knee osteoarthritis: the KIS randomized clinical trial [^114Z4YsY]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this trial suggest that, among patients in primary care settings with symptomatic knee OA, an IM glucocorticoid injection could present an inferior effect in reducing pain at our primary end point of 4 weeks, compared with an IA injection. An IM injection is noninferior to IA injection at 8 and 24 weeks after injection, but not at 2 and 12 weeks. Both types of injection should be considered effective strategies, and this trial provides evidence for shared decision-making between clinicians and patients, taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of both treatment strategies.

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) and peri-articular injections for musculoskeletal pain are addressed in this adult-focused guideline, which summarizes scope, dosing, efficacy, and safety. The guideline covers corticosteroid joint injections for "the shoulder, elbow, hand, wrist, hip, knee, and small joints of the hands and feet", notes "little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another", and states that "Ultrasound guidance increases the accuracy of injections and reduces procedural pain". Dosing statements include: "A dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg for shoulder IACS and subacromial subdeltoid bursa corticosteroid injections", "The commonly used dose for hip IACS is 40 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone", and "Triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS". Efficacy is characterized as "short-term pain relief from a few weeks to a few months", and adverse events include "an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage lining the joint, reduction of bone mineral density, and postoperative joint infection".

### A randomized trial of intra-articular injection therapy for knee osteoarthritis [^111WmDpN]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The strengths of our study included its single-center study setup and the single-dose intra-articular injection. The image-guided injection with contrast media assured correct intra-articular application, which is a crucial factor. This study is, to our knowledge, the first randomized trial comparing the use of glucocorticoids, hyaluronic acid, PRP, and placebo intra-articular injections.

Limitations

Up to now, there is no clear recommendation how often PRP should be injected. Because of the blinded study design, we could not offer multiple PRP injections to our patients.

Our study included patients with 1 or 2 knees treated. We took this into account in our statistical modeling and implemented a model with 2 random effects (for the patient and patient's knee) and an additional variable predictor that accounts for the treatment applied to the contralateral knee. Because systemic effects of glucocorticoid injections have only been reported up to 1 month after the initial injection, we injected the second knee at least 3 months after the injection in the contralateral knee.

Lastly, intra-articular injections are known for strong placebo effect. Self-reported parameters such as pain and stiffness are susceptible to this phenomenon. Future studies with larger study cohorts are warranted to confirm our findings.

In summary, there is no evidence that knee injections with glucocorticoid, PRP, or hyaluronic acid have superior short- or long-term effects in patients with mild or moderate OA when compared with placebo.

Based on these results, treating physicians might avoid these injection therapies for the management of knee OA.

Another area of debate is the number of injections that are needed for HA therapy. A meta-analysis of single-injection products utilizing a post hoc placebo comparison showed that a single injection could produce results similar to multi-injections. One of the limitations is that the study was funded by LCA Pharmaceuticals, and the author is an employee and shareholder of the company that makes a single injection HA product. Another systematic review compared the effectiveness of different dosing regimens of HA. This study identified 11 studies and found no difference in outcomes between a series of three and five injections. The authors' conclusion based on their results suggested that there appears to be a similar efficacy with single injections with greater cost-effectiveness. A review of the effectiveness and safety of Supartz (sodium hyaluronate) from pooled clinical trials showed that single 5-week injections could provide reductions in pain and improve function without any significant side effects. A total of 1155 patients were included in the analysis, and the intervention was compared to placebo(see Table 12).

Evidence Table Regarding Hyaluronic Acid

Unfortunately, there are many conflicting conclusions from systematic reviews and meta-analyses on viscosupplementation for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Overall, viscosupplementation is a safe, well-tolerated procedure that has been shown to have an improvement in pain and function. However, there is no evidence to suggest that one type of viscosupplementation product is superior to another, and also no evidence to suggest that a series of injections are better than a single injection.

Consensus Points for Hyaluronic Acid

Intra-articular hyaluronic acid (IAHA) is a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with symptomatic OA of the knee refractory to conservative medical management; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
IAHA demonstrates superior, longer-lasting efficacy post-injection in comparison to intra-articular corticosteroids in patients with knee pain secondary to OA; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Current evidence suggests there is no difference between the reduction in knee pain secondary to OA following a 3-week course of IAHA versus a 5-week course; Level II, Grade B, Consensus Moderate HA formulation differences including molecular weight and cross-linkage have been proposed as more or less effective; Level III, Grade C, Consensus Weak

### A randomized trial of intra-articular injection therapy for knee osteoarthritis [^111Wo5Bx]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This single-center randomized placebo-controlled trial compared intra-articular injection treatments in patients with mild to moderate OA of the knee. We found no significant difference in pain relief comparing glucocorticoid, hyaluronic acid, PRP, and placebo during the first 6 months after injection. Secondary outcomes including stiffness, Tegner Activity Scale, and clinical parameters of knee mobility were small and comparable among treatment groups. To take into account the structure of the data (patients measured over time) and to control for covariates, all results discussed are based on the LMM.

In the glucocorticoid group, pain reduction assessed with "pain NRS" score and WOMAC questionnaire was pronounced 1 week after the injection and vanished after 3 months. This is similar to a systematic reviewof 27 trials by the Cochrane group in 2015, which found a moderate reduction in knee pain in the first 1 to 2 weeks and no more pain reduction after 26 weeks. Although data in this review showed a difference in improved pain scores of 1.0 cm on a 10-cm NRS between corticosteroids and sham injections, our data found no difference in pain outcome between patients in the placebo and glucocorticoid group. Furthermore, the pain reduction in all our groups stayed mostly below a clinically relevant threshold, which is 30% of the baseline pain. For functional improvements, our observed effects were similar to the Cochrane analysis. In our study, the Tegner Activity Scale showed only small changes, with minimal improvement 3 months after the glucocorticoid injection. Glucocorticoid injections are frequently used in patients with knee OA, but whether the benefit exceeds the potential harms remains controversial. Recent studies indicated potential negative side such as loss of cartilage after repeated injections, transient meniscal thickness reduction, and increased risk of knee OA progression. Structural changes after the injection in our patients will be assessed in a separate article covering using magnetic resonance imaging data.

### Effect of intramuscular vs intra-articular glucocorticoid injection on pain among adults with knee osteoarthritis: the KIS randomized clinical trial [^114S4Hex]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Intra-articular (IA) glucocorticoid injection is widely used in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA), but the safety of this technique is in question among physicians. Intramuscular (IM) glucocorticoid injection could be an alternative approach.

Objective

To investigate whether an IM glucocorticoid injection is noninferior to an IA glucocorticoid injection in reducing knee pain for patients with knee OA in primary care.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The KIS trial, a multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical noninferiority trial including patients with symptomatic knee OA, was conducted in 80 primary care general practices in the southwest of the Netherlands. The study was conducted from March 1, 2018, to July 28, 2020.

Interventions

Patients were randomly allocated to receive an injection of triamcinolone acetonide, 40 mg, either IM in the ipsilateral ventrogluteal region or IA in the knee joint. All patients were followed up for 24 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The pain score at 4 weeks measured with Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (range, 0–100; 0 indicates extreme pain), with a noninferiority margin of -7 (IM minus IA). A per-protocol analysis was prespecified as the primary analysis.

Results

A total of 145 patients (94 women [65%]; mean [SD] age, 67 [10] years) were included; of these, 138 patients (IM, 72; IA, 66) were included in the per-protocol analysis. Clinically relevant improvements in knee pain were reached up to 12 weeks after the injection in both groups. At 4 weeks, the estimated mean difference in the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score between the 2 groups was -3.4 (95% CI, -10.1 to 3.3). Noninferiority could not be declared because the lower limit exceeded the noninferiority margin. Intramuscular injection was noninferior to IA injection at 8 (mean difference, 0.7; 95% CI, -6.5 to 7.8) and 24 (mean difference, 1.6; 95% CI, -5.7 to 9.0) weeks. No significant difference was found among all the secondary outcomes. These results were similar for the sensitivity analysis in an intention-to-treat population. The most frequently reported adverse events were hot flush (IM, 7 [10%] vs IA, 14 [21%]) and headache (IM, 10 [14%] vs IA, 12 [18%]), and all events were classified as nonserious.

Conclusions and Relevance

Based on the findings of this trial, among patients with knee OA in primary care, IM glucocorticoid injection could present an inferior effect in reducing pain at 4 weeks compared with IA injection. Noninferiority of an IM injection was observed at 8 and 24 weeks after injection. This trial provides data for shared decision-making, taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of both types of injections.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injection and peri-articular corticosteroid injection are commonly used to treat musculoskeletal conditions. Results vary by musculoskeletal region, but most studies report short-term benefit with mixed results on long-term relief. Publications showed adverse events from single corticosteroid injections. Recommended effective doses were lower than those currently used by clinicians.

Methods

Development of the practice guideline for joint injections was approved by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine and the participating societies. A Corticosteroid Safety Work Group coordinated the development of three guidelines: peripheral nerve blocks and trigger points; joints; and neuraxial, facet, and sacroiliac joint injections. The topics included safety of the technique in relation to landmark-guided, ultrasound-guided, or radiology-aided injections; effect of the addition of the corticosteroid on the efficacy of the injectate; and adverse events related to the injection. Experts on the topics were assigned to extensively review the literature and initially develop consensus statements and recommendations. A modified version of the US Preventive Services Task Force grading of evidence and strength of recommendation was followed. A modified Delphi process was adhered to in arriving at a consensus.

Results

This guideline focuses on the safety and efficacy of corticosteroid joint injections for managing joint chronic pain in adults. The joints that were addressed included the shoulder, elbow, hand, wrist, hip, knee, and small joints of the hands and feet. All the statements and recommendations were approved by all participants and the Board of Directors of the participating societies after four rounds of discussion. There is little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another. Ultrasound guidance increases the accuracy of injections and reduces procedural pain. A dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg for both shoulder IACS and subacromial subdeltoid bursa corticosteroid injections. The commonly used dose for hip IACS is 40 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone. Triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS. Overall, IACS injections result in short-term pain relief from a few weeks to a few months. The adverse events include an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage lining the joint, reduction of bone mineral density, and postoperative joint infection.

Conclusions

In this practice guideline, we provided specific recommendations on the role of corticosteroids in joint, bursa, and peritendon injections for musculoskeletal pain.

### Intraarticular corticosteroid for treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee [^114xcK2F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disorder. In the knee, injections of corticosteroids into the joint (intra-articular (IA)) may relieve inflammation, and reduce pain and disability.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of IA corticosteroids in treatment of OA of the knee.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PREMEDLINE (all to July 2003), and Current Contents (Sept 2000). Specialised journals, trial reference lists and review articles were handsearched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of IA corticosteroids for patients with OA of the knee: single/double blind, placebo-based/comparative studies, reporting at least one core OMERACT III outcome measure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Methodological quality of trials was assessed, and data were extracted in duplicate. Fixed effect and random effects models, giving weighted mean differences (WMD), were used for continuous variables. Dichotomous outcomes were analysed by relative risk (RR).

Main Results

Twenty-six trials (1721 participants) comparing IA corticosteroid against placebo, against IA hyaluronan/hylan (HA products), against joint lavage, and against other IA corticosteroids, were included. IA corticosteroid was more effective than IA placebo for pain reduction (WMD -17.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) -25.02 to -10.55) and patient global assessment (the RR was 1.44 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.82)) at one week post injection with an NNT of 3 to 4 for both, based on n = 185 for pain on 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) and n = 158 for patient global assessment. Data on function were sparse at one week post injection and neither statistically significant nor clinically important differences were detected. There was evidence of pain reduction between two weeks (the RR was 1.81 (95% CI 1.09 to 3.00)) to three weeks (the RR was 3.11 (95% CI 1.61 to 6.01), but a lack of evidence for efficacy in functional improvement. At four to 24 weeks post injection, there was lack of evidence of effect on pain and function (small studies showed benefits which did not reach statistical or clinical importance, i.e. less than 20% risk difference). For patient global, there were three studies which consistently showed lack of effect longer than one week post injection. However, all were fairly small sample sizes (less than 50 patients per group). This was supported by another study which did not find statistically significant differences, at any time point, on a continuous measure of patient global assessment (100 mm VAS). In comparisons of corticosteroids and HA products, no statistically significant differences were in general detected at one to four weeks post injection. Between five and 13 weeks post injection, HA products were more effective than corticosteroids for one or more of the following variables: WOMAC OA Index, Lequesne Index, pain, range of motion (flexion), and number of responders. One study showed a difference in function between 14 to 26 weeks, but no differences in efficacy were detected at 45 to 52 weeks. In general, the onset of effect was similar with IA corticosteroids, but was less durable than with HA products. Comparisons of IA corticosteroids showed triamcinolone hexacetonide was superior to betamethasone for number of patients reporting pain reduction up to four weeks post injection (the RR was 2.00 (95% CI 1.10 to 3.63). Comparisons between IA corticosteroid and joint lavage showed no differences in any of the efficacy or safety outcome measures.

Authors' Conclusions

The short-term benefit of IA corticosteroids in treatment of knee OA is well established, and few side effects have been reported. Longer term benefits have not been confirmed based on the RevMan analysis. The response to HA products appears more durable. In this review, some discrepancies were observed between the RevMan 4.1 analysis and the original publication. These are likely the result of using secondary rather than primary data and the statistical methods available in RevMan 4.1. Future trials should have standardised outcome measures and assessment times, run longer, investigate different patient subgroups, and clinical predictors of response (those associated with inflammation and structural damage).

### Effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for knee osteoarthritis on the rates of subsequent knee replacement and post-operative outcomes: a national cohort study of england [^116EfQJd]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications and future research

The findings from this work can be used to refine the use of IACI in the patient pathway and should facilitate the shared decision-making process between patients and clinicians when considering the use of IACIs for osteoarthritis. The reduction in rates of knee replacement following the use of IACI as observed in our IV analysis suggests a strategy of using IACI for knee osteoarthritis may be effective in helping manage uncontrolled pain, possibly conferring an appreciable delay to meeting the threshold for surgery. However, given our propensity score analyses did not replicate these findings but instead yielded conflicting results due to suspected residual confounding factors, future randomised studies are most likely needed to confirm and further elucidate the impact of single and repeat IACI use on the need for surgery. Unanswered questions include what the possible mechanisms of effect are, when in the osteoarthritis pathway patients should be offered IACI, what is the value for money, and what dose and type of IACI is most effective. The replication of the study in other healthcare settings elsewhere in the world is another subject for future research.

Corticosteroids in total joint arthroplasty — Introduction describes that the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS), the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), the Hip Society, the Knee Society, and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) collaborated to develop evidence-based guidelines on periarticular injection in primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA), with the purpose to improve treatment and reduce practice variation using a multidisciplinary, evidence-based approach. The guidelines address common questions on efficacy and safety of periarticular injection in primary TJA and were developed using the AAOS Clinical Practice Guidelines and Systematic Review Methodology, including systematic review and meta-analyses; direct meta-analyses were performed when data allowed, but network meta-analyses were not performed because of limitations in controlling variation in multimodal analgesic protocols and reported timepoints. The document notes that future updates may be necessary as additional literature becomes available.

### Physical therapy vs. glucocorticoid injection in patients with meniscal tears and knee osteoarthritis: a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial [^114SQJCC]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A meniscal tear is a common degenerative alteration of the knee that can be caused by minor twisting or stress while the individual is participating in competitive sports. Degenerative tears in the knee are more common in older individuals because of the age-related loss of elasticity in the menisci. Previous studies have shown that severe meniscus injuries can lead to knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Furthermore, deterioration of the meniscus has been associated with the deterioration of cartilage in the knee joint, indicating a significant relationship between these two forms of joint pathology. Meniscal tears are particularly common among individuals who suffer from KOA, which is a common cause of joint pain and dysfunction among middle-aged and older people. The scourge of plagiarism afflicts countless individuals globally, imposing immense strain upon both those affected directly and our collective social fabric through its pervasiveness and financial implications. Furthermore, previous research has indicated that KOA may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.

The most common approach for managing meniscus injuries usually focuses on addressing symptoms alone until the injuries progress to the point where knee replacement is necessary due to the worsening of KOA. Intra-articular glucocorticoid injections are commonly administered to treat degenerative meniscus injuries associated with KOA. A variety of treatment methods, such as intra-articular injections of corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, and platelet-rich plasma, have been proposed for the nonsurgical management of KOA. These therapeutic approaches are designed to alleviate pain and enhance functionality in individuals who are affected by KOA.

Intra-articular corticosteroids are highly effective anti-inflammatory agents that are injected directly into the knee joint. These injections can help alleviate inflammation and provide significant relief for individuals who suffer from KOA. Nonetheless, intra-articular corticosteroid injections are associated with certain risks, such as infection, joint cartilage deterioration, and subchondral insufficiency fractures. Therefore, it is important for patients to discuss these risks with them healthcare provider before proceeding with treatment. Exercise-based physical therapy has become the cornerstone for treating osteoarthritis. Studies have shown that physical therapy provides both short-term and long-term pain relief and improves functionality. Both physical therapy and steroid injections have been recommended by medical professionals for the treatment of knee arthritis. However, there is no consensus about which method is more effective for relieving pain and improving joint function over time. Previous clinical trials have shown that physical therapy combined with glucocorticoid injections does not provide further benefits.

Osteoarthritis

Background: Osteoarthritis of the knee is a common source of knee pain, increases with advancing age, and is more prevalent in women than in men.
Etiology: It is a disorder that develops after macro and micro-trauma leads to maladaptive repair response, activation of the pro-inflammatory immune response, and is characterized by cell stress and extracellular matrix degradation. Mechanical stress, varus and valgus malalignment lead to excessive loading of bone and subsequent development of bone marrow lesions, abnormal focal remodeling, and loss of articular cartilage. Osteoarthritis can involve one or both knees and can occur in any of the three compartments of the knee, most commonly in the medial compartment. Symptom onset is gradual, can be localized or generalized joint pain that is worse with weight bearing and joint motion, and relieved with rest. Morning stiffness resolves in less than 30 minutes and the joint may stiffen briefly after inactivity. Clinical exam findings include bony enlargement, small effusions that are body temperature, and crepitus with joint motion.
Diagnostic criteria: Diagnosis can be made based on history and physical exam. Standing radiographs may not show pathology in early OA so normal radiological findings do not exclude OA. Radiologic findings include osteophytes, subchondral cysts, subchondral sclerosis, and joint space narrowing which is graded using the Kellgren–Lawrence grading system (discussed previously).MRI is used to assess soft tissue if associated injury is suspected; however, it is rarely indicated for diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Ultrasound is an inexpensive and portable way to visualize the knee joint and assess for effusions and osteophytes; however, it is not accurate when assessing degree of joint space narrowing.
Treatment: With the exception of joint arthroplasty and regenerative therapies, most treatments for knee pain secondary to OA are palliative in nature. Treatments are tiered depending on the stage and level of disability of the patient. Conservative management includes activity modifications, weight loss if appropriate, exercise, physical therapy, and education. NSAIDs should be considered first line for "as-needed" symptomatic pain control. Opioids have minimal benefit in OA and are associated with undesirable side effect profile and safety risks, therefore use is discouraged. Intra-articular injections with corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid (HA) are well-accepted treatments for temporary symptomatic relief. Biologics such as PRP or mesenchymal stem cells have been proposed to attenuate the pro-inflammatory degradation in OA and potentially remodel the joint. Several adjunct medications such as cathepsin K inhibitors, Wnt inhibitors, anabolic growth factors, nerve growth factor inhibitors are being studied as a means of not only reducing the pain from knee OA but potentially stopping the progression of structural damage. For patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis who failed conservative therapy and who are candidates, total joint replacement is definitive treatment.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Corticosteroid injections — bone mineral density (BMD) risk and dosing limits in postmenopausal patients are detailed as follows: We suggest that the clinicians consider a maximum cumulative whole-body triamcinolone dose equivalent of 200 mg/year and 400 mg per 3 years in postmenopausal women. In support, BMD was not decreased at doses of < 200 mg of MPA/TA equivalents per year for postmenopausal women, and a cohort found no higher fracture risk with a mean cumulative dose of 141.8 mg TA equivalents (range, 2.7–2140.3 mg). Routine series of injections should not be performed; subsequent injection should be repeated only after observation of the patient's response and after recurrence of the pain. The minimum effective dose of CSIs in the joints and in the spine should be administered; CSIs should not be added in sympathetic nerve blocks, TPI, and most peripheral nerve blocks, and physicians should discuss the potential of BMD loss after glucocorticoid injections with their postmenopausal patients.

Knee IACS — dose comparison and durability of effect are detailed: In a 12-week double-blind RCT, 80 mg of IA TA was compared with 40 mg of TA and 80 mg was not found to be superior to 40 mg for IA in terms of pain relief or functional improvement; neither IA corticosteroid nor hyaluronic acid provided sustained symptom relief over 2 years. Evidence syntheses concluded that IACS for knee OA may be associated with moderate improvement in pain and a small improvement in physical function up to 6 weeks after injection, confirmed short-term (up to 6 weeks) superiority with a trend towards superiority of control at long-term follow-up (24 weeks or longer), noted short-lived improvement (< 4 weeks) in guidelines, and found no difference in outcomes between IACS and NSAID injection with both improving at 1 and 3 months; research to date has not demonstrated long-term superiority of one corticosteroid preparation for IA knee injections.

### Cost-effectiveness of physical therapy vs intra-articular glucocorticoid injection for knee osteoarthritis: a secondary analysis from a randomized clinical trial [^113pDXD6]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Results

A total of 156 participants (mean [SD] age, 56.1 [8.7] years; 81 [51.9%] male) were randomized 1:1 and followed up for 1 year. Six participants did not provide outcomes data at 1 year (5 in the injection group; 1 in the physical therapy group). For those individuals, we used multiple imputation (Markov chain Monte Carlo method, 20 iterations), using other follow-up time points as predictors in the imputation model. Every participant had at least 3 of the 5 total data time points. The Little MCAR test suggested that data were indeed missing at random (169.9, P = .51). Baseline variables and demographic characteristics of each group are given in Table 1. The impact inventory recommended for report with cost-effectiveness analysis 11 is found in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Four participants (all in the glucocorticoid injection group) had knee surgery during the 1-year follow-up. Most participants in the glucocorticoid injection group received more than 1 injection (mean, 2.6).

### Prior intra-articular corticosteroid injection within 3 months may increase the risk of deep infection in subsequent joint arthroplasty: a meta-analysis [^115ntCma]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-articular injections containing a corticosteroid are used frequently, and periprosthetic joint infection is a serious complication after total joint arthroplasty. There is debate regarding whether intra-articular corticosteroid injections before arthroplasty increase periprosthetic joint infection after surgery.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Does a previous intra-articular corticosteroid injection increase the odds of infection after subsequent hip or knee arthroplasty? (2) Does this risk vary based on how soon before the arthroplasty (such as less than 3 months before surgery) the injection is administered?

Methods

Using the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from inception to July 2021, we searched for comparative studies in English on patients who received intra-articular corticosteroid injections before arthroplasty and that tracked the frequency of infection after arthroplasty. We extracted data on the risk of infection after subsequent joint arthroplasty. The keywords included "corticosteroid", "steroid", "arthroplasty", "knee replacement", and "hip replacement". Eleven retrospective, comparative studies from four countries were included, of which 10 reported the specific diagnosis criteria and one did not. These articles included data on 173,465 arthroplasties in the hip or knee, as well as of 73,049 injections and 100,416 control patients. The methodologic quality of the included studies was evaluated according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale; the articles' scores ranged from 6 to 7 (the score itself spans 0 to 9, with higher scores representing better study quality). We found no evidence of publication bias based on the Egger test, and tests of heterogeneity generally found heterogeneity, so a random-effects model was used of our meta-analyses. A meta-analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.3 software and Stata version 12.0 software.

Results

Overall, there were no differences in the odds of periprosthetic joint infection between the injection group and the control group among patients who received any kind of injection (odds ratio 1.22 [95% CI 0.95 to 1.58]; p = 0.12). However, in a subgroup analysis, there was a higher OR for postoperative PJI in patients with an intra-articular corticosteroid injection in the knee or hip within 3 months (OR 1.39 [95% CI 1.04 to 1.87]; p = 0.03). There were no differences in the infection risk in patients who had injections between 3 and 6 months before arthroplasty (OR 1.19 [95% CI 0.95 to 1.48]; p = 0.13) or between 6 and 12 months before arthroplasty.

Conclusion

The current evidence suggests ipsilateral intra-articular corticosteroid injections within 3 months before arthroplasty were associated with an increased risk of periprosthetic joint infection during subsequent joint arthroplasty. We recommend against performing total joint arthroplasty on a patient who has received an intra-articular corticosteroid injection within 3 months. Further high-quality studies on this topic from registries, national databases, or insurance company data are still required to confirm and extend our findings.

Corticosteroid injections — septic arthritis risk and presentation are summarized as follows: The incidence of septic arthritis following IACS outside of the context of joint replacement surgery is rare, but patient morbidity can be devastating and infections can result in death. Risk factors for septic arthritis include immunosuppression, intravenous drug use, alcoholism, previous steroid injections, and cutaneous ulcers. Patients commonly present with local warmth and/or swelling, fever, and night pain, and the most involved joints include the knee and hip.

Modified US Preventive Services Task Force levels of certainty regarding net benefit — definitions for evidence strength are outlined for joint pain interventions. High certainty is described as evidence with "consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative care populations with joint pain", with conclusions "unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies". Moderate certainty is when "the available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the intervention on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors", and "the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion". Low certainty indicates "the available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes".

Outcomes

We measured outcomes at baseline (the day of completing baseline assessments), and 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks after administration of the injection via digital or paper questionnaires. Two of us (Q.W. and P.K.B.) did the baseline Kellgren and Lawrence grade scoring blinded to the allocated treatment (interrater reliability: prevalence-adjusted κ value: 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.93). A consensus meeting was held for making final decisions for discrepant grades. The primary outcome was the severity of knee pain at 4 weeks measured with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain subscale (0–100; 0 indicates extreme pain).

Secondary outcomes included the KOOS pain score at 2, 8, 12, and 24 weeks; KOOS symptom, function, sport and recreation, and quality-of-life scores (0–100; 0 indicates extreme symptoms); Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain, function, stiffness, and total scores (0–100; 0 indicates no pain); numeric rating scale of knee pain during the past week (0–10; 0 indicates no pain); Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (0–100; 0 indicates no pain); and EuroQol with 5 dimensions and 5 response levels (−0.446 to 1.000; −0.446 indicates worst health-related quality of life). In addition, we measured perceived recovery and the percentage of responders defined by the OMERACT-OARSI criteria. Patients' perceived recovery was measured with a 7-point Likert scale, and results were dichotomized into recovered (complete recovery, much improved, and slightly improved) or not recovered (no change, slightly worse, much worse, and worse than ever). The OMERACT-OARSI responders are those with high improvements (≥ 50% and absolute increase ≥ 20 points from baseline) in KOOS pain or function score; if that level is not achieved, then improvement in at least 2 of the 3 following domains: greater than or equal to 20% and greater than or equal to 10-point improvement in the KOOS pain score, greater than or equal to 20% and greater than or equal to 10-point improvement in the KOOS function score, and patient-perceived recovery in global assessment (complete recovery, much improved, and slightly improved). We measured adverse events at 2 weeks' follow-up and asked patients about cointerventions (oral medication, additional IA injection, and visit to medical care professional) at all follow-up times.

Periarticular injection contents — rationale: We reviewed forty-seven studies that evaluated the contents of periarticular injections in primary TJA and the effects on postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and adverse events. Sixteen studies, including twelve high quality and four moderate quality studies, compared a local anesthetic periarticular injection alone versus control. All sixteen studies evaluated postoperative pain and six studies found improved postoperative pain compared to control. The remaining ten studies found no difference between local anesthetic and control in postoperative pain. Eleven studies compared postoperative opioid consumption.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^115dgTTi]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Concern has been expressed about possible deleterious effects on articular cartilage volume of repeated joint injections with corticosteroid in people with knee osteoarthritis, but there is little evidence in people with IA. EULAR recommendations for intra-articular therapies advise avoiding > 3–4 corticosteroid injections in the same joint per year while acknowledging the lack of evidence to underpin this.

Conscious sedation, such as nitrous oxide, provides safe and effective short-term relief of pain and anxiety during intra-articular injections and can therefore be considered when administering local corticosteroid injections in children and young people with IA. General anaesthesia may be more suitable in certain cases (e.g. younger children or those requiring multiple injections).

Local corticosteroid injections are well tolerated, and serious side effects are rare. Recognized complications include infection, lipoatrophy, hypopigmentation and temporary worsening of diabetes control. No serious adverse effects took place during the injection procedure or follow-up for all patients included in the systematic review of the five studies mentioned above (n = 120). A minority of patients (n = 7) reported a mild cold feeling during the injection and one patient developed mild local atrophoderma at the point of entry after the treatment. Administration of local corticosteroid injections is also standard practice in other joints in IA (e.g. knees, shoulders), with evidence from RCTs for reduction in joint swelling, improved disease activity scores and DAS28 remission. There is no evidence to support any specific corticosteroid agent over another in the foot.

### Injection-based therapies for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis [^112i6ird]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2025). Medium credibility.

➢ Corticosteroid injections are largely safe, but patients and practitioners should be aware of the small risk of adverse side effects, and their limited duration of efficacy. The timing of injection should be coordinated with potential surgical dates.➢ The routine use of hyaluronic acid injections for osteoarthritis is not recommended, but there are certain subsets of patients, such as those who have undergone other therapies that failed, who may benefit from it.➢ Local anesthetics are frequently used in conjunction with corticosteroids for enhanced pain control; however, caution is needed because of concerns regarding chondrotoxicity. Proper patient selection is crucial, and their overuse for diagnostic purposes is not recommended.➢ There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of prolotherapy, bone marrow aspirate concentrate, stromal vascular fraction, and mesenchymal stromal cell injections.➢ Intra-articular saline solution has been associated with improvements in both patient-reported pain and function scores, and this should be considered in future study designs.

### Cumulative intraarticular injections are not a risk factor for periprosthetic joint infection following total knee arthroplasty [^111pJgdE]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

While injections within 90 days prior to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are associated with an increased risk of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), there is a paucity of literature regarding the impact of cumulative injections on PJI risk. This study was conducted to assess the association between cumulative corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid (HA) injections and PJI risk following TKA.

Methods

This retrospective study using an injection database included patients undergoing TKA with a minimum 1-year follow-up from 2015 to 2020. Patients with injections within 90 days prior to surgery were excluded. The sum of corticosteroid and HA injections within five years prior to TKA was recorded. The primary outcome was PJI within 90 days following TKA. Area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated for a cumulative number of injections.

Results

648 knees with no injections and 672 knees with injections prior to TKA were included, among whom 243 received corticosteroids, 151 received HA, and 278 received both. No significant differences in early PJI rates existed between patients who received injections (0.60%) or not (0.93%) (P = .541). No significant differences existed in early PJI rates between patients injected with corticosteroids (0.82%), HA (0.66%), or both (0.36%) (P = .832). No cutoff number of injections was predictive for PJI.

Discussion

A cumulative amount of steroid or HA injections, if given more than 90 days prior to TKA, does not appear to increase the risk of PJI within 90 days postoperatively. Multiple intraarticular corticosteroid injections and HA injections may be safely administered before TKA, without increased risk for early PJI.

A systematic review pooled these two aforementioned studies (n = 53) to conclude there were non-significant differences in pain score via VAS in favor of PRP versus corticosteroid (p = 0.23). The same systematic review reported that PRP was significantly superior compared to corticosteroid in terms of functional outcomes. Compared to corticosteroid injection for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, PRP intra-articular injection shows superior outcomes, including improved knee joint function and quality of life.

In 2021, Bennell et al published the results of an RCT comparing PRP to saline for the treatment of knee pain secondary to OA. While the results showed no statistically significant difference between PRP and placebo, the authors were not technically using PRP in the treatment arm.PRP is defined as a concentration of platelets that is ≥ 2× that of whole blood – the concentration utilized by the authors was only 1.6×, thus it cannot be considered PRP. This fact alone largely explains why the results are contrary to those published in over three dozen other studies. As such, the results of this study are not reflective of PRP as a treatment for knee pain secondary to OA. In 2022, Chu et al published the results of the largest RCT on PRP to date (n = 610) comparing PRP to sham, utilizing a concentration of roughly 4.3× that of whole blood. The PRP arm showed statistically significant improvements over sham in IKDC, WOMAC, and VAS out to 60 months.

Although there has been much variation in treatment protocols and specifically the total number of PRP injections, the optimal number of PRP injections for positive outcomes has been under investigation. In 2019, one systematic review studied the clinical effectiveness of single versus multiple (double or triple) PRP injections for knee osteoarthritis. Meta-analysis of five clinical trials (n = 301) showed that, at 6 months after the intervention, there were no significant differences in pain improvement between the differing number of injection groups. However, at 6 months, there was a significant and clinically important difference in improvement in knee functionality in favor of multiple injections, with sub-analysis only evident for the results of single versus triple injections. However, the authors conclude that there is difficulty in generalizing data due to the lack of standardization between the multiple injection intervals.

Preoperative intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACS) and periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)/surgical site infection risk around knee and hip arthroplasty are time dependent. For total knee arthroplasty (TKR), studies reported increased risk for injections done in a 6-month window preceding TKR with no detectable increased risk after 6 months, increased incidence when steroids were injected within 3 months, and, in a study of 76 090 patients, significantly increased risk for the 0–2-week window with a trend for increased risk within 2–4 weeks; another analysis of 9766 patients (4766 had IACS, 5000 without injection) found significant risk when IACS was done within 4 weeks prior to the TKA with no infection risk when the interval was beyond 4 weeks. For total hip replacement (THR), two large administrative analyses found that IACS within the 3 months of THR resulted in higher rates of PJI with no increased infection risk for IACS given between 3 and 6 months or between 6 and 12 months, and a 2023 review and meta-analysis concluded that the risk of infection is increased when an IACS is performed within 3 months of THR; across multivariate analyses, diabetes, obesity, inflammatory arthritis, or RA all carried significant risk of PJI, and guidance notes that providing IACS during the 3-month pre-operative period may carry increased risk of PJI, especially if done within 2–4 weeks of TKR.

### Intra-articular treatment options for knee osteoarthritis [^113kNxuh]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Intra-articular drug delivery has a number of advantages over systemic administration; however, for the past 20 years, intra-articular treatment options for the management of knee osteoarthritis (OA) have been limited to analgesics, glucocorticoids, hyaluronic acid (HA) and a small number of unproven alternative therapies. Although HA and glucocorticoids can provide clinically meaningful benefits to an appreciable number of patients, emerging evidence indicates that the apparent effectiveness of these treatments is largely a result of other factors, including the placebo effect. Biologic drugs that target inflammatory processes are used to manage rheumatoid arthritis, but have not translated well into use in OA. A lack of high-level evidence and methodological limitations hinder our understanding of so-called 'stem' cell therapies and, although the off-label administration of intra-articular cell therapies (such as platelet-rich plasma and bone marrow aspirate concentrate) is common, high-quality clinical data are needed before these treatments can be recommended. A number of promising intra-articular treatments are currently in clinical development in the United States, including small-molecule and biologic therapies, devices and gene therapies. Although the prospect of new, non-surgical treatments for OA is exciting, the benefits of new treatments must be carefully weighed against their costs and potential risks.

### Intra-articular corticosteroid injections increase the risk of requiring knee arthroplasty [^112ziRAh]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Recent studies have suggested that corticosteroid injections into the knee may harm the joint resulting in cartilage loss and possibly accelerating the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of this study was to assess whether patients with, or at risk of developing, symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee who receive intra-articular corticosteroid injections have an increased risk of requiring arthroplasty.

Methods

We used data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), a multicentre observational cohort study that followed 4,796 patients with, or at risk of developing, osteoarthritis of the knee on an annual basis with follow-up available up to nine years. Increased risk for symptomatic OA was defined as frequent knee symptoms (pain, aching, or stiffness) without radiological evidence of OA and two or more risk factors, while OA was defined by the presence of both femoral osteophytes and frequent symptoms in one or both knees. Missing data were imputed with multiple imputations using chained equations. Time-dependent propensity score matching was performed to match patients at the time of receving their first injection with controls. The effect of corticosteroid injections on the rate of subsequent (total and partial) knee arthroplasty was estimated using Cox proportional-hazards survival analyses.

Results

After removing patients lost to follow-up, 3,822 patients remained in the study. A total of 249 (31.3%) of the 796 patients who received corticosteroid injections, and 152 (5.0%) of the 3,026 who did not, had knee arthroplasty. In the matched cohort, Cox proportional-hazards regression resulted in a hazard ratio of 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 1.81; p < 0.001) and each injection increased the absolute risk of arthroplasty by 9.4% at nine years' follow-up compared with those who did not receive injections.

Conclusion

Corticosteroid injections seem to be associated with an increased risk of knee arthroplasty in patients with, or at risk of developing, symptomatic OA of the knee. These findings suggest that a conservative approach regarding the treatment of these patients with corticosteroid injections should be recommended.

### Pay attention to the evidence: in the longer term, intraarticular corticosteroid injections offer only harm for knee osteoarthritis [^115cR3K2]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2023). Medium credibility.

With respect to the long-term effects of intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACIs) in knee osteoarthritis (OA), we are at the stage where it seems like the jury has returned a verdict but the judge hasn't yet accepted it. Supporters of IACIs for knee OA, when reading about potential and actual harms and complete lack of any benefit in the medium- or long- term, are now clutching at straws that we shouldn't even expect to observe any benefit in the longer term. Sadly, the same arguments that orthopaedic surgeons use to justify continuing with knee arthroscopy when there are only documented long-term harms and no documented long-term benefits, are being used by rheumatologists to justify continuing with IACIs for knee OA. The only actual reason to keep recommending both IACIs and knee arthroscopy (which sadly society guidelines still do) is the "status quo", with the self-affirming argument that the quality of the RCTs published to date is not (yet) high enough to justify a change in expert opinion. There is a very strong argument against preserving the status quo for knee OA: outcomes everywhere keep getting worse. Knee replacements seem to be on a steady growth curve upwards in all countries and knee OA prevalence itself is also increasing. Something is badly wrong with the status quo for knee OA: if we were getting good results with medical treatment then fewer people would be needing knee replacements, not more. A very easy place to start questioning the status quo is to read a systematic review showing worse results than all comparators for IACIs followed by an editorial saying "let's not give up on IACIs for knee OA just yet". But as mentioned you could just as easily start with an orthopaedic journal editorial saying "let's not give up on knee arthroscopy just yet" after a systematic review showing no benefit for this procedure either.

### Intra-articular corticosteroid injections provide a clinically relevant benefit compared to placebo only at short-term follow-up in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114T2keQ]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To quantify the clinical relevance of intra-articular corticosteroid effects compared to placebo for the injective treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

The PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched on May 3, 2023. This study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published in English, with no time limitation regarding publication date, comparing intra-articular corticosteroids and placebo injections for knee OA. The effects were quantified at short- (≤ 6 weeks), mid- (> 6 weeks and ≤ 3 months), and long-term (≥ 6 months) follow-ups. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the outcomes (visual analogue scale for pain - VAS: 1.4, Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index - WOMAC: 9) was used to interpret the clinical improvement provided by intra-articular corticosteroid injections compared to placebo. The quality of each article was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and the GRADE guidelines.

Results

Among the 1030 articles retrieved, 11 RCTs (842 patients) were included. A comparison of the two groups revealed statistically significant differences in the improvement of VAS and WOMAC scores in terms of the mean difference (MD); this difference was in favour of corticosteroids at short-term (p < 0.001, MD = -1.6 and p < 0.001, MD = -9.9, respectively) and mid-term follow-ups (p = 0.001, mean MD = -1.3 and p = 0.005, MD = -4.9, respectively). No difference was observed at the long-term follow-up. The MDs between the improvements in the two groups reached the MCID values for the VAS and WOMAC only at the short-term follow-up. The RoB 2 tool and the GRADE evaluations showed the presence of risk of bias and limited quality of evidence.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that intra-articular corticosteroid injections offer clinically perceivable pain relief and functional improvement higher than the placebo effect only at short-term follow-up in patients affected by knee OA, with benefits losing clinical relevance already after 6 weeks. These results, together with the low number and the limited quality of the RCTs comparing this treatment with placebo, question the indication for the use of corticosteroid injections in clinical practice for the treatment of knee OA.

### Cost-effectiveness of physical therapy vs intra-articular glucocorticoid injection for knee osteoarthritis: a secondary analysis from a randomized clinical trial [^1179ZeNd]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Physical therapy and glucocorticoid injections are initial treatment options for knee osteoarthritis, but available data indicate that most patients receive one or the other, suggesting they may be competing interventions. The initial cost difference for treatment can be substantial, with physical therapy often being more expensive at the outset, and cost-effectiveness analysis can aid patients and clinicians in making decisions.

Objective

To investigate the incremental cost-effectiveness between physical therapy and intra-articular glucocorticoid injection as initial treatment strategies for knee osteoarthritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This economic evaluation is a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial performed from October 1, 2012, to May 4, 2017. Health economists were blinded to study outcomes and treatment allocation. A randomized sample of patients seen in primary care and physical therapy clinics with a radiographically confirmed diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis were evaluated from the clinical trial with 96.2% follow-up at 1 year.

Interventions

Physical therapy or glucocorticoid injection.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness between 2 alternative treatments. Acceptability curves of bootstrapped incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were used to identify the proportion of ICERs under the specific willingness-to-pay level ($50 000-$100 000). Health care system costs (total and knee related) and health-related quality-of-life based on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were obtained.

Results

A total of 156 participants (mean [SD] age, 56.1 [8.7] years; 81 [51.9%] male) were randomized 1:1 and followed up for 1 year. Mean (SD) 1-year knee-related medical costs were $2113 ($4224) in the glucocorticoid injection group and $2131 ($1015) in the physical therapy group. The mean difference in QALY significantly favored physical therapy at 1 year (0.076; 95% CI, 0.02–0.126; p = 0.003). Physical therapy was the more cost-effective intervention, with an ICER of $8103 for knee-related medical costs, with a 99.2% probability that results fall below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000.

Conclusions and Relevance

A course of physical therapy was cost-effective compared with a course of glucocorticoid injections for patients with knee osteoarthritis. These results suggest that, although the initial cost of delivering physical therapy may be higher than an initial course of glucocorticoid injections, 1-year total knee-related costs are equivalent, and greater improvement in QALYs may justify the initial higher costs.

### Evaluation of the benefit of corticosteroid injection before exercise therapy in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: a randomized clinical trial [^115jQVee]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is the most frequent form of arthritis and a cause of pain and disability. Combined nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments are recommended as the optimal treatment approach, but no evidence supports the recommendation.

Objective

To assess the clinical benefits of an intra-articular corticosteroid injection given before exercise therapy in patients with OA of the knee.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We performed a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the benefit of intra-articular corticosteroid injection vs placebo injection given before exercise therapy at an OA outpatient clinic from October 1, 2012, through April 2, 2014. The participants had radiographic confirmation of clinical OA of the knee, clinical signs of localized inflammation in the knee, and knee pain during walking (score > 4 on a scale of 0 to 10).

Interventions

Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to an intra-articular 1-mL injection of the knee with methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol), 40 mg/mL, dissolved in 4 mL of lidocaine hydrochloride (10 mg/mL) (corticosteroid group) or a 1-mL isotonic saline injection mixed with 4 mL of lidocaine hydrochloride (10 mg/mL) (placebo group). Two weeks after the injections, all participants started a 12-week supervised exercise program.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was change in the Pain subscale of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire (range, 0–100; higher scores indicate greater improvement) at week 14. Secondary outcomes included the remaining KOOS subscales and objective measures of physical function and inflammation. Outcomes were measured at baseline, week 2 (exercise start), week 14 (exercise stop), and week 26 (follow-up).

Results

One hundred patients were randomized to the corticosteroid group (n = 50) or the placebo group (n = 50); 45 and 44 patients, respectively, completed the trial. The mean (SE) changes in the KOOS Pain subscale score at week 14 were 13.6 (1.8) and 14.8 (1.8) points in the corticosteroid and placebo groups, respectively, corresponding to a statistically insignificant mean difference of 1.2 points (95% CI, -3.8 to 6.2; p = 0.64). We found no statistically significant group differences in any of the secondary outcomes at any time point.

Conclusions and Relevance

No additional benefit results from adding an intra-articular injection of 40 mg of corticosteroid before exercise in patients with painful OA of the knee. Further research is needed to establish optimal and potentially synergistic combinations of conservative treatments.

Knee and hip osteoarthritis progression and osteonecrosis after corticosteroid injections — evidence synthesis and retrospective data report: an updated Cochrane review found no effect on joint space narrowing versus control (SD = −0.02; 95% CI −0.49 to 0.46). A retrospective hip OA study of 70 patients reported radiographic OA progression in 44% (31 of 70) and collapse of the articular surface in 17% (12 of 70) after corticosteroid with local anesthetic injections, with X-ray defined osteonecrosis prevalence of 37% in the IACS group and 24% in the comparator group. A larger multicenter longitudinal study followed 684 propensity-score-matched participants and defined knee radiographic progression as Kellgren–Lawrence grade increase > 1 or joint space decrease > 0.7 mm, noting an association between IACS and knee radiographic OA progression.

### Effect of intramuscular vs intra-articular glucocorticoid injection on pain among adults with knee osteoarthritis: the KIS randomized clinical trial [^112fznsN]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Sample Size

This study was powered to test whether IM injection was noninferior to IA injection regarding the KOOS pain score at 4 weeks' follow-up. We used data from the trial of Henriksen et alfor estimating an SD of 16 for the KOOS pain score. The minimal clinically important difference for KOOS pain score is 9. We prespecified the noninferiority margin at 7, which is slightly smaller than the minimal clinically important difference. A sample size of 130 patients (65 per group) was needed to achieve 80% power at a significance level of α = .05 to detect noninferiority, assuming the true between-group mean (SD) was 7 (16). Based on our prior experience in glucocorticoid injection trials, we expected a low rate of loss to follow-up of 5%. Therefore, we aimed to recruit 137 patients.

### Analysis of the cost and efficacy of intra-articular knee injections [^111PP9H4]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most frequently encountered orthopaedic conditions, affecting more than 9.3 million adults and accounting for more than $27 billion in annual healthcare expenditures in the United States alone. Although OA is known to be caused by wear and tear on knee joint cartilage, current treatment modalities target different aspects of the condition and follow a tiered approach. Medical management often begins with acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to address inflammatory mediators, while physical therapy improves outcomes for symptomatic pain and stiffness. As the condition severity worsens, affected joints may be managed with intra-articular injections or operative management with total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

The efficacy of joint injections, however, presents a contentious topic. While corticosteroid (CS) injections have been repeatedly found to offer rapid onset pain relief, they have not demonstrated long-term effects. Although they are the most widely used intra-articular therapy for OA, reviews on CS injections have reported pain relief duration spans as short as 1 weekand up to 6 weeks, while effects past that window remain under debate. CS injections may paradoxically induce cartilage damage over time and increase the risk of OA progression. Similarly, the outcomes of hyaluronic acid (HA) injections are contested, with the long-term efficacy of this treatment modality unproven. Comparatively, the pain relief provided by HA seems enduring than that by CS injections, with several studies suggesting HA outperforms CS beyond 8 weeks from treatment.HA is also designed to restore and protect the physiologic environment of the joint capsule, which, in principle, is a positive effect on function. However, perceived benefits are weighed against a higher price point and the context of industry-backed studies with a preponderance for many of the positive findings currently published in peer-reviewed journals.

### Predictors of placebo response to local (intra-articular) therapy in osteoarthritis: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^116kwLQ4]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

This study was conducted under the umbrella of the OA Trial Bank, an international collaboration endorsed by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology. It brings together IPD data from RCTs to identify specific responsive subgroups for the different OA treatments. The research question and study proposal of this study were approved by the steering committee of the OA Trial Bank before the development of the published study protocol. The PROSPERO registration number is CRD42018095188.

Types of study and participants

All randomized placebo‐controlled trials, including crossover trials, evaluating either IA glucocorticoid or IA HA injections were eligible for inclusion. There were no language restrictions. Participants from the identified RCTs, assigned to the placebo group, had to have a diagnosis of knee and hip OA according to the criteria defined by the American College of Rheumatology and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology evidence‐based recommendations for the diagnosis of knee OA or on the basis of defined clinical and/or radiographic information, fulfilling the specified diagnostic criteria of OA of the respective trials.

Outcomes

The minimum criterion for inclusion of RCTs was sufficient participant reporting of pain measures in at least one of the subsequent follow‐up time frames: short‐term (up to 4 weeks), midterm (closest to 12 weeks) or long‐term (closest to 24 weeks). As a minimum, age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) were required. If available, potential placebo response modifier variables were extracted, including disease duration, OA at other joints, radiographic information, stiffness and function scores, signs of effusion and inflammatory features (either by physical examination or by radiographic imaging with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging), and intervention and trial design characteristics.

### Knee joint aspiration and injection [^1124G8hH]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Knee joint aspiration and injection are performed to aid in diagnosis and treatment of knee joint diseases. The knee joint is the most common and the easiest joint for the physician to aspirate. One approach involves insertion of a needle 1 cm above and 1 cm lateral to the superior lateral aspect of the patella at a 45-degree angle. Once the needle has been inserted 1 to 1 1/2 inches, aspiration aided by local compression is performed. Local corticosteroid injections can provide significant relief and often ameliorate acute exacerbations of knee osteoarthritis associated with significant effusions. Among the indications for arthrocentesis are crystal-induced arthropathy, hemarthrosis, unexplained joint effusion, and symptomatic relief of a large effusion. Contraindications include bacteremia, inaccessible joints, joint prosthesis, and overlying infection in the soft tissue. Large effusions can recur and may require repeat aspiration. Anti-inflammatory medications may prove beneficial in reducing joint inflammation and fluid accumulations.

Methods

Data and participants

We obtained and used English primary care health data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD for the period 01/01/2005 to 28/08/2020. CPRD GOLD contains electronic primary care health records capturing data on patient demographics, symptoms, referrals, test results, diagnoses, clinical measurements, and prescribed medicines. Clinical data are entered into the database by general practice staff in the form of Read codes — a hierarchical classification system that's been in use for over 30 years. At the time of data extraction (September 2020), CPRD GOLD covered 4.8% of the UK population, and cumulatively contained data covering approximately 19 million current and historical people from over 900 GP practices spread across the country. All-cause mortality data were linked to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) based on the Lower Layer Super Output Area of the patient's postcode. Secondary care Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data were also linked, containing hospital diagnoses and procedures for admitted patient care (APC), and associated Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). Curator software was used to perform pre-analytical data curation.

Incident knee osteoarthritis patients diagnosed between 01/01/2005 and 31/12/2019 were identified using Read code lists (Additional File 1: Table S1). Only patients whose data quality was flagged as acceptable for clinical research and registered at a GP practice with at least 1 year of 'up to standard' (the date of which is defined by CPRD in the dataset) clinical records were included. People with osteoarthritis at other anatomical joints were excluded as it was otherwise difficult to confidently ascertain which joint received an IACI from the Read code data. Further exclusion criteria, measured at knee osteoarthritis diagnosis date, were: age < 20 years old, body mass index (BMI) < 15 kg/m, prior referral to orthopaedic surgery (given it could be reasonably expected that in these cases injection may be being offered as a pain management strategy during the waiting period for joint replacement), prevalent inflammatory arthritis, and patients for whom HES APC linkage was not available.

Exposure

The exposure of interest was IACI. This was defined using a Read code for IACI in the knee joint or in an unspecified joint location (given the preponderance of such codes and the exclusion of patients with osteoarthritis affecting other sites).

### Physical therapy vs. glucocorticoid injection in patients with meniscal tears and knee osteoarthritis: a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial [^112w9QXP]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Trial procedures

Participants were recruited via hospital advertising and clinician referrals. All advertising strategies directed potential participants to a preliminary online screening form on the clinician. Those who passed the initial screening underwent full screening over the telephone with a member of the research team. All the participants received education classes, with the aim of providing abasic understanding of meniscus tears and knee osteoarthritis and reducing the degree of fear associated with pain symptoms. Simple strategies to reduce the risk of pain and improve function and instructions on how to self-manage any minor symptoms were discussed.

We performed block randomization at a 1:1 ratio, and we used a central computer-generated randomization scheme based on an electronic data capture (EDC) system. The randomization list was securely locked away and stored on EDC servers, and the allocation information was kept hidden. An investigator who was not involved in the randomization procedure prepared all sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes containing the assigned interventions to ensure that the sequence was concealed. After the sample size was determined, a third party randomly opened the envelopes to assign participants to either the physical therapy group or the glucocorticoid injection group sequentially.

To minimize bias and ensure the integrity of the study, in this study, the two groups of patients were blinded to the other treatment groups, as they were treated in different departments and rooms. As masking participants to their treatment assignment was impossible, participants were reminded to avoid discussing their treatment assignment with assessors or other participants. Physiotherapists delivered the intervention but played no role in data collection other than recording session attendance.

None of the study funders had any role in data collection, storage, or analysis; in the writing of the manuscript; or in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.

Glucocorticoid injections

Orthopedists or rheumatologists perform intra-articular injections according to clinical standards. One of the orthopedic providers administered an injection into one knee. The injection included 1 mL of triamcinolone acetonide (at a concentration of 40 mg per milliliter) combined with 7 mL of 1% lidocaine. A sterile technique was used. This injection aimed to reduce inflammation and pain while ensuring patient safety during the procedure. The same treatment providers examined patients again at 2 months and 6 months to discuss the continued plan of care, including the appropriateness of additional glucocorticoid injections. Patients could receive up to three injections over the 1-year trial period at the discretion of the clinician. Satisfactory treatment adherence in the glucocorticoid injection group was defined as the completion of the injection.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The dose of any local anesthetic administered varies with the anesthetic procedure, the area to be anesthetized, the vascularity of the tissues, the number of neuronal segments to be blocked, the depth of anesthesia and degree of muscle relaxation required, the duration of anesthesia desired, individual tolerance, and the physical condition of the patient. The smallest dose and concentration required to produce the desired result should be administered. Dosages of MARCAINE should be reduced for elderly and/or debilitated patients and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease. The rapid injection of a large volume of local anesthetic solution should be avoided and fractional (incremental) doses should be used when feasible.

For specific techniques and procedures, refer to standard textbooks.

There have been adverse event reports of chondrolysis in patients receiving intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures. MARCAINE is not approved for this use (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

In recommended doses, MARCAINE produces complete sensory block, but the effect on motor function differs among the three concentrations.

0.25%when used for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve block, produces incomplete motor block. Should be used for operations in which muscle relaxation is not important, or when another means of providing muscle relaxation is used concurrently. Onset of action may be slower than with the 0.5% or 0.75% solutions.

### Guidance by ultrasound of intra-articular injections in the knee and hip joints [^112vES9L]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop and assess a stable method for ascertaining the placement of intraarticular injections for osteoarthritis (OA) in the hip and knee.

Methods

Injections into the hip or knee joint with e.g. hyaluronan or cortisone were performed under the guidance of ultrasound. For this purpose an Acuson Sequoia apparatus and a 8–15 MHz transducer were used. After perforation of the capsule with a 21 G needle, 0.5–1 mL of atmospheric air and 1 mL lidocain 1% was injected with simultaneous recording of the ultrasound signals. This procedure was undertaken before the injection of the medication through the in situ needle.

Results

In the hip joint the injected air could readily ascertain the placement of the injection with a sharp echoic contrast forming on the ultrasound picture respecting the joint cavity. In the knee joint the procedure gave the best results in joints which have a small amount of fluid in either the suprapatellar bursa or in a pouch regularly observed over the lateral joint margin. However, also in some so-called 'dry' knee joints the air could be traced in the bursa by ultrasound.

Conclusion

By the injection of air, it is possible to test the placement of intraarticular injections in both hip and knee joints. This procedure will give a supplementary documentation of the injection as compared to a mere ultrasonographic demonstration of the position of the needle in the joint. The method is proposed as a tool for both learning purposes and quality assurance in daily therapy.

### Intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee… [^1116ZhzV]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Question How effective and safe are intra-articular corticosteroid injections for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. Evidence-Based Answer Intra-articular corticosteroid injections can be used to reduce pain by about 20% in the short term in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Intra-articular injections cause joint infections in one out of 14, 000 to 77, 000 procedures and can result in hyperglycemia for two to three days in patients with diabetes mellitus. Injections should not be given more often than every three months. Evidence Summary EFFECTIVENESS A meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials comparing a single corticosteroid injection with placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee showed improvement in pain but not in function at one week.

There was no improvement in any parameter at longer intervals. Four studies compared the percentage of patients with reduced pain after a corticosteroid injection compared with those who had a placebo injection. One trial showed a nonsignificant difference at one week, and another found reduced pain with steroids at one week but no difference at four weeks. One trial showed reduced pain at two weeks after a corticosteroid injection, and one found reduced pain at three weeks. Three studies that measured range of motion and walking distance or time found no significant differences for up to 24 weeks. Short-Term Hyperglycemia in Patients with Diabetes. Two small cohort studies found that corticosteroid injections produced short-term elevations in glucose levels in patients with diabetes who have osteoarthritis. In the first study, seven of nine patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes had glucose levels more than two standard deviations above baseline after a methylprednisone injection into the knee. Recommendations from Others The American College of Rheumatology recommends that intra-articular corticosteroid injections be administered no more often than every three months for patients with osteoarthritis whose symptoms are not controlled with full-dose acetaminophen. 7 A guideline from the United Kingdom's National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions recommends intra-articular corticosteroid injections in combination with exercise and weight loss for pain relief in patients with osteoarthritis. 8.

### Intra-articular corticosteroid for treating osteoarthritis of the knee… [^111UVSjo]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer An injection of the knee joint with a corticosteroid may improve the patient's symptoms for up to three weeks after the injection. There is no evidence that this intervention improves function, and there is little evidence of the benefits persisting beyond three weeks. Risk of dangerous adverse effects is minimal. Injection of hyaluronan and hylan products may provide longer-lasting benefit. Practice Pointers This review 1 shows that intra-articular injection of a corticosteroid is useful in improving pain and the patient's global assessment of symptoms for up to three weeks in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. The analysis was based on 26 trials with a total of 1, 721 patients. However, most studies were small and brief, with fewer than 100 participants and a duration of less than 26 weeks.

Only good-quality studies that used standardized rheumatologic outcome measures were included in the review. The authors made an adequate attempt to find all relevant articles and combined data using standard techniques. The collaboration also has reviewed local injection of corticosteroid for carpal tunnel syndrome 7 and found benefit lasting up to one month. Some evidence-based clinical guidelines 2, 4 recommend intra-articular corticosteroid injection for treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee when other, more conservative, treatments are not effective. Several authors have described injection techniques in detail. 8–10 This Cochrane review covers the best and most recent evidence available and supports the use of intra-articular corticosteroids for osteoarthritis of the knee. At four to 24 weeks postinjection, there was a lack of evidence of effect on pain and function. This result was supported by another study that did not find statistically significant differences, at any time point, on a continuous measure of patient global assessment. One study showed a difference in function between 14 and 26 weeks, but no differences in efficacy were detected at 45 to 52 weeks. In general, the onset of effect was similar with intra-articular corticosteroids but was less durable than with HA products.

### Long-term intra-articular steroid injections and knee cartilage… [^1148iq3T]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor The randomized clinical trial by Dr McAlindon and colleagues1 evaluated intra-articular administration of triamcinolone in the knee every 3 months. It is not surprising that clinical benefit 3 months following injection relative to placebo was not observed. The analgesic effect following corticosteroid injection is limited to weeks in duration.
