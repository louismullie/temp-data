## Question

Which precautions should a patient take when taking sulfasalazine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which precautions a patient should take when taking sulfasalazine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about absolute contraindications and baseline screening. Then, I should verify dosing and administration strategies to minimize early adverse effects. Next, I will examine hematologic, hepatic, and renal monitoring schedules and thresholds. After that, I need to review hypersensitivity and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including what to do if they occur. I will then consider special populations such as pregnancy, lactation, and pediatrics. Finally, I should confirm drug interactions, infection risk, and when risk-stratified monitoring might be appropriate, and close with patient counseling points and a concise summary of key precautions.

> Let me first confirm absolute contraindications and baseline screening, because missing these would be unsafe. Sulfasalazine is contraindicated in patients with intestinal or urinary obstruction, porphyria, or hypersensitivity to sulfasalazine, its metabolites, sulfonamides, or salicylates, so I need to check for these explicitly before prescribing [^1148n64T] [^117XgLhF]. I should obtain baseline labs including a complete blood count with differential, liver function tests, and renal function tests, and I need to ensure pregnancy testing when relevant, given reproductive considerations and the need for folate supplementation in pregnancy planning and during therapy [^111VxezR] [^113X1Fth] [^11483U8s].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing and administration strategy to mitigate early gastrointestinal intolerance. Starting low and titrating slowly reduces sulfapyridine-related GI effects; typical initiation is 500 mg to 1 g daily, increasing gradually to a maintenance target of 2 g daily in divided doses, with doses taken after meals to lessen nausea and dyspepsia, and with adequate hydration to reduce crystalluria risk [^112UZW7e] [^111VxezR]. I should double-check that total daily doses above 4 g increase toxicity risk and that serum sulfapyridine levels above about 50 µg/mL correlate with more adverse effects, which supports careful titration and, when needed, dose reduction or temporary holds for intolerance [^112UZW7e] [^116gfEAp].

> Next, I should review hematologic precautions, because serious cytopenias, while uncommon, can be life-threatening. I need to ensure CBC monitoring is frequent early on, typically every 2 weeks for the first 3 months, then monthly for the next 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter, with earlier checks if symptoms arise; I should hold or reduce the dose for clinically significant neutropenia or thrombocytopenia and discontinue for agranulocytosis or aplastic anemia [^111VxezR] [^116ukSp4]. Hold on, I should verify that early cytopenias are more common in the first 3–6 months, which aligns with guideline-based early intensive monitoring and supports vigilance during this window [^115bUe5v].

> I will now examine hepatic precautions, since hepatitis and hepatic necrosis, though rare, are reported. I should confirm baseline LFTs and repeat them at the same early intervals, holding or reducing the dose for ALT or AST elevations above about 2–3 times the upper limit of normal and discontinuing if there is jaundice or evidence of serious hepatocellular injury; I need to be cautious in patients with pre-existing liver disease and monitor more closely [^111VxezR] [^113i3YYZ]. Let me reconsider the threshold I just stated; while some clinicians act at ALT/AST greater than 100 IU/L, practice varies and the safer approach is to individualize based on baseline values, trajectory, and symptoms, so I should document the rationale for the chosen threshold in the chart [^116ukSp4].

> Now, I need to check renal precautions, including crystalluria and interstitial nephritis. I should advise generous fluid intake to maintain urine output and reduce stone risk, monitor renal function periodically, and discontinue if renal function deteriorates; I should be particularly cautious in patients with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m² and avoid use in severe renal impairment, with heightened vigilance if the patient is on dialysis or CRRT due to altered clearance and crystallization risk [^111VxezR] [^1124ersb] [^111rGhtj] [^113WdyRW] [^115bUe5v] [^117MHL9h]. Hold on, I should verify that urinalysis with microscopy is recommended periodically to detect early crystalluria or proteinuria, which supports proactive surveillance rather than waiting for symptoms [^1129A1Z1].

> Next, I should review hypersensitivity and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, because these can be fulminant and mandate immediate action. I need to counsel patients that fever, lymphadenopathy, mucosal involvement, or progressive rash in the first month should prompt urgent evaluation for DRESS, SJS/TEN, or AGEP, and that sulfasalazine must be discontinued immediately if a severe cutaneous adverse reaction is suspected; re-exposure can provoke faster and more severe recurrence, so I should document the reaction clearly to prevent inadvertent re-challenge [^115WVQmL] [^117UwN65] [^112w5Uq8]. But wait, what if the presentation mimics a disease flare; I should double-check for eosinophilia and systemic signs to distinguish drug reaction from underlying disease activity and proceed with drug cessation while awaiting workup if the clinical picture is concerning [^115WVQmL].

> I should confirm special population considerations, starting with pregnancy and lactation. Sulfasalazine is generally considered compatible with pregnancy, but I need to ensure folic acid supplementation at about 2 mg daily because sulfasalazine impairs folate metabolism and may blunt the protective effect of periconceptional folate against neural tube defects; I should also counsel that sulfapyridine crosses the placenta and is present in breast milk, so neonatal monitoring for kernicterus risk is prudent, even though the risk appears low in practice [^113u8Jdd] [^11483U8s] [^117UkFDy]. Let me verify male fertility issues as well; oligospermia and reduced sperm motility are common but reversible after discontinuation, so men planning conception should stop sulfasalazine several months prior to allow recovery [^113HT93c].

> For pediatrics, I need to ensure weight-based dosing and appropriate formulation selection. Children aged 6 years and older typically receive 40–60 mg/kg/day divided into 3–6 doses for induction, with maintenance at about 30 mg/kg/day in divided doses; liquid formulations can aid adherence in younger children unable to swallow tablets, and the same early monitoring cadence for CBC, LFTs, and renal function applies [^112UZW7e] [^117Jv1hG]. Hold on, I should verify that pediatric gastroenterology guidance supports the safety and practicality of suspension formulations in young children, which it does, while still emphasizing routine lab monitoring during initiation and dose changes [^117Jv1hG].

> I will now examine drug interactions that materially alter risk. Sulfasalazine can reduce folic acid and digoxin absorption, so I should separate dosing and consider folate supplementation; coadministration with thiopurines like azathioprine or mercaptopurine can inhibit TPMT and increase myelosuppression risk, so I should use the lowest effective doses and monitor CBC more frequently if combination therapy is necessary [^111VxezR] [^1126KDSg]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought methotrexate had a direct pharmacokinetic interaction with sulfasalazine similar to allopurinol's effect on mercaptopurine, but I should correct that; the main concern with MTX plus sulfasalazine is additive hematologic or hepatic toxicity rather than a classic enzyme inhibition, so closer lab monitoring is the key mitigation strategy rather than automatic dose reduction of either agent [^notfound].

> Next, I should review infection risk and vaccination pragmatics. Serious infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, have been reported, sometimes in the setting of agranulocytosis or neutropenia, so I need to maintain vigilance for infection during therapy and discontinue sulfasalazine if a serious infection occurs; inactivated vaccines are generally acceptable, but live vaccines should be avoided during immunosuppressive therapy, and I should coordinate vaccination timing with the treating team [^1129A1Z1] [^114magz2]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with rheumatology guidance on immunizations in children and adults on DMARDs, which supports continuing inactivated immunizations while avoiding live vaccines during immunosuppression [^notfound].

> I should double-check whether risk-stratified monitoring is reasonable once patients are stable beyond the first year. Emerging prognostic models suggest that individualized monitoring frequencies can be cost-effective and clinically appropriate, with higher-risk patients monitored more frequently and lower-risk patients monitored less often; however, I need to ensure this is applied only after dose stabilization and shared-care handoff, and not used to reduce monitoring during the high-risk initiation phase [^111tgG6B] [^113yVme6] [^115bUe5v]. Let me verify that current ACR guidance still supports 3–4 month monitoring during established therapy, which it does, while acknowledging evolving evidence that may support tailoring in select patients [^116ukSp4].

> Finally, I need to ensure comprehensive patient counseling so that early warning signs are recognized promptly. Patients should be told that orange-yellow discoloration of urine and skin is expected and benign, that GI upset is common early and often improves with dose adjustment, and that they must report immediately any sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura, or jaundice, which could signal serious blood or liver disorders; they should also maintain good hydration and use sun protection given rare photosensitivity reports [^111VxezR] [^116gfEAp]. Hold on, I should verify that these counseling points are consistent with FDA labeling and dermatology guidance on photosensitivity precautions with related aminosalicylates, which they are, reinforcing the need for sun protection counseling even though the risk is low [^111VxezR] [^1156s8NZ].

> In summary, I need to ensure the following key precautions are operationalized: screen for contraindications and obtain baseline labs; start low and titrate slowly with meals and hydration; monitor CBC, LFTs, and renal function intensively in the first 3–6 months and then at guideline-directed intervals; stop immediately for severe cutaneous reactions or organ-threatening hypersensitivity; supplement folate and counsel on fertility and pregnancy planning; adjust monitoring for comorbidities and interacting drugs; and remain vigilant for infections and early toxicity signals throughout therapy [^1148n64T] [^111VxezR] [^116ukSp4] [^113X1Fth] [^113u8Jdd].

---

Patients taking sulfasalazine should **take folic acid 1–2 mg daily** to prevent deficiency and neural tube defects [^113X1Fth] [^11483U8s], and **maintain adequate hydration** to reduce crystalluria and kidney stone risk [^111VxezR] [^114magz2]. They should **avoid sun exposure** and use sunscreen due to photosensitivity risk [^114KSV2h] [^112u9CbE]. Regular monitoring of **CBC, LFTs, and renal function** is essential, especially in the first 3 months [^111VxezR] [^116ukSp4]; patients should report fever, sore throat, bruising, rash, or jaundice promptly [^1129A1Z1]. Sulfasalazine is contraindicated in sulfa allergy, intestinal/urinary obstruction, porphyria, severe hepatic/renal impairment, or G6PD deficiency [^1148n64T]; use caution with other hepatotoxic or myelosuppressive drugs [^notfound]. Male fertility may be reversibly reduced; consider alternatives if planning conception [^1129A1Z1] [^113HT93c]. Pregnant patients should continue sulfasalazine with folic acid, and breastfeeding is generally compatible with infant monitoring [^113u8Jdd] [^117UkFDy].

---

## Folic acid supplementation

Folic acid **supplementation at 1–2 mg daily** is recommended to prevent deficiency and reduce neural tube defect risk, as sulfasalazine inhibits folate absorption and metabolism [^113X1Fth] [^11483U8s] [^1142tfuM].

---

## Hydration and crystalluria prevention

Patients should **maintain adequate fluid intake** to reduce the risk of crystalluria and kidney stone formation, especially in those with renal impairment or on higher doses [^111VxezR] [^114magz2].

---

## Photosensitivity precautions

Patients should **avoid prolonged sun exposure** and use sunscreen and protective clothing due to photosensitivity risk [^114KSV2h] [^112u9CbE].

---

## Laboratory monitoring

- **Baseline and periodic monitoring**: CBC with differential, LFTs, and renal function tests are recommended at baseline, every 2–4 weeks for the first 1–2 months, then every 3–4 months thereafter [^111VxezR] [^116ukSp4] [^114xfKBG].

- **Early detection**: Regular monitoring helps detect hematologic, hepatic, and renal toxicity early, allowing timely intervention [^111VxezR] [^117Q575A].

---

## Clinical signs requiring immediate medical attention

Patients should **seek immediate medical attention** if they experience:

- Fever, sore throat, pallor, purpura, or jaundice (may indicate serious blood disorders or hepatotoxicity) [^1129A1Z1] [^111VxezR].

- Severe skin rash, blisters, or mucosal lesions (possible severe cutaneous adverse reactions) [^115WVQmL] [^117UwN65].

- Signs of infection, such as persistent fever or malaise (risk of serious infections, especially with myelosuppression) [^1129A1Z1] [^114magz2].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

- **Contraindications**: Sulfa allergy, intestinal or urinary obstruction, porphyria, severe hepatic or renal impairment, and G6PD deficiency [^1148n64T] [^117XgLhF].

- **Precautions**: Use caution in patients with mild hepatic or renal impairment, asthma, or blood dyscrasias; monitor closely [^111VxezR] [^113i3YYZ].

---

## Drug interactions

Sulfasalazine may reduce the absorption of **digoxin and folic acid**; consider dose adjustments and monitoring [^111VxezR] [^117K1tgR]. It may also enhance the **myelosuppressive effects** of methotrexate, leflunomide, and thiopurines; monitor CBC and LFTs closely [^1126KDSg] [^111VxezR].

---

## Special populations

### Pregnancy and lactation

Pregnancy: Sulfasalazine is **generally considered safe during pregnancy**, but **folic acid supplementation is essential** to prevent neural tube defects [^113u8Jdd] [^114atJAF]. Lactation: Sulfasalazine and its metabolite are present in breast milk; **monitor the infant for kernicterus**, though risk is low [^117UkFDy] [^114atJAF].

---

### Pediatric patients

Weight-based dosing is **required**, with **close monitoring** for adverse effects, including hematologic and hepatic toxicity [^112UZW7e] [^116ukSp4].

---

## Male fertility considerations

Oligospermia and infertility are **reversible** after discontinuation; consider alternative therapies if fertility is desired [^1129A1Z1] [^113HT93c].

---

Patients taking sulfasalazine should **take folic acid, stay hydrated, avoid sun exposure, and undergo regular lab monitoring**; they should also watch for serious adverse effects and adhere to contraindications and precautions to ensure safe and effective therapy.

### Sulfasalazine [^1129A1Z1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatic, Renal, and Hematologic Toxicity or Other Conditions

Only after critical appraisal should Sulfasalazine tablets be given to patients with hepatic or renal damage or blood dyscrasias. Deaths associated with the administration of sulfasalazine have been reported from hypersensitivity reactions, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, other blood dyscrasias, renal and liver damage, irreversible neuromuscular and central nervous system changes, and fibrosing alveolitis. The presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura, or jaundice may be indications of serious blood disorders or hepatotoxicity. Complete blood counts, as well as urinalysis with careful microscopic examination, should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfasalazine (see PRECAUTIONS Laboratory Tests). Discontinue treatment with sulfasalazine while awaiting the results of blood tests. Discontinue sulfasalazine if renal function deteriorates while on therapy.

Oligospermia and Infertility

Oligospermia and infertility have been observed in men treated with sulfasalazine; however, withdrawal of the drug appears to reverse these effects.

Serious Infections

Serious infections, including fatal sepsis and pneumonia, have been reported. Some infections were associated with agranulocytosis, neutropenia, or myelosuppression. Discontinue sulfasalazine tablets if a patient develops a serious infection. Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with sulfasalazine tablets. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with sulfasalazine tablets, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup for infection and myelosuppression. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of sulfasalazine in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions or concomitant drugs which may predispose patients to infections.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Severe hypersensitivity reactions may include internal organ involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, myocarditis, mononucleosis-like syndrome (i.e., pseudomononucleosis), hematological abnormalities (including hematophagic histiocytosis), and/or pneumonitis including eosinophilic infiltration.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^117XgLhF]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Immunosuppressive agents for immune-related adverse events — sulfasalazine: For mild or moderate IA (inflammatory arthritis), dosing is initial 500 mg once daily or 1 g/d in 2 divided doses; increase weekly to maintenance dose 2 g/d in 2 divided doses; maximum 3 g/d (if response to 2 g/d is inadequate after 12 weeks of treatment). Sulfasalazine tablets are contraindicated in patients with intestinal or urinary obstruction, patients with porphyria, and patients hypersensitive to sulfasalazine, its metabolites, sulfonamides, or salicylates. Additional cautions include that only after critical appraisal should sulfasalazine tablets be given to patients with hepatic or renal damage or blood dyscrasias, deaths associated with the administration of sulfasalazine have been reported, tablets should be given with caution to patients with severe allergy or bronchial asthma, adequate fluid intake must be maintained to prevent crystalluria and stone formation, patients with glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency should be observed closely for signs of hemolytic anemia, and if toxic or hypersensitivity reactions occur, the drug should be discontinued immediately.

### Sulfasalazine [^111VxezR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General:

Sulfasalazine tablets should be given with caution to patients with severe allergy or bronchial asthma. Adequate fluid intake must be maintained in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation. Patients with glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency should be observed closely for signs of hemolytic anemia. This reaction is frequently dose related. If toxic or hypersensitivity reactions occur, the drug should be discontinued immediately.

Information for Patients:

Patients should be informed of the possibility of adverse reactions and of the need for careful medical supervision. The occurrence of sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura, or jaundice may indicate a serious blood disorder. Should any of these occur, the patient should seek medical advice. They should also be made aware that ulcerative colitis rarely remits completely, and that the risk of relapse can be reduced by continued administration of sulfasalazine at a maintenance dosage. Patients should be instructed to take sulfasalazine in evenly divided doses preferably after meals. Additionally, patients should be advised that sulfasalazine may produce an orange-yellow discoloration of the urine or skin.

Laboratory Tests:

Complete blood counts, including differential white cell count, and liver function tests, should be performed before starting sulfasalazine and every second week during the first three months of therapy. During the second three months, the same tests should be done once monthly and thereafter once every three months, and as clinically indicated. Urinalysis and an assessment of renal function should also be done periodically during treatment with sulfasalazine.

The determination of serum sulfapyridine levels may be useful since concentrations greater than 50 µg/mL appear to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions.

Drug Interactions:

Reduced absorption of folic acid and digoxin have been reported when those agents were administered concomitantly with sulfasalazine.

### First update of the international ASAS consensus statement for the use of anti-TNF agents in patients with ankylosing spondylitis [^113GFvGG]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the international recommendations for use of anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis.

Methods

The published recommendations on anti-TNF treatment in ankylosing spondylitis formed the basis of the update. A questionnaire was sent to the ASAS (assessment in ankylosing spondylitis) members before the final decisions were agreed upon at an international meeting of the ASAS working group.

Results

Only minor changes to the original consensus statement were required. For the initiation of anti-TNF treatment, there should be: a diagnosis of definitive ankylosing spondylitis (normally based on modified New York criteria); active disease for at least four weeks, as defined by a sustained Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI) of ≥ 4 on a 0–10 scale and expert opinion based on clinical findings; refractory disease, defined by failure of at least two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during a three month period, failure of intra-articular steroids (if indicated), and failure of sulfasalazine in patients with predominantly peripheral arthritis; and application of the usual precautions and contraindications for biological treatment. For monitoring anti-TNF treatment: both the ASAS core set for clinical practice and the BASDAI should be followed after the initiation of treatment. Discontinuation of anti-TNF treatment in non-responders should be considered after 6–12 weeks. Response is defined by improvement of at least 50% or 2 units (on a 0–10 scale) of the BASDAI.

Conclusions

This updated consensus statement is recommended in guiding clinical practice and as a basis for developing national guidelines. Evaluation and regular update of this consensus statement is subject to further research by the ASAS group.

Drug hypersensitivity is generally an exceedingly rare occurrence in the general population. Not all drugs are created equal in this domain and so in the first instance, corroboration of exacerbated toxicity profiles of ICI treated patients in conjunction with drugs with well‐known liabilities for hypersensitivity is an area of interest. Indeed, such cases have begun to be recognised and acted upon; sulfasalazine is an excellent example as it elicits hypersensitivity in the general population at a rate considered to be high but acceptable. However, the incidence of sulfasalazine hypersensitivity appears to be increased to an unacceptable level in ICI treated individuals, and as a result this drug is effectively informally contraindicated in this patient cohort. Ironically, as the current treatment algorithms for irAEs are lifted from the management of parallel autoimmune diseases, sulfalsalazine formed part of the initial treatment algorithms for ICI‐induced arthralgia. The use of drugs with a pre‐existing, well‐recognised risk for these types of reactions are likely to be problematic in these patients, and the oncology community should be made aware of the potential challenge posed by certain concomitant medications. A review of hypersensitivity literature to identify such compounds might be helpful in terms of identifying therapeutics to closely monitor. Adjunctive therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors also have a proven capacity to elicit such reactions. It is also important to remember, as demonstrated in our own case report on iodinated contrast media, that previous tolerance of a compound in isolation does not guarantee tolerance once a checkpoint is introduced. Whilst some combinations will be obviously intolerable, for the vast majority, it might be that the risk‐benefit balance is altered, but ICI treatment is still considered to convey sufficient benefit to warrant treatment. Additionally, pre‐emptive review of concomitant medication could be undertaken as standard to ameliorate the risk. Therefore, wide reassessment of concomitant medications is warranted.

### International ASAS consensus statement for the use of anti-tumour necrosis factor agents in patients with ankylosing spondylitis [^115t8qJb]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To obtain an international consensus about the use of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF alpha) for treating patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

Methods

These recommendations were developed by a review of published reports in combination with expert opinion, including a Delphi exercise, and a consensus meeting of the ASsessments in AS (ASAS) Working Group.

Results

The final consensus comprises the following requirements: (1) For the initiation of anti-TNF alpha therapy: (a) a diagnosis of definitive AS; (b) presence of active disease for at least four weeks as defined by both a sustained Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) of at least 4 and an expert opinion based on clinical features, acute phase reactants, and imaging modalities; (c) presence of refractory disease defined by failure of at least two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during a single three month period, failure of intra-articular steroids if indicated, and failure of sulfasalazine in patients with peripheral arthritis; (d) application and implementation of the usual precautions and contraindications for biological therapy. (2) For the monitoring of anti-TNF alpha therapy: both the BASDAI and the ASAS core set for clinical practice should be followed regularly. (3) For the discontinuation of anti-TNF alpha therapy: in non-responders, consideration should be made after 6–12 weeks' treatment. Response is defined as improvement of (a) at least 50% or 2 units (on a 0–10 scale) of the BASDAI, (b) expert opinion that treatment should be continued.

Conclusion

This consensus statement on anti-TNF alpha treatment in AS may be used for guidance in clinical decision making and as the basis for the development of guidelines. Evaluation of the healthcare consequences of this consensus is subject to further research by the ASAS group.

### Risk-stratified monitoring for sulfasalazine toxicity: prognostic model development and validation [^117Q575A]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Hepatic, haematological and renal toxicity from sulfasalazine occurs uncommonly after the first few months of treatment.
Nevertheless, the manufacturers and some specialist societies, for example, the American College of Rheumatology recommend monitoring blood tests at 3 monthly intervals during established treatment.
Other guidelines, for example, from the British Society of Rheumatology recommend no monitoring after the first 2 years of treatment.
It is not known whether hepatic, haematological and renal toxicities due to sulfasalazine can be predicted and monitoring be risk-stratified.

### When a DMARD fails, should patients switch to sulfasalazine or add sulfasalazine to continuing leflunomide? [^112WrNAM]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding sulfasalazine to leflunomide treatment compared with switching to sulfasalazine alone in patients with RA with an inadequate response to leflunomide monotherapy.

Methods

Patients with active RA ((DAS28) > 3.2) who were enrolled in the first open label phase of the RELIEF study received leflunomide for 24 weeks. Inadequate responders then entered the double blind phase and received a further 24 weeks' treatment with leflunomide (20 mg once daily) plus sulfasalazine (final dose 2 g once daily), or placebo plus sulfasalazine (dose as above). The primary efficacy variable was the DAS28 response rate, and secondary efficacy outcomes were ACR 20%, 50%, and 70% response rates. Adverse events, including standard laboratory tests, were recorded.

Results

106 inadequate responders entered the double blind phase; 56 received leflunomide plus sulfasalazine, and 50 placebo plus sulfasalazine. In the intention to treat population, more patients receiving leflunomide plus sulfasalazine (25/56 (45%)) achieved a DAS28 response than those receiving placebo plus sulfasalazine (17/50 (34%)) (p = 0.179). In week 24 completers, more patients receiving leflunomide plus sulfasalazine (17/56 (30%)) were DAS28 responders than those receiving placebo plus sulfasalazine (10/50 (20%)) (p = 0.081). Comparable numbers in each group were ACR 20% responders; the ACR 50% response rate was significantly higher in the leflunomide plus sulfasalazine group (8.9%) than in the placebo plus sulfasalazine group (0%) (p = 0.038). The safety profiles of both groups were comparable.

Conclusion

Patient numbers are small and firm conclusions cannot be reached, but a non-significant benefit is indicated for combining leflunomide with sulfasalazine compared with switching to sulfasalazine alone in patients inadequately responding to leflunomide.

### COVID-19: a primer for the rheumatologist: management of patients and care settings [^1139fG6S]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There are currently many unanswered questions surrounding the management of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic and several 'rapid' guidelines have been released, although are subject to be updated and changed in the near future. The purpose of this review is to discuss the approach to management of patients with immune-mediated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recent Findings

At present, there is little evidence to suggest an increased risk of COVID-19 infection or its complications in patients with immune-mediated diseases or associated with conventional or biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs; however, glucocorticoid use does appear to have negative associations.

Summary

Currently, conventional and biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs can be continued in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In the case of exposure, with the exception of hydroxyhcloroquine and sulfasalazine, immunosuppression should be held for 2 weeks. Our recommendations and the guidelines we discuss here are based on C-level recommendations but help provide a framework for how to counsel our patients during this pandemic.

### Update on pregnancy and breastfeeding in the era of biologics [^114Rj56R]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic conditions that frequently affect patients during their childbearing years. Considering the characteristics of disease and the medications used to treat it, several issues arise in the care of these patients when they attempt or achieve conception. We review the most current evidence concerning fertility and pregnancy outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. With the exception of those women who undergo pelvic surgery, patients with inflammatory bowel diseases have no decreased fertility. Sulfasalazine decreases fertility in men. When looking at obstetrical outcomes, active disease at conception is associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight. While most medications used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases are low risk, some precautions need to be taken and the risk-to-benefit ratio needs to be considered on an individualized basis. In general, aminosalicylates and thiopurines should be continued, but methotrexate is contraindicated. Anti-tumour necrosis factor agents are considered safe to continue but full monoclonal antibodies do cross the placenta. As a general rule, the it is important to counsel women that conception is optimal when disease is in remission, as adverse obstetrical outcomes are directly associated with disease activity. Clinicians need to educate patients before, during and after conception, emphasizing treatment compliance.

### Risk-stratified monitoring for sulfasalazine toxicity: prognostic model development and validation [^113yVme6]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have developed and externally validated a prognostic model for sulfasalazine discontinuation due to abnormal blood-test results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such risk-prediction model. It performed well in predicting outcomes by 5 years and in clinically relevant subgroups defined by age and inflammatory condition. Previous studies have variably reported N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT-2) acetylator status to be associated with sulfasalazine toxicity. However, these studies evaluated all side effects and did not separately assess either myelotoxicity, hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity as evaluated in the current study.

Our findings suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach to monitoring for blood, liver or renal toxicity using 3 monthly blood tests during long-term sulfasalazine treatment as recommended in the summary of product characteristics and the ACR guidelines, and not monitoring for these after the first year of treatment as recommended in the BSR guidelines are both inappropriate because there is a large interindividual variation in the risk of developing these side effects. The large variation in risk implies that it may be reasonable to not monitor some patients after the first year of sulfasalazine treatment, while others at higher risk of side effects are monitored frequently, for example, 3 monthly.

It is important to realise that DILI can be idiosyncratic and annual testing is unlikely to detect them early enough to improve patient outcome. It is beyond our remit to propose threshold at which the frequency of monitoring blood tests should be altered. These decisions are best taken by guideline writing groups. Thus, our findings ought to be considered by guideline writing groups.

It is important that the results of this study are not used to risk-stratify monitoring in patients newly started on sulfasalazine because our prognosis model used data from patients prescribed sulfasalazine by their GP for 6 months after initiating treatment and dose-escalation in a hospital outpatient. It typically takes 3–6 months to stabilise a patient's sulfasalazine dose before prescription and monitoring is handed over to the GP. In healthcare systems where such shared care arrangements do not exist, this strategy may be applied after 1 year of sulfasalazine treatment. Although generally perceived to be safe, sulfasalazine use carries a risk of myelotoxicity and nephrotoxicity comparable to that observed with methotrexate in people with RA.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The dosage of sulfasalazine tablets should be adjusted to each individual's response and tolerance.

Initial Therapy:

Adults:

3 to 4 g daily in evenly divided doses with dosage intervals not exceeding eight hours. In some cases, it is advisable to initiate therapy with a smaller dosage, e.g., 1 to 2 g daily, to reduce possible gastrointestinal intolerance. If daily doses exceeding 4 g are required to achieve desired effects, the increased risk of toxicity should be kept in mind.

Children, six years of age and older:

40 to 60 mg/kg body weight in each 24-hour period, divided into 3 to 6 doses.

Maintenance Therapy:

Adults:

2 g daily.

Children, six years of age and older:

30 mg/kg body weight in each 24-hour period, divided into 4 doses.

The response of acute ulcerative colitis to sulfasalazine tablets can be evaluated by clinical criteria, including the presence of fever, weight changes, and degree and frequency of diarrhea and bleeding, as well as by sigmoidoscopy and the evaluation of biopsy samples. It is often necessary to continue medication even when clinical symptoms, including diarrhea, have been controlled. When endoscopic examination confirms satisfactory improvement, the dosage of sulfasalazine should be reduced to a maintenance level. If diarrhea recurs, the dosage should be increased to previously effective levels. If symptoms of gastric intolerance (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, etc.) occur after the first few doses of sulfasalazine, they are probably due to increased serum levels of total sulfapyridine and may be alleviated by halving the daily dose of sulfasalazine and subsequently increasing it gradually over several days. If gastric intolerance continues, the drug should be stopped for 5 to 7 days, then reintroduced at a lower daily dose.

Some patients may be sensitive to treatment with sulfasalazine. Various desensitization-like regimens have been reported to be effective in 34 of 53 patients,47 of 8 patients,5and 19 of 20 patients.6These regimens suggest starting with a total daily dose of 50 to 250 mg sulfasalazine initially, and doubling it every 4 to 7 days until the desired therapeutic level is achieved. If the symptoms of sensitivity recur, sulfasalazine should be discontinued. Desensitization should not be attempted in patients who have a history of agranulocytosis, or who have experienced an anaphylactoid reaction while previously receiving sulfasalazine.

Thus, the continued use of the bDMARD or tsDMARD is more likely to maintain disease control than the continued use of methotrexate. The voting panel cautioned that many patients treated with certain monoclonal antibodies may require ongoing treatment with methotrexate to prevent the formation of antidrug antibodies.

### Mesalamine (Rowasa) [^1156s8NZ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of mesalamine PR (also known as Rowasa, Canasa):

- **ALF**: use caution in patients with pre-existing liver disease. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and apply sunscreen while outdoors.
- **Anaphylaxis, asthma exacerbation**: use caution in patients susceptible to sulfite-related reactions, such as patients with asthma or atopy, as mesalamine rectal suspension contains sulfites that may cause allergic reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening asthmatic episodes. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and apply sunscreen while outdoors.
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine may cause hypersensitivity reactions involving internal organs, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Use caution in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to sulfasalazine.
- **Mesalamine-induced acute intolerance syndrome**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine may cause acute intolerance syndrome, presented with symptoms such as cramping, acute abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, headache, and rash, that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis.
- **Minimal change disease, interstitial nephritis, renal failure**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Assess renal function at baseline and periodically during treatment.
- **Nephrolithiasis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine has been associated with an increased risk of nephrolithiasis, including mesalamine-containing stones. Advise adequate fluid intake during treatment.
- **Photosensitivity of skin**: use caution in patients with pre-existing skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and apply sunscreen while outdoors.
- **Positive urine normetanephrine test**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine has been reported to cause false-positive urine test results for normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection due to the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.

Questioning the need for the current frequency of monitoring

Most patients questioned why they should continue with such frequent monitoring given their IMID, medication dosage and test results had remained stable, and felt it could be reduced (j). Many HCPs viewed the current approach to monitoring as outdated and overly cautious. Based on their clinical experience, abnormalities arising from DMARDs were uncommon once a patient was established on a stable dose, and thus a reduction in frequency would be plausible (k). Some HCPs were already working to reduced monitoring schedules for medications considered to be a low risk of causing side effects, such as anti-TNF-αs and sulfasalazine. A few also reported that there were no observable increases in the rate of abnormal results during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown when they had to implement reduced monitoring schedules. This made them question the need to return to three-monthly monitoring (l).

### Risk-stratified monitoring for sulfasalazine toxicity: prognostic model development and validation [^115bUe5v]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sulfasalazine is commonly used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), axial spondylarthritis, reactive arthritis and infrequently in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (the latter is mostly treated with 5-aminosalicylates due to a better safety profile). Although effective, sulfasalazine can cause cytopenia and elevated liver enzymes typically in the first 3–6 months of treatment, although late-onset toxicity is reported. Sulfasalazine can also cause crystalluria and interstitial nephritis, and is not recommended in those with severe renal impairment. Cautious use is recommended in those with mild-to-moderate renal impairment.

There is considerable inconsistency in guidance on how to monitor patients on long-term sulfasalazine treatment for asymptomatic bone marrow, liver and/or renal toxicity. The British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) guidelines recommend 2–4 weekly blood tests for full blood count (FBC), liver function test (LFT), urea electrolytes and creatinine (UE&C) for the first 3 months of treatment followed by 3 monthly testing in the first year and no further monitoring blood tests thereafter. On the contrary, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines recommend close monitoring for the first 3 months of treatment, followed by 3 monthly blood testing for FBC, UE&C and LFT during the entire duration of treatment. The summary of product characteristics for sulfasalazine recommends monitoring with FBC, LFT and UE&C at 3 monthly intervals during long-term treatment. However, whether everyone needs a fixed monitoring schedule once established on sulfasalazine treatment, or whether monitoring can be risk-stratified during long-term treatment is not known.

To predict clinically significant laboratory abnormalities during established sulfasalazine treatment and to inform the frequency of testing, we have developed and validated a prognostic model for clinically significant myelotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and/or nephrotoxicity due to sulfasalazine.

Sulfasalazine for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis — indications, dosing, monitoring, efficacy, and safety are summarized as follows: There is no FDA-approved use for psoriasis. In psoriasis, initial dose of 500 mg PO twice daily increased to up to 3–4 g/d as tolerated. In the only randomized controlled trial, 8 wks of 3–4 g/d sulfasalazine led to moderate improvement (global improvement of 30%-59%) in 7/17 assessable patients given sulfasalazine compared with 1/27 assessable patients given placebo. Contraindications include patients with intestinal or urinary obstruction, patients with porphyria, and patients hypersensitive to sulfasalazine, its metabolites, sulfonamides, or salicylates. Toxicity includes anorexia, headache, GI symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, and gastric distress) and oligospermia in up to one third of patients; less frequent reactions include rash, pruritus, urticaria, fever, hemolytic anemia, and cyanosis, which may occur in ≤ 1/30 patients. Drug interactions include reduced absorption of folic acid and digoxin. Baseline monitoring includes history and physical examination, CBC count/diff and LFTs, and pregnancy test if indicated; ongoing monitoring specifies CBC count/diff and LFTs every other week for the first 3 mo, during the second 3 mo monthly, and thereafter once every 3 mo, with urinalysis and renal function tests should be done periodically. Pregnancy: category B, and during nursing sulfonamides are excreted in the milk and may cause kernicterus. For psoriatic arthritis, in the largest trial, after 36 wk of treatment with 2 g/d, 58% of sulfasalazine patients versus 45% of placebo achieved PsARC (Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria).

### Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: safety and tolerability issues [^1135XQX7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

An examination is needed of the potential adverse effects of the agents most commonly used to treat inflammatory bowel disease. Most of these therapies can be used safely to induce or maintain remissions, although some aspects of monitoring for toxicity are necessary. Aminosalicylates, including sulfasalazine and mesalamine delivery systems, are most commonly associated with sulfa-related effects (sulfasalazine) or intolerance, with rare instances of nephritis, pulmonitis, hepatitis, or worsening colitis. The immunomodulators are most commonly associated with bone marrow suppression, hepatitis, and the risk of opportunistic infections. Methotrexate is contraindicated in pregnancy. Antibiotics used for inflammatory bowel disease are generally safe and well tolerated, although metronidazole carries a long-term risk of peripheral neuropathy. The well-recognized multitude of adverse effects from corticosteroids are eliminated or minimized when rapidly metabolized steroids, such as budesonide, are used.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^113a5AJc]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Low disease activity — DMARD-naive agent selection: Hydroxychloroquine is conditionally recommended over other csDMARDs, sulfasalazine is conditionally recommended over methotrexate, and methotrexate is conditionally recommended over leflunomide for DMARD-naive patients with low disease activity. Hydroxychloroquine is conditionally recommended over other csDMARDs because it is better tolerated and has a more favorable risk profile in patients with RA. Sulfasalazine is recommended over methotrexate because it is less immunosuppressive, and the patient panel felt that many patients with low disease activity would prefer to avoid the side effects associated with methotrexate. The recommendations are conditional because methotrexate may be the preferred initial therapy in patients at the higher end of the low disease activity range and in those with poor prognostic factors (11). Methotrexate is recommended over leflunomide because of its greater dosing flexibility and lower cost.

### Etanercept (Enbrel) [^115zGCgT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with Enbrel.

7.1	Vaccines

Most PsA patients receiving Enbrel were able to mount effective B-cell immune responses to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, but titers in aggregate were moderately lower and fewer patients had 2-fold rises in titers compared to patients not receiving Enbrel. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Patients receiving Enbrel may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving Enbrel.

Patients with a significant exposure to varicella virus should temporarily discontinue Enbrel therapy and be considered for prophylactic treatment with varicella zoster immune globulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.10)].

7.2	Immune-Modulating Biologic Products

In a study in which patients with active RA were treated for up to 24 weeks with concurrent Enbrel and anakinra therapy, a 7% rate of serious infections was observed, which was higher than that observed with Enbrel alone (0%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)] and did not result in higher ACR response rates compared to Enbrel alone. The most common infections consisted of bacterial pneumonia (4 cases) and cellulitis (4 cases). One patient with pulmonary fibrosis and pneumonia died due to respiratory failure. Two percent of patients treated concurrently with Enbrel and anakinra developed neutropenia (ANC < 1 × 10⁹/L).

In clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and Enbrel resulted in increased incidences of serious adverse events, including infections, and did not demonstrate increased clinical benefit [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

7.3	Cyclophosphamide

The use of Enbrel in patients receiving concurrent cyclophosphamide therapy is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

7.4	Sulfasalazine

Patients in a clinical study who were on established therapy with sulfasalazine, to which Enbrel was added, were noted to develop a mild decrease in mean neutrophil counts in comparison to groups treated with either Enbrel or sulfasalazine alone. The clinical significance of this observation is unknown.

Table 1 — characteristics of available 5-aminosalicylates and sulfasalazine summarizes dosing, conversions, adverse effects, and monitoring for ulcerative colitis. Mesalamine dosing categories are listed as low dose < 2 g/d of mesalamine, standard dose 2–3 g/d, and high dose > 3 g/d. For diazo-bonded 5-ASA, 6.75 g balsalazide provides approximately 2.4 g 5-ASA, and for sulfasalazine, 4 g provides approximately 1.6 g 5-ASA. Monitoring for mesalamine and diazo-bonded 5-ASAs is to monitor renal function periodically, while for sulfasalazine the table states to monitor complete blood count and liver function tests periodically and that patients should take folic acid supplement. Noted adverse effects include for mesalamine uncommon idiosyncratic worsening of colitis with uncommon interstitial nephritis, and for sulfasalazine interference with folate metabolism, male infertility, rare serious cutaneous side effects such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pneumonitis, and hepatitis.

Reduce the dose of MERCAPTOPURINE when coadministered with allopurinol [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

7.2	Warfarin

The coadministration of MERCAPTOPURINE with warfarin may decrease the anticoagulant effectiveness of warfarin. Monitor the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin and adjust the warfarin dosage as appropriate.

7.3	Myelosuppressive Products

MERCAPTOPURINE can cause myelosuppression. Myelosuppression may be increased when MERCAPTOPURINE is coadministered with other drugs that cause myelosuppression. Enhanced myelosuppression has been noted in some patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Monitor the CBC and adjust the dose of MERCAPTOPURINE for excessive myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

7.4	Aminosalicylates

Aminosalicylates (e.g., mesalamine, olsalazine or sulfasalazine) may inhibit the TPMT enzyme, which may increase the risk of myelosuppression when coadministered with MERCAPTOPURINE. When aminosalicylates and MERCAPTOPURINE are coadministered, use the lowest possible doses for each drug and monitor more frequently for myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

7.5	Hepatotoxic Products

MERCAPTOPURINE can cause hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity may be increased when MERCAPTOPURINE is coadministered with other products that cause hepatotoxicity. Monitor liver tests more frequently in patients who are receiving MERCAPTOPURINE with other hepatotoxic products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Case of relapsing sulfasalazine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome upon re-exposure [^112w5Uq8]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Sulfasalazine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (SIHS) is a serious systemic delayed adverse drug reaction that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Here, we report the first case, to our knowledge, of a patient with previously unidentified SIHS who developed a significantly more rapid and extreme recurrence on re-exposure to sulfasalazine. The patient is a 58-year-old woman with asymptomatic Crohn's disease who, 10 days after initiating sulfasalazine, developed fevers, diffuse rash, pancytopenia, hypotension and hepatitis without a definitive source of infection. Sixteen days after her first hospitalisation, she was restarted on sulfasalazine and was readmitted within 10hours with a similar but more serious presentation, requiring vasopressors. She did recover completely without any further recurrence to date, after definitively discontinuing sulfasalazine. This case demonstrates the importance of recognising SIHS early in patients to prevent re-exposure to sulfasalazine and to ensure timely initiation of appropriate treatment.

Section 4. Guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with traditional systemic agents — psoriasis is described as a multisystem disease "affecting approximately 2% of the population", and this section discusses traditional systemic medications for treatment; "Treatment should be tailored to meet individual patients' needs". It will "discuss in detail the efficacy and safety, and offer recommendations for the use of the 3 most commonly used, and approved, traditional systemic agents: methotrexate, cyclosporine, and acitretin", and will "briefly discuss the available data for the use of azathioprine, fumaric acid esters, hydroxyurea, leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil, sulfasalazine, tacrolimus, and 6-thioguanine in psoriasis". The scope states, "This fourth section will cover the management and treatment of psoriasis with traditional systemic therapies". The disclaimer notes, "Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful treatment in every situation", adds that the guidelines are not exclusive or exhaustive, and that "The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific therapy must be made by the physician and the patient".

### Sulfasalazine for ankylosing spondylitis [^1114x7Gp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause and affects mainly the spine, but can also affect other joints. Disease progression may result in loss of mobility and function. Sulfasalazine is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug used in the treatment of AS. However, its efficacy remains unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of sulfasalazine for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

Search Methods

We searched for relevant randomized and quasi-randomized trials in any language, using the following sources: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 11); MEDLINE (2003 to 28 November 2013); EMBASE (2003 to 27 November 2013); CINAHL (2003 to 28 November 2013); Ovid MEDLINE data, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (28 November 2013); and the reference sections of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

We evaluated randomized and quasi-randomized trials examining the benefits and harms of sulfasalazine on AS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed unblinded trial reports according to the selection criteria. Disagreements on the inclusion of the studies were resolved, when necessary, by recourse to a third review author. The same authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included trials and entered the data extracted from the included trials. We combined results using mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data. We restructured outcome measures for this update based on recommendations from the editorial group. Major outcomes included: pain, Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI), Bath ankylosing spondylitis function index (BASFI), Bath ankylosing spondylitis metrology index (BASMI), radiographic progression, total number of withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events.

Main Results

We did not add any new studies to this review following the updated search. In the original review, we included 11 studies in the analysis, involving 895 participants in total. All included studies compared sulfasalazine with placebo. We judged most of the studies as low risk of bias or unclear risk of bias in five domains (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, selective reporting, and other sources of bias). However, for incomplete outcome data, we only judged one trial at low risk of bias. None of the included trials assessed BASDAI, BASFI, BASMI or radiographic progression. Different parameters were used to assess pain. The pooled MD for back pain measured on a 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale was -2.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) -6.33 to 0.41; absolute risk difference 3%, 95% CI 1% to 6%; 6 trials). Compared to placebo, a significantly higher rate of withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.15; absolute risk difference 4%, 95% CI 0.4% to 8.8%; 11 trials) was found in the sulfasalazine group. A serious adverse reaction was reported in one patient taking sulfasalazine (Peto odds ratio 7.50, 95% CI 0.15 to 378.16).

Authors' Conclusions

There is not enough evidence to support any benefit of sulfasalazine in reducing pain, disease activity, radiographic progression, or improving physical function and spinal mobility in the treatment of AS. A statistically significant benefit in reducing the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and easing spinal stiffness was mentioned in the previous version. However, the effect size was very small and not clinically meaningful. More withdrawals because of side effects occurred with sulfasalazine. Further studies, with larger sample sizes, longer duration, and using validated outcome measures are needed to verify the uncertainty of sulfasalazine in AS.

### Sulfasalazine for alopecia areata [^111caisA]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Sulfasalazine is used as a therapy for various autoimmune conditions, including psoriasis; its effectiveness is presumed to be the result of its immunomodulatory effects. We have treated patients with severe alopecia areata with sulfasalazine as part of our dermatology practice and have noticed cosmetically acceptable regrowth in 23% of patients in whom a response could be determined. In view of its good safety profile, sulfasalazine may be considered for systemic treatment of severe alopecia areata.

### Risk-stratified monitoring for sulfasalazine toxicity: prognostic model development and validation [^112BzmH5]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Start of follow-up

Patients were followed up from 180 days after their first primary care sulfasalazine prescription until the earliest of outcome, death, transfer out of practice, 90-day prescription gap, last data collection from practice, 31 December 2019 or 5 years.

Outcome

Sulfasalazine toxicity-associated drug discontinuation was the outcome of interest. This was defined as a prescription gap of ≥ 90 days with either an abnormal blood-test result or a diagnostic code for abnormal blood-test result within ± 60 days of the last prescription date. The blood tests were considered abnormal if any of the following were present: total leucocyte count < 3.5×10⁹/L, neutrophil count < 1.6×10⁹/L, platelet count < 140×10⁹/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) and/or aspartate transaminase (AST) > 100 IU/mL and decline in kidney function, defined as either progression of CKD based on medical codes recorded by the GP or > 26 µmol/L increase in creatinine concentration, the threshold for consideration of acute kidney injury (AKI). In a previous validation study on methotrexate discontinuation, only 5.4% of abnormal blood-test results in this time window were potentially explained by an alternate illness.

A random sample of sulfasalazine discontinuation with abnormal blood-test results was drawn. Data for all diagnostic codes entered during primary care consultations within ± 60 days of the abnormal blood test result were extracted. AA (rheumatology and general medicine expertise) screened the list to identify outcomes that could potentially be explained by an alternative condition or its treatment.

Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions

Drug Reactions with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)

Severe, life-threatening, systemic hypersensitivity reactions such as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue sulfasalazine tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

Other Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions

Other severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with the use of sulfasalazine (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Severe cutaneous adverse reactions can be serious and are sometimes fatal. Patients are at highest risk for these events early in therapy, with most events occurring within the first month of treatment. Discontinue sulfasalazine tablets at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^117Jv1hG]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Oral mesalamine may be better tolerated than sulfasalazine (relative risk [RR] of adverse effects: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.36–0.63), but the latter is cheaper, as effective, and remains the only 5‐ASA available in liquid formulation, making it attractive for young children. Sulfasalazine also has a direct effect on nuclear factor kappa B, which may add to its mode of action. Sulfasalazine suspension was safe and effective in a retrospective study of 57 children with UC (mean [standard deviation (SD)] age 5.3 ± 3.3 years) with inability to swallow tablets. Moreover, except for the uncommon allergic reaction (< 0.1%), the vast majority of adverse events are mild (e.g. headache and gastrointestinal symptoms) and uncommon. Serious adverse events with 5‐ASA treatment are rare and include renal, pancreatic, pulmonary and cardiac complications. Sulfasalazine hypersensitivity presents with fever, rash and eosinophilia, which should trigger immediate treatment cessation; folic acid deficiency has been reported with sulfasalazine. In adult studies, withdrawal due to intolerance ranges from 2% to 5%. Intolerance to 5‐ASA medications may mimic a UC flare, and when clinically proven by rechallenge, it precludes further use of 5‐ASA compounds. Regular laboratory monitoring of CBC, renal function and urinalysis remains the practice of many clinicians, though not supported by evidence. Poor adherence is always a possible cause of nonresponse to therapy.

### Sulfasalazine for ankylosing spondylitis [^115Hzd7x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause and belongs to a group of diseases known as spondyloarthropathies (SpA), which includes reactive arthritis, arthritis/spondylitis in inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis/spondylitis and undifferentiated SpA. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been the main treatment for AS. For those refractory or intolerant to NSAIDs, the disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been used as a second line approach. Sulfasalazine (SSZ) is the best studied DMARD in AS, but its efficacy remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of sulfasalazine for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis.

Search Strategy

Relevant randomised and quasi-randomised trials in any language were sought using the following sources: CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to June Week 4 2003), EMBASE (1980 to 2003 Week 26), CINAHL (1982 to June Week 3 2003) and the reference section of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

We evaluated randomised and quasi-randomised trials examining the efficacy of sulfasalazine on ankylosing spondylitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Unblinded trial reports were reviewed independently by two reviewers according to the selection criteria. Disagreements on the inclusion of the studies were resolved, where necessary, by recourse to a third reviewer. The methodological quality of included trials were independently assessed by the same reviewers on randomization, concealment, blindness (participants, care providers and outcome investigators), description of withdrawals and drop-outs and intention-to-treat analysis. The same reviewers independently entered the data extracted from the included trials, using RevMan double entry facility. Results were combined using weighted mean difference or standardised mean difference for continuous data, and relative risk for dichotomous data.

Main Results

Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria but only eleven were included in the data analysis. The pooled analysis showed that the difference between intervention groups was significant only in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (WMD -4.79, 95% CI -8.80 to -0.78) mm/h) and morning stiffness VAS-100 mm (visual analogue scale 100 mm, where 0 = no stiffness and 100 = severe) (WMD -13.89, 95% CI -22.54 to -5.24), favouring SSZ over placebo. The trial with the largest sample (Clegg 1996) and that with the longest treatment duration (Kirwan 1993) had similar results. Both trials found that SSZ showed evidence of benefit in the occurrence of peripheral joint symptoms and peripheral responses in patients with peripheral arthritis. Nissila 1988 is the only trial in which SSZ showed benefit in primary outcome analyses, including back pain, chest expansion, occiput-to-wall test and patient's general well being. Compared with other trials, the patients in this trial had the shortest disease duration and the highest level of baseline ESR and contained the greatest proportion of patients with peripheral arthritis. Significantly more withdrawals for side effects (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.15, NNH 23, 95% CI 10 to 288) and for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.73, NNH 17, 95% CI 8 to 180) were found in SSZ compared with placebo group although severe side effects were rare (1 of the 469 patients taking SSZ).

Authors' Conclusions

Across all AS patients, SSZ demonstrated some benefit in reducing ESR and easing morning stiffness, but no evidence of benefit in physical function, pain, spinal mobility, enthesitis, patient and physician global assessment. Patients at early disease stage, with higher level of ESR (or active disease) and peripheral arthritis might benefit from SSZ.

### Sulfasalazine [^117UkFDy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy:

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of sulfasalazine in pregnant women. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6 times the human maintenance dose of 2 g/day based on body surface area and have revealed no evidence of impaired female fertility or harm to the fetus due to sulfasalazine. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

There have been case reports of neural tube defects (NTDs) in infants born to mothers who were exposed to sulfasalazine during pregnancy, but the role of sulfasalazine in these defects has not been established. However, oral sulfasalazine inhibits the absorption and metabolism of folic acid which may interfere with folic acid supplementation (see Drug Interactions) and diminish the effect of periconceptional folic acid supplementation that has been shown to decrease the risk of NTDs.

A national survey evaluated the outcome of pregnancies associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a group of 186 women treated with sulfasalazine alone or sulfasalazine and concomitant steroid therapy, the incidence of fetal morbidity and mortality was comparable to that for 245 untreated IBD pregnancies as well as to pregnancies in the general population.1A study of 1,455 pregnancies associated with exposure to sulfonamides indicated that this group of drugs, including sulfasalazine, did not appear to be associated with fetal malformation.2A review of the medical literature covering 1,155 pregnancies in women with ulcerative colitis suggested that the outcome was similar to that expected in the general population.3

No clinical studies have been performed to evaluate the effect of sulfasalazine on the growth development and functional maturation of children whose mothers received the drug during pregnancy.

Clinical Considerations:

Sulfasalazine and its metabolite, sulfapyridine, pass through the placenta. Sulfasalazine and its metabolite are also present in human milk. In the newborn, sulfonamides compete with bilirubin for binding sites on the plasma proteins and may cause kernicterus. Although sulfapyridine has been shown to have a poor bilirubin-displacing capacity, monitor the newborn for the potential for kernicterus.

A case of agranulocytosis has been reported in an infant whose mother was taking both sulfasalazine and prednisone throughout pregnancy.

### When I use a word… Taking therapeutic care [^115rVEJV]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

In healthcare there are different forms of taking care or taking precautions. When using a therapeutic intervention, one takes care by implementing it appropriately. When the appropriate intervention is pharmacological that means giving an appropriate formulation of a medication in an appropriate dosage regimen. If the intervention might cause harm, but the benefit:harm balance is favourable, one might do nothing apart from monitoring or one might introduce a preventive strategy, such as the use of mesna when giving an oxazaphosphorine such as cyclophosphamide. Vaccination and contraception are both examples of precautionary measures that have an excellent benefit:harm balance. But when the benefit:harm balance of an intervention is unfavourable the precaution to be taken is avoidance of the intervention. That, and only that, form of precaution, avoidance to avoid harm, is a defining feature of the precautionary principle.

### Is it Crohn's disease? A severe systemic granulomatous reaction to sulfasalazine in patient with rheumatoid arthritis [^114H9aZi]. BMC Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Sulfasalazine is a widely used anti-inflammatory agent in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and several rheumatological disorders. Although as many as 20% of treated patients may experience reversible, dose-dependent side effects, less frequent but potentially severe, systemic reactions have also been reported.

Case Presentation

A severe systemic reaction to sulfasalazine developed in a 21-year old female with rheumatoid arthritis characterized by eosinophilia, granulomatous enteritis and myelotoxicity, cholestatic hepatitis, and seizures. The clinical course and management of this patient are presented as well as a review of the incidence and outcome of severe systemic reactions to sulfasalazine.

Conclusions

Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.

Methods

Data source

Data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum and Gold were used for model development and validation, respectively.CPRD is an anonymised longitudinal database of electronic health records originated during clinical care in the National Health Service in the UK. With almost universal coverage of UK residents, participants that contributed data to the CPRD are representative of the UK population. The CPRD includes information on demographic details, lifestyle factors (eg, smoking, alcohol intake), diagnoses, results of blood tests and details of primary care prescriptions. CPRD Gold and Aurum complement each other in terms of coverage of general practices due to their use of different software for data capture. Some general practices that have contributed data to both databases are identifiable using a bridging file provided by the CPRD.

Study design

Retrospective cohort study.

Study period

1 January 2007 to 31 December 2019.

Study population

Participants aged 18 years or older with a new diagnosis of inflammatory disease (eg, RA, axial spondyloarthritis, PsA and IBD) and prescribed sulfasalazine by their general practitioner (GP) for ≥ 6 months were eligible. Patients were required to have ≥ 1 year disease-free registration in their current general practice to be classified as having a new diagnosis. Additionally, patients were required to have received their first sulfasalazine prescription either after the first record of inflammatory disease in the CPRD or in the 90 days preceding. This 90-day period was allowed because recording of diagnosis may lag prescriptions. These two requirements minimised the chance of patients on long-term sulfasalazine treatment appearing as new users of sulfasalazine when they moved to a different general practice. Patients with chronic liver disease, haematological disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 or 5 prior to cohort entry were excluded as described in a previous manuscript.

Sulfasalazine prescriptions

In the UK, sulfasalazine initiation and dose escalation occur in hospital outpatient clinics. During this period prescriptions are issued by the hospital specialists. They also organise monitoring blood tests and acts on any abnormalities. Once a patient is established on treatment, typically approximately 6 months after initiating on treatment, the responsibility for prescribing and monitoring, including with periodic blood tests is handed to the patients' GP as per the National Health Service (NHS) shared-care protocols. During shared-care monitoring, the GP seeks advice from the hospital specialist if there are side effects including abnormal blood-test results, and treatment changes are directed by the specialist.

6-Thioguanine — recommendations for psoriasis state there is no FDA-approved use for psoriasis. Dosing is: start at 80 mg two times/wk; increase by 20 mg every 2–4 wk; maximum dose is 160 mg 3 times/wk. Short-term results include an open-label trial of 14 patients using pulse dosing then maintenance dosing (120 mg twice/wk to 160 mg 3 times/wk), in which of 11 patients who became longer-term responders, 6/11 showed a response after 2–4 wk. Long-term results report 76 patients followed for > 1 mo; at 24 mo, 58% were effectively maintained, with use safely up to 145 mo; another study showed 14/18 patients had 90% improvement. Contraindications include pre-existing liver disease, immunosuppression, and anemia, leukopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia. Toxicity includes myelosuppression, liver toxicity from hepatic veno-occlusive disease, increased ALT and AST, hyperuricemia, photodermatitis, taste changes, gastroesophageal reflux, gastric ulcers, headache, nausea/vomiting, aphthous ulcers, fatigue, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and multiple warts, herpes zoster.

Maternal medication use and preconception planning — As standard good practice, we suggest discussing medications well before the patient attempts to conceive; we also suggest discussing pregnancy plans prior to initiating treatment with medications that may affect gonadal function, such as CYC. MTX, MMF, CYC, and thalidomide are known teratogens, and we strongly recommend discontinuation of these within 3 months prior to conception; because timing data are conflicting, discontinuation within 1 menstrual cycle is the minimum and 3 months the most common period for discontinuation, allowing time to observe disease stability without medication. For women treated with leflunomide, we strongly recommend cholestyramine washout if serum metabolite is detectable prior to or as soon as pregnancy is confirmed; once metabolite is not detectable in the serum, the risks of pregnancy loss and birth defects are not elevated. We conditionally recommend treatment with CYC for life-threatening conditions in the second or third trimester. When potentially teratogenic medications are stopped prior to pregnancy, we strongly recommend a period of observation without medication or transition to pregnancy-compatible medications; with inadvertent exposure, we strongly suggest immediate referral to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, pregnancy medication specialist, or genetics counselor as standard good practice. We strongly recommend HCQ, azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, colchicine, and sulfasalazine as compatible for use throughout pregnancy.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions associated with sulfasalazine are anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, gastric distress, and apparently reversible oligospermia. These occur in about one-third of the patients. Less frequent adverse reactions are skin rash, pruritus, urticaria, fever, Heinz body anemia, hemolytic anemia, and cyanosis, which may occur at a frequency of one in every thirty patients or less. Experience suggests that with a daily dosage of 4 g or more, or total serum sulfapyridine levels above 50 µg/mL, the incidence of adverse reactions tends to increase.

Although the listing which follows includes a few adverse reactions which have not been reported with this specific drug, the pharmacological similarities among the sulfonamides require that each of these reactions be considered when sulfasalazine tablets are administered. Less common or rare adverse reactions include:

Blood dyscrasias: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, megaloblastic (macrocytic) anemia, purpura, thrombocytopenia, hypoprothrombinemia, methemoglobinemia, congenital neutropenia, and myelodysplastic syndrome.

Hypersensitivity reactions: erythema multiforme, epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) with corneal damage, exfoliative dermatitis, DRESS, anaphylaxis, serum sickness syndrome, interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis with or without eosinophilia, vasculitis, fibrosing alveolitis, pleurisy/pleuritis, pericarditis with or without tamponade, allergic myocarditis, polyarteritis nodosa, lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, hepatitis and hepatic necrosis with or without immune complexes, fulminant hepatitis, sometimes leading to liver transplantation, parapsoriasis varioliformis acuta (Mucha-Haberman syndrome), rhabdomyolysis, photosensitization, arthralgia, periorbital edema, conjunctival and scleral injection, and alopecia.

### Mesalazine-induced lung fibrosis [^115ENnB4]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

The medical management of a patient with Crohn's disease should take into account the activity, site and behaviour of disease, and should be discussed with the patient, and 5-aminosalicylates are a group of medications which have been commonly used. Sulfasalazine is a combination of 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulfapyridine which acts only as a carrier to the colonic site of action but can still cause systemic side-effects including lung disease. In mesalazine the specific sulfapyridine-related side-effects, especially pulmonary reactions, are avoided. However, we present a case of lung fibrosis which was associated with mesalazine in a Crohn's patient.

### Risk-stratified monitoring for sulfasalazine toxicity: prognostic model development and validation [^111RF7pL]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

CKD stage 3, diabetes and concomitant methotrexate or leflunomide therapy were associated with sulfasalazine discontinuation with abnormal monitoring blood-test results in this study. These associations may be due to reduced sulfasalazine clearance in CKD and DILI being associated with diabetes. Abnormal blood-test results during the first 6 months of therapy were associated with discontinuing sulfasalazine with abnormal monitoring blood-test results, like findings for methotrexate and leflunomide. Elevated liver enzymes and cytopenia before starting treatment have previously been associated with abnormal blood-test results in patients treated with methotrexate and biologics, respectively.

There are several strengths of this study. First, we used a large real-world and nationally representative dataset for model development and a similar independent dataset for external validation. Second, the study population included patients with a range of diseases and the results have broad generalisability. Third, the prognostic factors were selected by an expert multidisciplinary team based on clinical experience. Fourth, our outcome required the abnormal blood-test result to be associated with sulfasalazine discontinuation, thus, allowing the model to predict clinically relevant outcomes. Fifth, the prognostic model is easy to use in practice, and can be easily built into GP electronic health records.

### Risk factors for anti-drug antibody formation to infliximab: secondary analyses of a randomised controlled trial [^116btUgd]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Consistent with several previous reports, the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications lowered the risk of immunogenicity in our study. The proposed dose‐dependent protective effects of thiopurines or methotrexate could not be confirmed by our results. This may be due to the high doses of methotrexate used by most patients in this study. The use of methotrexate or sulfasalazine co‐medication in the RA and PsA subgroups was not significantly protective. This finding is most likely explained by the fact that most patients (90% and 80% with RA and PsA, respectively) used concomitant immunosuppressive medication, mainly methotrexate. In the SpA subgroup, none of the 27 patients who used concomitant immunosuppressive medications (25 methotrexate and 2 sulfasalazine) developed ADAb, compared to 13 of 92 patients who did not. This finding suggests that, contrary to current clinical practice, the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medication may be valuable in patients with SpA. This finding is supported by observational data showing increased drug survival of TNFi in patients with SpA on concomitant immunosuppressive medication.

5.13.2 IBD-related cancer chemoprevention with mesalazine

Statement 126. We recommend that patients with ulcerative colitis or IBD-U with left-sided or more extensive disease should be advised to take mesalazine in doses of at least 2 g daily to reduce risk of colorectal cancer (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 95.5%).

Although there is a lack of randomised prospective data regarding chemoprevention of CRC in IBD, a number of studies have shown a protective effect of 5-ASA on the risk of IBD-associated CRC. A systematic review suggests the drug has multiple biological effects that protect against neoplasia. These include stabilisation of cell cycle regulation, scavenging of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, inhibition of TNFα, NF-κB and TGFβ pathways, interference with Wnt/beta-catenin signalling and antimicrobial activity. A systematic review and meta-analysis of eight studies contained 867 cases of colorectal neoplasia and 143 of non-cancer dysplasia. Prescription of 5-ASA is associated with OR of 0.6 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.9, p = 0.04) for development of CRC, although the advantage was only seen in studies from referral centres, not population-based studies.

Two more recent meta-analyses have been published in 2017, confirming that 5-ASA reduces the risk of CRC in UC. Sulfasalazine was not protective. A dose-dependent protective effect was noted with 5-ASA with a minimum dose of 1.2 gor 2 g. It remains unclear whether the protective effect of 5-ASA simply represents more effective mucosal healing rather than a specific drug effect. In patients who are also taking immunosuppressive drug therapy there are no data to show that 5-ASA has additional benefits, whereas a recent retrospective study demonstrated that stopping 5-ASA in patients on anti-TNF therapy was not associated with a worse disease course.

Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions

Drug Reactions with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)

Severe, life-threatening, systemic hypersensitivity reactions such as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue AZULFIDINE EN-tabs if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

Other Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions

Other severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with the use of sulfasalazine (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Severe cutaneous adverse reactions can be serious and are sometimes fatal. Patients are at highest risk for these events early in therapy, with most events occurring within the first month of treatment. Discontinue AZULFIDINE EN-tabs at the first appearance of signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation.

### Antirheumatic medications in pregnancy and breastfeeding [^114atJAF]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As active rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease during pregnancy increases the risk for pregnancy loss, preterm birth, and maternal illness, ongoing management with pregnancy-compatible medications can improve these outcomes. Selecting and taking these medications can be challenging for rheumatologists and patients due to limited knowledge about potential risks and benefits.

Recent Findings

Fortunately, the American College of Rheumatology, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, British Rheumatology Society, and the European League Against Rheumatism have each published recommendations to guide the use of antirheumatic medications in pregnancy and lactation. Each of these groups endorsed the use of hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, sulfasalazine, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in pregnancy. They also agreed that methotrexate, mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, and leflunomide should be avoided in pregnancy. New medications, including small-molecules and biologics, have limited data to support safety in pregnancy and are not currently recommended during this period. Most antirheumatic medications are compatible with lactation.

Summary

Because many patients are hesitant to use antirheumatic medications during pregnancy, honest and accurate discussions about pregnancy planning and management are important to help women make decisions that are in their and their offspring's best interest.

Predictors

These were selected by the clinical members of the study team based on their clinical expertise and knowledge of the published literature. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), alcohol intake and diabetes were included as they associate with drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Individual inflammatory diseases were considered separately because sulfasalazine toxicity is reported to be less common in people with IBD than in those with RA.CKD stage 3 was included as it reduces sulfasalazine clearance. Statins, carbamazepine, valproate and paracetamol were included as their use is associated with sulfasalazine toxicity as per the British National Formulary. Methotrexate, leflunomide, thiopurines were included as they can cause cytopenia, elevated liver enzymes and AKI. Either cytopenia (neutrophil count < 2×10⁹/L, total leucocyte count < 4×10⁹/L or platelet count < 150×10⁹/L) or elevated transaminase (ALT and/or AST > 35 IU/L) during the first 6 months of primary care prescription were included as they predicted cytopenia and/or transaminitis in other studies.

The latest record of demographic and lifestyle factors, diseases recorded within 2 years prior to start of follow-up and latest primary care prescriptions within 6 months prior to start of follow-up were used to define predictors except for CKD stage 3 that was defined using both GP records and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate 30–59 mL/min. GPs typically review patients with long-term conditions annually. A 2-year look-back period was used to minimise the risk of missing data from those that did not attend in the previous 12-months.

Patient and public involvement

Patient and public involvement members were involved in selecting and prioritising the research question. They advised to use readily available datasets for the study rather than conduct an expensive and time-consuming clinical trial.

Table 3
Characteristics of the patients in the replication cohort collected in Sweden

Table 4
Replication of HLA types associated with sulfasalazine‐induced agranulocytosis

Predictive ability and clinical implications

The specificity to predict risk of agranulocytosis increased from 82.4% to 88.7% when using HLA‐DQB1*02:01‐DRB1*03:01‐B*08:01‐C*07:01 instead of HLA‐B*08:01. This indicates that fewer patients would be falsely predicted as being at risk when using the full haplotype. The sensitivity was 32.5% with either HLA‐B*08:01 or the full haplotype, but when combining HLA‐B*08:01 with HLA‐A*31:01, the sensitivity increased to 47.5%. With a sensitivity of 47.5% and an incidence of 0.0014 (1 in 700 patients receiving treatment), 9 we could theoretically reduce the incidence of agranulocytosis to 0.000735 (0.0014 − 0.475 × 0.0014) by screening for HLA‐ B*08:01 and HLA‐A*31:01. The number needed to genotype (NNG) for HLA‐ B*08:01 and HLA‐A*31:01 to avoid one case was estimated to be about 1,500, which is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction, [1/(0.0014 × 0.475)].

### Refining drug safety in rheumatology [^116md9B4]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

This issue explores several important safety concerns that currently plague the rheumatologist and health care providers who care for patients with rheumatic diseases. Weighing safety against efficacy can be a complex task that is best alleviated by understanding the issues, nature, and breadth of problems associated with drug use. Therapeutic decision-making must be evidence-based, judicious, and appropriate for the patient and situation. Understanding drug safety is paramount to ensuring both success of therapy and benefit to the patient. Similarly, it is important not to underestimate the impact of uncontrolled disease activity in decision-making. Drug safety must be weighed against the severity and risks of the disease under treatment. Clearly the benefit/risk ratio has improved for many of the therapies discussed in this book. The use of both conventional and novel therapies mandates an understanding of the mechanisms of action, unique toxicities, screening and monitoring measures, and rules for drug avoidance.

### Methotrexate in combination with sulfasalazine is more effective in rheumatoid arthritis patients who failed sulfasalazine than in patients naive to both drugs [^115hbdwL]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

For pharmacological reasons, the effect of the combination of MTX and SSZ may be different in RA patients who are naïve to these drugs compared to patients with an insufficient response to one of them. Therefore, we compared the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the combination of MTX and SSZ in naïve patients and in patients with an insufficient response to SSZ.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed to identify RCTs that compared the MTX-SSZ combination to either drug alone. The databases MEDLINE and the Cochrane Clinical Trials registry were searched from 1966 up to April 2007. The efficacy of the single therapeutic agents or their combination was assessed using the mean change in the disease activity score (DAS) and the ACR improvement criteria.

Results

Four RCTs were identified to compare the efficacy of the combination MTX-SSZ to the efficacy of either drug alone. Two parallel trials were performed with patients naïve to both drugs and two add-on trials were performed in SSZ failures. In the trials with naïve patients, the mean DAS changes for the combination MTX and SSZ pointed to a sub-additive efficacy. In the trials with patients who previously failed to SSZ, the mean DAS changes for the combination MTX and SSZ indicated additive efficacy.

Conclusions

In RA, addition of MTX to SSZ is a therapeutic option in SSZ failures, whereas combination of MTX and SSZ in DMARD-naïve patients has no added value.

### Patient and health professional views on risk-stratified monitoring of immune-suppressing treatment in adults with inflammatory diseases [^116gZCBv]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriasis (PsO) ± arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) together affect over 4% of adults. They are treated with long-term steroid sparing disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which can cause hepatotoxicity, myelotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Those prescribed these medicines undergo regular blood tests to check for such side-effects, typically fortnightly-to-monthly when treatment is commenced and three-monthly once treatment becomes stable. These side-effects seldom occur during stable long-term treatment. The practice of undertaking three-monthly monitoring blood tests for all patients is based on expert opinion from guideline writing groups, often underpinned by the summary of product characteristics. Performing these tests at fixed intervals regardless of individuals' risk is an unjustifiable use of resources and goes against the tenets of personalized medicine.

We have developed risk-stratified monitoring strategies for methotrexate, leflunomide, thiopurine, sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylate toxicity. These consider individuals' risk of developing clinically significant side-effects to determine their individualized frequency of monitoring blood tests, rather than having a standard approach for all. A health economic analysis based upon these risk predictions revealed that this approach was more cost-effective than current practice. For anti-TNF-alpha (α) drugs, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of different blood-test monitoring strategies to ascertain the most cost-effective strategy due to low outcome event rate and availability of a single dataset that precluded prognostic model development.

Before this new evidence is used to change guidelines and clinical practice, it is vital to explore whether such changes would be acceptable to patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, this study explored the views and experiences of people with IMIDs and HCPs managing their treatment, about current monitoring practice and the acceptability of a risk-stratified monitoring strategy.

### Efficacy and safety of sulfasalazine in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria [^116tqVwZ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There are limited data regarding alternative treatments for antihistamine refractory chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). Patients with recalcitrant skin disease often cannot gain satisfactory symptom control with standard therapies and may require prolonged courses of oral corticosteroids. There is a lack of information describing the degree and duration of sulfasalazine's efficacy, the frequency and nature of adverse reactions, and the appropriate safety monitoring parameters.

Objective

To present a case series detailing the efficacy and safety of sulfasalazine therapy in patients with CIU.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted of 39 patients with sulfasalazine-treated CIU evaluated at Johns Hopkins Asthma and Allergy Center from October 2007 to March 2012. Eight patients were excluded from the final analysis.

Results

Twenty-six patients (83.9%) showed an improvement in symptoms within the first 3 months, with 51.6% of patients (n = 16) becoming asymptomatic within the first 6 months of starting sulfasalazine. Eleven patients (35.4%) achieved complete relief of symptoms after tapering off sulfasalazine therapy. Five of the 31 patients (16.1%) failed treatment, defined as worsening symptoms and pursuit of an alternative therapy. Six of 31 patients (19.4%) had a modified course of sulfasalazine therapy owing to abnormal hematologic parameters. Serious adverse events leading to drug discontinuation occurred in 6.5% of patients (n = 2) and included a patient with drug-induced leukopenia and one with rhabdomyolysis.

Conclusion

Sulfasalazine is a highly effective treatment for patients with antihistamine resistant CIU. The frequency of adverse events leading to an alteration of sulfasalazine treatment supports the need for close monitoring of these patients.

### Chemoprevention: risk reduction with medical therapy of inflammatory bowel disease [^1111qsm9]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The ideal chemopreventative agent, in addition to being efficacious in the prevention of cancer, must be easily administered, affordable, safe, and well tolerated, with minimal side effects. In the past decade, a growing body of literature has emerged on the prevention of CRC in patients with long-standing CD and UC. The data are not definitive and consist almost exclusively of retrospective case-control and cohort studies rather than the more rigorous prospective RCTs. 5-ASA compounds have been most thoroughly studied, and most of the existing data support the use of 5-ASA in the prevention of CRC. Although the precise dose and duration are unclear, studies suggest that chronic systemic administration of 5-ASA at a dose of at least 1.2 g/d is most likely to be effective. A beneficial effect of folate, albeit not statistically significant, has been consistently shown in every study performed for this purpose. Folate supplementation, which is safe and affordable, should also be recommended for all patients with IBD, especially those taking sulfasalazine. UDCA has been shown to exert a protective effect in most studies on patients with UC and concomitant PSC. Because this patient population is at particularly high risk for CRC, it is advisable to consider UDCA in all patients with colitis complicated by PSC. For patients without PSC, sufficient data do not exist to recommend it for the purpose of cancer prevention. Five of the six corticosteroid studies have found a beneficial effect of systemic steroids, although most did not reach statistical significance. Regardless, given the frequent and serious adverse effects associated with chronic steroid use, systemic corticosteroids should not be prescribed for this indication. Budesonide, an oral corticosteroid with minimal systemic absorption, is a potential alternative, although it has not yet been studied as a chemopreventative agent. Similarly, until the long-term safety of chronic NSAID use can be demonstrated in patients with IBD, the role of NSAIDs in chemoprevention remains undefined. Although the data are conflicting, immune-modulating medications, such as AZA, do not seem to confer any reduction in the risk of dysplasia or CRC. The data on calcium supplementation and statin use are still too limited to endorse their use for the prevention of colitis-related CRC. Chemoprevention is an area that holds great promise in the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with IBD. Further studies, including prospective trials when possible and cost-effectiveness analyses, need to be performed to develop an optimal strategy for the reduction of cancer risk in patients with IBD.

### Insights into the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in pregnancy [^113HT93c]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

5-ASA drugs have also been found to be safe to use during pregnancy. A meta-analysis of seven studies that followed 2200 pregnant women with IBD found that exposure to 5-ASA drugs (including mesalazine, sulfasalazine, balsalazide, and olsalazine) was not associated with a significantly increased risk of congenital abnormalities (OR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.76–1.77]), stillbirth (OR, 2.38 [95% CI, 0.65–8.72]), spontaneous abortion (OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.65–2.01]), or preterm delivery (OR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.85–2.13]).

Some formulations of 5-ASA drugs include dibutyl phthalate (DBP) in the enteric coating, which had been associated with skeletal formations and urogenital defects in male offspring of exposed female rates. In a report of six cases, urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites in patients treated with DBP-containing 5-ASA formulations were 50 times higher than those not treated with these formulations. The effects seen in animal models have not been seen in humans. However, given the overall limited data and uncertainty of the safety of DBP exposure during pregnancy, The Toronto Consensus Statement recommends that women contemplating pregnancy and taking 5-ASA formulations containing DBP should switch to an alternative formulation of 5-ASA that does not contain DBP. Ideally this change should occur months prior to conception given the risk of possible flare while changing agents. If a patient has already conceived on a DBP-containing 5-ASA agent, the decision to change agents should be individualized to the patient.

Paternal exposure

In men, sulfasalazine has been shown to cause oligospermia, abnormal sperm morphology, and decreased sperm motility in several studies. These effects are fully reversible, and generally resolve a few months after discontinuation. The sulfapyridine metabolite is felt to be responsible for these effects on sperm; therefore, it is recommended to transition patients to an alternative 5-ASA agent, such as mesalazine, at least 4 months prior to planned conception.

### Sexual and reproductive health in rheumatic disease [^111zXmqY]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Family size is reduced among patients with rheumatic diseases. The causes for the low number of children are multifactorial and include impaired sexual function, decreased gonadal function, pregnancy loss, therapy and personal choices. Sexuality contributes to quality of life in patients with rheumatic disease, but is often ignored by health professionals. Both disease-related factors and psychological responses to chronic disease can impair sexual functioning. Toxic effects of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs can induce transient or permanent gonadal failure in women and men. Furthermore, permanent infertility can be a consequence of treatment with cyclophosphamide, whereas transient infertility can be caused by NSAIDs in women and sulfasalazine in men. These adverse effects must be communicated to the patients, and measures to preserve fertility should be initiated before the start of gonadotoxic therapy. Management of patients of both genders should include regular family planning, effective treatment of high disease activity, sexual counselling, and, if necessary, infertility treatment.

### Risk-stratified monitoring for sulfasalazine toxicity: prognostic model development and validation [^111tgG6B]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sulfasalazine-induced cytopenia, nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity is uncommon during long-term treatment. Some guidelines recommend 3 monthly monitoring blood tests indefinitely during long-term treatment while others recommend stopping monitoring after 1 year. To rationalise monitoring, we developed and validated a prognostic model for clinically significant blood, liver or kidney toxicity during established sulfasalazine treatment.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

UK primary care. Data from Clinical Practice Research Datalink Gold and Aurum formed independent development and validation cohorts.

Participants

Age ≥ 18 years, new diagnosis of an inflammatory condition and sulfasalazine prescription.

Study period

1 January 2007 to 31 December 2019.

Outcome

Sulfasalazine discontinuation with abnormal monitoring blood-test result.

Analysis

Patients were followed up from 6 months after first primary care prescription to the earliest of outcome, drug discontinuation, death, 5 years or 31 December 2019. Penalised Cox regression was performed to develop the risk equation. Multiple imputation handled missing predictor data. Model performance was assessed in terms of calibration and discrimination.

Results

8936 participants were included in the development cohort (473 events, 23 299 person-years) and 5203 participants were included in the validation cohort (280 events, 12 867 person-years). Nine candidate predictors were included. The optimism adjusted R 2 D and Royston D statistic in the development data were 0.13 and 0.79, respectively. The calibration slope (95% CI) and Royston D statistic (95% CI) in validation cohort was 1.19 (0.96 to 1.43) and 0.87 (0.67 to 1.07), respectively.

Conclusion

This prognostic model for sulfasalazine toxicity uses readily available data and should be used to risk-stratify blood-test monitoring during established sulfasalazine treatment.

### Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) [^111v6Kwm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of sulfasalazine in pregnant women. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6 times the human maintenance dose of 2 g/day based on body surface area and have revealed no evidence of impaired female fertility or harm to the fetus due to sulfasalazine. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

There have been case reports of neural tube defects (NTDs) in infants born to mothers who were exposed to sulfasalazine during pregnancy, but the role of sulfasalazine in these defects has not been established. However, oral sulfasalazine inhibits the absorption and metabolism of folic acid which may interfere with folic acid supplementation (see Drug Interactions) and diminish the effect of periconceptional folic acid supplementation that has been shown to decrease the risk of NTDs.

A national survey evaluated the outcome of pregnancies associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In 186 pregnancies in women treated with sulfasalazine alone or sulfasalazine and concomitant steroid therapy, the incidence of fetal morbidity and mortality was comparable both to that of 245 untreated IBD pregnancies, and to pregnancies in the general population.2

A study of 1455 pregnancies associated with exposure to sulfonamides including sulfasalazine, indicated that this group of drugs did not appear to be associated with fetal malformation.3A review of the medical literature covering 1155 pregnancies in women with ulcerative colitis suggested that the outcome was similar to that expected in the general population.4

No clinical studies have been performed to evaluate the effect of sulfasalazine on the growth development and functional maturation of children whose mothers received the drug during pregnancy.

Clinical Considerations

Sulfasalazine and its metabolite, sulfapyridine, pass through the placenta. Sulfasalazine and its metabolite are also present in human milk. In the newborn, sulfonamides compete with bilirubin for binding sites on the plasma proteins and may cause kernicterus. Although sulfapyridine has been shown to have poor bilirubin-displacing capacity, monitor the newborn for the potential for kernicterus.

A case of agranulocytosis has been reported in an infant whose mother was taking both sulfasalazine and prednisone throughout pregnancy.

### Enhancing patient understanding of medication risks and benefits [^111X2CKr]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Knowledge was assessed by 3 separate instruments administered via telephone interview, including an 8‐item measure assessing knowledge concerning methotrexate (which is often first‐line therapy for RA), a 20‐item measure assessing knowledge concerning biologic treatment options, and an 8‐item measure assessing knowledge of RA and RA treatment options more generally. Correct answers were summed across all 3 measures and transformed to a 100‐point scale, reflecting the percentage of questions answered correctly.

DMARD use was assessed via a checklist of 19 RA medications (abatacept, adalimumab, azathioprine, certolizumab pegol, cyclosporine, etanercept, golimumab, gold, hydroxycholoroquine, infliximab, leflunomide, methotrexate pill, methotrexate shot, minocycline, rituximab, sulfasalazine, tocilizumab infusion, tocilizumab shot, and tofacitinib) included in the online questionnaires. Participants were asked to check all of those medications that they were currently being treated with or to check an option labeled "none of the above".

Gist reasoning ability was assessed by the Test of Strategic Learning (TOSL). The TOSL was developed to systematically quantify participants' capacity to abstract gist meanings from complex input. The TOSL consists of nonmedical text passages varying in length (from 291 to 575 words) and complexity. At each time point, participants read one of the text passages presented via an online questionnaire. After reading the passage, participants clicked on a link to the next page of the questionnaire, which included a single item asking participants to summarize the original text, focusing on bottom‐line meaning (i.e. "the moral of the story") rather than specific details. Participants had up to 5 minutes to complete this task and were not allowed to return to the page on which the passage appeared while writing the summary.

Dapsone is usually well-tolerated at recommended doses. However, hematological side effects may sometimes occur, the most common being dose-dependent hemolysis and methemoglobinemia. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are more prone to these side effects. Other possible side effects that usually appear within the first 3 months of treatment include headache, dizziness, nausea, elevated transaminases, and even agranulocytosis. Rarely, peripheral neuropathy with primarily motor function loss may develop in patients with DH continuously receiving a daily dose of dapsone ≥ 100 mg. Clinical and laboratory monitoring, including complete blood cell count and liver and renal function tests, are necessary both at baseline and during follow-up of dapsone treatment; these are best performed by a dermatologist. When dapsone is causing major side effects or is otherwise contraindicated, sulfasalazine or rituximab can help. Topical dapsone 5% gel, available in the United States and Canada, is free from systemic side effects and seems moderately efficient in the treatment of localized DH lesions on the face and chest.

### Sulfasalazine… [^114QTk11]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Sulfasalazine, sold under the brand name Azulfidine among others, is a medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. It is considered by some to be a first-line treatment in rheumatoid arthritis. It is taken by mouth or can be administered rectally. Significant side effects occur in about 25% of people. Commonly these include loss of appetite, nausea, headache, and rash. Severe side effects include bone marrow suppression, liver problems, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and kidney problems. It should not be used in people allergic to aspirin or sulfonamide. Use during pregnancy appears to be safe for the baby. Sulfasalazine is in the disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs family of medications. It is unclear exactly how it works. One proposed mechanism is the inhibition of prostaglandins, resulting in local anti-inflammatory effects in the colon.

The medication is broken down by intestinal bacteria into sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid. Sulfasalazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1950. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Sulfasalazine is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 284th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. Medical uses Sulfasalazine is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It is also indicated for use in rheumatoid arthritis and used in other types of inflammatory arthritis. It is usually not given to children under two years of age. Side effects Use of sulfasalazine is contraindicated in people with sulfa allergies and in those with urinary tract obstructions, intestinal obstructions, and severe liver or kidney problems.

Sulfasalazine metabolizes to sulfapyridine. Serum levels should be monitored every three months, and more frequently at the outset. Serum levels above 50 μg/L are associated with side effects. In rare cases, sulfasalazine can cause severe depression in young males. It can also cause oligospermia and temporary infertility. Immune thrombocytopenia has been reported. Sulfasalazine inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, and can cause folate deficiency and megaloblastic anemia. and various other undesirable effects. Sulfasalazine can cause hemolytic anemia in people with G6PD deficiency. Sulfasalazine can cause kidney stones. Sulfasalazine may cause stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, headache, dizziness, or unusual tiredness. Skin and urine can become orange, with occasional allergic reactions. Sulfasalazine may cause sulfhemoglobinemia.

Pharmacology Around 90% of a dose of sulfasalazine reaches the colon, where most of it is metabolized by bacteria into sulfapyridine and mesalazine. Both metabolites are active; most of the sulfapyridine is absorbed and then further metabolized, but most mesalazine is not, and remains in the colon. A mix of unchanged, hydroxylated, and glucuronidated sulfapyridine is eliminated in urine, as is acetylated mesalazine and unmetabolized sulfasalazine. The mechanism of action is not clear, but it appears that sulfasalazine and its metabolites have immunosuppressive, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory effects. It also appears to inhibit the cystine-glutamate antiporter, as well as sepiapterin reductase. Chemistry It is a codrug which is a combination of sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid coupled with an azo linkage.

### Mesalazine [^115SKZdE]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Mesalazine, also known asmesalamine or5-aminosalicylic acid, is a medication used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It is generally used for mildly to moderately severe disease. It is taken by mouth or rectally. The formulations which are taken by mouth appear to be similarly-effective. Common side-effects include headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and fever. Serious side-effects may include pericarditis, liver problems, and kidney problems. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding appears safe. In people with a sulfa allergy certain formulations may result in problems. Mesalazine is an aminosalicylate and anti-inflammatory. It works by direct contact with the intestines. Mesalazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1987. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

In 2021, it was the 239th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. Medical uses It is used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. In 2022 Germany introduced guidance to use mesalamine to treat acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Side-effects Most often reported side-effects are gastrointestinal, including: nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Very rarely, use of mesalazine has been associated with an exacerbation of the symptoms of colitis, Stevens Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme. Pregnancy There is no data on use in pregnant women, but the drug does cross the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. The drug should not be used in children under two years of age, people with kidney disease, or people who are allergic to aspirin.

Chemistry Mesalazine is the active moiety of sulfasalazine, which is metabolized to sulfapyridine and mesalazine. It is also the active component of the prodrug balsalazide along with the inert carrier molecule 4-aminobenzoyl-beta-alanine. It is in the category of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs family of medications. It is unclear exactly how it works. Mesalazine is claimed to be a PPAR-γ agonist. Mechanism of action Exact mechanism of mesalazine is unknown, but is speculated that mesalazine decreases synthesis of prostaglandin and leukotriene, modulating the inflammatory response derived from the cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase pathways. It appears to act locally on colonic mucosa. Society and culture Brand names Mesalazine is sold under various names including Apriso, Asacol, Asacol HD, Canasa, Delzicol, Fivasa, Lialda, Salofalk, Pentasa, Rowasa, Octasa, and Sfrowasa. In Europe, it is sold under the name Salofalk.
