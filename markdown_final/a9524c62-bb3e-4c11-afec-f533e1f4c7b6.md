## Question

What is the physiologic basis of a rigor? Are they beneficial, therapeutic or detrimental?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the physiologic basis of rigors and whether they are beneficial, therapeutic, or detrimental. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying definitions so I don't conflate rigors with rigor mortis or opioid-induced muscle rigidity. Then, I should verify the thermoregulatory pathophysiology that produces shaking chills. Next, I will examine whether rigors confer any benefit versus being simply epiphenomena of fever. After that, I need to check whether rigors can ever be considered therapeutic. Finally, I will assess potential harms and synthesize the clinical implications for diagnosis and management, making sure the evidence base supports each step.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so we do not jump to incorrect inferences: clinically, rigors refer to paroxysmal shaking chills associated with fever and systemic inflammatory responses, which must be distinguished from rigor mortis (postmortem stiffening) and from pharmacologic skeletal muscle rigidity during anesthesia or opioid administration; I should verify each of these distinctions with sources that specifically discuss bacteremia-associated shaking chills, postmortem positioning challenges due to rigor mortis, and opioid-induced rigidity phenomena, respectively.

> I will now examine the physiologic mechanism: rigors arise when pyrogenic signals elevate the hypothalamic set-point, creating a sensed mismatch that triggers heat-conserving vasoconstriction and heat-generating shivering; the shivering thermogenesis is driven by rapid, involuntary skeletal muscle contractions coordinated via hypothalamic-spinal pathways, with shivering predominating in acute thermogenic responses while nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue accrues more gradually; infections that provoke bacteremia and cytokine release commonly precipitate this response, and cold stress literature corroborates shivering as the primary acute thermogenic effector, so these pieces fit mechanistically with clinical shaking chills [^111hdpQU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "benefit" without being precise: fever as a host response can be adaptive, but I need to check whether rigors per se add benefit beyond being the motor expression of set-point elevation; shivering does efficiently generate heat to reach the new set-point more rapidly, which could accelerate fever-associated immune advantages, but rigors themselves are a symptom rather than a targeted host defense, so any "benefit" is indirect and embedded in the broader fever response; diagnostically, I initially thought rigors were "highly sensitive", but wait, let me verify — systematic data show shaking chills have clinical utility for identifying bacteremia, but I should avoid overstating sensitivity or specificity without exact estimates, so I will simply note that rigors meaningfully raise suspicion for bloodstream infection rather than claim a specific performance metric [^115HYaf5] [^111hdpQU].

> I should confirm whether rigors are ever therapeutic: rigor episodes are not a treatment that clinicians deploy; instead, they are involuntary events that frequently signify adverse reactions or intercurrent infection; in fact, multiple drug labels list rigors as part of febrile or infusion-related reactions, often necessitating interruption, dose modification, or supportive care rather than intentional induction, which supports the conclusion that rigors are not a therapy but a side effect or symptom that may require management [^notfound] [^1137rsJd] [^113Dpi1s] [^116JEs5A] [^116bUxCj].

> Next, I should review the potential harms to ensure I am not underestimating them: severe shivering entails high skeletal muscle work with increased oxygen consumption and lactate generation, which can exacerbate metabolic stress and, in vulnerable patients, contribute to or unmask rhabdomyolysis; I also need to check hemodynamic consequences — febrile reactions with rigors are often complicated by hypotension, dehydration, and even acute kidney injury, indicating substantial systemic stress; clinically, rigors cause distress, can be mistaken for seizures, and in the critically ill may risk device dislodgement, so on balance the net effect tends to be detrimental in acute care contexts where we can treat the cause while mitigating excessive metabolic cost [^115HdJe4] [^115HYaf5] [^1137rsJd] [^116bUxCj].

> Let me synthesize the clinical significance and practical approach, and I should double-check that my recommendations map to the cited evidence: rigors reflect the extreme motor manifestation of shivering during pyrogen-driven set-point elevation, so their presence should prompt expedited evaluation for serious infection, especially bacteremia, while also considering drug-related febrile reactions; symptom control with antipyretics and external measures can reduce metabolic load without obscuring the need to identify and treat the underlying cause, and in infusion-related chills, premedication or product selection can mitigate rigors; I need to ensure I differentiate rigors from opioid-induced rigidity, which has different management (adjust opioid rate, neuromuscular blockade if necessary), and to monitor for complications such as hypotension or renal dysfunction when severe febrile reactions occur, aligning with labeling guidance to evaluate for infection and assess kidney function during significant pyrexia [^111hdpQU] [^116bUxCj] [^111qoQHi] [^115HYaf5].

> In conclusion, let me reconsider the central question to confirm internal consistency: rigors are shaking chills driven by pyrogen-mediated thermoregulatory reset and shivering thermogenesis; while the fever response may confer host advantages, rigors themselves are not therapeutic and are generally net harmful due to metabolic and hemodynamic stress, yet they retain diagnostic value for serious infections like bacteremia and should trigger focused evaluation and supportive control of symptoms while the underlying cause is treated [^111hdpQU] [^113BGBZ6].

Rigors are rapid, involuntary muscle contractions driven by hypothalamic thermoregulatory responses to pyrogens, with **ATP-dependent shivering** generating heat to raise core temperature [^113BGBZ6]. They are **beneficial for host defense** by promoting fever and inhibiting pathogen replication, but can be **detrimental in vulnerable patients** by increasing metabolic demand, precipitating cardiovascular events, or causing complications such as rhabdomyolysis or acute kidney injury [^115HYaf5]. Management should balance prompt treatment of the underlying cause, use of antipyretics, and supportive care to prevent harm.

## Physiologic basis of rigors

Rigors are a **coordinated thermoregulatory response** to pyrogenic stimuli that engages both central and peripheral mechanisms [^1144eAqD].

---

### Central thermoregulatory control

Hypothalamic set-point elevation occurs when pyrogens (e.g. IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, **PGE2**) raise the **set-point**, triggering **heat production**. Sympathetic activation increases sympathetic outflow from the hypothalamus, causing **vasoconstriction** and **shivering** [^113BGBZ6].

---

### Peripheral effector mechanisms

Vasoconstriction reduces skin blood flow and heat loss, while **shivering thermogenesis** consists of rapid, involuntary muscle contractions that generate heat via ATP hydrolysis.

---

### Biochemical and cellular mechanisms

Biochemical and cellular mechanisms include **ATP hydrolysis** during muscle contractions, which liberates heat, and repeated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release and reuptake that sustain contractions and heat production [^112Cqeao]. Increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation meets the heightened ATP demand and further contributes to heat generation [^113BGBZ6].

---

## Clinical significance of rigors

Rigors are **clinically significant** and often indicate serious underlying conditions [^111hdpQU]:

- **Infections**: Common in bacteremia, sepsis, malaria, influenza, and other systemic infections [^111hdpQU].

- **Drug reactions**: Occur with amphotericin B, neostigmine, and others [^116bUxCj] [^115CPwC9] [^116JEs5A].

- **Malignant hyperthermia**: Life-threatening hypermetabolic crisis with severe muscle rigidity and hyperthermia [^112Cqeao].

---

## Beneficial aspects of rigors

Rigors confer several **physiological benefits**, including an **enhanced immune response** — fever augments immune function and inhibits pathogen replication — and an **early clinical warning**, as rigors prompt timely evaluation and treatment of serious infections [^111hdpQU].

---

## Detrimental aspects of rigors

Rigors can cause **significant harm**, especially in vulnerable patients:

- **Increased metabolic demand**: Higher oxygen consumption and cardiac workload can precipitate ischemia or arrhythmias.

- **Muscle injury**: Severe or prolonged rigors can cause rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury [^114BLNZp] [^115HdJe4].

- **Respiratory compromise**: Chest wall rigidity can impair ventilation, particularly in critical illness [^111qoQHi].

---

## Therapeutic implications and management

Rigors are not therapeutic per se, but their management is **clinically important**:

- **Treat underlying cause**: Identify and treat infections or other triggers [^111hdpQU].

- **Antipyretic therapy**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs reduce fever and shivering.

- **Supportive care**: Provide oxygen, fluids, and monitor for complications.

- **Specific interventions**: Use dantrolene for malignant hyperthermia [^112Cqeao]; consider neuromuscular blockade for severe rigidity [^111qoQHi].

### Critical issues for the translation of cardioprotection [^116HSMxx]. Circulation Research (2017). Low credibility.

The translation from numerous successful animal experiments on cardioprotection beyond that by reperfusion to clinical practice has, at the time of writing, been disappointing. Animal experiments often use reductionist approaches and are mostly performed in young and healthy animals, which lack the risk factors, comorbidities, and comedications characteristic of patients suffering an acute myocardial infarction or undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Conceptually, it is still unclear by how much the time window for successful reperfusion is extended by preconditioning, and how long the duration of ischemia can be so that adjunct cardioprotection by postconditioning at reperfusion still protects. Experimental studies addressing long-term effects of adjunct cardioprotection beyond infarct size reduction, specifically on repair, remodeling, and mortality, are lacking.

Technically, the reproducibility and robustness of experimental studies are often limited. Grave faults in the design and conduct of clinical trials have also substantially contributed to the failure of the translation of cardioprotection to clinical practice. Cardiovascular surgery with ischemic cardioplegic arrest is only a surrogate of acute myocardial infarction and is confounded by the choice of anesthesia, hypothermia, cardioplegia, and traumatic myocardial injury. Trials in patients with acute myocardial infarction have been performed on agents and interventions with no or inconsistent previous animal data and in patients who had either some reperfusion already at admission or were reperfused too late to expect any myocardial salvage.

### The physiology of sudden violent death [^111ws9Ty]. Resuscitation (2003). Low credibility.

The physiology behind sudden violent death is considered in light of information from a wide variety of clinical, experimental, forensic, and veterinary sources. Physiological causes can be classified under the headings of blood loss, asphyxia, electrocution, tissue loss, destruction of the brain, disconnection of the brain, and poisoning. Death, although sudden, is not necessarily instantaneous, as asphyxia and electrocution take some time to kill the subjects.

The chemistry of dying, death, and changes post mortem needs more research in order to design further rational resuscitation procedures.

### International guideline development for the determination of death [^117XdqAD]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This report describes the initial phase in an international process to develop guidelines and agree upon an operational definition for determining death, based on the cessation of neurological and circulatory functions. Plenary discussions resulted in consensus on seven key areas:

- **Death determination**: Death is determined primarily using clinical criteria based on direct observation or examination of the patient, once preconditions have been fulfilled and confounding conditions excluded.

- **Physiological sequences**: The physiological sequences by which circulatory and neurological functions cease, leading up to the moment of death, were set forth to clarify the critical events that occur following a catastrophic injury or illness.

- **Clinical tests and standards**: Clinical tests that constitute the minimum clinical standard for the determination of death were defined for both the neurological and the circulatory sequences. Preconditions and confounding conditions that may impede or invalidate death diagnosis were also specified.

- **Ancillary and laboratory tests**: Certain ancillary and/or complementary laboratory tests may be useful in situations in which clinical testing cannot be performed or when confounding or special conditions are present. Limitations to using certain of these tests in death determination mean that further research is required to ensure their reliability.

- **Terminology and clarity**: A set of precise terminology, which aims to improve clarity in death determination discussions and debate, was agreed upon.

- **Operational definition**: An operational definition of human death, based on measurable biomedical standards, was proposed. Participants supported avoiding use of anatomically based terms such as "brain death".

### The regulatory light chain mediates inactivation of myosin motors during active shortening of cardiac muscle [^1133q4JQ]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

One such alternative explanation was suggested by our previous study of the orientations of NRLC and CRLC in trabeculae during the steady states of relaxation, isometric contraction, and rigor. In those experiments, four bifunctional fluorescent probes were attached separately to each domain of the RLC at different locations and orientations in the local coordinate frame of the domain, allowing the distribution of orientations of each domain with respect to the trabecular axis to be determined. The results showed that, in heart muscle in situ, NRLC and CRLC are not part of a rigid single domain but are connected by a flexible hinge. A similar conclusion was reached in a multi-probe analysis of NRLC and CRLC orientations in skeletal muscle.

Flexibility between NRLC and CRLC has also been inferred from cryo-EM structures of both the actin-bound motor in the nucleotide-free or rigor complex, and in the folded OFF or IHM state of the myosin dimer. Flexibility between NRLC and CRLC implies that NRLC may not be part of the lever arm in all conditions, and therefore that changes in NRLC orientation may not report the power stroke directly. Moreover, comparison of the NRLC orientation distribution deduced from the multi-probe studies in trabeculae with the cryo-EM structures showed that some NRLCs stay folded against the thick filament backbone in the OFF orientation during active isometric contraction and, unexpectedly, that the OFF orientation of NRLC is similar to that in the actin-bound rigor complex.

### International guideline development for the determination of death [^11292YS4]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This report summarizes the results of the first phase in the development of international guidelines for death determination, focusing on the biology of death and the dying process. These were developed by an invitational forum of international content experts and representatives of several professional societies.

- **Results and conclusions**: Precise terminology was developed to improve clarity in death discussion and debate. Critical events in the physiological sequences leading to cessation of neurological and/or circulatory function were constructed. It was agreed that death determination is primarily clinical, and recommendations for preconditions, confounding factors, minimum clinical standards, and additional testing were made. A single operational definition of human death was developed: "the permanent loss of capacity for consciousness and all brainstem functions, as a consequence of permanent cessation of circulation or catastrophic brain injury". In order to complete the project, the next phase will involve a broader group of international stakeholders to develop clinical practice guidelines based on comprehensive reviews and grading of the existing evidence.

### The trouble with translational medicine [^111V3yFK]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Increasingly, more reports in the literature are reflecting on the hurdles of effectively translating promising results from biomedical research into useful therapeutics. A recurring theme is that good intentions are frustrated by extrinsic factors upon which 'translationalists' have little control. It is possible that the problem resides, at least in part, within the translational community itself, which has failed to prioritize the steps required to systematically approach the problem. Most importantly, there is disproportionate emphasis on bench-to-bedside efforts, rather than addressing a priori the need to increase the understanding of human pathophysiology.

Therapeutic concepts based on experimental conditions that may not, and indeed often do not, represent the nature of human genetics lead to drug development that is not sufficiently applicable to the human condition. The damage is then amplified when these ill-fated concepts are tested in clinical trials at great cost. The use of surrogate biomarkers that could allow early assessment of efficacy currently requires long-term assessment of clinical benefit, which can delay essential feedback about clinical efficacy by years or decades.

Moreover, scant effort is applied to learning whether a drug has achieved its biological endpoint or why it failed its clinical endpoint. Thus, the feedback loop is not only delayed but is often uninformative. As a consequence, researchers continue to produce novel therapeutic candidates based on experimental models without the essential benefit of lessons learned from previous failures.

### The effect of ischemia reperfusion injury on skeletal muscle [^114CcBAR]. Injury (2012). High credibility.

Ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury occurs when tissue is reperfused following a period of ischemia, resulting from acute inflammation involving various mechanisms. IR injury can occur following a range of circumstances, from seemingly minor conditions to major trauma. The intense inflammatory response has both local and systemic effects due to the physiological, biochemical, and immunological changes that occur during the ischemic and reperfusion periods. The sequelae of the cellular injury of IR may lead to the loss of organ or limb function or even death. Many factors influence the outcome of these injuries, and it is crucial for clinicians to understand IR injury to minimize patient morbidity and mortality. This paper reviews the pathophysiology, effects of IR injury in skeletal muscle, and associated clinical conditions, such as compartment syndrome, crush syndrome, and vascular injuries.

### Leptin: Is it thermogenic [^113BGBZ6]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

However, as outlined previously, the delayed response in BAT activation observed in some studies does not necessarily explain the acute cold intolerance of ob/ob mice, because the response to acute cold relies mainly on shivering thermogenesis, whereas nonshivering thermogenesis in BAT is only recruited gradually during the course of cold acclimation. It may, however, reflect a general tendency toward lower sympathetic activation in these mice, a state that could also result in a lower degree of sympathetically stimulated lipolysis in WAT, which could limit substrate availability for shivering thermogenesis.

The initiation and maintenance of shivering thermogenesis requires proper fiber type in the muscle tissue, as well as sufficient fuel supply to muscles. ob/ob mice on a Balb/c background are less susceptible to cold-induced acute hypothermia than are ob/ob mice on the BL/6 background. Correspondingly, these Balb/c mice show higher rates of ex vivo lipolysis in white fat and higher activity-induced plasma glycerol levels compared with the less cold-tolerant C57BL/6 ob/ob mice. It may thus be speculated that a delayed or reduced initiation of lipolysis in ob/ob mice limits muscle fuel supply, thereby limiting the shivering response usually seen upon acute cold exposure. Indeed, some studies measuring lipolysis in ob/ob mice or in isolated ob/ob adipocytes found reduced levels of basal and stimulated lipolysis, and leptin treatment has been shown to activate lipolysis via the sympathetic nervous system.

### Age structure landscapes emerge from the equilibrium between aging and rejuvenation in bacterial populations [^112tqjfD]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

The above result alone should eliminate starvation as the explanation for the observed physiological differences between old and new daughters, but we tested this conclusion even more rigorously. We employed a second microfluidic design, comprising large growth chambers and controlling for positional nutrient deprivation by opening both ends of the traps (Fig. 1d). In these chambers, the larger width spread cells into a monolayer of approximately 300 bacteria, which pushed against each other and shuffled positions as they elongated.

Unlike the mother machine, this device did not preferentially retain either the old or the new daughter. Thus, we named this design, for the purpose of this study, the daughter device, and used it to test whether the doubling time relationship observed for OO, ON, NN, and NO in the mother machine could be replicated. To assemble a data set equivalent to Fig. 2a, we identified OO cells in the daughter device as those that had been old for at least two generations, and then followed them forward in time to obtain the series OO, ON, NN, and NO. The relationships measured for OO, ON, NN, and NO in the mother machine (Fig. 2a) and the daughter device (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1) were nearly identical. Most importantly, NO (20.18 ± 0.97 min, mean ± SD, n = 620) still had a significantly longer doubling time than NN (19.60 ± 0.94 min, n = 620) in the latter device. To ensure that the shuffling was effective, we measured cell positions in the daughter device and found that OO, ON, NN, and NO experienced the same average.

### Clinical observations in acute neurology: A historical explanation of the present [^111cmYq5]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Over several decades, US centers have provided care for respiratory distress, recognizing that oropharyngeal failure signals insufficiency of respiratory muscles. Already in 1945, a reported 60 cases from Massachusetts General Hospital highlighted respiratory failure, specifically oropharyngeal failure. Later, Rowland et al. reported 39 fatal cases between 1930 and 1955, urging physicians to watch for warning signs, use sedatives cautiously, initiate early mechanical ventilation, and control for infection.

Campbell and Bramwell in Brain alerted UK and US physicians to myasthenia gravis and its potential for critical worsening. They provided detailed descriptions of 60 patients, 23 with fatal outcomes. Frequent involvement of bulbar muscles in their cases and ptosis, with accompanying weakness of the neck muscles, impaired the compensatory mechanism of "throwing back the head". The paper emphasized choking, nasal fluid regurgitation, diminished palatal reflex, and lowered voice tone, suggesting weakness of the vocal cord adductors and an inability to thrust out the cheek and maintain protrusion of the tongue. Measured circumferentially, the difference in chest movements between inspiration and expiration did not exceed a quarter inch. Dyspnea with exertion was common, and there were "unaccountable attacks of breathlessness, during which the patient is in danger". Accumulated mouth sputum accompanied dyspneic attacks, leaving patients unable to swallow or spit: "The tongue appears to sink back into the mouth". Retracting the tongue markedly improved symptoms.

### Ultiva [^111qoQHi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Skeletal muscle rigidity**: Skeletal muscle rigidity can be caused by Ultiva and is related to the dose and speed of administration. Ultiva may cause chest wall rigidity (inability to ventilate) after single doses of more than 1 mcg/kg administered over 30 to 60 seconds, or after infusion rates greater than 0.1 mcg/kg/min. Single doses of less than 1 mcg/kg may cause chest wall rigidity when given concurrently with a continuous infusion of Ultiva.

Muscle rigidity induced by Ultiva should be managed in the context of the patient's clinical condition. Muscle rigidity occurring during the induction of anesthesia should be treated by decreasing the rate or discontinuing the infusion of Ultiva or by administering a neuromuscular blocking agent. These agents should be compatible with the patient's cardiovascular status.

Muscle rigidity seen during the use of Ultiva in spontaneously breathing patients may be treated by stopping or decreasing the rate of administration. Resolution of muscle rigidity after discontinuation of the infusion occurs within minutes. In cases of life-threatening muscle rigidity, a rapid onset neuromuscular blocker or naloxone may be administered.

- **Potential inactivation by nonspecific esterases in blood products**: Ultiva should not be administered into the same IV tubing with blood due to potential inactivation by nonspecific esterases in blood products.

- **Bradycardia**: Bradycardia has been reported with Ultiva and is related to its administration parameters.

### A perspective on SIDS pathogenesis. The hypotheses: Plausibility and evidence [^114d8PJz]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The conclusion and final analysis draw attention to the need for integrated research approaches. Analysis of the various hypotheses and their relationship to pathological findings and epidemiological risk factors demonstrates that most hypotheses do not comprehensively address this relationship. This shortcoming highlights the necessity for future research to take formal measures to integrate both pathological and epidemiological findings. Such an approach will correct the frequent oversight in prior research, which has often concentrated on single mechanisms, like respiratory obstruction, rather than a holistic understanding, leading to inefficient allocation of public resources.

### Loss of function mutations in Gemin5 cause a neurodevelopmental disorder [^1157DyEg]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

The larval eclosion assay utilized UAS-rigor mortis KK RNAi lines (VDRC 105403) crossed with an inducible driver, Tubulin-GS-Gal4. The experiment was conducted at 28 °C on food mixed with 1 mM RU486 (Cayman Chemicals) to induce transgene expression. The larvae were monitored from the 1st instar stage until they eclosed and became adults. Images of each developmental stage were taken using a Leica M205C dissection microscope equipped with a Leica DFC450 camera.

- **Motor dysfunction assays**: UAS-rigor mortis KK RNAi lines (VDRC 105403) were crossed with the ubiquitous inducible driver, Tubulin Gene Switch (TubGS)-Gal4. Day 1 adults from the F1 progeny were collected every 24 h and moved to standard media mixed with 20 mM RU486 at 28 °C. Locomotion was assessed using the RING assay. Briefly, flies were transferred, without anesthetization, into plastic vials and placed in the RING apparatus. The vials were tapped down against the bench, and the climbing was recorded on video at day 20. Quantifications were performed manually by a third party in a blinded manner.

For studying NMJ defects, 3rd instar larvae expressing rigor mortis RNAi were dissected and fixed using 4% formaldehyde. The RNAi was expressed using TubGS-Gal4 by growing the 1st instar larvae on 1 mM RU486 at 28 °C until they reached the 3rd instar stage. The larvae (n = 4) were probed with mouse anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRP), a presynaptic neuronal marker, to identify the NMJs overnight at 4 °C. On the next day, the larvae were washed with 0.1% TBST and stained with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-568 secondary antibody.

### Perioperative oxidative stress: The unseen enemy [^111iiyLc]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Low credibility.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential for cellular signaling and physiological function. An imbalance between ROS production and antioxidant protection results in a state of oxidative stress (OS), which is associated with perturbations in reduction/oxidation (redox) regulation, cellular dysfunction, organ failure, and disease. The pathophysiology of OS is closely interlinked with inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and, in the case of surgery, ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI).

Perioperative OS is a complex response that involves patient, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The magnitude of tissue injury inflicted by the surgery affects the degree of OS, and both the duration and nature of the anesthetic procedure applied can modify this. Moreover, the interindividual susceptibility to the impact of OS is likely to be highly variable and potentially linked to underlying comorbidities. The pathological link between OS and postoperative complications remains unclear, in part due to the complexities of measuring ROS- and OS-mediated damage.

Exogenous antioxidant use and exercise have been shown to modulate OS and may have potential as countermeasures to improve postoperative recovery. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of OS, redox signaling, and regulation can provide an opportunity for patient-specific phenotyping and development of targeted interventions to reduce the disruption that surgery can cause to physiology. Anesthesiologists are in a unique position to deliver countermeasures to OS and improve physiological resilience.

- **Mekinist administered with Dabrafenib (Adult)**: In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], fever occurred in 58% of patients. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure occurred in 5% of patients. Fever was complicated by hypotension in 4%, dehydration in 3%, syncope in 2%, renal failure in 1%, and severe chills/rigors in less than 1% of patients.

- **Mekinist administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric)**: In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], pyrexia occurred in 66% of patients.

Withhold Mekinist when used as monotherapy, and both Mekinist and dabrafenib when used in combination, if the patient's temperature is ≥ 100.4°F. In case of recurrence, therapy can be interrupted at the first symptom of pyrexia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Fever may be complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure. Evaluate for signs and symptoms of infection and monitor serum creatinine and other evidence of renal function during and following severe pyrexia. If appropriate, Mekinist, or both Mekinist and dabrafenib when used in combination, may be restarted if the patient has recovered from the febrile reaction for at least 24 hours, either at the same or a lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### John Newsom-Davis: Clinician-scientist and so much more [^111Eb7oz]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Tom Sears, JND's MD supervisor, friend, and colleague, describes their work together on respiratory physiology (1965–75) and myasthenia at the National Hospital. Moran Campbell conducted experiments testing the ability of human subjects to perceive increased resistive or elastic loading of the airways. He utilized contemporary ideas of the 'length follow-up servo control of movement' to propose that perception depended on 'length–tension' inappropriateness. At that time, the servo theory conceived a muscle spindle-dependent reflex mechanism automatically subserving motor control without conscious intervention. The conscious response to limb muscle loading was believed to involve joint receptors with afferent pathways to the brain in the posterior columns.

Richard Godwin-Austen, a neurologist, had recently completed a study on intercostal joint mechanoreceptors in cats, examining these as a source of chest wall proprioception explaining dyspnoeic sensibility. During this period, I was investigating the electromyographic response of intercostal muscles to altered mechanical loading. Consequently, I suggested to John that he should investigate the perception of load in patients with impaired position sense or other signs of posterior column dysfunction. On alternate weeks, John and I would impale each other with wire EMG electrodes inserted in the external or internal intercostal muscles, sometimes resulting in uncomfortable consequences, to examine their reflex responses.

### Methodological rigor in preclinical cardiovascular studies: Targets to enhance reproducibility and promote research translation [^1155Uhcp]. Circulation Research (2017).

Preclinical cardiovascular research using animal models plays an integral role in advancing the care of patients afflicted with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, its impact is contingent on its scientific validity, reproducibility, and relevance to human physiology and disease. It is understood that inherent limitations of using animals to model human diseases can undermine the predictive value of preclinical findings, rendering it difficult for even the most skilled scientists to make impactful discoveries. However, this difficulty is compounded when methodological sources of bias are introduced.

- **Examination of practices**: We systematically examined a continuous and large body of preclinical cardiovascular research to determine how often randomization, blinding, and a priori sample size estimation are incorporated. This was done over a sufficiently long period to draw meaningful conclusions on the temporal patterns of these practices. Our findings indicate that, overall, these design elements are rarely implemented in studies published in leading peer-reviewed cardiovascular journals, paralleling the previously reported prevalence of sex bias.

- **Trends and disparities**: Apart from a modest increase in the proportion of studies reporting sample size calculations, there has been no improvement in these practices over the past decade, although stroke research may be a notable exception. Finally, analyses of citation counts suggest that crucial methodological aspects of preclinical studies may be overlooked by cardiovascular researchers, affording potentially biased research comparable influence on scientific research efforts as methodological rigor.

### Hypothermia-induced acute kidney injury in an elderly patient [^115XeENJ]. The Korean Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). High credibility.

Accidental hypothermia can be associated with various clinical signs and symptoms, including hypotonia, decreased body temperature, shivering, pallor, hyperkalemia, bradycardia, confusion, frostbite, slurred speech, premature atrial contractions, and premature ventricular contractions. Additional manifestations might include facial erythema, hyporeflexia, Osborn waves, loss of appetite, and homelessness. Patients may also present with mydriasis, decreased O2 saturation, frostnip, decreased QRS complex amplitude, apathy, ventricular fibrillation (VF), altered mental status, increased QT interval, bradypnea, somnolence, increased serum lactate, traumatic injury, and cyanosis.

### Survival after cardiac arrest with instantaneous rigorlike stiffness: A case report [^117GGYe7]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Instantaneous rigor is the immediate appearance of rigor mortis following cardiac arrest. To our knowledge, no previous reports exist on the resuscitation of such patients. A young athlete suddenly collapsed with cardiac arrest during a marathon; simultaneously, his legs stiffened with instantaneous rigorlike stiffness. This stiffening provoked hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis, and multiple organ failure. We decided to amputate both legs, with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Remarkably, the patient recovered and was discharged without neurologic impairment. This rare case highlights the potentially significant effect of instantaneous rigor.

### Sudden unexpected death in infancy: Biological mechanisms [^113ZTZz1]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) encompasses both explained and unexplained deaths. Unexplained cases, often referred to as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), are likely influenced by multiple neural mechanisms contributing to the final event. Evidence suggests a range of subtle physiological signs related to autonomic control, as well as autopsy findings of altered neurotransmitter systems, including the serotonergic system. This network plays a significant role in cardio-respiratory and thermoregulatory control. These processes may be influenced by the infant's vulnerability due to age, limited motor ability, or genetic predisposition. An environmental stressor may trigger the fatal event. It seems improbable that a single final physiological route leads to death. Understanding the causes of explained SUDI underscores the importance of thorough investigations following each death, ensuring that all contributory factors are examined.

### Duraclon [^112UxXVT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Overdosage**: Hypertension may develop early and may be followed by hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, hypothermia, drowsiness, decreased or absent reflexes, irritability, and miosis. With large oral overdoses, reversible cardiac conduction defects or arrhythmias, apnea, coma, and seizures have been reported. As little as 100 mcg of oral clonidine has produced signs of toxicity in pediatric patients.

- **Treatment**: There is no specific antidote for clonidine overdosage. Supportive care may include atropine sulfate for bradycardia and intravenous fluids and/or vasopressor agents for hypotension. Hypertension associated with overdosage has been treated with intravenous furosemide, diazoxide, or alpha-blocking agents such as phentolamine. Naloxone may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of clonidine-induced respiratory depression, hypotension, and/or coma; blood pressure should be monitored since the administration of naloxone has occasionally resulted in paradoxical hypertension. Tolazoline administration has yielded inconsistent results and is not recommended as first-line therapy. Dialysis is not likely to significantly enhance the elimination of clonidine.

The largest overdose reported at the time of writing involved a 28-year-old white male who ingested 100 mg of clonidine hydrochloride powder. This patient developed hypertension followed by hypotension, bradycardia, apnea, hallucinations, semi-coma, and premature ventricular contractions. The patient fully recovered after intensive treatment. Plasma clonidine levels were 60 ng/mL after 1 hour, 190 ng/mL after 1.5 hours, 370 ng/mL after 2.

### The etiology of rhabdomyolysis: an interaction between genetic susceptibility and external triggers [^112Fk368]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Primary analysis**: A total of 1302 patient records were selected. Of these, 934 (72%) were male and 368 (28%) were female. The median (range) age was 53 (0–98) years. Death during the episode of increased CK level was reported in 289 patients (22%). The median (range) peak CK was 4423 (2008–5,013,800) IU/l. In all categories, male patients were affected more frequently than females, except for those in the long lie group (P < 0.001).

- **Patient characteristics**: Of 1302 patients, 1025 (79%) had a non‐neuromuscular cause for the rhabdomyolysis event, whereas 277 (21%) had a proven genetic susceptibility, or were suspected of having a neuromuscular condition at the time of the event. Ischemia/anoxia was the most common trigger, followed by trauma; these two triggers were responsible for 42% and 20% of all cases, respectively.

The details of triggers and genetic factors underlying rhabdomyolysis in this patient cohort were examined at the Radboud University Medical Center between 2014 and 2019.

### Defining the boundary between life and death: New insights from neuropathology [^112TdYTs]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

"The boundaries which divide life from death are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other begins?"

In this issue of the Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology, Dr. Folkerth and colleagues provide new insights into the neuropathology of brain death, shedding light on decades-old questions regarding the boundary between life and death. Through the lens of classic light microscopic analysis, they comprehensively characterize histopathological changes affecting the neurons, glia, vasculature, and dura of Ms. Jahi McMath, a 13-year-old girl who was pronounced brain dead following a hypoxic-ischemic brain injury caused by postoperative hemorrhage. Ms. McMath's body was sustained via mechanical ventilation and medical support for four and a half years after she was pronounced brain dead, raising profound ethical questions that have been the subject of numerous debates.

Dr. Folkerth and colleagues help ground these debates about brain death in objective, histopathological evidence, providing a rare glimpse into the structural composition of the human brain years after the declaration of brain death. Most knowledge about the science of human brain death, and its sine qua non, the complete cessation of cerebral perfusion, is extrapolated from experimental animal and cell culture models, which may be limited by species- and paradigm-specific differences in pathological responses to hypoxic-ischemic injury. Direct human observation is of paramount importance to link experimental and mechanistic insights to human neuropathology.

### The surviving sepsis campaign: Basic/translational science research priorities [^116Wceaf]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The concept of "recovery from sepsis" encompasses a range of outcomes. At the organism level, it can refer to survival, reversal of organ dysfunction, or resumption of premorbid activities. While controlling or eliminating the infection focus is necessary, it alone is insufficient. Organ dysfunction may persist, and some sepsis-induced abnormalities might never fully resolve. Recovery likely involves reversing numerous maladaptive cellular, subcellular, and biochemical changes that occur during sepsis. These changes include alterations in metabolism; dysfunction in organelles, particularly mitochondria; attenuation of intracellular signal transduction pathways; and decreases in the activity of white blood cells, neuronal pathways, and endocrine responses that facilitate communication within the organism.

Despite descriptions of events occurring during recovery or the lack thereof, the specific mechanisms initiating recovery remain unknown. One theory suggests that recovery could be an extension of Darwinian theory: sepsis resolves, and the fittest cells or patients survive by implementing general protection mechanisms. Alternatively, specific molecules, processes, or events may directly promote recovery from sepsis, or it could be a combination of both.

- **Immunological processes contributing to recovery from sepsis**: In contrast to a substantial body of work describing the resolution of "normal" infections, the specific immunological processes that contribute to recovery from sepsis are still not well understood.

### Clinical observations in acute neurology: A historical explanation of the present [^115VHbNo]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Another revelation came with the discovered loss of all brainstem reflexes, apnea, and progressive hypotension in a patient with a rapidly deteriorating brain and no explanation other than a catastrophic lesion; this became known as cerebral death or brain death (the vacuous term "death by neurologic criteria" is staging a comeback). The 1950s invention of the positive‐pressure mechanical ventilator led to the recognition of progressive loss of brainstem function, breathing drive, and vascular tone, which were previously unobserved because patients succumbed from failure to protect the upper airway. It became apparent that injury of the lower pons and medulla oblongata in mechanically ventilated patients inevitably led to irrevocable loss of brainstem reflexes.

The normal dying sequence was a rostrocaudal deterioration of brainstem function; lost mesencephalic and pontine reflexes preceded functional loss of respiratory and pressure centers in the medulla, causing apnea and hypotension. This led to a definition of death by brainstem criteria despite increasingly sophisticated systems able to maintain other bodily systems. Fully disconnected from brain signals, the body became dependent on intrinsic pacemakers. This simple neurologic observation launched a reexamination of the crucial role of the brainstem in human vital functions and provided a new insight that the mind and thinking parts of the brain are subjugated by the brainstem.

Is the rest history? A detailed review of the discovery of clinical signs may tell us otherwise.

### Cramps, muscle pain, and fasciculations: Not always benign [^114X95To]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Fasciculation and cramps without weakness or muscle atrophy are recognized as a benign syndrome. The authors report a patient with cramp and fasciculation, which persisted for one year without abnormal motor unit morphology on EMG before progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, and EMG abnormalities developed. This observation raises the possibility that lower motor neuron hyperexcitability may precede motor neuron death in motor neuron disease.

### International guideline development for the determination of death [^114vEKo8]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

After reviewing the historical taxonomy and definitions of death, as well as the neurologic and circulatory sequences in the dying process that had been previously discussed and refined, participants reached a consensus on an operational definition of human death. This refers to a practical and quantifiable description of the state of human death based on measurable and observable biomedical standards. Forum participants agreed on the following operational definition:

Death is the permanent loss of capacity for consciousness and all brainstem functions. This may result from the permanent cessation of circulation or catastrophic brain injury. In the context of death determination, 'permanent' refers to the loss of function that cannot resume spontaneously and will not be restored through intervention.

Participants supported avoiding the use of anatomically based terms such as "brain death" or "cardiac death", which erroneously imply the death of that organ and can confuse the general public, health professionals, and policymakers. Organisms die, while organs cease functioning. Our operational definition is based on the cessation of function — the primary and fundamental purpose of an organ that can be assessed by observation and examination and is necessary for sustained life — rather than activities, which are physiologic properties of cells and groups of cells that can be measured by laboratory means.

While the forum participants understood that the overwhelming majority of deaths in the world occur after circulation has ceased, many occur outside health care settings.

### Emergency cricothyrotomy for trismus caused by instantaneous rigor in cardiac arrest patients [^111iRYJd]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Instantaneous rigor, as muscle stiffening occurring in the moment of death or cardiac arrest, can be confused with rigor mortis. If trismus is caused by instantaneous rigor, orotracheal intubation is impossible, and a surgical airway should be secured. Here, we report two patients who had emergency cricothyrotomy for trismus caused by instantaneous rigor. This case report aims to help physicians understand instantaneous rigor and emphasize the importance of securing a surgical airway quickly upon the occurrence of trismus.

### A perspective on SIDS pathogenesis: The hypotheses, plausibility, and evidence [^113dETTD]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

In order to fully examine hypotheses of SIDS causation, it is essential to acknowledge the pathological findings in SIDS. These hypotheses have often been limited to one organ site or have been overlooked, which is surprising and extremely unsatisfactory. Many pediatric pathologists specializing in Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI) maintain that deaths from asphyxia are indistinguishable on gross pathology from SIDS without providing supportive evidence. Contrary to this stance, there is evidence that pathological findings in SIDS are salient and consistent.

They consist of the following:

1. Intrathoracic petechial hemorrhages
2. Thymomegaly
3. Encephalomegaly
4. Evidence of microcardia
5. Liquid unclotted blood in the chambers of the heart
6. Kidney growth-restriction, which is also well described
7. An empty bladder and rectum

Given that most SIDS cases share this common pathological picture, it is reasonable to suppose these pathological features result from a single cause or a related underlying pathophysiology. While this view may seem against mainstream consensus, it appears improbable that such a regular spectrum of pathologies would result from a myriad or even a few possible causes. In the absence of these salient findings, and where the history and death scene do not align with SIDS, experienced pathologists would consider alternative diagnoses. Other more subtle pathologies, which are less consistent in terms of the proportion of SIDS babies affected, include the brainstem.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for rhabdomyolysis, specifically concerning diagnosis, the AAST 2022 guidelines recommend suspecting rhabdomyolysis in patients with any medical condition that causes increased metabolic demands on myocytes, exceeding the available supply of ATP. This condition can result from extreme exertional demands on skeletal muscle due to exercise, exogenous agents such as drugs or toxins, genetic defects or myopathies affecting the muscle cell, and infections.

### Ambisome [^116bUxCj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In the empirical therapy study 97–0–034, on Day 1, where no premedication was administered, the overall incidence of infusion-related events such as chills and rigors was significantly lower for patients administered AmBisome compared with those given amphotericin B lipid complex. Fever, chills/rigors, and hypoxia were significantly lower for each AmBisome group compared with the amphotericin B lipid complex group. The infusion-related event, hypoxia, was reported for 11.5% of amphotericin B lipid complex-treated patients compared with 0% of patients administered 3 mg/kg per day AmBisome and 1.2% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg per day AmBisome.

On Day 1, body temperature increased above the temperature taken within 1 hour prior to infusion (preinfusion temperature) or above the lowest infusion value (if no preinfusion temperature was recorded). Patients were not administered premedications to prevent infusion-related reactions before the Day 1 study drug infusion.

In study 94–0–013, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared AmBisome and amphotericin B deoxycholate as initial therapy for cryptococcal meningitis, allowing premedications to prevent infusion-related reactions. AmBisome-treated patients had a lower incidence of fever, chills/rigors, and respiratory adverse events.

There have been a few reports of flushing, back pain with or without chest tightness, and chest pain associated with AmBisome administration; on occasion, this has been severe. Where these symptoms were noted, the reaction developed within a few minutes after treatment.

### Brain death-associated reflexes and automatisms [^114dkcpP]. Neurocritical Care (2005). Low credibility.

In several instances, the diagnosis of brain death has been questioned due to the presence of movements. This case report and review of the literature illustrates the spectrum of movements that have been encountered in brain death.

- **Methods**: A case report and review of the literature on movements seen in brain death was conducted.

- **Results**: Movements in brain death are common and have a wide range of phenomenology. Several movements wax and wane over time, making movements in brain death difficult to classify. In addition, varying terminology has been used (e.g. Lazarus sign, spinal man, spinal reflexes, spinal automatisms). Although evidence points to a spinal origin for such movements, the pathophysiology in many cases remains speculative. Characteristics of movements in brain death have been identified that can help differentiate them from brainstem or voluntary origin.

- **Conclusions**: Based on our review, we suggest referring to stimulus-provoked movements as reflexes and spontaneous movements as automatisms. We propose using the terms brain death-associated reflexes and brain death-associated automatisms as two main categories for movements that occur in brain death. These terms do not imply a specific pathophysiology, but consistent clinically oriented nomenclature may be useful when reporting such phenomena.

### Quantification of muscle tone by using shear wave velocity during an anaesthetic induction: a prospective observational study [^1159fE6h]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

- **Results**: Opioid-induced rigidity increased the abdominal muscle tone, while complete muscle relaxation decreased the tone.

Seventy-five patients were included in the study. At baseline, the shear wave velocity (SWV) was 1.91 ± 0.51 m/s. During opioid-induced rigidity, the SWV increased to 2.24 ± 0.65 m/s, which was significantly faster than at baseline (p = 0.0005). During complete muscle relaxation, the SWV decreased to 1.61 ± 0.38 m/s, which was slower than at baseline (p = 0.0014).

- **Changes in shear wave velocity during anesthetic induction**: The grey circles represent means, and the bars represent standard deviations. At opioid-induced rigidity, the velocity was faster than at baseline. During complete muscle relaxation, the velocity was slower than at baseline (✱✱ p < 0.01 versus baseline condition).

- **Significant factors affecting muscle tone**: To estimate the effects of the coefficients on the SWV and to counter selection bias, three multiple regression models were used at each time point. Female sex was an independent factor in decreasing the SWVs during both opioid-induced rigidity and complete muscle relaxation. Additionally, a higher body mass index was an independent factor in decreasing the SWVs during baseline, opioid-induced rigidity, and complete muscle relaxation.

### Rhabdomyolysis: a review [^117SPTVb]. Muscle & Nerve (2002). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterized by the breakdown of skeletal muscle, leading to the leakage of muscle contents. It is often accompanied by myoglobinuria, and if severe enough, can result in acute renal failure with potentially life-threatening metabolic disturbances. A wide range of inherited and acquired disorders can affect muscle membranes, ion channels, and energy supply, leading to rhabdomyolysis.

- **Pathophysiology**: Common pathophysiological mechanisms among these causes include an uncontrolled rise in free intracellular calcium and activation of calcium-dependent proteases. These processes lead to the destruction of myofibrils and lysosomal digestion of muscle fiber contents.

Recent advances in molecular genetics and muscle enzyme histochemistry may facilitate a specific metabolic diagnosis in many patients with idiopathic rhabdomyolysis.

### Ernest Starling and the discovery of secretin [^116cFUUD]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

The demonstration by Bayliss and Starling that acid liberates a chemical messenger from the cells of the duodenal and jejunal mucosa and that this, by traveling through the blood, excites the pancreas to secrete revolutionized physiology. It subsequently provided the impetus to establish endocrinology as a specialist field in medicine. Together, their contributions to physiology covered a vast sphere of knowledge, ranging from hormones to the heart and from enzymes to osmotic forces. Every subject that they studied was augmented by their efforts, and their lucid scientific writing brought both clarity and organization to the field of physiological endeavor throughout the world. Both contributed in a very definite way to crystallizing physiology into a rigorous scientific discipline and their respective texts, "Principles of General Physiology" (Bayliss) and "Principles of Human Physiology" (Starling), established a framework of thought that for decades remained the lodestar of physiological science. As mentors, they devoted themselves to aspirant physiologists from all parts of the world, and their dedication to the activities of the Physiological Society in London was legendary. Indeed, from 1896, when Starling became secretary, until the death of Bayliss in 1924, the two ran this august body in one capacity or another for more than a quarter of a century. There is little doubt that the felicitous collaboration that led to the discovery of secretin and the introduction of the concept of chemical messengers represents an advance that not only revolutionized physiological science.

### Side-effects are often a curse. Can they also be a blessing [^114ivM5J]. Brain (2024). Low credibility.

Whether and how the findings can be translated to clinical practice remains to be determined. Side effects are a key concern in any treatment context, and they must not be ignored in the hope of enhancing treatment effectiveness. Instead, the authors suggest actively supporting patients' perception that side effects are a sign that the body is responding to the treatment in the desired way. This 'positive framing' of side effects has been shown not only to reduce the burden of side effects, but also to enhance the desired treatment outcomes. This approach may be particularly promising in cases where there is a significant delay between the onset of a side effect and the desired therapeutic effect, making it difficult for the patient to establish a causal connection between the two events.

In their study, Schenk and colleagues provided concrete information about the expected onset of the effects ('takes effect in as little as 3 min') to allow for precise temporal expectations. More controversially, it could be debated whether — similar to the use of active placebos — mild and benign side effects could deliberately be introduced and coupled with a treatment to try to improve therapeutic outcomes. This approach has yet to be systematically tested in clinical applications, due in part to the substantial ethical implications.

To be able to use side effects as a strategy to enhance treatment outcomes in a safe and ethical manner, it is essential to understand their limitations.

### Hypothermia-induced rhabdomyolysis: A case report [^115jLxtd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A 29-year-old man was lost in the bush with minimal clothing for almost two days.

- **Case report**: The patient in this case developed rhabdomyolysis with subsequent acute kidney injury. He was treated with passive warming and intravenous fluids, leading to the resolution of the kidney injury.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** Patients who present with hypothermia may develop rhabdomyolysis with subsequent acute kidney injury. If not identified, renal failure may develop. This is easily preventable if the practitioner is aware of the possible consequences of cold exposure, orders the appropriate tests, and administers corrective treatment.

### Consciousness and the dying brain [^112jCc8x]. Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

A multidimensional framework for consciousness includes near-death or near-death-like experiences. Abbreviations used: IFT, isolated forearm test; NREM, non–rapid eye movement; REM, rapid eye movement. This framework is used with permission from Elsevier Science & Technology Journals as referenced in Martial et al; permission conveyed through Copyright Clearance Center, Inc.

In the study of consciousness, the so-called explanatory gap refers to how we bridge the physical properties of the brain with the first-person feelings of experience. The explanatory gap exists even assuming a perfectly healthy brain and only a single pixel of subjectivity, such as the experience of a single photon in an otherwise dark room. However, this gap widens considerably in the case of near-death experiences. During these experiences, the brain is hypofunctional in the context of near-death physiology, while the subjective experience is seemingly among the richest accessible to humans. This is precisely why some posit that there is no scientific bridge that can cross the even wider explanatory gap represented by near-death experiences.

- **Neural correlates of consciousness**: The modern science of consciousness emerged in the early 1990s. One of the first formal research programs to be proposed in this new science was the identification of the minimal set of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient for a specific conscious percept, commonly referred to as the "neural correlates of consciousness". Although there has been considerable progress over the past three decades, major controversies remain unresolved. Most notably, there is still active debate as to whether…

### Quantification of muscle tone by using shear wave velocity during an anaesthetic induction: A prospective observational study [^113Trgh1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Low credibility.

The quantitative assessment of muscle stiffness or weakness is essential for medical care. Shear wave elastography is a non-invasive ultrasound method that provides quantitative information on the elasticity of soft tissue. However, a universal velocity scale for quantification has not been developed. The aim of the study is to determine the shear wave velocities of the abdominal muscle during anesthetic induction and identify methods to cancel the effects of confounders for future development in the quantitative assessment of muscle tone using the universal scale.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 75 adult patients undergoing elective surgery with ASA-PS I - III between December 2018 and March 2021. We measured and calculated the shear wave velocity (SWV) before and after opioid administration (i.e. the baseline at rest and opioid-induced rigidity condition), and after muscle relaxant administration (i.e. zero reference condition). The SWV value was adjusted for subcutaneous fat thickness using our proposed corrections. The SWVs after the adjustment were compared among the values in baseline, rigidity, and relaxation using one-way repeated-measures ANOVA and post hoc Tukey-Kramer test. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. UMIN Clinical Trials Registry identifier UMIN000034692, registered on October 30, 2018.

- **Results**: The SWVs in the baseline, opioid-induced rigidity, and muscle relaxation conditions after the adjustment were 2.08 ± 0.48, 2.41 ± 0.60, and 1.79 ± 0.30 m/s, respectively (p < 0.001 for all comparisons).

### Percocet [^113MBJN8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Overdosage**: Following an acute overdosage, toxicity may result from the oxycodone or the acetaminophen.

- **Clinical presentation**: Acute overdosage with oxycodone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.

	- **Acetaminophen**: Dose-dependent potentially fatal hepatic necrosis is the most serious adverse effect of acetaminophen overdosage. Renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma, and coagulation defects may also occur. Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose may include nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and general malaise. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post-ingestion.

- **Treatment of overdose**:

- **Oxycodone**: In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures.

### Normal perinatal and paediatric postmortem magnetic resonance imaging appearances [^112CCwLT]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Changes in positioning after death

Some of the most frequent changes encountered when imaging after death relate to body position, including slumping or organ shifting (soft tissue laxity) and rigor mortis in non-foetal cases. Fixed flexion deformities due to stiffening of the limbs and joints in rigor mortis make positioning the body appropriately for imaging challenging, particularly for postmortem paediatric radiography. Some methods of overcoming this involve imaging in different positions or taking multiple radiographs at different angles to highlight different aspects of the long bones. Apparent fixed flexion deformities on both postmortem radiography and postmortem magnetic resonance imaging can be misinterpreted as arthrogryphosis multiplex congenita and vice versa, whereas oligohydramnios and rigor mortis in otherwise normal fetuses can give similar appearances. Therefore, it is essential that imaging findings are interpreted in conjunction with the clinical history and macroscopic external appearances.

With increased soft tissue laxity and muscle relaxation in the period immediately after death, body organs often slump or shift into non-physiological positions due to the effect of gravity. Imaging bodies in slumped positions can lead to significant misinterpretation of normal anatomy. This can lead to some organs being difficult to identify accurately as they are not in their normal anatomical position (e.g. the spleen or proximal duodenum, suggesting malrotation), or simply make accurate assessment of the mediastinal structures difficult secondary to shifts in position.

### Skeletal and cardiac α-actin isoforms differently modulate myosin cross-bridge formation and myofibre force production [^116Qb3bw]. Human Molecular Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Multiple congenital myopathies, including nemaline myopathy, can arise due to mutations in the ACTA1 gene encoding skeletal muscle α-actin. The main characteristics of ACTA1 null mutations (absence of skeletal muscle α-actin) are generalized skeletal muscle weakness and premature death. A mouse model (ACTC(Co)/KO) mimicking these conditions has been successfully rescued by the transgenic over-expression of cardiac α-actin in skeletal muscles using the ACTC gene. Nevertheless, myofibres from ACTC(Co)/KO animals generate less force than normal myofibres (20–25% less). To understand the underlying mechanisms, we have undertaken a detailed functional study of myofibres from ACTC(Co)/KO rodents.

Mechanical and X-ray diffraction pattern analyses of single membrane-permeabilized myofibres showed, upon maximal Ca(2+) activation and under rigor conditions, lower stiffness and disrupted actin-layer line reflections in ACTC(Co)/KO compared to age-matched wild-types. These results demonstrate that in ACTC(Co)/KO myofibres, the presence of cardiac α-actin instead of skeletal muscle α-actin alters actin conformational changes upon activation. This alteration finely modulates the strain of individual actomyosin interactions and overall lowers myofibre force production.

Taken together, the present findings provide novel primordial information about actin isoforms, their functional differences, and should be considered when designing gene therapies for ACTA1-based congenital myopathies.

### Ten reasons why we should not use severity scores as entry criteria for clinical trials or in our treatment decisions [^116Wtd4q]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Severity scores such as Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II have been advocated as entry criteria for clinical trials and in clinical decision-making. We present ten reasons why we believe this approach is not appropriate and may even be detrimental.

- **Data sources**: Available relevant literature from authors' personal databases and personal knowledge of past and future clinical trial development.

- **Data synthesis**: Severity scores were not designed for use in individual patients or for therapeutic decision-making for specific interventions. Difficulties with the time window needed to calculate these scores and the need to administer therapies early further limit their use in this context. The complex nature of the scores makes it difficult to use them at the bedside, and there is considerable interobserver variability in score calculation. Inclusion of chronic health and age points in severity scores may prevent younger, previously healthy patients, with similar acute physiological dysfunction and therefore total lower severity scores, from trial inclusion or from receiving therapies that may be beneficial.

- **Conclusions**: We believe severity of illness scores are poor surrogates for risk stratification and should not be used as a criterion for patient enrollment into clinical trials or as the basis for individual treatment decisions.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis in the athlete: A clinical review [^1132yyR1]. Sports Health (2014). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for rhabdomyolysis, specifically in the context of exertional rhabdomyolysis, the AOSSM 2014 guidelines recommend considering the following patients to be at low risk:

- **Rapid clinical recovery and CK normalization**: Athletes who show quick recovery and normalization of creatine kinase (CK) levels after exercise restrictions.

- **Sufficient fitness or training history**: Athletes who are sufficiently fit or well-trained with a history of intense training or exercise.

- **No personal or family history**: Athletes with no personal or family history of rhabdomyolysis.

- **Existence of group cases**: Instances where other group or team-related cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis occurred during the same exercise sessions.

- **Concomitant viral illness**: Suspected or documented presence of a concurrent viral illness that may contribute to the condition.

- **Drug or supplement ingestion**: Ingestion of a drug or dietary supplement that likely contributed to the development of exertional rhabdomyolysis.

### Standards and methodological rigor in pulmonary arterial hypertension preclinical and translational research [^1124SohS]. Circulation Research (2018). Low credibility.

Despite advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology and management of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), significant therapeutic gaps remain for this devastating disease. Few innovative therapies beyond the traditional pathways of endothelial dysfunction have reached clinical trial phases in PAH. Although there are inherent limitations in the currently available models of PAH, the leaky pipeline of innovative therapies relates, in part, to flawed preclinical research methodology, including lack of rigor in trial design, incomplete invasive hemodynamic assessment, and lack of careful translational studies that replicate randomized controlled trials in humans with attention to adverse effects and benefits.

- **Prespecified eligibility criteria**: Rigorous methodology should include the use of prespecified eligibility criteria, sample sizes that permit valid statistical analysis, randomization, blinded assessment of standardized outcomes, and transparent reporting of results.
- **Preclinical study design**: Better design and implementation of preclinical studies can minimize inherent flaws in the models of PAH, reduce the risk of bias, and enhance external validity and our ability to distinguish truly promising therapies from many false-positive or overstated leads. Ideally, preclinical studies should use advanced imaging, study several preclinical pulmonary hypertension models, or correlate rodent and human findings. Additionally, they should consider the fate of the right ventricle, which is the major determinant of prognosis in human PAH. Although these principles are widely endorsed, empirical evidence suggests that such rigor is often lacking.

### Heat-related illness [^1144eAqD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). High credibility.

Environmental exposure to high temperatures can result in abnormalities ranging from mild heat exhaustion to heat stroke with multiorgan system failure. An understanding of the mechanisms of thermoregulation and how these mechanisms fail under extreme heat stress is critical for managing patients with elevated body temperature in the emergency department.

### Physiology is vital to precision medicine in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis [^113gKMmC]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

As with molecular markers, trials are required to confirm clinically relevant treatment benefits in subsets of patients defined by these physiological markers. Only those physiological characteristics that reflect the mechanisms driving injury and outcomes are relevant to personalizing care. Many physiological markers do not predict the relative benefit or harm of treatment, even those that usefully stratify the risk of death. For example, the benefit of lung-protective ventilation is unrelated to the severity of hypoxemia. Lung-protective ventilation in any given patient may be associated with worsened oxygenation but improved mortality, and the effect of lowering mortality is independent of the severity of hypoxemia. In contrast, elastance and driving pressure, which reflect mechanistically relevant lung stress and strain, provide more appropriate targets for personalization.

The uses of physiology and physiological responsiveness for precision medicine in a prospective trial design have already been described. The recent multiplatform trial of therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) provides an instructive example of using both physiology and biomarkers in trial design for precision medicine. At the outset, the investigators hypothesized that treatment effects may vary according to both the patient's physiological state (severely ill, requiring ICU-level organ support, vs. moderately ill, not requiring organ support) and baseline D-dimer (a biomarker hypothesized to reflect hypercoagulation from COVID-19).

### Interpreting bruises at necropsy [^113J7vze]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The accurate interpretation of bruising at necropsy is essential to understanding how a victim has been injured and assists the pathologist in a reliable reconstruction of the events leading to death. It is essential not only to assess the mechanism of production of a bruise, taking into account the type of impacting surface and the magnitude of force used, but also to estimate when the injury was caused. An account is given of the various methods used in the examination of bruises, particularly with respect to aging, as well as the factors that may affect their appearance. Differentiation from artefacts resulting from postmortem changes is also discussed in some detail.

### Evaluating the strength of genetic results: Risks and responsibilities [^114Yrzd3]. PLoS Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

To be clear, we do not endorse a loosening of rigor for human genetic studies; to the contrary, as genome sequencing becomes more accessible, the risk of false positive results only increases, and we fully support using statistical frameworks for evaluating claims of causality, linkage, and association whenever possible. Furthermore, when clinical, potentially life-altering decisions are being made, transparency, rigor, and precision of terminology are essential; these points are what motivate the expression of concern. At the same time, analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships is not an end, but a means to understand basic biology and investigate pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie human disease. Examples of the latter effort, in which the potential impact of aggregate genotype-phenotype relationships may go beyond the identity of a specific causal variant, include autism, Hirschsprung's disease, and congenital heart disease. Perhaps the same will be true of MS.

### International perspective on the diagnosis of death [^113gatQD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

There is a growing medical consensus on a unifying concept of human death. All human deaths involve the irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness, combined with the irreversible loss of the capacity to breathe. Death, therefore, results from the irreversible loss of these functions in the brain. This paper outlines three sets of criteria for diagnosing human death. Each set of criteria clearly establishes the irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness, combined with the irreversible loss of the capacity to breathe. The most appropriate set of criteria to use is determined by the circumstances in which the medical practitioner is called upon to diagnose death.

- **Somatic criteria**: Features visible on external inspection of the corpse.
- **Circulatory criteria**: Applied after cardiorespiratory arrest.
- **Neurological criteria**: Used in patients in a coma on mechanical ventilation.

These represent a diagnostic standard in which the medical profession and the public can have complete confidence. This review unites authors from Australia, Canada, and the UK and examines the medical criteria that were recommended in 2012 to diagnose human death.

### Revonto [^112Cqeao]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical pharmacology: In isolated nerve-muscle preparation, dantrolene sodium has been shown to produce relaxation by affecting the contractile response of the muscle at a site beyond the myoneural junction. In skeletal muscle, dantrolene sodium dissociates the excitation-contraction coupling, probably by interfering with the release of Ca++ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The administration of intravenous dantrolene sodium to human volunteers is associated with loss of grip strength and weakness in the legs, as well as subjective CNS complaints (see also PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients). Information concerning the passage of dantrolene sodium across the blood-brain barrier is not available.

In the anesthetic-induced malignant hyperthermia syndrome, evidence points to an intrinsic abnormality of skeletal muscle tissue. In affected humans, it has been postulated that "triggering agents" (e.g. general anesthetics and depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents) produce a change within the cell which results in an elevated myoplasmic calcium. This elevated myoplasmic calcium activates acute cellular catabolic processes that cascade to the malignant hyperthermia crisis.

It is hypothesized that the addition of dantrolene sodium to the "triggered" malignant hyperthermic muscle cell reestablishes a normal level of ionized calcium in the myoplasm. Inhibition of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by dantrolene sodium reestablishes the myoplasmic calcium equilibrium, increasing the percentage of bound calcium. In this way, physiological, metabolic, and biochemical changes are controlled.

### International guideline development for the determination of death [^11419qUW]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This report summarizes the results of the first phase in developing international guidelines for death determination, focusing on the biology of death and the dying process. This was developed by an invitational forum of international content experts and representatives from numerous professional societies.

- **Results and conclusions**: Precise terminology was developed to improve clarity in death discussions and debates. Critical events in the physiological sequences leading to the cessation of neurological and/or circulatory function were constructed. It was agreed that death determination is primarily clinical, and recommendations for preconditions, confounding factors, minimum clinical standards, and additional testing were made. A single operational definition of human death was developed: "The permanent loss of capacity for consciousness and all brainstem functions as a consequence of permanent cessation of circulation or catastrophic brain injury".

To complete the project, in the next phase, a broader group of international stakeholders will develop clinical practice guidelines based on comprehensive reviews and grading of the existing evidence.

### Tafinlar [^1137rsJd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity, complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure, can occur with Tafinlar. The incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased when Tafinlar is administered with trametinib compared with Tafinlar as a single agent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Tafinlar monotherapy (adult)**: In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], fever (serious and non-serious) occurred in 30% of patients. Approximately 13% of these patients experienced three or more discrete episodes. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors, or chills occurred in 6% of patients.

- **Tafinlar administered with trametinib (adult)**: In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], fever occurred in 58% of patients. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure occurred in 5% of patients. Fever was complicated by hypotension in 4%, dehydration in 3%, syncope in 2%, renal failure in 1%, and severe chills/rigors in less than 1% of patients.

### The preconditioning phenomenon: A tool for the scientist or a clinical reality [^117E81e5]. Circulation Research (2000). Low credibility.

The possibility that an innate mechanism of myocardial protection might be inducible in the human heart has generated considerable excitement and enthusiastic research. The potential to enhance myocardial resistance to ischemic injury in patients suffering the consequences of coronary artery disease has led to studies with more direct clinical relevance. However, in common with many other areas of clinical interest based on advances in basic scientific understanding, early enthusiasm may be disproportionate to ultimate therapeutic significance.

There can be little doubt that our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion injury has been enhanced significantly by the plethora of research stimulated by interest in endogenous myocardial protection. Direct extrapolation of observations in the laboratory to the cardiology clinic or operating theater is tempting but should be avoided. The results of recent clinical experiments that suggest that preconditioning can protect against ischemia, although encouraging, should be interpreted cautiously, with particular attention to the limitations of the end points available. A reasoned evaluation of recent research should prevent unrealistic expectations and allow improved design of future trials so that this potent adaptive phenomenon can be exploited to its maximum potential.

### Pathogenesis and treatment of renal dysfunction in rhabdomyolysis [^114BLNZp]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a major cause of acute renal failure, and recent experimental data have provided a better understanding of the pathophysiology of renal dysfunction. Renal failure results from renal vasoconstriction, tubular damage caused by oxidant injury, and possibly tubular obstruction. Recent studies have provided greater insight into the rationale behind therapy and potential treatment strategies. This review aims to summarize the understanding of the causes, pathogenesis, and treatment of renal failure caused by rhabdomyolysis.
