## Question

A 62-year-old man with a history of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis presents to the nephrology clinic. He has progressive renal dysfunction and now has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 8 mL/min/1.73 m². He reports increasing fatigue, pruritus, and mild lower limb edema. Echocardiography performed last month showed mild diastolic dysfunction but no evidence of severe heart failure. His blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, and he is euvolemic on examination.

Based on current BCSH guidelines, what is the recommended management regarding renal replacement therapy for this patient?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended management regarding renal replacement therapy for a 62-year-old man with AL amyloidosis, an eGFR of 8 mL/min/1.73 m², and symptoms of fatigue and pruritus, with mild edema and no severe heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this patient meets indications for dialysis. Then, I should verify what the BCSH guideline actually says about dialysis in AL amyloidosis. Next, I will review competing guidance on timing of dialysis initiation and reconcile any differences. After that, I should consider modality selection in the context of amyloidosis and cardiac involvement. Finally, I will integrate transplant candidacy considerations and outline immediate next steps, including multidisciplinary planning and symptom-directed care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and whether dialysis is indicated now. With eGFR 8 mL/min/1.73 m² and uremic symptoms (fatigue, pruritus), this patient meets objective criteria for kidney failure replacement therapy, and the presence of symptoms pushes toward initiation rather than deferral, even though the exact eGFR threshold for symptoms varies across studies and guidelines [^868990a3] [^6f1646af].

> Wait, let me verify the BCSH position on dialysis in AL amyloidosis. The BCSH guideline explicitly recommends considering dialysis in patients with end-stage renal failure due to AL amyloidosis who do not have severe heart failure, which fits this patient's profile of advanced CKD without severe HF, so dialysis should be offered and planned now [^507b58eb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing. I initially thought to apply a general CKD principle of intent-to-defer, but that would be a mistake here because that deferral approach applies to asymptomatic patients with eGFR less than 15, not to someone with symptomatic kidney failure at eGFR 8. So I should correct that and align with symptom-driven initiation in this scenario [^abd44d7e] [^868990a3].

> I need to check modality selection next. Given mild diastolic dysfunction and the risk of hemodynamic instability with thrice-weekly hemodialysis in amyloidosis, peritoneal dialysis or home hemodialysis options (short daily or long nocturnal) are reasonable to consider to minimize intradialytic hypotension and autonomic stress. The ACC consensus supports PD or gentler HD schedules in patients with cardiorenal amyloidosis, and SAGES provides contemporary PD access guidance, so I should discuss these modalities with the patient and plan access accordingly [^f0669829] [^c4f52853].

> Next, I should review transplant candidacy, because dialysis planning should be integrated with transplant evaluation. Kidney transplantation in AL amyloidosis is reserved for carefully selected patients with minimal extrarenal disease, good performance status, and a deep hematologic response; KDIGO and ACC recommend excluding patients with significant cardiac involvement or those not in remission, so I should coordinate hematology input, assess cardiac disease thoroughly, and document candidacy status before proceeding [^4afede74] [^34a5f5e5] [^2b5ebc06].

> I will now examine immediate steps. I should confirm the diagnosis and disease burden with serum free light chains and immunofixation, stage cardiac involvement with NT-proBNP and troponin, and arrange urgent dialysis access planning (PD catheter or AV fistula) while initiating transplant evaluation in parallel if candidacy is plausible. This parallel approach is consistent with KDIGO guidance to plan for KRT when eGFR is below 15–20 or risk of KRT exceeds 40% over 2 years, which this patient clearly meets [^a49e64e6] [^e3332728].

> But wait, what if we prioritize disease-modifying therapy instead of dialysis right now? I should double-check that this would be unsafe. With eGFR 8 and uremic symptoms, delaying dialysis risks complications and does not substitute for renal replacement; moreover, rapid reduction of amyloidogenic light chains improves survival and may stabilize organ function, but that complements — rather than replaces — timely dialysis initiation in advanced kidney failure, so I should not defer dialysis solely to pursue chemotherapy [^868990a3] [^715b6404].

> Let me reconsider the final recommendation to ensure internal consistency. Based on BCSH guidance and contemporary nephrology standards, I recommend initiating renal replacement therapy now, selecting PD or a home HD modality to mitigate hemodynamic stress, and proceeding with coordinated hematology evaluation and transplant candidacy assessment. This balances symptom control, safety, and long-term outcomes in AL amyloidosis [^507b58eb] [^f0669829] [^4afede74].

---

Per BCSH guidance, **initiate dialysis now** for this patient with AL amyloidosis, eGFR 8 mL/min/1.73 m², and uremic symptoms (fatigue, pruritus) [^507b58eb], as there is no severe heart failure to contraindicate dialysis [^notfound]. BCSH supports dialysis in AL-related ESRD without severe HF, and **symptom-driven initiation is appropriate** at this eGFR [^868990a3]. Concurrently, **evaluate for kidney transplantation** if hematologic response is achieved and extrarenal disease is limited [^9b37fc6d] [^4afede74].

---

## Indications for renal replacement therapy in AL amyloidosis

BCSH recommends **dialysis in AL patients with ESRD who do not have severe HF** [^507b58eb]; this patient fits that profile. General CKD guidance supports **symptom-based initiation** when eGFR is 5–10 mL/min/1.73 m², which aligns with this case [^868990a3].

---

## Timing of dialysis initiation

Although some guidelines support deferring dialysis in asymptomatic patients with eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² [^abd44d7e], this patient has **uremic symptoms** (fatigue, pruritus) and eGFR 8 mL/min/1.73 m², so **immediate initiation is warranted** [^868990a3].

---

## Dialysis modality selection

BCSH does not specify a modality; selection should be individualized. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is often preferred in AL amyloidosis because it avoids hemodynamic stress and is better tolerated in patients with autonomic dysfunction or cardiac involvement [^f0669829]. Hemodialysis remains appropriate if PD is contraindicated or unavailable, with careful attention to volume and hemodynamics [^66ff668c].

---

## Kidney transplantation considerations

BCSH advises that **kidney transplantation be considered in selected patients** with good performance status, minimal extrarenal disease, and hematologic remission [^9b37fc6d]. KDIGO similarly recommends excluding patients with significant extrarenal involvement and requiring hematologic remission before transplant [^4afede74] [^425f3150]. Given this patient's mild cardiac involvement and lack of severe HF, **transplant evaluation should proceed in parallel** with dialysis planning if hematologic response is achieved [^34a5f5e5].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Initiate dialysis now | - eGFR 8 mL/min/1.73 m² <br/> - Uremic symptoms <br/> - No severe HF [^507b58eb] [^868990a3] |
| Consider PD as first-line modality | Better hemodynamic tolerance in AL amyloidosis [^f0669829] |
| Evaluate for kidney transplantation | - Good performance status <br/> - Minimal extrarenal disease <br/> - Hematologic remission required [^9b37fc6d] [^4afede74] |

---

## Conclusion and next steps

Per BCSH, **initiate dialysis now** for this patient with AL amyloidosis, eGFR 8 mL/min/1.73 m², and uremic symptoms, as there is no severe HF to contraindicate dialysis [^507b58eb]. Concurrently, **evaluate for kidney transplantation** if hematologic remission is achieved and extrarenal disease is limited [^9b37fc6d] [^4afede74].

Nephrology — management impact on kidney manifestations of amyloidosis states that in AL amyloidosis, eradication of the amyloidogenic light chain with anti-plasma-cell therapy often leads to improvement in kidney manifestations; proteinuria typically decreases progressively over many months to several years after a hematologic complete response or very good partial response and can resolve fully if the hematologic response is sustained; although GFR usually does not improve, kidney function often stabilizes after amyloidogenic light chain production is halted.

Ig light chain amyloidosis is a protein misfolding disease capable of causing multiorgan failure. Organ failure can be stopped by reducing the production of Ig light chain. The current study by Rezk et al. found that even patients with advanced chronic kidney disease can benefit if the serum free light chain can be substantially reduced within the first 3 months. This, if confirmed, can have a huge impact in the management of these patients.

Nephrologists' multidisciplinary role and kidney replacement therapy in amyloidosis — Nephrologists provide important contributions to care for patients with AL or ATTR amyloidosis who have amyloid nephropathy or reduced kidney function due to amyloid cardiomyopathy, including managing nephrotic syndrome and chronic kidney disease, interpreting serum free light chain and cardiac biomarkers in kidney impairment, dosing drugs by kidney function, determining need for kidney biopsy, assessing suitability for kidney transplantation, and preparing for dialysis and modality selection. Nephrologists also should be involved in decisions about kidney biopsy and in preparation for kidney replacement therapy. For patients who progress to end-stage kidney disease, kidney replacement therapy can be provided with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or, in selected patients, kidney transplantation, and in severe cardiomyopathy peritoneal dialysis, short daily hemodialysis, or long nocturnal hemodialysis may be better tolerated than conventional thrice-weekly hemodialysis.

Introduction

Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a result of extracellular deposition of pathologic, insoluble fibrils that are formed from abnormal light chains (LCs) or LC fragments. It is a systemic disease that affects various organs and is associated with an underlying clonal B-cell disorder (most commonly plasmacytic). The accumulation of amyloid fibrils disrupting tissue structure and direct toxicity from circulating precursors eventually leads to organ failure and death. Approximately 57–80% of AL amyloidosis patients have renal involvement at presentation, and up to ~40% of these patients require renal replacement therapy during the course of their disease. A renal staging system for the prediction of ESRD using universally available measurements (i.e. proteinuria and eGFR) was validated in patients with AL amyloidosis and being used in clinical practice.

Until the mid-1990s, the treatment of AL amyloidosis was ineffective, resulting in a median overall survival (OS) of only 12–18 months. Over the last two decades, newer therapeutic regimens directed towards the toxic plasma cell clone have become available, including high dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation (HDM/SCT), proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, ixazomib), immunomodulatory drugs (pomalidomide, lenalidomide, thalidomide) and monoclonal antibodies (daratumumab). Due to these breakthroughs in treatment, there is now a higher frequency of complete hematologic response (CR) or very good partial response (VGPR), which has translated into improved organ response and OS.

### Comprehensive review of AL amyloidosis: some practical recommendations [^68dbef4d]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Worsening heart failure is another toxicity that may be encountered during transplantation and about 5% of patients will have a reduction in EF of > 10%, which increases the 100-day mortality. Multiple factors contribute to the heart failure risk during peritransplant in this population including electrolyte imbalance, medications, fluid overload, arrhythmia, temporary cessation of cardiac medications, sepsis, and exacerbation of organ dysfunction during transplant. It is worth noting that standard heart failure treatments such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and/or ACE inhibitors, cannot be used for worsening heart failure management in this patient population and so should be avoided.

Another important toxicity that could complicate ASCT is ESRD. In a study examining the association between acute renal failure and mortality in AL amyloidosis during ASCT, the medical records of 408 ASCT patients between 1996 and 2010 were examined. Dialysis was required by 72 (18%) patients. Eight patients started dialysis > 30 days prior to ASCT (Group II), 36 started ± 30 days after ASCT (Group III) and 28 initiated dialysis > 1 month after ASCT (Group IV) whereby patients who were never dialyzed were assigned to Group I. Median OS was not reached in Groups I and II but was 7 months in Group III and 48.5 months in Group IV (p < 0.001). TRM was observed in 44.4% of the patients in Group III, 6-fold higher than the next highest group with a TRM of only 3.6% (p < 0.001). The most common causes of TRM were cardiac and sepsis. In the multivariate analysis, only hypoalbuminemia (< 2.5 g/dL, p < 0.001) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.001) were independently associated with starting dialysis within 30 days of ASCT. The risk of dialysis increased exponentially with increasing the number of risk factors present. If none or 1 factor was present, risk of dialysis was 2% and 10%, respectively. Nonetheless, the presence of both, hypoalbuminemia and eGFR < 40 mL/min resulted in a 44% risk of dialysis. As such, screening with serum albumin and eGFR may reduce the risk. Unfortunately, these two risk factors are also risk factors for progression to ESRD as part of the natural progression of AL amyloidosis. Thus, the decision on whether to proceed to ASCT is a difficult one. It is important to note though, that patients are likely to experience improved renal function as the disease burden decreases post induction, then making them eligible for subsequent treatment with ASCT.

### Revised renal stratification and progression models for predicting long-term renal outcomes in immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis [^19a430ae]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Renal prognosis in light-chain amyloidosis (AL) is determined by categorizing patients into three renal stages at diagnosis and assessing Renal Response or Renal Progression following chemotherapy after 6 months. We evaluated, in a test (N = 1935) cohort of patients with renal AL amyloidosis who were followed for a median of 95 months, a modified 4-stage model where Renal Stage 2 was sub-categorized according to preserved (2A) or reduced (2B) estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR). A hybrid model for evaluation of Renal Progression was also introduced, using an eGFR cut-off of 30ml/min/1.73 m2. These models were compared with existing models; namely those of Palladini and Kastritis, and results were validated in a multicenter cohort (N = 438). The risk of progression to renal replacement therapy (RRT) increased progressively across all Renal Stages of the revised staging model (Hazard ratio [HR]: 3.25, 5.13, 10.66 for Stages 2A, 2B and 3 respectively vs Stage 1, each p.

### Outcome in renal AL amyloidosis after chemotherapy… [^9aa2359c]. ASCO (2011). Low credibility.

Abstract Purpose Chemotherapy in AL amyloidosis is associated with improved survival, but its effect on renal outcome has not been examined systematically. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of chemotherapy on clinical outcome among patients with renal AL amyloidosis. Patients and Methods We evaluated factors influencing survival among 923 patients with renal AL amyloidosis observed during a 21-year period, including 221 patients who became dialysis dependent. Factors associated with renal outcome were analyzed, including serum free light chain response to chemotherapy using a simple subtraction formula applicable to all stages of chronic kidney disease. Patient survival and graft survival were analyzed in 21 renal transplantation recipients. 1Systemic AL amyloidosis is caused by deposition of fibrils derived from monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains and is the most common and serious type.

2Organ involvement and clinical presentation of AL amyloidosis are heterogeneous, but renal dysfunction, which frequently progresses to end-stage renal disease, is the most common clinical manifestation of the disease, and diagnosis of AL amyloidosis is commonly obtained through renal histology.
3. We report here an analysis of clinical outcome among 923 patients with renal AL amyloidosis who were observed at a single national center over a period of 21 years. Factors associated with renal outcome were identified, including response to chemotherapy as assessed rigorously by serial serum free light chain assays. We report unprecedented survival among 221 patients who commenced dialysis and compelling evidence supporting renal transplantation in selected patients.

Patients underwent prospective protocolized assessments every 6 months at the NAC, with each assessment comprising clinical evaluation, tests of amyloidotic organ function including biochemical evaluation of renal and liver function, echocardiography, SAP scintigraphy. 23assessment of hematologic disease by serum FLC assay, and storage of serum samples at −30°C. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated according to Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines. 24For all patients whose baseline visit to the NAC was after January 2007, serial N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide concentration was prospectively determined, 25and in patients who were first evaluated before this time, NT-proBNP was determined retrospectively from available archived serum samples. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Royal Free Hospital, and patients provided informed consent.

Healthy, polyclonal serum FLC concentrations increase progressively through advancing stages of chronic kidney disease. Assessment of Renal Outcome Risk factors for progression to dialysis were analyzed among the 752 patients with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≥ 15 mL/min but not among the remaining 171 patients. A separate analysis of factors influencing change in renal function from baseline according to the amyloidosis international consensus criteria and including both renal response and renal progression was undertaken in all 429 patients with follow-up renal data. Patients who died or started dialysis within 6 months of their baseline NAC visit and patients in whom there was no creatinine or proteinuria measurement recorded after 6 months from baseline were excluded from this analysis.

### Renal outcomes in patients with AL amyloidosis: prognostic factors, renal response and the impact of therapy [^014309c3]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

A staging system for patients with renal AL amyloidosis, based on eGFR (< 50 ml/min/1.73 m 2) and proteinuria (≥ 5 g/day) at diagnosis, as well as criteria for renal progression (≥ 25% eGFR reduction) and response (≥ 30% reduction of proteinuria without renal progression) were recently proposed. We validated these criteria in a cohort of 125 patients with renal AL amyloidosis, mostly treated with bortezomib or lenalidomide. We confirmed the prognostic value of the renal staging system but also identified the limitations of renal progression criteria which are based only on eGFR reduction. We identified the ratio of 24h proteinuria to eGFR as a sensitive marker of renal risk which also accounts for changes in both proteinuria and eGFR: 24h proteinuria/eGFR ratio < 30 (in mg/ml/min/1.73 m 2) was associated with a 2-year progression to dialysis rate of 0% compared to 9% for a ratio of 31–99 and 35% for a ratio ≥ 100 (P < .001). In landmark analysis, patients who achieved a reduction of this ratio by at least 25% or ≤ 100 (if initially > 100) at 3 months had a 2-year progression to dialysis of 0% vs 24% for patients who either did not reduce to or still had a ratio > 100 (P = 0.001); similar results were obtained by applying the same criteria at 6 months; thus, the evaluation of treatment effect on renal function may be identified early. Furthermore, primary bortezomib-based therapy was more effective than lenalidomide-based therapy, in terms of renal outcomes, especially in patients at intermediate renal risk, but without affecting overall survival.

In conclusion, we reported the first case of renal limited amyloidosis secondary to AL amyloidosis. We hope that early recognition of this unusual localised presentation of a AL amyloidosis and its poor response to conventional treatment can alert the nephrologist to the potential existence of this challenging condition. A faithful monitoring of the patient' serum plasma paraprotein status and effective proteinuria reduction should be incorporated as the main stay of treatment.

AL amyloidosis — hematologic and organ response criteria are defined as follows: Complete response (CR) requires absence of amyloidogenic light chains defined by negative SIFE and UIFE plus either a FLC ratio within the reference range or an uninvolved FLC concentration greater than the involved FLC concentration with or without an abnormal FLC ratio; very good partial response (VGPR) is dFLC < 40 mg/L; partial response (PR) is dFLC decrease ≥ 50%; and no response (NR) is dFLC decrease < 50%. Organ responses are defined as cardiac: decrease in NT-proBNP by > 30% and < 300 ng/L (if baseline NT-proBNP > 650 ng/L); renal: at least 30% decrease in proteinuria or drop below 0.5 g/24 h in the absence of kidney progression (defined as a > 25% decrease in eGFR); and hepatic: 50% decrease in abnormal alkaline phosphatase value or decrease in radiographic liver size by ≥ 2 cm. On-page definitions specify dFLC = difference between involved and uninvolved FLCs; eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate; FLC = free light chain; NT-proBNP = N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide; SIFE = serum immunofixation electrophoresis; and UIFE = urine immunofixation electrophoresis.

Timing of therapy (CPG 1.3) — initiation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is based on the assumption that overall kidney function correlates with GFR, and caregivers should be alert to signs of declining health and initiate KRT earlier in such patients; they should consider that dialysis therapy is not innocuous and does not replace all functions of the kidney and that HD-related hypotension may accelerate the loss of RKF. Even when GFR is greater than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, individual uraemic manifestations may warrant consideration, but these considerations necessitate conservative management until GFR decreases to less than 15 mL/min/ 1.73 m2, unless there are specific indications to initiate dialysis therapy. Thus, the recommended timing is a compromise designed to maximize patient QOL while avoiding complications, with theoretical considerations supporting initiation at approximately 10 mL/min/1.73 m2; in 2003, mean estimated GFR at initiation was 9.8 mL/min/ 1.73 m2, with lower average values (~7 to 9 mL/min/1.73 m2) for young and middle-aged adults.

In assessing treatment effectiveness, the target response for most patients should be at least a VGPR. In those with a low presenting dFLC of 20–50 mg/L, a target response should be a dFLC < 10 mg/L. If a patient has a serum M-spike (true for ~50% of patients), this can help in assessing response, especially in those with a low level of circulating light chains where assessing response becomes very challenging. A retrospective analysis of 716 patients, 73% of which had a measurable M-spike before ASCT, found a measurable M-spike prior to ASCT an independent negative predictor of OS and PFS. In patients with renal failure where the free light chains are cleared by the kidneys, it is sometimes hard to assess the response and a bone marrow biopsy may help to see if a deep remission has been achieved.

### Cardiorenal AL amyloidosis: risk stratification and outcomes based upon cardiac and renal biomarkers [^3d670cf1]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Systemic AL amyloidosis is a cause of type 5 cardiorenal syndrome. Response to treatment is currently reported according to organ-specific amyloidosis consensus criteria (ACC), which are not validated in cardiorenal AL amyloidosis. Of 1000 patients prospectively enrolled into the UK ALchemy study, 318 (32%) had combined cardiac and renal amyloidotic organ dysfunction at diagnosis, among whom 199 (63%) died; median survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 18.5 months. Fifty (16%) patients required renal replacement therapy (RRT). At diagnosis, independent predictors of death and dialysis were N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) > 8500 ng/l (hazard ratio [HR] 3.30, P < 0.001; HR 3.00, P < 0.001), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (HR 1.89, P = 0.011; HR 6.37, P < 0.001). At 6 months, an increase in NT-proBNP of > 30% and a reduction in eGFR of ≥ 25% were independent predictors of death (HR 2.17, P = 0.009) and dialysis (HR 3.07, P = 0.002), respectively. At 12 months, an increase in NT-proBNP > 30% was highly predictive of death (HR 3.67, P < 0.001) and dialysis (HR 2.85, P = 0.010), whereas ACC renal response was predictive of neither. Cardiorenal AL amyloidosis is associated with high early mortality. Outcomes are dictated by NT-proBNP and eGFR at diagnosis rather than proteinuria, and thereafter predominantly by changes in NT-proBNP concentration.

### Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis for nephrologists-treatment standard [^d8f0d313]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Amyloidosis is a group of complex diseases caused by the misfolding and aggregation of proteins into amyloid fibrils. Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is one of the most prevalent forms of amyloidosis, characterized by the gradual proliferation of light chains from plasma cell clones. A growing body of evidence has contributed to our understanding of its pathogenesis, presentation and clinical course. Increased recognition of its clinical sequelae has increased the prevalence of AL amyloidosis. Renal involvement, seen in up to 70% of cases, is particularly challenging due to its impact on quality of life and access to treatment options. Thus, early recognition of its unique sequelae, appropriate staging and a comprehensive understanding of treatment options balanced by their organ toxicities are crucial to managing this disease. We review the current treatment standards and discuss novel developments in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, outcome prediction and management of AL amyloidosis for the Nephrologist.

### Comprehensive review of AL amyloidosis: some practical recommendations [^d0ce6f27]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Risk-adapted management approach

When choosing the appropriate treatment approach, potential organ impairment needs to be considered. While the younger and fitter patient can tolerate more intense therapy, the frailer one has poor treatment tolerance and is, as such, at an increased risk of early mortality. The determination of frailty in amyloidosis is not accompanied by specific frailty scores, but short-term survival can be used as a surrogate to estimate frailty. Age and the number, type and extent of organ involvement and to a lesser extent, pre-existing comorbidities, are the main determinants of frailty in this patient population.

The Mayo Clinic investigators looked at the effect of age, among other factors, on survival in a cohort of 592 patients with mass-spectrometry-verified AL amyloidosis between 2008 and 2015. The cohort was followed up for 8 years and the median overall survival (OS) was 44 months. Dividing the patients into two age groups, < 65 years and ≥ 65 years, it was evident that the younger patients had a much better survival than those aged ≥ 65 years.

The effect of the number of organs involved on survival was investigated in the same cohort. There was a significant decrease in survival as the number of organs involved increased (p < 0.001). However, it is not just the number of organs involved in the disease, but also the type of organs involved that determine survival. For instance, comparing survival in patients with isolated cardiac involvement to those with cardiac plus multi-organ involvement, yields very similar survival curves between the two groups (p = 0.51). On the other hand, comparing survival in patients with isolated renal involvement to those with renal plus multi-organ involvement, yields significantly different survival curves (p < 0.001) whereby isolated renal involvement infers a survival advantage compared to the latter. As such, cardiac involvement is therefore the most important prognostic factor in AL amyloidosis whereby when present, irrespective of other organ involvement, influences survival. As previously discussed, several powerful staging models build on cardiac involvement to classify disease and aid treatment decisions.

Fu et al. compared 15 dialysis initiation strategies with eGFR values ranging between 4 and 19 mL/min/1.73m 2 in increments of 1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and observed that dialysis initiation at eGFR15-16 was associated with a 5.1% (95% CI 2.5% to 6.9%) lower absolute 5-year mortality risk compared with initiation at eGFR6-7. The 5.1% absolute risk difference corresponded to a mean postponement of death of 1.6 months over 5 years of follow-up. Prasad et al. included exclusively patients with peritoneal dialysis in a prospective study and found that patient survival were better in higher baseline GFR groups. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year patient survival in patients with GFR ≤ 5 ml/min/1.73 m 2 were 78.2%, 41.9%, 24.8%, and 7.8%; GFR between > 5 and 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2 were 87.2%, 64.8%, 43.1%, and 19.1%; and GFR > 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2 were 91.6%, 74.1%, 51.1%, and 20.2%; respectively. Compared to patients with GFR > 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2, both patients with GFR ≤ 5 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (HR — 3.42, 95% CI — 1.85–6.30, P = 0.000) and patients with GFR between > 5 and 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (HR — 2.16, 95% CI — 1.26–3.71, P = 0.005) had higher risk of mortality in the adjusted model.

### Graded organ response and progression criteria for kidney immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis [^6134ceca]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Kidney light chain (AL) amyloidosis is associated with a risk of progression to kidney replacement therapy (KRT) and death. Several studies have shown that a greater reduction in proteinuria following successful anticlonal therapy is associated with improved outcomes.

Objective

To validate graded kidney response criteria and their association with kidney and overall survival (OS).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, multicenter cohort was conducted at 10 referral centers for amyloidosis from 2010 to 2015 and included patients with kidney AL amyloidosis that was evaluable for kidney response and who achieved at least hematologic partial response within 12 months of diagnosis. The median follow-up was 69 (54–88) months. Data analysis was conducted in 2023.

Exposure

Four kidney response categories based on the reduction in pretreatment 24-hour urine protein (24-hour UP) levels: complete response (kidCR, 24-hour UP ≤ 200 mg), very good partial response (kidVGPR, > 60% reduction in 24-hour UP), partial response (kidPR, 31%-60% reduction), and no response (kidNR, ≤ 30% reduction). Kidney response was assessed at landmark points (6, 12, and 24 months) and best kidney response.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Cumulative incidence of progression to KRT and OS.

Results

Seven-hundred and thirty-two patients (335 women [45.8%]) were included, with a median (IQR) age of 63 (55–69) years. The median (IQR) baseline 24-hour proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate was 5.3 (2.8–8.5) g per 24 hours and 72 (48–92) mL/min/1.73m2, respectively. In a competing-risk analysis, the 5-year cumulative incidence rates of progression to KRT decreased with deeper kidney responses as early as 6 months from therapy initiation (11%, 12%, 2.1%, and 0% for kidNR, kidPR, kidVGPR, and kidCR, respectively; P = 0.002) and were maintained at 12 months and 24 months and best kidney response. Patients able to achieve kidCR/kidVGPR by 24 months and at best response had significantly better OS compared with kidPR/kidNR. Kidney progression, defined as a 25% or greater decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate, was associated with cumulative incidence of progression to KRT and OS.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this cohort study suggest that graded kidney response criteria offers clinically and prognostically meaningful information for treating patients with kidney AL amyloidosis. The response criteria potentially inform kidney survival based on the depth of reduction in 24-hour proteinuria levels and demonstrate an OS advantage for those able to achieve kidCR/kidVGPR compared with kidPR/kidNR. Taken together, achievement of at least kidVGPR by 12 months is needed to ultimately improve kidney and patient survival.

### Prolonged renal survival in light chain amyloidosis: speed and magnitude of light chain reduction is the crucial factor [^91b8c10c]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

Renal involvement causing progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) is present in 70% of patients with systemic Ig light-chain (AL) amyloidosis at diagnosis. Chemotherapy that substantially suppresses free light chain production is associated with improved patient survival, but its benefit in delaying the onset of renal replacement therapy among patients who present with established advanced CKD has not been studied. To evaluate this, we studied 1000 patients enrolled in the prospective UK AL amyloidosis chemotherapy study (ALchemy). Of these, 84 patients had advanced amyloid-related CKD defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) under 20 ml/min/1.73 m 2. We determined outcomes among these 84 patients, who had a median eGFR of 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2, in relation to response to chemotherapy evaluated at three, six, and 12 months from baseline. Patients who achieved suppression of 90% or more in their amyloidogenic free light chain (dFLC) within three months of baseline had significantly better overall survival, prolonged time to dialysis, and prolonged time to the composite endpoint of 'death or dialysis' compared to those who achieved lesser degrees of clonal response at the same time point. Even when this target of greater than 90% dFLC response was achieved but was delayed beyond 3 months, it was associated with worse outcomes. Cox regression analyses confirmed that a 90% or better dFLC response within 3 months was the only significant independent predictor of all three of these outcome measures. Thus, renal survival among patients with systemic immunologic light chain amyloidosis who present with advanced CKD is strongly dependent upon the magnitude and speed with which the underlying hematologic disorder is suppressed by chemotherapy.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2026 Multiple Myeloma — diagnostic tests for renal insufficiency specify that, according to the NCCN Panel, diagnostic workup of patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) should include serum creatinine, electrolyte measurements, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), electrophoresis of a sample from a 24-hour urine collection, serum electrophoresis, and serum free light chain (FLC) measurement; if proteinuria predominantly consists of light chains with high serum levels of FLC and the cause of renal insufficiency can be attributed to MM, a renal biopsy may not be necessary, whereas patients without a clear and complete explanation for their renal insufficiency should undergo renal biopsy to look for other pathophysiology such as monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD) or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and concomitant amyloidosis and monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition should be suspected when renal insufficiency or albuminuria is present without high levels of light chains.

### A detailed evaluation of the current renal response criteria in AL amyloidosis: is it time for a revision? [^b4856442]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

Organ response correlates with overall survival in patients with immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis and is the goal of treatment. This study evaluates the current renal response criteria and their ability to predict overall survival. Patients with immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation between 1995 and 2010 were recruited. Eligibility criteria included > 1 g/dL of proteinuria, dialysis independence at baseline and within the first year of autologous stem cell transplantation, and a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Responses were assessed by the best values after autologous stem cell transplantation. The difference between involved and uninvolved serum free light chain levels was used to determine hematologic response. Increases in serum creatinine were calculated from the highest creatinine after autologous stem cell transplantation. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were met by 141 patients. These patients had a median follow-up of 52 months. Superior overall survival was observed in patients with a > 75% reduction in proteinuria and those who had a > 95% reduction had additional benefits. The overall survival of patients with > 50% to ≤ 75% proteinuria was similar to that of patients with ≤ 50% reduction. A rise in serum creatinine > 25% was not associated with a poorer outcome in patients with a > 75% reduction in proteinuria. Deeper hematologic responses were associated with higher rates of proteinuria reduction. These results suggest that further evaluation of the current renal response criteria is needed. In particular, discrimination of the renal response into complete and partial categories and modification of the serum creatinine requirement seem justified.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published June 26, 2024 The survival of patients with systemic light chain amyloidosis is dependent on the severity of cardiac dysfunction at the time of diagnosis. Patients who receive a diagnosis late in the clinical course of the disorder have a median survival of 3 to 6 months, whereas patients without cardiac involvement can survive for many years. Read the NEJM Review Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: Describe the pathogenesis of AL amyloidosis. A: Amyloidosis comprises a group of diseases triggered by the misfolding of a soluble precursor protein. This misfolding leads to the formation of oligomers, aggregates, and amyloid fibrils characterized by pleated β-sheets, which are deposited extracellularly in various organs and tissues. The result is progressive organ dysfunction, organ failure, and eventual death.

Organ dysfunction is due to the disruption of architecture caused by amyloid deposits, direct cytotoxic effects from protein aggregates or oligomers, or both. AL amyloidosis is associated with a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia and is caused by abnormal or excessive production of amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chains, which aggregate into oligomers and amyloid fibrils, leading to organ dysfunction. Q: Is systemic AL amyloidosis readily diagnosed. A: Nonspecific symptoms linked to AL amyloidosis often contribute to diagnostic delays. Consideration of AL amyloidosis is crucial in patients with unexplained proteinuria, restrictive cardiomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy with autonomic features, carpal tunnel syndrome in both wrists, or hepatomegaly without imaging abnormalities and in any patient with a monoclonal gammopathy or multiple myeloma with atypical manifestations such as macroglossia or raccoon eyes. A high index of suspicion is essential to prevent delays in diagnosis.

A: The diagnosis of AL amyloidosis requires evidence of amyloid deposits in tissue and evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia. Tissue amyloid deposits show green birefringence when stained with Congo red dye and viewed with the use of polarized light microscopy. Fine-needle aspiration of abdominal fat is a simple procedure that is positive for amyloid deposits in approximately 70 to 75% of patients with AL amyloidosis. Other tissues that allow for relatively noninvasive biopsy procedures are the minor salivary glands, gingiva, rectum, and skin. However, if the clinical index of suspicion is high and abdominal fat-pad aspiration is negative for Congo red staining, biopsy of an affected organ may be necessary to establish the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Examination of specimens from both abdominal fat and bone marrow biopsies identifies 85% of patients with AL amyloidosis.

A: Care of patients with systemic AL amyloidosis has undergone transformative changes, leading to marked, steady progress in outcomes for patients over the past four decades. High-dose intravenous melphalan and autologous peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation have been used as a treatment since the mid-1990s for selected patients with AL amyloidosis. However, only 10 to 20% of patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis are eligible for SCT because of factors such as poor performance status, advanced organ dysfunction, and multiorgan disease. The expanding therapeutic landscape is another reason for the limited role of SCT. Patients who are ineligible for SCT receive treatment with the combination of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone plus daratumumab, which is the preferred first-line therapy on the basis of the ANDROMEDA trial.

### Organ response in patients with AL amyloidosis treated with NEOD001, an amyloid-directed monoclonal antibody [^c6c5c3af]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

At enrollment in January 2014, the patient's urinary protein was 5,129 mg/day (normal, < 150 mg/day). We note that persistently elevated proteinuria, especially > 5,000 mg/day, will eventually lead to end‐stage renal disease and necessitate dialysis 4. This patient also had slightly elevated serum creatinine (1.4 mg/dL; normal range, 0.8–1.3 mg/dL), below normal creatinine clearance (62 mL/min; normal range, 77–160 mL/min), and an eGFR not significantly impacted at baseline.

The patient began NEOD001 treatment 40.3 months after his last exposure to PCD therapy. He was treated for 9 months with 16 mg/kg NEOD001 q28d, then was escalated to 24 mg/kg (MTD) for the remainder of this trial. At the 5‐month follow‐up visit, after 4 infusions of NEOD001, proteinuria was reduced by 36%, which constitutes consensus‐defined renal response 4. As of the trial cutoff date (May 9, 2016), he had received 29 infusions (20 at the MTD; Fig. 1 A). His best response, recorded after 23 months of treatment, revealed an 88% reduction in proteinuria from baseline (602 mg/day). The patient's serum creatinine levels had stabilized at 1.1 mg/dL, and his creatinine clearance had risen to fluctuate within the normal range (74–92 mL/min). The patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate did not change from screening (52–60 mL/min/1.73 m 2). He also experienced progressive functional improvement, complete resolution of edema, and no more fatigue.

Although the goal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for chronic dialysis initiation is currently above 5ml/min per 1.73m(2), there is no convincing evidence that patients will benefit from this approach. With close follow-up of advanced chronic kidney disease patients, aiming to start dialysis at an estimated GFR (eGFR) less than 5ml/min per 1.73m(2) may result in the avoidance of potentially unnecessary end-of-life dialysis and could result in significant dialysis-free time for a large segment of the world's future dialysis population.

### Outcomes of patients with renal monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease [^1e85f7f5]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Recent reports suggest that deep hematologic responses to chemotherapy are associated with improved renal outcomes in monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD). Here we describe the long term outcomes and identify prognostic factors after first line treatment of the largest reported series of patients with MIDD. Between March 1992 and December 2014, 88 patients with MIDD were seen at Mayo Clinic, MN. Renal responses were defined using criteria used for light chain amyloidosis (AL) or those used by the IMWG. Sixty-one (69%) patients had a GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and 16 (18%) were on renal replacement therapy at diagnosis. The interval between albuminuria or elevation in creatinine and MIDD diagnosis was 12 months suggesting a delay in diagnosis. Thirty-seven patients (42%) had at least a hematologic CR/VGPR. Fifty-three (60%) received an autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or proteasome inhibitor (PI)-based treatments. Patients receiving ASCT or PI-based therapies were more likely to achieve at least a hematologic CR/VGPR compared to those receiving other therapies: 66% vs 2%, p < 0.0001. Patients that achieved a hematologic CR were more likely to achieve a renal response (53% vs 24%, p = 0.001). Five year overall and renal survival for the entire cohort was 67% and 57%, respectively. In multivariate analyses, a baseline GFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and a renal response (using AL or IMWG criteria) were independently predictive of progression to dialysis. This study confirms that deep hematologic responses, best achieved with ASCT or PI-based therapies, are a prerequisite to achieving renal responses. Am. J.

### Cystatin C as biomarker for the evaluation of renal outcome in AL amyloidosis [^b20947ee]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cystatin C (CysC) has emerged as a novel and potentially more reliable biomarker for the estimation of glomerular filtration in the general population in patients with various conditions. In AL amyloidosis, the current renal staging system and renal response criteria are based on proteinuria and creatinine-based eGFR. We explored the prognostic role of CysC and of estimation of eGFR based on CysC-based equations in a cohort of 195 patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with renal involvement. Baseline CysC level was strongly and independently associated with progression to dialysis, and CysC levels ≥ 1.9mg/L can be used in combination with the current renal staging system to identify patients with different risk of progression to dialysis among renal stages 2 and 3. eGFR based on CysC performed at least similarly to eGFR based on creatinine alone (by CKD-EPI race free formula) and the cutoff of 30mL/min/1.73 m 2 could better predict progression to dialysis at 2years. At 6months landmark, an increase in CysC by ≥ 1mg/L was associated with higher risk of progression to dialysis (HR: 19.8, 95% CI 6.5–60.5, p < 0.001); a reduction of CysC based eGFR ≥ 30% was also associated with poor renal outcome, with a prognostic performance similar to current renal progression criteria. In conclusion, CysC provides prognostic information regarding the renal outcomes in patients with AL amyloidosis independently of the established biomarkers, but requires further validation.

ABSTRACT

Cystatin C (CysC) has emerged as a novel and potentially more reliable biomarker for the estimation of glomerular filtration in the general population in patients with various conditions. In AL amyloidosis, the current renal staging system and renal response criteria are based on proteinuria and creatinine‐based eGFR. We explored the prognostic role of CysC and of estimation of eGFR based on CysC‐based equations in a cohort of 195 patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with renal involvement. Baseline CysC level was strongly and independently associated with progression to dialysis, and CysC levels ≥ 1.9 mg/L can be used in combination with the current renal staging system to identify patients with different risk of progression to dialysis among renal stages 2 and 3. eGFR based on CysC performed at least similarly to eGFR based on creatinine alone (by CKD‐EPI race free formula) and the cutoff of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 could better predict progression to dialysis at 2 years. At 6 months landmark, an increase in CysC by ≥ 1 mg/L was associated with higher risk of progression to dialysis (HR: 19.8, 95% CI 6.5–60.5, p < 0.001); a reduction of CysC based eGFR ≥ 30% was also associated with poor renal outcome, with a prognostic performance similar to current renal progression criteria. In conclusion, CysC provides prognostic information regarding the renal outcomes in patients with AL amyloidosis independently of the established biomarkers, but requires further validation.

Outcome and follow-up

The most critical issue in hepatic amyloidosis is early diagnosis, because any delayed confirmation could cause extremely serious consequence. The condition of this patient, including liver, heart and renal, deteriorating extremely rapidly (Table 1), showing estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 48 mL/min/1.73 m 2; NT-pro BNP, 2976 pg/mL; cardiac troponins, 0.18 ng/mL, and serum free light chain difference (DFLC) was 903.8 (≥ 180) mg/L. Thus, Mayo score 3 for AL amyloidosis was given to this patient. Upon the diagnosis, a haematologist was consulted, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was not advised for this patient, however chemotherapy was recommended. This patient declined chemotherapy and elected to be self-discharged back to his hometown for palliative care only. The patient died of multi-organ failure one month after discharge.

### Modern treatment of amyloidosis: unresolved questions [^dc513242]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

During the past 10 to 15 years, there has been substantial progress in developing new treatments for the systemic amyloidoses. These advances have improved patient outcomes but have also raised new questions with direct clinical implications. For example, development of less intensive treatments for AL amyloidosis has made less certain the role of autologous stem cell transplantation, and new quantitative assays should now allow determination of the importance of fully eliminating amyloidogenic light chain production in AL disease. Additionally, observations from a clinical trial in AA amyloidosis have generated hypotheses about the relative contributions of amyloid precursors and mature fibrils to amyloidosis-associated kidney disease.

Table 2
System-Based, Clinical Presentation of AL Amyloidosis Patients and Key Diagnostic Findings

Table 3 outlines the diagnostic and staging studies recommended for patients with suspected/confirmed AL amyloidosis. Because cardiac involvement has a major prognostic impact by driving early mortality, current staging systems incorporate the extent of cardiac involvement as measured by serum markers (Table 4). A staging system for renal involvement predicting renal survival has also been validated (Table 5). An overlapping diagnosis of MM based on the presence of CRAB criteria, or a bone marrow clonal plasmacytosis exceeding 10% both represent adverse prognostic factors in AL amyloidosis. Translocation t(11;14) resulting in the juxtaposition of the cyclin D1 gene locus to the Ig heavy chain locus is the most common cytogenetic abnormality in AL, present in 40%-60% of patients, and portends a worsened prognosis (Table 6). This is in contrast to MM where t(11;14) is a standard-risk cytogenetic abnormality. Furthermore, t(11;14) is a predictive factor of poor response to bortezomib. The molecular basis for the biological impact of t(11;14) on prognosis and response to therapy remain obscure.

Cardiac amyloidosis — biomarkers and staging: In AL amyloidosis, the affected free light chain (FLC) concentration together with N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin T or I can be used to assign a disease stage with highly reproducible prognostic information, and a staging system based on NT-proBNP and cardiac troponins (with differential FLC levels) is widely used to stratify therapy intensity. A European study identified a stage 3 subgroup with very advanced cardiac involvement with NT-proBNP (> 8500 ng/L) and a very poor prognosis; reductions in FLC after anti–plasma cell treatment are typically followed within 6 to 12 months by reductions in NT-pro-BNP and troponin (an organ-specific response) associated with improved symptoms and extended survival. FLC-based and NT-proBNP-based hematologic and cardiac responses have been extensively validated in AL amyloidosis; in ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, NT-proBNP, cardiac troponin, and estimated glomerular filtration rate have been validated in risk-prediction models, with changes in NT pro-BNP useful to follow disease progression, and biomarker evaluation is an integral part of management in both AL and ATTR.

### The impact and importance of achieving a complete haematological response prior to renal transplantation in AL amyloidosis [^631af64e]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Renal dysfunction is a common presenting feature of AL amyloidosis and one-third of affected patients will develop end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Consequently, a sizable proportion of patients will require either renal replacement therapy (RRT) or renal transplantation.

In AL amyloidosis, achieving a deep haematological response (HR) to therapy (at least a very good partial response (VGPR)or a 90% reduction in the difference between free light chains (dFLC)) improves renal outcomes and survival. Renal transplantation is associated with lower mortality, less risk of cardiovascular events and improved quality of life when compared to RRT. In 2010, we reported a median overall survival (OS) of 6.5 years and median graft survival of 5.8 yearsin patients with AL amyloidosis who underwent renal transplantation, whilst a recent report from the Boston group documented an impressive 10.5 year OS and 8.3-year graft survival, perhaps reflecting advances in patient selection and available therapies over the last decade. Appropriate patient selection is imperative from the perspective of both fitness to undergo transplantation and depth of HR. Assessment of HR in patients with ESRF provides a challenge due to the polyclonal increase in serum-free light chains (sFLC) that occurs in renal failure.

Organ transplantation

In AL amyloidosis, selected patients may successfully undergo renal or cardiac transplantation to assist with organ recovery. For patients that have single-organ involvement and control of the plasma cell proliferative process, organ transplantation may be considered. Stem cell transplantation can be safely performed in patients with dialysis-dependentrenal failure. Failure to achieve a complete response is no longer considered a contraindication to organ transplantation because of the increased availability of therapeutic options and direct organ donor programs. Once the patient has an established complete response, consideration of renal transplantation may be undertaken. Cardiac transplantation has also been performed in patients with AL amyloidosis. Patients with advanced cardiac disease are unlikely to tolerate therapy well and achieve deep responses prior to consideration of organ transplantation. There have been cases of patients receiving cardiac allografting first, followed by chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation to achieve remission of the AL amyloidosis –. Long-term survivorship has been reported in highly selected patients who fulfill the criteria of deep hematologic response and single-organ involvement. Lenalidomide therapy is best avoided in organ transplant recipients that are considered for post-organ transplant chemotherapy.

AL amyloidosis — response assessment to therapy is monitored in 2 ways: hematologic response of sFLC and organ response, with assessments that may include serum troponin, NT-proBNP, electrocardiography and echocardiography, creatinine, 24-hour UPEP, and liver enzymes. A hematologic response is generally observed within 3 to 6 months of treatment initiation, and organ-specific response is generally observed 6 to 12 months after a hematologic response.

Discussion

New, effective systemic therapies that successfully target pathologic plasma cells and suppress toxic light chain production have led to an increase in the number of patients who survive longer albeit with ESRD. There is a lingering reluctance to offer renal transplantation to these patients due to the fear of recurrent disease and poor outcomes. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify patients who may benefit. To address this need, we combined data from five countries under the umbrella of The International Kidney and Monoclonal Gammopathy Research Group which resulted in the largest series of patients with AL amyloidosis who underwent renal transplantation.

These data show excellent outcomes: OS from diagnosis was 14.4 years and from renal transplantation 8.6 years. The long post-diagnosis OS (compared to all AL amyloid patients) shows that these are highly selected patients with excellent response to therapeutic interventions. The median time of graft survival was also very good, 7.8 years and compared favorably to outcomes reported for patients who were transplanted for non-amyloidosis indications. This was despite the age of our patients at renal transplantation being a decade older than the average renal transplant recipient (60.8 vs. 50 years). There was no statistically significant difference between living versus cadaveric renal transplantation but this question should be revisited in a larger cohort less dependent on selection bias.

The population of patients with moderate and severe CKD is growing. Frail and older patients comprise an increasing proportion. Many studies still exclude this group, so the evidence base is limited. In 2013 the advisory board of ERBP initiated, in collaboration with European Union of Geriatric Medicine Societies (EUGMS), the development of a guideline on the management of older patients with CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73 m2). The full guideline has recently been published and is freely available online and on the website of ERBP (www.european-renal-best-practice.org). This paper summarises main recommendations of the guideline and their underlying rationales.

Multiple studies have looked into the use of bortezomib-based regimens upfront –. Three studies, which highlight the durable HR associated with bortezomib-based regimens, are the European CyBorD collaboration study of 230 patients between 2013 and 2016, a prospective observational study by the UK National Amyloidosis Center of 915 patients between 2010 and 2017, and a phase III trial of MDex versus BMDex between 2011 and 2016. Across these studies the CR rates on intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis ranged from 21 to 25% –. Cardiac response varied from 17 to 38% and renal response, 15 to 44% –. The median OS across these studies was > 4 years and the median follow-up period ranged from 25 to 32 months –. The phase III trial (NCT01277016) comparing MDex to BMDex in newly diagnosed AL patients reported very exciting data in 109 patients recruited in Europe and Australia (56 in MDex arm, 53 in BMDex arm). Although there was no difference in the CR and partial response (PR) rates, or in cardiac and renal response rates, at the end of treatment after a median of five cycles, the overall HR rate was significantly better in the BMDex arm compared with the MDex arm (79% versus 52%, p = 0.002) whereas VGPR or CR was achieved in 64% of the patients on the BMDex arm versus 39% of those on the MDex arm. This translated into improvements with BMDex over MDex in PFS and OS with a 2-fold decrease in mortality (HR 0.5, [0.27–0.90]).

### A staging system for renal outcome and early markers of renal response to chemotherapy in AL amyloidosis [^af0e0c83]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

The kidney is involved in 70% of patients with immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, but little is known on progression or reversibility of renal involvement, and criteria for renal response have never been validated. Newly diagnosed patients from the Pavia (n = 461, testing cohort) and Heidelberg (n = 271, validation cohort) centers were included. Proteinuria > 5 g/24 h and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 50 mL/min predicted progression to dialysis best. Proteinuria below and eGFR above the thresholds indicated low risk (0 and 4% at 3 years in the testing and validation cohorts, respectively). High proteinuria and low eGFR indicated high risk (60% and 85% at 3 years). At 6 months, a ≥ 25% eGFR decrease predicted poor renal survival in both cohorts and was adopted as criterion for renal progression. A decrease in proteinuria by ≥ 30% or below 0.5 g/24 h without renal progression was the criterion for renal response, being associated with longer renal survival in the testing and validation populations. Hematologic very good partial or complete remission at 6 months improved renal outcome in both populations. We identified and validated a staging system for renal involvement and criteria for early assessment of renal response and progression in AL amyloidosis that should be used in clinical practice and trial design.

### Long-term outcome of kidney transplantation in AL amyloidosis [^8d71cd05]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Therapies for AL amyloidosis have dramatically improved, leading to longer patient survival; however, more AL amyloidosis patients are reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD). There are no clear guidelines regarding eligibility for kidney transplantation in patients with AL amyloidosis, and data on outcomes are limited. We evaluated the clinical and laboratory data of 49 patients who were followed in the Amyloidosis Center at Boston University and underwent kidney transplantation at a center in the United States between 1987–2017. During a median follow-up of 7.2 years (range 0–19), the median patient survival from diagnosis was 15.4 years, and from kidney transplantation was 10.5 years. One, three, and five-year graft survival were 94%, 89%, and 81%, respectively. Patients with hematologic complete response or very good partial response prior to kidney transplantation had significantly better patient survival than patients with partial response or no response, and the median time to graft loss was 10.4 years versus 5.5 years, respectively. This is the largest published series of kidney transplantation in patients with AL amyloidosis, suggesting that kidney transplantation can have a good outcome in carefully selected patients, particularly in those who have achieved a complete response or very good partial response at the time of kidney transplantation.
