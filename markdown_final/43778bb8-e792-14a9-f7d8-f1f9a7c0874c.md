## Question

What are the most commonly used empirical antibiotics for treating UTIs in males?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which empirical antibiotics are most commonly used to treat urinary tract infections in males. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how male UTIs are classified and why that matters for empiric choices. Then, I should verify the most reliable real-world prescribing data in men. Next, I will reconcile those data with contemporary guideline recommendations and resistance patterns. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, stewardship-aligned answer and note exceptions and duration nuances, anchoring to high-quality sources where possible.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: in men, most UTIs are considered complicated by definition because of the higher likelihood of prostatic involvement, obstruction, or bacteremia, so empiric therapy should reflect that complexity and the broader pathogen spectrum, including Enterococcus and Pseudomonas in some contexts, which is why guidelines and practice often diverge from female-focused algorithms [^8144d778] [^38cfbfed].

> Next, I should review the most representative real-world data. The French primary care database study of 610 male UTI consultations found fluoroquinolones were the most prescribed class at 64.9%, followed by beta-lactams at 17.4%, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at 11.9%, and nitrofurantoin at 2.6%, which aligns with older observational data showing high fluoroquinolone use in men with suspected UTI and contemporary ED/urgent care data where male sex predicts fluoroquinolone prescribing, albeit at somewhat lower rates than in primary care [^36f6408d] [^d2b22e4f] [^40f2c18f].

> Wait, let me verify the resistance context before I jump to conclusions. Multiple datasets show rising resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones in urinary E. coli, with higher multidrug resistance rates in males, and stewardship frameworks consistently advise avoiding fluoroquinolones as empiric therapy when alternatives exist due to safety and resistance concerns, which should temper the apparent popularity of fluoroquinolones in practice [^ed7a287c] [^95f07e63] [^5b3f0c5f] [^9e504cdb].

> Hold on, I should align this with guidelines. The IDSA cUTI guidance emphasizes tailoring empiric therapy to severity and patient-specific risk factors for resistance, and it discourages routine empiric fluoroquinolones, especially with prior exposure, while EAU guidance advises against empiric fluoroquinolones in urology patients or after recent fluoroquinolone use, and recommends agents like amoxicillin plus an aminoglycoside, second- or third-generation cephalosporins for severe presentations, with culture-directed de-escalation when available [^e6fdfc78] [^21bec297] [^f2778097] [^a4f83f4e] [^3e5275a9].

> I need to check duration nuances because they influence empiric choices. For afebrile men with suspected UTI, a randomized trial showed 7 days of ciprofloxacin or TMP-SMX was noninferior to 14 days, supporting shorter effective courses when clinically appropriate, whereas a separate randomized trial in febrile UTI found 7 days of ofloxacin inferior to 14 days, underscoring that severity and syndrome guide duration and that fluoroquinolones are not interchangeable in this context [^eae55c88] [^37a3bd2c].

> Let me reconsider the original question and synthesize carefully. The most commonly used empirical antibiotics in males with UTI are fluoroquinolones, followed by beta-lactams, then trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with nitrofurantoin used infrequently for lower tract disease without systemic features. However, this pattern reflects historical prescribing inertia and does not reflect best practice given rising resistance and safety concerns, so guideline-concordant empiric therapy should prioritize culture when feasible, avoid fluoroquinolones unless there is a compelling indication, and tailor to local resistance and patient risk factors, with typical durations of 7 days for afebrile presentations and 10–14 days for febrile or prostatic involvement [^36f6408d] [^e6fdfc78] [^eae55c88] [^e8b20eae].

> But wait, what if the presentation is lower-tract symptoms without fever or flank pain? In that narrower scenario, nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX may be reasonable if local resistance is low, whereas any suspicion of upper tract disease or prostatitis should broaden coverage and extend duration, and I should double-check that any initial empiric choice is narrowed promptly once culture returns to honor stewardship principles [^4f91305f] [^3e5275a9].

---

The most commonly used empirical antibiotics for male UTIs are **fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin)** [^36f6408d] and **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)** [^d2b22e4f], with beta-lactams (amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin, ceftriaxone) as alternatives when resistance or allergies are a concern [^notfound]. Fluoroquinolones are often favored for their broad coverage and prostatic penetration [^92488b54], but **rising resistance** [^ed7a287c] and safety concerns limit their empiric use [^9e504cdb]; TMP-SMX remains an option where local resistance is ≤ 20% [^60df4b65]. Beta-lactams are used when first-line agents are unsuitable or resistance is high [^notfound]. Empiric therapy should be guided by **local resistance data** [^e6fdfc78], patient-specific factors, and culture results to enable timely de-escalation [^3e5275a9].

## Commonly used empirical antibiotics

| **Antibiotic class** | **Commonly used agents** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Fluoroquinolones | - Ciprofloxacin <br/> - Levofloxacin | - Broad-spectrum coverage <br/> - Good prostatic penetration [^92488b54] <br/> - Rising resistance [^ed7a287c] <br/> - Safety concerns (CNS, QT, tendon rupture) [^notfound] |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) | - TMP-SMX | - Cost-effective <br/> - Resistance variable; use if ≤ 20% locally [^60df4b65] |
| Beta-lactams | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate <br/> - Cephalexin <br/> - Ceftriaxone | - Alternative when first-line agents unsuitable <br/> - Higher resistance in some regions [^ed7a287c] |

---

## Current prescribing patterns

Real-world data show **fluoroquinolones are the most frequently prescribed empirical therapy** in men, followed by TMP-SMX and beta-lactams [^36f6408d]. A French primary care study found fluoroquinolones accounted for 64.9% of prescriptions, TMP-SMX for 11.9%, and beta-lactams for 17.4% [^36f6408d]. Similarly, a population-based study reported fluoroquinolones as the most common choice, with TMP-SMX and beta-lactams as alternatives [^d2b22e4f].

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic selection

Empiric antibiotic selection in men is shaped by:

- **Local resistance patterns**: Critical for choosing effective agents [^e6fdfc78] [^80977h68].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, allergies, and prior antibiotic use [^25bb8edc].
- **Severity of infection**: Febrile or systemic illness may require broader coverage or IV therapy [^f2778097].
- **Prostatic involvement**: Requires agents with good prostatic penetration (e.g. fluoroquinolones) [^92488b54].

---

## Resistance patterns and clinical outcomes

Resistance is a major driver of empiric choices: **E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones is rising** [^ed7a287c], with higher multidrug resistance in men [^ed7a287c]. This trend increases treatment failure and complications, reinforcing the need for culture-guided therapy and stewardship [^3e5275a9].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **individualized empiric therapy** based on local resistance, patient factors, and severity, with culture-directed de-escalation when available [^e6fdfc78] [^3e5275a9]. Fluoroquinolones are effective but should be reserved due to resistance and safety concerns; TMP-SMX is appropriate where resistance is low; beta-lactams are alternatives when first-line agents are unsuitable [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Fluoroquinolones and TMP-SMX remain the most commonly used empirical antibiotics for male UTIs, with beta-lactams as alternatives. Rising resistance and safety concerns necessitate **careful selection** guided by local data, patient factors, and culture results to optimize outcomes and limit resistance [^e6fdfc78].

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^38cfbfed]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^5311e3c1]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans. Women are significantly more affected than men: one in three women will have at least one episode of UTI by the age of 24, and roughly 50% of women will experience a UTI in their lifetime.

UTIs are classified according to the site of infection (pyelonephritis, cystitis, urethritis and prostatitis) and the presence of risk factors for complications. While asymptomatic UTIs are left untreated in most cases according to guidelines, the high incidence of symptomatic UTIs that require antibiotics (ATBs) emphasises the need to ensure appropriate therapy with agents that maximise success and minimise the risk of resistance.

According to the WHO, rational drug use requires that patients receive drugs appropriate to their clinical condition, in doses that suit their needs, for an adequate period of time and at the lowest cost for themselves and their community.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on urological infections: summary of the 2024 guidelines [^5165eba0]. European Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Urological infections significantly impact the wellbeing and quality of life of individuals owing to their widespread occurrence and diverse clinical manifestations. The objective of the guidelines panel was to provide evidence-based guidance on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and male accessory-gland infections, while addressing crucial public health aspects related to infection control and antimicrobial stewardship.

Methods

For the 2024 guidelines on urological infections, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations within the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences.

Key Findings and Limitations

Key recommendations emphasise the importance of a thorough medical history and physical examination for patients with urological infections. The guidelines stress the role of antimicrobial stewardship to combat the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance, providing recommendations for antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration on the basis of the latest evidence.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

This overview of the 2024 EAU guidelines offers valuable insights into managing urological infections and are designed for effective integration into clinical practice.

Patient Summary

The European Association of Urology has issued an updated guideline on urological infections. The guidelines provide recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, with a particular focus on minimising antibiotic use because of the increasing global threat of antimicrobial resistance.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^e8b20eae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

### The best rules for antimicrobial stewardship in urogenital tract infections [^5b3f0c5f]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) belong to the most common community-acquired and nosocomial infections, but therapy of UTIs is limited by resistance of pathogens and nonoptimal using of antibacterials. Narrative review of recent (2020–2018) literature dedicated to antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in urological infections has been done.

Recent Findings

Analysis of recent 64 articles has shown following principles of AMS for UTIs: selecting the correct drug, correct dose, and shortest clinically effective duration of therapy whenever possible, is a base for optimal antimicrobial stewardship; symptomatic UTIs should be treated with antimicrobials to alleviate symptoms, and in the case of more serious infection, to prevent complications; in both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, quantitative culture is the gold standard for diagnosis; we have to avoid prescriptions of antibiotics when possible; we have to follow European and National Guidelines; we must avoid prescription of fluoroquinolones as empiric therapy for UTIs by many reasons, one of these is urogenital tuberculosis; the choice of antibiotic for UTI should be based on local level of resistance of uropathogens.

Summary

Studies of antimicrobial stewardship in urology are limited. Nevertheless, there are some golden rules, which may help to reduce inappropriate use of antimicrobials, improve patient outcomes, reduce side effects of antibiotic therapy, decrease the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant infections, as well as decrease total costs of the therapy.

### Urinary tract infections in adults… [^76ea8269]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was found to be the most cost-effective treatment. Three-day regimens of ciprofloxacin, 250 mg twice daily, and ofloxacin, 200 mg twice daily, were recently compared with three-day trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy. 3, 11 The oral fluoroquinolones produced better cure rates with less toxicity, but at a greater overall cost. Quinolones that are useful in treating complicated and uncomplicated cystitis include ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. On the basis of cost and efficacy, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remains the antibiotic of choice in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in young women.

The use of fluoroquinolones as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTIs should be discouraged, except in patients who cannot tolerate sulfonamides or trimethoprim, who have a high frequency of antibiotic resistance because of recent antibiotic treatment or who reside in an area in which significant resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been noted. The initial empiric therapy for these patients should include an agent with a broad spectrum of activity against the expected uropathogens. Treatment most often includes a fluoroquinolone, administered orally if possible. Enterococci are frequently encountered uropathogens in complicated UTIs. In areas in which vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium is prevalent, the investigational agent quinupristindalfopristin may be useful.
20. 23 Men with urinary tract infections should receive a minimum of seven days of antibiotic therapy.

However, more extensive courses may be required in, for example, men with associated urinary tract infection and prostatitis. Consensus regarding the need for a urologic work-up in men with urinary tract infections is lacking. Symptomatic bacteriuria in a patient with an indwelling Foley catheter should be treated with antibiotics that cover potential nosocomial uropathogens. Patients with mild to moderate infections may be treated with one of the oral quinolones, usually for 10 to 14 days. Parenteral antibiotic therapy may be necessary in patients with severe infections or patients who are unable to tolerate oral medications.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^7f6c712c]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are treatments for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) recommended in national guidelines published in 2011 still optimal?

Findings

Using a large regional claims dataset for 57 585 episodes of UTI occurring in 49 037 female patients, this cohort study found that guideline-concordant first-line treatments retained their efficacy vs fluoroquinolones and outperformed β-lactam antibiotics with respect to efficacy and adverse events.

Meaning

Even though the national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated UTI were published nearly 14 years ago, these findings suggest that outpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs should continue to encourage clinicians to follow them.

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infection in elderly patients in primary care and its association with bloodstream infections and all cause mortality: population based cohort study [^0a782cee]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection in the older patient population, and Escherichia coli is the most common uropathogen in community dwelling people older than 65 years. The spectrum of UTI ranges from a mild self limiting illness to severe sepsis, with a mortality rate of 20–40%. The incidence of sepsis and its associated mortality increases disproportionately with age, and UTI in men is more likely to be severe. Both sexes develop UTI in old age, with a female to male ratio of 2:1 in patients older than 70 years, compared with the overwhelming UTI susceptibility of females in younger populations, with a 50:1 ratio. The diagnosis of UTI in older patients can be problematic, as these patients are less likely to present with a typical clinical history and localised urinary symptoms compared with younger patients. The rising incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults is also contributing to further diagnostic difficulty (> 20% of women aged ≥ 65 years compared with < 5% in younger women), which results in probable over-diagnosis of UTI and unnecessary treatment.

UTI is the second most common diagnosis for which empirical antibiotics are prescribed in both primary and secondary care, with more than 50% of the antibiotics prescribed for a suspected UTI in older adults being considered unnecessary. With the spread of antibiotic resistance and its increasing threat to public health (about 30% of urinary isolates of E coli are now resistant to trimethoprim), national guidelines and antimicrobial stewardship programmes have been proposed to combat these challenges.NHS England, for example, released the Quality Premium to incentivise Clinical Commissioning Groups to reduce antibiotic use in primary care. As a result of these new initiatives, a substantial decrease in antibiotic use has been reported for the first time in England across the whole healthcare system between 2013 and 2017. A recent study has also shown a decrease in prescribing of broad spectrum antibiotics for UTI in older people in primary care between 2004 and 2014. In the meantime, however, increases in the incidence of Gram negative bloodstream infections have been reported, which has led the UK government to announce a plan to reduce healthcare associated Gram negative bloodstream infections in England by 50% by March 2021.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^bd248e36]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common conditions seen in female patients in general practice. These infections affect 50% of women at least once in their lives, and more than 20% of infections are resistant to trimethoprim and cephalosporins and 50% to amoxicillin.

Urinary dipsticks are the most commonly used near patient test in primary care in the United Kingdom. The aim of using dipsticks is to target treatment to the 60% of women who have urinary tract infections, while minimising antibiotic use for women without infection. A previous validation study has shown that dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. If clinicians are to use dipsticks, however, they need to have strategies to deal with the poor negative predictive values. We know of no trial that has assessed dipstick or clinical management algorithms in comparison with the realistic alternatives. Previous studies have documented that delayed antibiotic prescribing in respiratory infections results in good symptom control, reduced belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics, and fewer repeat consultations. We hypothesised that, compared with an immediate antibiotic prescription, other management strategies would result in worse symptom control, particularly in women asked to delay antibiotics empirically or while waiting for the result of midstream urine analysis.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of management using dipstick or clinical algorithms compared with the alternative management strategies (empirical antibiotic treatment, delayed prescribing, and targeted prescribing based on midstream urine results).

### EAU guidelines on urological infections [^98f590f5]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to do not use ciprofloxacin or other fluoroquinolones as empirical therapy in patients from urology departments or when patients have used fluoroquinolones in the last 6 months.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^283966fa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Personal clinical history predicts antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infections [^80977f68]. Nature Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Antibiotic resistance is prevalent among the bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infections. However, antimicrobial treatment is often prescribed 'empirically', in the absence of antibiotic susceptibility testing, risking mismatched and therefore ineffective treatment. Here, linking a 10-year longitudinal data set of over 700,000 community-acquired urinary tract infections with over 5,000,000 individually resolved records of antibiotic purchases, we identify strong associations of antibiotic resistance with the demographics, records of past urine cultures and history of drug purchases of the patients. When combined together, these associations allow for machine-learning-based personalized drug-specific predictions of antibiotic resistance, thereby enabling drug-prescribing algorithms that match an antibiotic treatment recommendation to the expected resistance of each sample. Applying these algorithms retrospectively, over a 1-year test period, we find that they greatly reduce the risk of mismatched treatment compared with the current standard of care. The clinical application of such algorithms may help improve the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatments.

### Determinants of practice patterns in pediatric UTI management [^e297be45]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) affects 10% of girls and 3% of boys by age 16. Both the American Academy of Pediatrics and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Guidelines recommend urine testing prior to initiation of antibiotic treatment and the use of local antibiograms to guide empiric antibiotic therapy. Urine culture results not only provide the opportunity to halt empiric therapy if there is no bacterial growth, but also allow for tailoring of broad-spectrum therapy. Additionally, the use of antiobiograms improves empiric antibiotic selection based on local resistance patterns. However, execution of guideline recommendations has proved challenging. Understanding barriers in implementation is critical to developing targeted interventions aimed to improve adherence to these guidelines.

Objectives

The present study sought to investigate practice patterns and factors that influence urine testing and antibiogram use in the setting of empiric antibiotic treatment of UTI in children to ultimately improve adherence to UTI management guidelines.

Study Design

A random, national sample of physicians caring for children was surveyed from the American Medical Association Masterfile. Participants were queried regarding practice type, length of time in practice, factors influencing urine testing, urine specimen collection method, and antibiogram utilization. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with use of urine testing, bagged specimens, and antibiograms.

Results

Of respondents who acknowledged contact by surveyors, 47% completed the survey (n = 366). Most respondents (84%) obtain urinalysis and culture prior to treatment for UTI. Physicians report they would more likely order testing if the specimen were easier to collect (46%) and if results were available immediately (48%) (Table). Urine collection by bag was more common in circumcised boys (> 30%) compared with girls (20%) and uncircumcised boys (20%) (P = 0.02). The most common reasons for collection by bag were parental refusal for (49%) and difficulty with (42%) catheterization (Table). Of the 70% of respondents reporting antibiogram access (n = 256), 50% report its use the majority of the time with empiric prescription (n = 128).

Discussion

While most practitioners report following guidelines to obtain urine testing prior to antibiotic prescription for UTI, urine collection by bag is common. Additionally, < 50% of practitioners adhere to guideline recommendations for empiric antibiotic selection based on local antibiograms. Interventions to improve adherence to UTI management guidelines should focus on (1) improving catheterization practices, (2) educating parents regarding the value of catheterization, and (3) incorporating local antibiograms into electronic medical records.

### Diagnosis and management of male urinary tract infections: a need for new guidelines. study from a French general practice electronic database [^36f6408d]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The definition and the treatment of male urinary tract infections (UTIs) are imprecise. This study aims to determine the frequency of male UTIs in consultations of general practice, the diagnostic approach and the prescribed treatments.

Methods

We extracted the consultations of male patients, aged 18 years or more, during the period 2012–17 with the International Classification of Primary Care, version 2 codes for UTIs or associated symptoms from PRIMEGE/MEDISEPT databases of primary care. For eligible consultations in which all symptoms or codes were consistent with male UTIs, we identified patient history, prescribed treatments, antibiotic duration, clinical conditions, additional examinations and bacteriological results of urine culture.

Results

Our study included 610 consultations with 396 male patients (mean age 62.5 years). Male UTIs accounted for 0.097% of visits and 1.44 visits per physician per year. The UTIs most commonly identified were: undifferentiated (52%), prostatitis (36%), cystitis (8.5%) and pyelonephritis (3.5%). Fever was recorded in 14% of consultations. Urine dipstick test was done in 1.8% of consultations. Urine culture was positive for Escherichia coli in 50.4% of bacteriological tests. Fluoroquinolones were the most prescribed antibiotics (64.9%), followed by beta-lactams (17.4%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (11.9%) and nitrofurantoin (2.6%).

Conclusions

Male UTIs are rare in general practice and have different presentations. The definition of male UTIs needs to be specified by prospective studies. Diagnostic evidence of male cystitis may reduce the duration of antibiotic therapy and spare critical antibiotics.

### Keep it simple: a proposal for a new definition of uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections from the EAU urological infections guidelines panel [^63aa9cb9]. European Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

The European Association of Urology Urological Infections Guidelines Panel is proposing a new classification scheme for categorizing urinary tract infections (UTIs) into uncomplicated and complicated types. This classification would provide clarity and facilitate effective clinical management of UTIs, and acknowledges the importance of addressing clinical and sex-specific nuances in the care of individual patients.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^546d4847]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

Our data continue to support evidence that UTIs are often diagnosed and treated in a manner inconsistent with guidelines meant to direct best clinical practices. Laboratory tests are frequently used in the absence of urinary symptoms demonstrating inappropriate testing. Over‐testing is contributing to the overtreatment of patients without UTI symptoms and often without microbiological evidence of infection. Given the potential harms of overtreatment such as antibiotic resistance, recurrent infections, and high healthcare costs, our study demonstrates the need for advances in adherence to and understanding of UTI diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines as well as improved diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) — definition and treatment approach: In this document, cUTI refers to urinary tract infections associated with a structural or functional genitourinary abnormality or any UTI in an adolescent or adult male; the panel suggests cUTI be treated with similar agents and similar treatment durations as pyelonephritis, and when source control has occurred it is reasonable to use regimens akin to uncomplicated cystitis with day 1 of therapy being the day source control occurred.

### Current challenges in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and prostatitis [^92488b54]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Serious urinary tract infections (UTIs) and acute bacterial prostatitis in adults cause significant morbidity and economic burden. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is a rather rare condition seen in urological practice, however, in certain occasions difficult to treat. In this paper, we review the bacterial etiologies and the resistance patterns found in adults with serious UTIs and bacterial prostatitis, and discuss considerations for selecting optimal antimicrobial therapy. The role of fluoroquinolones as targeted therapy for serious UTIs is highlighted. The use of effective antimicrobial therapy is the foundation of management of serious UTIs and bacterial prostatitis. Selection of the optimal antimicrobial agent must take into account patient-specific factors; infection characteristics (e.g., severity, community- vs. institutional- or hospital-acquired, need for IV agent, UTI, prostatitis); local resistance pattern; pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles; and cost. Fluoroquinolones are among the alternatives for empirical antibiotic treatment of serious UTIs and acute bacterial prostatitis. In serious UTIs activity of the antimicrobial agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa needs to be taken into account. In chronic bacterial prostatitis fluoroquinolones are the first choice because of their favourable pharmacokinetic properties at the site of infection. Targeted antimicrobial therapy — emphasising the correct antibacterial spectrum and correct dosage — is likely to provide important benefits, such as reduced morbidity and associated costs, reduced emergence of resistance and maintenance of class efficacy.

### Antimicrobial susceptibility trends for urinary isolates in the veteran population [^2400c439]. American Journal of Infection Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidance on empiric treatment for urinary tract infections (UTIs) is lacking for the male population which comprises much of the Veteran population in the United States. This study evaluated susceptibility trends in antimicrobials used for treatment of UTIs in the inpatient and outpatient Veteran population nationwide.

Methods

Urine culture data was retrospectively obtained from Corporate Data Warehouse. All urine cultures from Veteran Health Administration patients 18 years of age or older who were treated at any VA health care center in the years 2009 and 2018 were eligible. Antibiograms were constructed for bacterial isolate susceptibility.

Results

In 2009 and 2018 isolates from 54,788 and 58,983 Veterans were analyzed, respectively. Escherichia coli was the most common bacteria isolated. For ceftriaxone, E coli susceptibilities were relatively high but trended downward from 2009 to 2018. Common urinary pathogen susceptibilities remained low for fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Discussion

Empiric therapy for Veterans with UTIs should be based on local susceptibility patterns as previously recommended first-line agents have fallen out of favor due to increasing resistance rates.

Conclusions

Both inpatient and outpatient stewardship is needed to ensure appropriate treatment, as viable treatment options for UTIs are becoming increasingly limited.

### 5-day versus 10-day course of fluoroquinolones in outpatient males with a urinary tract infection (UTI) [^aa9eff78]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Current guidelines classify urinary tract infections (UTIs) in males as complicated and recommend longer treatment than for UTIs in females. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that males with UTIs may be successfully treated with an outpatient 5-day course of levofloxacin.

Methods

Data were obtained from a previously conducted clinical trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00210886), a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, noninferiority study comparing levofloxacin 750 mg intravenously/by mouth once daily for 5 days and ciprofloxacin 400/500 mg intravenously/by mouth twice daily for 10 days in complicated UTI (cUTI). The current study was a post hoc, subgroup analysis of male and female subjects with cUTI. Subjects were stratified into groups based on sex and antibiotic received. The subjects were analyzed at the end of therapy (EOT) and post therapy (PT) for clinical success rates, defined as no further need for antimicrobial treatment.

Results

Totals of 427 patients (224 male, 203 female) and 350 patients (189 male, 161 female) were included in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population and microbiologically evaluable (ME) populations, respectively. Clinical success rates between males and females were not statistically different between antibiotic groups in either the mITT or ME populations at EOT or PT.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that males with UTI may be treated with a shorter course of antimicrobial therapy for UTI than previously recommended.

### Multidrug resistance in urinary E. coli higher in males compared to females [^95f07e63]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

MDR rates are expectedly higher in the hospital setting compared to community, likely due to the higher complexity of patients presenting for tertiary care, whereas uncomplicated UTIs are largely diagnosed and managed in the community. Our findings of increasing MDR over time is alarming and reflects the increasing resistance globally. A study in the United States indicated that the prevalence of MDR urinary E. coli increased from 9.1 to 17.0% between 2001 and 2010. Similarly, in Australia, MDR rates increased from 4.5% in 2008 to 7.6% in 2012. In our study, MDR rates of 6.4% in the community, and as high as 16.5% in the hospital are worrying since Australia is considered a low prevalence country for AMR.

Identifying the mechanisms of MDR was beyond the scope of this study. Increasing rates of MDR E. coli are associated with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and co-located resistance mechanisms on transferable plasmids. ESBL-producing E. coli have increased in Australia, and have been found more commonly in urinary samples from men. Some of the risk factors associated with ESBL-producing E. coli infections include urinary stones, use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, advanced age, prior surgeries, indwelling catheters, and recent prescription of antibiotics. Infections caused by MDR bacteria, including ESBLs, result in poorer clinical outcomes.

In the hospital setting, significantly higher AMR was seen in males, compared to females, for four of the five tested antibiotics, except trimethoprim. According to the national antibiotic guidelines, trimethoprim is recommended as a first-line oral empirical antibiotic for uncomplicated UTIs due to low risk of adverse outcomes from treatment failure. It could be postulated that trimethoprim resistance is higher in females as a result of trimethoprim exposure, since a greater proportion of uncomplicated infections occur in this group. Our findings are consistent with increased rates of resistance (20%) to trimethoprim among urinary E. coli isolates in Australia, which is worrying, since this is the first-line antibiotic recommended for treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in our country. Our findings indicate that caution should be exercised in using trimethoprim as a first line agent in UTIs, due to a higher rate of resistance. In terms of changing the empirical therapy based on resistance percentage, a UK based study indicated alternatives such as Fosfomycin and Nitrofurantoin were only cost effective at 30–35% resistance rates to trimethoprim respectively. Infectious Diseases Society of America also continues to recommend trimethoprim when resistance rates are below 20%.

### Multidrug resistance in urinary E. coli higher in males compared to females [^ed7a287c]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common however the widespread use of antibiotics has led to a rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) amongst uropathogens, rendering a significant proportion of infections resistant to first line treatment. AMR in UTIs may differentially affect men and women, younger and older patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate MDR (multi-drug resistance) and AMR in males and females in an Australian health district.

Methods

There were 85,844 E. coli urinary isolates (2007–2020) analysed from adult patients. An E. coli isolate with MDR was defined as resistant to at least 1 agent in ≥ 3 antimicrobial classes. Chi-square tests and relative risk were calculated by comparing resistance in males and females and by age for antibiotics commonly used to treat UTIs in hospital and community collected samples.

Results

There was a higher proportion of MDR E. coli in males compared to females in both the community (6.4% vs. 5.2%, P < 0.001) and hospital datasets (16.5% vs. 12.8%, P < 0.001). The proportions of MDR for both males and females were significantly higher in the hospital setting. Resistance rates were higher in males compared to females for amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cephalexin and norfloxacin (p < 0.005), though not for trimethoprim. Antibiotic resistance was seen to increase over time.

Conclusions

A higher proportion of MDR E. coli were noted in urine samples from males compared with females, possibly due to the increased likelihood of prior treatment for UTIs in men. Antimicrobial stewardship interventions could be targeted towards this cohort to address increasing rates of AMR.

### Trends in antibiotic resistance in community-acquired urinary tract infections among children: nationwide survey [^ba2ad192]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in children. Early antibiotic treatment may prevent complications. Empirical treatment requires up-to-date knowledge of the local epidemiology. This study aims to describe trends in resistance rates in community-acquired UTI between 2017 and 2023, assess whether current recommendations for empirical treatment are valid and identify risk factors for resistance.

Methods

Data were collected retrospectively from the computerized system of Maccabi Health Services for all children under 18 years old diagnosed with a UTI in 2017, 2022 and 2023. Data was evaluated using chi-square tests and regression models to identify resistance trends and associated risk factors.

Results

A total of 24,592 urinary samples were included in the study. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated pathogen (76%-78%), with higher prevalence among females than males (78.3% vs. 59.3%, P < 0.001). Sensitivity to first-generation cephalosporins improved significantly (73% in 2017 to 82% in 2022, P < 0.001), while second- and third-generation cephalosporins showed minor fluctuations. Resistance to fluoroquinolones increased markedly, from 7% to 20% (P < 0.001). Female gender, older age, prior antibiotic use and urinary tract abnormalities were significant risk factors for resistance.

Conclusions

The increased resistance rate observed for most pathogens and antibiotics was statistically significant. Nevertheless, due to small absolute changes, the recommendations for empirical antibiotic treatment in Israel are still valid. Fluoroquinolones, which are not recommended as empirical treatment, should be avoided due to high levels of resistance.

### Research agenda for antibiotic stewardship within the veterans' health administration, 2024–2028 [^17becd41]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic use is the strongest risk factor for the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance, a global public health crisis. Mitigating this crisis must include efforts to measure and improve how antibiotics are being used in a variety of healthcare settings as well as in animals and agriculture. These types of improvement efforts are broadly described as antibiotic stewardship.

Approximately one-third of all antibiotic use occurs in human medicine; an estimated 30% of this human use is unnecessary. - Among antibiotic use that is warranted, a substantial proportion has suboptimal antibiotic selection, dosing, or duration. To improve antibiotic prescribing, antibiotic stewardship programs are now mandated for all hospitals, nursing homes, and outpatient centers in the United States that are accredited by The Joint Commission or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Before these mandates went into effect, the Veterans' Health Administration (VA), the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, published a directive that required its medical centers to develop antibiotic stewardship programs. The VA National Antimicrobial Stewardship Task Force, established in 2011, continues to provide tools and resources that support effective antibiotic stewardship. The VA is a leader in stewardship implementation and stewardship-related research, with inherent advantages that include a motivated and engaged stewardship community, a robust health services research infrastructure, national-level organization of research, and the ability to synthesize and analyze national-level data through a central data repository, the VA Corporate Data Warehouse.

Since the publication of our last VA research agenda in 2018, VA researchers have informed the practice of antibiotic stewardship on a wide variety of topics, including the frequency of antibiotic-related harms, novel metrics for evaluating a hospital's antibiotic use, clinical data on the optimal treatment of male urinary tract infections (UTIs), diagnostic stewardship of urine cultures, the diagnostic accuracy of hospital antibiograms in predicting the risk of antibiotic resistance, and approaches for providing more effective feedback to outpatient clinicians on their antibiotic-prescribing. - To encourage further innovative and impactful research within VA and to support the national effort to improve antibiotic prescribing, we herein describe important knowledge gaps about the optimal use of antibiotics and the effective use of antibiotic stewardship strategies. The aim of this expert summary document is to provide a roadmap for the next 5 years of antibiotic stewardship investigations within and outside the VA.

### Multidrug resistance in urinary E. coli higher in males compared to females [^fe64ff12]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections and reason for urological referral. Women are at a greater risk of UTIs than men and the risk increases with age. In men, UTIs are associated with increasing age and underlying urinary tract disorders such as benign prostatic hypertrophy. In both men and women, the most common uropathogen causing UTIs is Escherichia coli, responsible for over half of urinary tract infections. Antibiotic treatment failure can result in urinary sepsis, renal abscesses and impairment of renal function.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and multi-drug resistance (MDR) E. coli are a major threat to public health outcomes due to limited treatment options. Whilst AMR is a naturally occurring phenomenon in bacteria, resistance accelerates when antimicrobials are misused or overused. Almost 50% of prescribed antimicrobials to patients may be unwarranted. It is recognised that the E. coli antimicrobial resistance levels are on the rise. E. coli gain resistance through horizontal gene transfer. The common mechanisms involve genes that code for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), as well as mobile genetic elements such as integrons, transposons and conjugative plasmids. Amoxicillin resistance is common in E. coli and frequently conferred by the TEM-1/TEM-2 β-lactamase; because of the high level of resistance, amoxicillin is not recommended as empiric therapy for UTI. For trimethoprim and fluoroquinolones, resistance through mutations in dfrA and qnr genes respectively are often co-located with ESBLs.

Limited literature exists on the comparisons of AMR between males and females. To the best of our knowledge, no literature exists in Australia. The rising rates of MDR E. coli pose significant risks for treatment failures and complications, necessitating an urgent examination of resistance patterns in different populations. We previously demonstrated increasing rates of resistance in community and hospital settings. Using these databases, we compared urinary E. coli MDR rates between men and women in the region of the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District (ISLHD) of New South Wales, Australia. Secondary aims included examining differences in AMR based on age, and on community and hospital laboratory settings.

### Urinary tract infection in male general practice patients: uropathogens and antibiotic susceptibility [^d2b22e4f]. Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate uropathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility in male general practitioner (GP) patients presenting with an uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI).

Material and Methods

A population-based study was conducted among males, 18 years and older, general practice patients, who had symptoms indicative of an uncomplicated UTI. A UTI was defined as ≥ 10(3) colony-forming units/mL (CFU/mL). The etiology of the infection, antimicrobial susceptibility, and treatment strategies used by the GP were determined.

Results

Escherichia coli was most frequently isolated (48%), followed by other enterobacteriaceae (24%) and enterococci (9%). The etiology of infection was age-dependent; E. coli was more frequently isolated in younger patients and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the elderly. The overall susceptibility rates were low for amoxicillin (63%) and trimethoprim (70%), and high for fluoroquinolones (91%) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (90%), which is similar to susceptibility rates in females with UTIs from the same population. Antibiotics were prescribed to 59% of the males with symptoms of UTI. Fluoroquinolones were given to 33% of the patients and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to 24%. No difference in antibiotic prescription, nor in duration of therapy, was found between the different age groups.

Conclusions

In the male presenting with complaints of an acute uncomplicated UTI at the GP, E. coli, followed by other Gram-negative bacteria were the most frequently isolated uropathogens. Susceptibility rates in uncomplicated male and female UTIs were similar, indicating that data from UTI susceptibility studies in females from the same geographic region can be useful in the choice of empirical therapy in males.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^e6fdfc78]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) empiric therapy — process to guide choice proposes a four-step approach that includes assessing severity of illness for initial prioritization, considering patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens to optimize coverage, evaluating other patient-specific considerations to reduce adverse events, and for patients with sepsis, consulting a relevant local antibiogram if available.

### Which treatment strategy for women with symptoms of urinary tract infection? [^83d18d13]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection in women. Most women experience at least one episode during their lives, and each year about 10% receive one or more courses of antibiotics for UTI. Most women with typical symptoms are treated empirically, though up to half of them do not have clinically significant bacteriuria, and evidence indicates that many women with symptoms of UTI will recover without antibiotic treatment.

Studies that compared antibiotics with placebo in women with uncomplicated UTI report a delayed cure in the placebo group, but most become symptom free within a week. Prescribing antibiotics to patients with self limiting conditions contributes to antimicrobial resistance. The World Health Organization considers antimicrobial resistance to be one of the three most important public health problems globally, and initiatives to reduce inappropriate and superfluous prescribing are essential if we are to maintain effective antibiotic treatment for future generations.

In a linked paper, Gágyor and colleagues (doi:) report a pragmatic double blind trial to investigate whether initial treatment with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen can help to reduce antibiotic prescribing in women in primary care with symptoms suggestive of uncomplicated UTI. Nearly two thirds of women treated with ibuprofen did not receive antibiotics during the four week follow-up. They did, however, have a significantly higher burden of symptoms than women randomised to antibiotics (fosfomycin). Women given ibuprofen had their symptoms for a day longer, and about 60% (n = 143) still had still symptoms after four days compared with about half of those given fosfomycin initially. After one week, only 70% (n = 163) of women in the NSAID group were symptom free compared with 82% (n = 186) of women in the antibiotic group.

### Effect of 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic therapy on resolution of symptoms among afebrile men with urinary tract infection: a randomized clinical trial [^eae55c88]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Determination of optimal treatment durations for common infectious diseases is an important strategy to preserve antibiotic effectiveness.

Objective

To determine whether 7 days of treatment is noninferior to 14 days when using ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to treat urinary tract infection (UTI) in afebrile men.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial of afebrile men with presumed symptomatic UTI treated with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at 2 US Veterans Affairs medical centers (enrollment, April 2014 through December 2019; final follow-up, January 28, 2020). Of 1058 eligible men, 272 were randomized.

Interventions

Participants continued the antibiotic prescribed by their treating clinician for 7 days of treatment and were randomized to receive continued antibiotic therapy (n = 136) or placebo (n = 136) for days 8 to 14 of treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The prespecified primary outcome was resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after completion of active antibiotic treatment. A noninferiority margin of 10% was selected. The as-treated population (participants who took ≥ 26 of 28 doses and missed no more than 2 consecutive doses) was used for the primary analysis, and a secondary analysis included all patients as randomized, regardless of treatment adherence. Secondary outcomes included recurrence of UTI symptoms and/or adverse events within 28 days of stopping study medication.

Results

Among 272 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [62–73] years) who were randomized, 100% completed the trial and 254 (93.4%) were included in the primary as-treated analysis. Symptom resolution occurred in 122/131 (93.1%) participants in the 7-day group vs 111/123 (90.2%) in the 14-day group (difference, 2.9% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.2% to ∞]), meeting the noninferiority criterion. In the secondary as-randomized analysis, symptom resolution occurred in 125/136 (91.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 123/136 (90.4%) in the 14-day group (difference, 1.5% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.8% to ∞]) Recurrence of UTI symptoms occurred in 13/131 (9.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 15/123 (12.9%) in the 14-day group (difference, -3.0% [95% CI, -10.8% to 6.2%]; P = 0.70). Adverse events occurred in 28/136 (20.6%) participants in the 7-day group vs 33/136 (24.3%) in the 14-day group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among afebrile men with suspected UTI, treatment with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 7 days was noninferior to 14 days of treatment with regard to resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after antibiotic therapy. The findings support the use of a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as an alternative to a 14-day course for treatment of afebrile men with UTI.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^9e504cdb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. US Food and Drug Administration released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade owing to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have high rates of guideline-discordant treatment with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the current concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

Study Design

A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections at the age of 18 to 75 years were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities so that it matched the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The proportion of prescriptions for each antibiotic drug class were reported with 95% confidence intervals and compared with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Patient and physician characteristics were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of antibiotic selection and thereby guideline concordance.

Results

Of the visits that resulted in antibiotic treatment, the overall concordance rate was 58.4% (26.2 million visits of 44.9 million visits) and increased from 48.2% (3.9 million visits of 8.1 million visits) in 2015 to 64.6% (6.3 million visits of 9.8 million visits) in 2019. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic agents were fluoroquinolones (36.4%, 16.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), nitrofurantoin (31.8%, 14.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (26.3%, 11.8 million visits of 44.9 million visits). From 2015 to 2019, fluoroquinolone use decreased whereas nitrofurantoin and beta-lactam use increased. Based on the logistic regression, patients aged 18 to 29 years (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.88; P < .001) and 30 to 44 years (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.42; P = 0.020) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant treatment than patients aged 45 to 75 years (reference group). Obstetricians-gynecologists (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 2.91–4.37; P < .001) and urologists (odds ratio, 3.51; 95% confidence interval, 2.45–5.13; P < .001) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of concordant treatment than all other specialties combined (reference group).

Conclusion

Guideline discordance continues in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections with the overuse of fluoroquinolones and the underuse of first-line antibiotic agents. Although improving, continued misuse of antibiotic agents may contribute to the growing rates of antibiotic resistance. Actions such as educating physicians about antibiotic resistance and clinical practice guidelines and providing feedback on prescription habits are needed to increase guideline concordance and therefore reduce the use of fluoroquinolones, especially for physicians in family and internal medicine.

### Risk factors for empiric treatment failure in US female outpatients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection: an observational study [^85faa949]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

More than half of females experience ≥ 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and uncomplicated UTIs (uUTI) are among the most frequently occurring infections in the United States (US). The annual incidence of uUTIs is upwards of 1,500 cases per 100,000 females aged ≥ 15 years.UTIs are often treated empirically, which may lead to suboptimal outcomes, including increased risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and treatment failure (TF), when inappropriate antibiotics are prescribed. – In the US, 0.3–17% of patients with uUTIs experience TF,– with varying incidence largely driven by TF definition heterogeneity. Incidence rates approaching 20% are notable as TF is associated with increased levels of UTI-related burden, including greater activity impairment and higher direct and indirect healthcare resource use. – Patients with uUTI who experience antibiotic TF cost $570 more on average in outpatient visit expenditures compared to those without TF.

To date, there is a dearth of research assessing risk factors for antibiotic TF in uUTI. In one randomized clinical trial (RCT), treatment with fosfomycin and age ≥ 52 years were associated with clinical failure, with the latter characteristic also associated with microbiological failure. An enhanced understanding of risk factors for TF could help optimize empiric antibiotic prescribing in uUTI and reduce the burden associated with TF. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for empiric treatment in uUTI recommend considering community-level thresholds of AMR when antibiogram data are available. However, these data are often unavailable as urine culture collection is not standardized across clinics or recommended by guidelines for most cases of uUTI. Therefore, identification of risk factors of TF that can be readily assessed in clinical practice is imperative to help inform empiric antibiotic prescribing.

To advance the understanding of TF in uUTI, this study assessed the incidence of TF to empirically prescribed oral antibiotics and identified risk factors for TF in female outpatients with uUTI in the US.

### AI driven decision support reduces antibiotic mismatches and inappropriate use in outpatient urinary tract infections [^75c61ce3]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common reasons for outpatient visits and antibiotic prescriptions in adults. However, the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance among uropathogens, particularly against quinolones, challenges disease management –. The choice of antibiotics for UTI is usually made empirically since urine culture results are not immediately available at the point of care. The selection of empiric antibiotic therapy requires careful consideration of several factors, including patient background characteristics such as age, gender, pregnancy status, past infectious histories such as prior UTIs, previous antibiotic use and culture susceptibilities, local susceptibility patterns, and patient preferences –. However, even when considering these parameters, the potential risk of antibiotic mismatch in the management of UTIs remains –. In some cases, the initial antibiotic regimen may need modification based on later culture data.

Artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise in predicting UTI resistance and suggesting suitable antibiotic regimens –. These tools analyze diverse data sources, including patient characteristics and microbiological data, to predict antibiotic resistance likelihood and guide treatment decisions. Consequently, AI tools may assist clinicians in selecting the most appropriate antibiotics and minimizing the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. This can reduce the risk of developing antibiotic resistance, lower the risk of adverse effects, and improve patient outcomes.

UTI management and antibiotic therapy guidelines have been published globally. Yet studies have shown inappropriate antibiotic use for UTI in the outpatient setting and suboptimal adherence to local guidelines –. This inappropriate therapy includes the misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics and inappropriate dose or duration of therapy, which are major drivers for the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

With rising antibiotic resistance among uropathogens and concerns about antibiotic availability for UTIs, antimicrobial stewardship programs are increasingly crucial. These programs ensure appropriate antibiotic use by favoring narrow-spectrum and shorter-duration regimens, balancing risk and benefit for optimal effectiveness –. Implementing an electronic health record (EHR)-based antimicrobial stewardship program can provide a timely clinical decision support system (CDSS) –. However, there is limited data on the utility of EHR-based CDSS in improving antimicrobial prescribing behaviors, especially in the community setting and for UTI.

### Antimicrobial for 7 or 14 days for febrile urinary tract infection in men: a multicenter noninferiority double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^37a3bd2c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in men remains controversial.

Methods

To compare 7 days to 14 days of total antibiotic treatment for febrile UTIs in men, this multicenter randomized, double-blind. placebo-controlled noninferiority trial enrolled 282 men from 27 centers in France. Men were eligible if they had a febrile UTI and urine culture showing a single uropathogen. Participants were treated with ofloxacin or a third-generation cephalosporin at day 1, then randomized at day 3–4 to either continue ofloxacin for 14 days total treatment, or for 7 days followed by placebo until day 14. The primary endpoint was treatment success, defined as a negative urine culture and the absence of fever and of subsequent antibiotic treatment between the end of treatment and 6 weeks after day 1. Secondary endpoints included recurrent UTI within weeks 6 and 12 after day 1, rectal carriage of antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacterales, and drug-related events.

Results

Two hundred forty participants were randomly assigned to receive antibiotic therapy for 7 days (115 participants) or 14 days (125 participants). In the intention-to-treat analysis, treatment success occurred in 64 participants (55.7%) in the 7-day group and in 97 participants (77.6%) in the 14-day group (risk difference, -21.9 [95% confidence interval, -33.3 to -10.1]), demonstrating inferiority. Adverse events during antibiotic therapy were reported in 4 participants in the 7-day arm and 7 in the 14-day arm. Rectal carriage of resistant Enterobacterales did not differ between both groups.

Conclusions

A treatment with ofloxacin for 7 days was inferior to 14 days for febrile UTI in men and should therefore not be recommended.

### Urinary culture sensitivity after a single empirical antibiotic dose for upper or febrile urinary tract infection: a prospective multicentre observational study [^ae365dd1]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Urinary culture sensitivity after antibiotics administration is unknown. This study aimed to describe the diagnostic sensitivity of urine cultures from patients' first, second, and third micturition samples after a single dose of empirical antibiotics given for upper and/or febrile urinary tract infections, as well as searched for factors influencing diagnostic sensitivity over time.

Methods

We collected consecutive urine samples from adult patients with an upper or febrile urinary tract infection diagnosed at four secondary hospital emergency rooms. One sample was collected before a first dose of empirical antibiotic treatment and up to three samples were collected from consecutive postadministration micturition. The main outcome was the number of positive cultures growing uropathogens with ≥ 10 3 colony forming units (CFUs) for men and ≥ 10 4 for women. Identical analyses were performed for any identified CFU and ≥ 10 5 CFU cut-off points. Time between antibiotic administration and first negative urinary culture was noted, which could have been at the time of any of the three postantibiotic urine samples. We used a Cox regression analysis for age- and sex-adjusted analyses.

Results

A total of 86 of 87 patients' preantibiotic cultures (99%) were positive compared with 26 of 75 (35%; p < 0.001), 15 of 50 (30%; p < 0.001), and 1 of 15 (7%; p < 0.001) of the first, second, and third postantibiotic samples, respectively, and missing 14 of 21 (67%), 13 of 17 (76%), and 7 of 7 (100%) of uropathogens with antibiotic resistance, respectively. The times needed for 25%, 50%, and 75% of cultures to be negative were 1.5, 2.9, and 9 hours, respectively, after antibiotic administration. Older age, male sex, non-Escherichia coli pathogens, urinary tract disease, comorbidity burdens, and urinary catheters prolonged time to negative culture, but were not significantly associated after adjustment. Uropathogens were found at ≥ 10 5 CFU in 15 of 75 (20%), 7 of 50 (14%), and 0 of 15 (0%) of the three postantibiotic micturition samples, respectively, and in any identified CFU in 48 of 75 (64%), 23 of 50 (46%), and 1 of 15 (7%), respectively.

Conclusion

Urinary culture sensitivity decreases rapidly after administering antibiotics.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^60df4b65]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Policy, clinical, and research implications

Our findings detail global high level resistance to some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children primary care, which could result in several drugs becoming ineffective first line treatments in many countries. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID)recommend that an antibiotic should be selected for first line empirical treatment of urinary tract infection only if the local prevalence of resistance is less than 20%. According to these guidelines, our review suggests ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and trimethoprim are no longer suitable first line treatment options for urinary tract infection in many OECD countries and that as a result many guidelines, such as those published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), might need updating. In non-OECD countries, resistance to all first line antibiotics specified for urinary tract infections was in excess of 20% (appendix 5), suggesting that choices of first line treatment might need to be re-evaluated in less well developed countries. Our results also support the need for prescribing guidelines to reflect patterns of local resistance and that, for many areas, nitrofurantoin might be the most appropriate first line treatment for lower urinary tract infection. That said, care is needed because ruling out the use of some first line antibiotics could lead clinicians to prescribe broad spectrum second line antibiotics, such as co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, and quinolones, resulting in a vicious cycle of increasing use of broad spectrum antibiotics and bacterial resistance.

### Bacterial susceptibility to oral antibiotics in community acquired urinary tract infection [^86824d53]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The most common oral antibiotics used in the treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) are sulphonamides and cephalosporins, but emerging resistance is not unusual.

Aims

To assess the change in susceptibility of urinary pathogens to oral antibiotics during the past decade in children with community acquired UTI.

Methods

The study sample included two groups of children with a first community acquired UTI: 142 children enrolled in 1991 and 124 enrolled in 1999. UTI was diagnosed by properly collected urine specimen (suprapubic aspiration, transurethral catheterisation, or midstream specimen in circumcised males) in symptomatic patients. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was compared between the two groups.

Results

The pathogens recovered in the two groups were similar: in 1991 — E coli 86%, Klebsiella 6%, others 8%; in 1999 — E coli 82%, Klebsiella 13%, and others 5%. A slight but generalised decrease in bacterial susceptibility to common antibiotics in the two groups was shown: ampicillin 35% versus 30%; cephalexin 82% versus 63% (p < 0.001); nitrofurantoin 93% versus 92%. The only exception was co-trimoxazole, 60% versus 69%. Overall resistance to antibiotics in 1999 was as follows: ampicillin 70%, cephalexin 37%, co-trimoxazole 31%, amoxicillin-clavulanate 24%, nitrofurantoin 8%, cefuroxime-axetil 5%, nalidixic acid 3%.

Conclusions

This study shows a slight but generalised decrease in bacterial susceptibility to common oral antibiotics in the past decade in our population. Empirical initial treatment with co-trimoxazole or cephalexin is inadequate in approximately one third of UTI cases. A larger number of pathogens may be empirically treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate (24% resistance); 95% of organisms are susceptible to cefuroxime-axetil.

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: a retrospective cohort study [^9345b820]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The only subtype of potentially suboptimal antibiotic treatment that was associated with the composite poor clinical outcome and CDI in our study was potentially suboptimal dose frequency. The risk of CDI was 2.42 times higher among those treated with a suboptimal dose frequency versus optimal treatment. Potentially suboptimal dose frequency was also associated with hospitalization/ED visits and all-cause mortality. In prior work, a dose-dependent increased risk of CDI has been observed, with increasing cumulative defined daily dose of antibiotics resulting in increasing risks of CDI. Our results suggest that dose frequency, in addition to drug choice and antibiotic duration, may also impact risk of CDI and other poor outcomes.

We found no difference in risk for UTI recurrence for residents treated with potentially suboptimal or optimal antibiotic treatment. Previous work has found that among women with UTI, longer courses of antibiotics may be associated with increased risk of recurrent UTI, possibly due to alterations in urogenital flora. However, among males with UTI treated in the outpatient setting, longer treatment duration was not associated with UTI recurrence, nor was antibiotic choice. Interestingly, for unclear reasons, among the subgroup of residents treated with initial beta-lactam therapy, suboptimal treatment was associated with a decreased hazard of UTI recurrence which requires further investigation.

It is possible that suboptimal initial treatment could lead to clinical failure, the consequences of which could be serious and may include bacteremia, urosepsis, acute care hospitalization, and potentially death. In our study, suboptimal treatment was not associated with mortality. It is possible that despite being suboptimal, an appropriate agent was ultimately used considering the susceptibility of the uropathogen causing the UTI. Three previous studies have similarly demonstrated that inappropriate empiric therapy for UTI was not associated with an increased risk of mortality. Excessive treatment duration versus optimal treatment was associated with a decreased hazard of mortality. The optimal duration of treatment of males with UTI is largely unknown. In females, durations as short as 3 days are recommended for those with uncomplicated infection, but for males longer durations between 7 and 14 days are generally recommended. Further investigation is needed to determine optimal treatment duration in males to decrease the risk of treatment failure.

### Frequency and predictors of suboptimal prescribing among a cohort of older male residents with urinary tract infections [^08de0415]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Unnecessary antibiotic treatment of suspected urinary tract infections (UTI) is common in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). However, less is known about the extent of suboptimal treatment, in terms of antibiotic choice, dose, and duration, after the decision to use antibiotics has been made.

Methods

We described the frequency of potentially suboptimal treatment among residents with an incident UTI (the first during the study with none in the year prior) in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) community living centers (CLCs; 2013–2018). Time trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression. Residents with UTIs receiving potentially suboptimal treatment were compared with those receiving optimal treatment, to identify resident characteristics predictive of suboptimal antibiotic treatment, using multivariable unconditional logistic regression models.

Results

We identified 21938 residents with an incident UTI treated in 120 VA CLCs, of whom 96.0% were male. Potentially suboptimal antibiotic treatment was identified in 65.0% of residents and decreased 1.8% annually (P < .05). Potentially suboptimal initial drug choice was identified in 45.6% of residents, suboptimal dose frequency in 28.6%, and longer than recommended duration in 12.7%. Predictors of suboptimal antibiotic treatment included prior fluoroquinolone exposure (adjusted odds ratio, 1.38), chronic renal disease (1.19), age ≥ 85 years (1.17), prior skin infection (1.14), recent high white blood cell count (1.08), and genitourinary disorder (1.08).

Conclusion

Similar to findings in non-VA facilities, potentially suboptimal treatment was common but improving in CLC residents with an incident UTI. Predictors of suboptimal antibiotic treatment should be targeted with antibiotic stewardship interventions to improve UTI treatment.

### Antibiotic resistance patterns of outpatient pediatric urinary tract infections [^b2656f18]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We characterize the current national patterns of antibiotic resistance of outpatient pediatric urinary tract infection.

Materials and Methods

We examined outpatient urinary isolates from patients younger than 18 years in 2009 using The Surveillance Network®, a database with antibiotic susceptibility results and patient demographic data from 195 United States hospitals. We determined the prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns for the 6 most common uropathogens, ie Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus. We compared differences in uropathogen prevalence between males and females using chi-square analysis.

Results

We identified 25,418 outpatient urinary isolates. E. coli was the most common uropathogen overall but the prevalence of E. coli was higher among females (83%) than males (50%, p < 0.001). Other common species among males were Enterococcus (17%), P. mirabilis (11%) and Klebsiella (10%). However, these uropathogens each accounted for 5% or less of female isolates (p < 0.001). Resistance among E. coli was highest for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (24%) but lower for nitrofurantoin (less than 1%) and cephalothin (15%). Compared to 2002 Surveillance Network data, E. coli resistance rates increased for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (from 23% to 31% in males and from 20% to 23% in females) and ciprofloxacin (from 1% to 10% and from 0.6% to 4%, respectively).

Conclusions

E. coli remains the most common pediatric uropathogen. Although widely used, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a poor empirical choice for pediatric urinary tract infections in many areas due to high resistance rates. First-generation cephalosporins and nitrofurantoin are appropriate narrow-spectrum alternatives given their low resistance rates. Local antibiograms should be used to assist with empirical urinary tract infection treatment.

### The diagnosis and treatment of adult urinary tract infections in the emergency department [^b4c73bf9]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Emergency medicine has been called the art of "making complicated clinical decisions with limited information". This description is particularly relevant in the case of diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Although common, UTIs are often challenging to diagnose given the presence of non-specific signs and symptoms and over-reliance on laboratory findings. This review provides an interdisciplinary interpretation of the primary literature and practice guidelines, with a focus on diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship in the emergency department.

### Urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults [^6b6dbb1b]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant cause of morbidity among older adults. However, antibiotic prescriptions for clinically suspected UTIs are often inappropriate. Health care providers frequently struggle to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, particularly in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms. Patients with baseline cognitive impairments that limit history-taking can be particularly challenging. This article reviews the epidemiology and pathogenesis of UTI in older adults. It discusses an approach to diagnosis and treatment focused on recognizing patients who would likely benefit from antibiotic treatment and on identifying patients for whom empiric antibiotic therapy should not be given.

The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

### Antibiotic stewardship interventions for urinary tract infections in outpatient settings: a narrative review [^41ec04b0]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Inappropriate antibiotic choice or duration of therapy for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in outpatients is common and is a major contributor to antibiotic overuse. Most studies on outpatient antibiotic stewardship for UTIs follow a pre-design or post-design with a multifaceted intervention; these trials generally have found improvement in appropriateness of antibiotic use for UTI. Audit and feedback was one of the most commonly employed strategies across these trials but may not be sustainable. Future research on antibiotic stewardship for UTIs in outpatients should measure both effectiveness and implementation success.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^1ec6abc3]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Empirical therapy for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance: a decision and cost analysis [^3c30a4dc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines state that uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) should be treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), unless the community resistance among uropathogens exceeds 10%-20%, in which case a fluoroquinolone (FQ) should be used. However, the data to support this threshold are limited. We performed a cost-minimization and sensitivity analysis to determine what level of TMP-SMZ resistance in a community should trigger FQ use. The mean cost of empirical treatment with TMP-SMZ was US$92 when the proportion of resistant Escherichia coli was 0%, $106 when it was 20%, and $120 when it was 40%. The mean cost of empirical FQ treatment was $107 at current levels of FQ resistance. When > 22% of E. coli in a community are TMP-SMZ-resistant, empirical FQ therapy becomes less costly than TMP-SMZ therapy. Treatment guidelines for empirical treatment of UTIs may need modification, and the threshold trigger for empirical FQ use should be raised to > 20% TMP-SMZ resistance.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) treatment principles — treatment options "can be stratified by whether complicating features, such as known abnormal genitourinary anatomy, immunosuppression, and chronic catheterization, are present," and "Antibiotic therapy is typically used to treat active infections and prevent future infections; the treatment regimen, route, and duration will vary based on the clinical situation and should be individualized for each patient"; strategies "can be divided into treatment of an acute episode (provider prescribed or self-treatment) or prophylaxis (to prevent further episodes)"; "Whenever possible, rUTI patients should have a culture sent before treatment," although "Empiric therapy can be initiated before urine culture results if clinically indicated (such as history of UTI-related sepsis or pyelonephritis)," and "Antibiotic choice should be tailored to the individual patient and pathogens, community and patient resistance patterns, costs, drug availability, patient allergies, and patient tolerance/ability to comply"; clinicians "should be familiar with the antibiotic-resistant patterns in their communities which is generally available via antibiograms through any clinical laboratory," and "Empiric regimens should be altered if necessary based on the urine culture results."

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: a retrospective cohort study [^12901a19]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge the limitations of this retrospective cohort study. First, our study was not designed to assess causality, and there are important differences (known and unknown) between residents who received suboptimal and optimal antibiotic treatment. While we did adjust for confounders of suboptimal treatment and clinical outcomes, our findings neither confirm nor deny a causal relationship, as our findings may be confounded by unmeasured factors which affect suboptimal treatment and clinical outcomes. As such, while we found an association between suboptimal antibiotic treatment and poor clinical outcomes even after adjusting for several resident and CLC characteristics, this association may be impacted by residual confounding. Second, we defined UTI based on a urine culture and antibiotic treatment, per recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. While we excluded patients with other positive cultures and only included those exposed to common antibiotics recommended by national guidance or with reliable urinary concentrations, the antibiotic treatment captured may have been targeting another non-urinary tract infection type or asymptomatic bacteriuria. Additionally, we did not capture UTIs in which a urine culture was not obtained. Urine culturing practices are not standardized across VA CLCs, and some facilities may only recommend obtaining UTI cultures in certain clinical situations, such as recurrent infection. However, our population was mostly a complicated, male population, in which urine cultures would be generally recommended. Third, no established definitions for suboptimal antibiotic treatment of residents with UTI have been developed. There is no IDSA guidance for the treatment of complicated UTIs in males, so we based suboptimal treatment definitions on available guidelines for uncomplicated infection in females and expert opinion. Suboptimal antibiotic treatment is multifactorial and as such we considered three elements of suboptimal treatment (drug choice, dose frequency, and longer duration). However, other elements, such as drug strength and route of administration may also be suboptimal. Insufficient treatment duration is also a clinical problem. We excluded those treated for 2 days or less, but some residents may have still been exposed to insufficient treatment durations. Future research should continue to investigate and operationalize the definition of suboptimal antibiotic treatment among residents with UTI. Additionally, while we conducted analyses by subtype of suboptimal treatment, comparative analyses are warranted to determine which individual aspects of suboptimal antibiotic treatment (the drug choice, dose frequency, or longer than recommended duration) are the most strongly associated with poor outcomes. Forth, we measured all-cause hospitalizations, ED visits, and mortality. Our frail older resident population is already at risk for these events and many of the events observed may have not been related to antibiotic use. Alternatively, we likely underestimated antibiotic-related adverse events, as these events may not have been coded or other codes were used. Adverse events are difficult to identify in large databases as they are often not recorded in health claims and reports. Fifth, while we investigated five potential harms of suboptimal antibiotic use, we did not assess the development of colonization or infection with resistance, which is a well-known harm of antibiotic use. Finally, the generalizability of our findings conducted in a largely older male population may be limited to other non-VA long-term care populations.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^16b6bc0f]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. Use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Current treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to current clinical practice guidelines. Patients who have been inappropriately treated with antibiotics for a UTI (e.g. treating those with asymptomatic bacteriuria) have worse outcomes, which may include subsequent infections with multidrug‐resistant organisms or substantial medication side effects. Patients who have an inappropriate initial antibiotic prescription are also subjected to additional drug costs and are at risk of antibiotic switching which can cost up to $2000 more per patient.

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs produce worse patient outcomes, increased healthcare costs, and higher societal antibiotic burden. The goals of our study were to evaluate the factors associated with inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of cystitis in the outpatient setting in a set of patients diagnosed with UTI without signs of bacteremia.

### CQUIN audit for prescription of antibiotics for urinary tract infections in an acute medical assessment unit [^f87549c5]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common diagnosis in medical admissions unit. NHS Choices states that around half of all UK women will have a UTI at least once in their lives and one in 2000 healthy men will have one at least once a year. There is a higher mortality and morbidity associated with UTIs in critically ill patients, and it is important that UTIs are treated promptly and adequately.

Moreover, numerous studies have shown an increasing resistance to several common antibiotics; of note in 2001 the first international survey of prevalence and susceptibility of organisms causing uncomplicated UTIs in the community (ECO-SENS Project), found that 42% E. coli isolated (accounting for 77% of pathogens cultured) was resistant to one or more of the more common antibiotics. The microbiology departments of hospital Trusts develop guidelines on first and second line antibiotics to treat infections based on local organisms and sensitivities.

### Multidrug resistance in urinary E. coli higher in males compared to females [^6bd966c2]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated increasing rates of MDR among urinary E. coli isolates in an Australian local health district, which was more prominent in males compared to females, in particular in the hospital setting. This body of work contributes to our understanding of changes in resistance patterns, providing valuable insight for clinicians to make informed antibiotic choices for UTIs in certain patient groups. The result highlights the need for caution when using trimethoprim as a first-line agent, emphasises clinician awareness of potential MDR and the risk of initial therapy failure and underscores the importance of obtaining cultures for susceptibility results before antibiotics, to guide effective treatment.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^f5916536]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

### Children with recurrent urinary tract infections: who are they and why do we need better prevention options? [^29467d3a]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common infections in children, and those with congenital malformations of the urinary tract are at risk of recurrent UTIs (rUTIs), which can lead to renal scarring, chronic renal failure, reduced renal perfusion, and hypertension. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), which is present in 30% to 40% of children with UTIs, has been associated with rUTI. Other risk factors include the absence of circumcision, bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD), and fecal retention.

The standard of care for children at risk of rUTIs includes antimicrobial prophylaxis, whose effectiveness in preventing rUTIs and renal scarring remains controversial. Prolonged antibiotics use can lead to adverse events, and some studies suggested that prophylaxis does not reduce renal scarring and may increase antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Moreover, UTIs are often treated empirically, with treatment adjusted once the uropathogen's susceptibility profile is available.

Interventions aimed at reducing the occurrence of rUTIs without the reliance on antibiotics are imperative, but the populations that would most benefit from this intervention remain uncertain. This study aimed to identify the pediatric population most susceptible to rUTIs in a urology clinic, evaluate antibiotic use and assess the risk of AMR.

### Syndromic antibiograms and nursing home clinicians' antibiotic choices for urinary tract infections [^4742487d]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 85% of antibiotic treatment courses in nursing homes (NHs) are initiated empirically before results of cultures are available. Up to two-thirds of these empirical choices are inappropriate and may result in harms from not providing active coverage as well as providing too broad of activity. Harms of exposure to multiple antibiotic classes or overly broad therapy include increased risk of developing C difficile diarrheaand future infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, as well as spread of resistant bacteria to other NH residents. In NHs, over 90% of performed cultures are from urine samples, and urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common indication for antibiotic initiation. Improving the quality of empirical antibiotic decisions is a critical step toward improving antibiotic safety and effectiveness in NHs.

Cumulative susceptibility reports, commonly called antibiograms, summarize the susceptibility rates of bacteria recovered from cultures collected in a health care facility over a specific time frame. Clinicians can use these tools to guide empirical antibiotic choices, increasing the likelihood that the first prescribed antibiotic will provide adequate activity while awaiting culture and other diagnostic studies. Syndromic antibiograms, limited to cultures from a specific body site, can provide more targeted empirical antibiotic recommendations that only include antibiotic choices appropriate to the specific syndrome. The outcomes of antibiograms specific to bacteria isolated from urine on empirical antibiotics selected by NH clinicians has not been well characterized.

Our objective was to assess how urinary antibiograms may be associated with empirical antibiotics selected by NH clinicians treating clinically suspected UTIs. We hypothesized that NH clinicians using a urinary antibiogram would be more likely to select empirical antibiotics that were active against potential urinary pathogens. We further hypothesized that compared with a traditionally formatted urinary antibiogram, NH clinicians using a weighted-incidence syndromic antibiogram (WISCA)would be more likely to select antibiotics that were not only active but also optimal in the treatment of NH residents with clinically suspected UTI. To test our hypotheses, we asked NH clinicians to participate in an electronic survey that included 4 clinical vignettes describing NH residents with UTIs. Survey participants were randomized to use a traditional antibiogram (TA), a WISCA, or no antibiogram when selecting empirical antibiotics for each case.

### Lower urinary tract infections: management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic Re-prescription in primary care [^66bb3fd4]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTIs) are a common reason for consultation in primary care, where most suspected episodes are managed. Uncomplicated lower UTIs generally resolve quickly and many are self-limiting, but 11% of women report to have experienced at least one UTI and 3% report to have experienced three or more UTIs in the previous year. There are marked differences across four European countries in culture positivity, antibiotic prescribing and re-consultation, despite similarities in the presentation of UTI in primary care, the pathogens and antibiotic sensitivities. The high incidence of UTI and tendency to recur leads to high healthcare costs.

UTIs are the second most common reason for antibiotic prescribing. In the UK, recent national clinical guidelines recommend treatment of lower UTIs with narrow spectrum antibiotics, particularly nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim, when the risk of resistance is low (e.g. considering previous antibiotic use and previous urine culture and sensitivity results). Amoxicillin or oral cephalosporins are advised for second or third line therapy for pregnant women and children aged 3 months or more. Choice of second line antibiotic therapy in adult men should be guided by culture results after considering alternative diagnoses to UTIs. Antibiotic use, even in short courses, can alter the normal microbial composition of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina, selecting for drug-resistant pathogens. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of five studies of UTIs managed in primary care found an increased risk of antibiotic resistance that persisted for up to one year and a higher risk associated with multiple courses of antibiotics. Evidence of a dose–response between the number of courses of amoxicillin and trimethoprim and resistance also exists. Antibiotic resistance is associated with higher morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. It is therefore important to avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and to make appropriate choices to treat UTIs.

This study aimed to describe current investigation, antibiotic treatment and antibiotic re-prescription rates (as a likely indicator of treatment failure) across the spectrum of all lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) managed in primary care in England, with reference to current guideline-defined groups of patients.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns for adult urinary tract infections within emergency department and urgent care settings [^40f2f18f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a common reason for emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) visits. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) are frequently prescribed for treatment of UTI in the outpatient setting; however, data evaluating prescribing patterns after FDA safety warnings is limited, especially in UC. The study goal was to investigate and compare antimicrobial prescribing for UTIs in a single-site ED and an off-site UC in an urban, academic health system. This retrospective study included patients presenting with a UTI to the ED or UC between January and June 2018. Those 18 years or older with uncomplicated, complicated UTI, or pyelonephritis were included. Exclusion criteria were catheter-related UTI, urinary tract abnormalities, immunocompromised, or hospitalization. Primary outcome was FQ prescribing rate for all UTI in the ED and UC. Secondary outcomes were rates of non-FQ prescribing, re-presentation, bug-drug mismatch, and treatment durations. 184 patients were included. FQ prescribing rate was similar in ED and UC (21.2% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.4). Non-FQs prescribed in ED and UC were nitrofurantoin (20.2% vs 53.6%), beta-lactams (46.1% vs 22.6%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (12.5% vs. 5%). A longer than recommended duration was identified in 46.3% UC patients compared to 21.2% ED patients. Thirty-day re-presentation with persistent UTI symptoms occurred more frequently in the ED compared to UC (13.5% vs. 7.5%). Predictors of FQ prescribing on logistic regression were male, recurrent UTI, and malignancy. FQ prescribing rate for UTI treatment was low with no difference between ED and UC. Opportunity exists to improve treatment duration and antimicrobial choice.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^9026c0c0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7–14 days) for older patients than for younger women, but the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not clear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies marketing antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections, screened the reference list of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched the following data bases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials in which different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women were compared. We excluded patients with fever or flank pain and those with complicating factors. Trials with treatment durations longer than 14 days or designed for prevention of urinary tract infection were also excluded. No language restriction was applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

The quality of all selected trials was assessed and data extracted by the reviewers. Main outcome measures were persistence of urinary symptoms (short-term and long-term efficacy), effect on mental and functional status and adverse drug reactions. To compare the different treatment durations, we defined the following categories of duration: single dose, short course (3–6 days) and long course (7–14 days). Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial and outcome and were then combined using a random effects model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials were included in this review. Six trials compared single dose with short-term treatment (3–6 days), three studies single dose with long-term treatment (7–14 days) and four trials short-term with long term treatment. Eight trials also included younger patients, but provided a subgroup analysis for elderly women. The methodological quality of all trials was low. All trials reported results of bacteriological cure rate; less often clinical outcomes (e.g. improvement or cure of symptoms) were analyzed. Only five trials compared the same antibiotic given for a different length of time. We performed a separate analysis for these trials. The rate of persistent bacteriuria rate at short-term (two weeks post-treatment) was better in the longer treatment group (3–14 days) than in the single dose group (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.86). However, the rate of persistent bacteria at long term and the clinical cure rate showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Patients showed a preference for single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), however this was based on only one trial comparing the same antibiotic. The comparison of short (3–6 days) and longer treatments (7–14 days) did not show any significant difference, but the number of included studies and sample size were low.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review suggests that single dose antibiotic treatment is less effective but may be better accepted by the patients than longer treatment durations (3–14 days). In addition there was no significant difference between short course (3–6 days) versus longer course (7–14 days) antibiotics. The methodological quality of the identified trials was poor and the optimal treatment duration could not be determined. We therefore need more appropriately designed randomized controlled trials testing the effect, - on clinical relevant outcomes -, of different treatment durations of a given antibiotic in a strictly defined population of elderly women.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^0845abca]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, ranking as the second most frequent indication for antibiotic prescribing in the outpatient setting. The majority of UTIs are "uncomplicated," occurring in non-pregnant adult women who are not immunocompromised and have normal genitourinary structure and function. Each year, 12.6% of women will have a UTI, and half of all women will have at least one UTI by age 32. The standard of care for uncomplicated UTI is oral antibiotic therapy, which typically leads to rapid symptom resolution and reduces the risk of complications such as pyelonephritis.

In recent years, growing antibiotic resistance has led to efforts to use antibiotics more judiciously. Specifically for uncomplicated UTIs, these initiatives have sought to reduce the amount — either duration or frequency — and spectrum of antibiotics. – Interviews with women indicate willingness to delay or avoid antibiotic prescriptions when safe to do so. Furthermore, some UTIs are self-limited without treatment and thus may not require antibiotic therapy. For example, a randomized controlled trial comparing nitrofurantoin with placebo for uncomplicated UTI demonstrated spontaneous symptomatic cure or improvement in over half of participants receiving placebo who had UTIs as proven by a combination of symptoms/signs and positive laboratory testing. While a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials found placebo to be inferior to antibiotics for resolution of UTI symptoms, it is unclear whether non-antibiotic treatment regimens for uncomplicated UTIs may be feasible as an outpatient antibiotic stewardship strategy. For example, cranberry extract was initially considered a potential antibiotic-sparing option; however, subsequent research has not supported its use in the treatment of UTI over antibiotics.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^75ae50f2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including postsurgery and instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.– To cover these, if IV antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended, with a child's individual history guiding whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessment of the likelihood of resistance is part of management (see below).

Multiple recurrent UTIs, defined by 2 or more UTIs caused by different organisms, are a risk for resistant and MDR bacteria. Although recurrent UTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include VUR, underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization and UTI prophylaxis, and girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough. For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected ESBL-E, empiric oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones and fosfomycin. Empirical IV options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or clinical risk is higher, IV amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine and can avoid broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem use. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance to tobramycin but remain susceptible to amikacin, due to reduced inactivation by bacterial enzymes. If cultures grow Klebsiella pneumoniae with high bacterial inoculum, empirical B-lactam antibiotics should be switched to a different class. With a high bacterial inoculum, the stationary phase is rapidly reached, so the effect of targeting penicillin-binding proteins is rapidly diminished, and an alternative is better. In the large majority, carbapenems should be spared since their use is the greatest risk for developing carbapenem resistance. Even with a history of recurrent UTI with resistant uropathogens, empirical carbapenems are rarely needed in children with cUTI unless a child presents with sepsis (see below). – If the identified uropathogen is MDR, including carbapenem-resistant, options include a carbapenem plus amikacin combination, colistin and newer B-lactam/B-lactamase antibiotics such as ceftazidime-avibactam. Since methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an uncommon uropathogen, this rarely needs to be covered empirically. P. aeruginosa (susceptible and resistant) is more common in recurrent UTIs, so it should be empirically treated with oral quinolones or IV aminoglycosides.

### Appropriate antibiotic treatment of genitourinary infections in hospitalized patients [^01e3a0d3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The etiology of urinary tract infections (UTIs) that require hospitalization, whether they originate in the hospital or in the community, is changing, with increasing findings of gram-positive organisms. The Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) criteria recommend evaluating treatment choices on the basis of sound clinical evidence, potential for therapeutic benefits, safety, optimal duration of treatment, and cost-efficacy in order to improve antibiotic treatment. Evidence-based guidelines recommend fluoroquinolones for the treatment of patients with cases of pyelonephritis or bacterial prostatitis severe enough to warrant hospitalization. For other serious UTIs, fluoroquinolones are usually recommended either when traditional agents have failed or when resistance to traditional agents is high. Even in the context of rapidly changing antimicrobial resistance patterns, the fluoroquinolones have maintained consistent, well-tolerated efficacy against many of the principal organisms responsible for UTIs, and are generally considered safe for most patients. To increase the likelihood of treatment success with first-line therapy, an antimicrobial agent must attain sufficient concentrations in the target tissue or in the urine for an appropriate amount of time. Both levofloxacin and gatifloxacin are excreted unchanged in the urine in concentrations that far exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration of most uropathogens. Factors that affect cost-effectiveness that should be considered include acquisition costs as well as treatment success and ease of use for hospital staff.

### Acute uncomplicated UTIs in adults: rapid evidence review [^4f91305f]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract with no sign of systemic illness or pyelonephritis in a noncatheterized, nonpregnant adult with no urologic abnormalities or immunocompromise. In women, a self-diagnosis of a UTI with the presence of typical symptoms (e.g., frequency, urgency, dysuria/burning sensation, nocturia, suprapubic pain), without vaginal discharge, is accurate enough to diagnose an uncomplicated UTI without further testing. Urine culture and susceptibility testing should be reserved for women with recurrent infection, treatment failure, history of resistant isolates, or atypical presentation to make a definitive diagnosis and guide antibiotic selection. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin for five days, fosfomycin in a single dose, trimethoprim for three days, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days. Symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and delayed antibiotics may be considered because the risk of complications is low. Increased fluids, intake of cranberry products, and methenamine hippurate can prevent recurrent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is also effective in preventing recurrence but has a risk of adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. Men with lower UTI symptoms should always receive antibiotics, with urine culture and susceptibility results guiding the antibiotic choice. Clinicians should also consider the possibility of urethritis and prostatitis in men with UTI symptoms. First-line antibiotics for men with uncomplicated UTI include trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin for seven days. Uncomplicated UTIs in nonfrail women and men 65 years and older with no relevant comorbidities also necessitate a urine culture with susceptibility testing to adjust the antibiotic choice after initial empiric treatment; first-line antibiotics and treatment durations do not differ from those recommended for younger adults.

### Unnecessary antibiotics in older female patients with recurrent urinary tract infections [^f1307b3b]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over 50% of female patients experience at least one episode of uncomplicated UTI during their lifetime, and 20–30% will have recurrent episodes. Recurrent UTI, defined as at least two infections within 6 months or at least three within a year, affects female individuals of all ages but older women are disproportionately affected with the rate doubling after age 65.

Unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, i.e. antibiotic use for a condition when it is not recommended based on best practices, is a well-known contributor to multi-drug antibiotic resistance, adverse events, and gut dysbiosis that increases risk of future UTIs. According to practice guidelines, antibiotics for UTI should be prescribed to female patients with recurrent UTI only when symptoms attributable to UTI (UTI-specific symptoms) are present and urine culture demonstrates the presence of an organism with pathogenic potential. This decision making is challenging in older female patients who have a high rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria, where bacteria with pathogenic potential are present in urine culture in the absence of UTI-specific symptoms, a common scenario for which antibiotics are not recommended. The rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria, already high at 15–20% in older women, increases to 30% in those with recurrent UTI. Additional challenges that clinicians face when prescribing antibiotics to older female patients include differentiating symptoms of UTI from other common co-existing conditions such as overactive bladder and genitourinary syndrome of menopause as well as pressure from patients and caregivers to prescribe antibiotics when only nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and memory changes are present and which should not be attributed to UTI. In these clinical scenarios, an antibiotic for UTI may be prescribed in the presence of documented negative urine culture, absent pyuria, or even without any urine tests. Most antibiotic stewardship programs have focused on hospitalized patients; however, the majority of antibiotics for UTI are prescribed in outpatient visits to physicians' office and emergency rooms. Consequently, there is a lack of data on the rate of unnecessary antibiotics and the clinical scenarios in which they are prescribed to older female patients with recurrent UTI in the ambulatory setting.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^a24a48ff]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance is an internationally recognised threat to health. The contribution of primary healthcare is particularly important as this is where almost 80% of all antibiotics used within the health service are prescribed. Bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics can limit the availability of effective treatment options, rendering some commonly encountered bacterial infections difficult to treat, including those of the urinary tract. Antibiotic resistant infections are also twice as likely to be associated with greater morbidity and mortality and are associated with increased healthcare costs. In low income countries, affordability of second line drugs and reduced access to healthcare can restrict the use of newer broad spectrum antibiotics, resulting in growing concerns for increased morbidity and mortality from antibiotic resistant infections in these countries.

Children receive a lot of primary healthcare services and, as such, receive a disproportionately high number of antibiotics compared with middle aged populations. Children are also key drivers of infection within communities and can contribute to the spread of bacteria from person to person. Despite this, little research has been published describing the prevalence of bacterial resistance in children or the risk factors of importance in this group. In 2010, Costelloe and colleagues conducted a systematic review that reported strong associations between previous exposure to routinely prescribed antibiotics in primary care and antimicrobial resistance persisting for up to 12 months. Most of the contributing studies, however, were conducted in adults.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections seen in primary care. In children with a suspected urinary tract infection, the most common management strategy is to treat empirically with an antibiotic while results of culture and sensitivity testing are awaited. Young children are more vulnerable to immediate and long term complications, including renal scarring and renal failure, and therefore require prompt appropriate treatment. Escherichia coli is responsible for over 80% of all urinary tract infectionsand is also the most common cause of bacteraemia and foodborne infections and a cause of meningitis in neonates.

We conducted a systematic review to investigate the prevalence of resistance in community acquired E coli urinary tract infection to the most commonly prescribed antibiotics given to children in primary care and to quantify the relation between previous exposure to antibiotics in primary care and bacterial resistance. We stratified results by OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) status of the study countries as antibiotics tend to be used differently in these groups. In the more developed OECD countries antibiotics are obtained mostly only by prescription, whereas in "developing" non-OECD countries many antibiotics, including those commonly used to treat urinary tract infection, can be obtained over the counter, without the need for a prescription.

### Development of predictive models to inform a novel risk categorization framework for antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli-caused uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^35983055]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common outpatient infections in the United States (US), with an estimated lifetime incidence of 50%‒60% in female adults. Approximately 80% of UTIs are classified as uncomplicated UTI (uUTI), which is one of the most common indications leading to antibiotic prescriptions in females. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend nitrofurantoin (NTF), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), and fosfomycin as first-line treatments, while antibiotics such as β-lactams and fluoroquinolones are recommended as alternative options. Despite guideline recommendations, prescribing practices not aligned with IDSA guidelines are common, with 86.1% of patients prescribed alternative antibiotic agents as first-line therapy. These inappropriate prescribing practices contribute to increased healthcare costs and development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which leads to treatment failure, persistent uUTI symptoms, and adverse events.

Approximately 80% of uUTIs are caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), and rising prevalence of AMR is a growing concern. A recent US study of urinary E. coli isolates from female outpatients ≥ 12 years of age found that 25.4%, 21.1%, and 3.8% were nonsusceptible to SXT, fluoroquinolones, and NTF, respectively, and 6.4% had extended-spectrum β-lactamase production. In clinical practice, challenges in identifying patients with uUTI at risk of having a nonsusceptible isolate to commonly prescribed antibiotics can lead to inappropriate empiric prescribing. One novel method to help inform empiric prescribing by clinicians in uUTI is using a data-driven approach, such as predictive modeling, to identify patients at higher risk of having a nonsusceptible isolate to commonly prescribed antibiotics, thereby facilitating improved empiric prescribing practices in uUTI and mitigating development of AMR. Recently, predictive modeling has been used to identify important factors that contribute to risk of nonsusceptibility to antibiotic treatments for uUTI. To date, none have developed a corresponding risk categorization framework that contextualizes different AMR risk profiles.

To address this gap, this study developed and validated predictive models to estimate probabilities of E. coli nonsusceptibility to 4 commonly prescribed classes of antibiotic treatments for uUTI, identified key predictors of nonsusceptibility to the 4 classes of antibiotic treatments, and constructed a novel risk categorization framework for nonsusceptibility to the 4 classes of antibiotic treatments.

### Characteristics of febrile urinary tract infections in older male adults [^7110906b]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are among the most frequent bacterial infections in older adults. The aim of the study was to analyse the existence of differences in clinical features, microbiological data and risk of infection by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) between older and non-older men with febrile UTI (FUTI).

Methods

This was an ambispective observational study involving older males with a FUTI attended in the Emergency Department. Variables collected included age, comorbidity, diagnostic of healthcare-associated (HCA)-FUTI, clinical manifestations, hospitalization, mortality, and microbiological data.

Results

Five hundred fifty-two males with a FUTI, 329 (59.6%) of whom were older adults, were included. Older males had a higher frequency of HCA-FUTI (p < 0.001), increased Charlson scores (p < 0.001), had received previous antimicrobial treatment more frequently (p < 0.001) and had less lower urinary tract symptoms (p < 0.001). Older patients showed a lower frequency of FUTI caused by E. coli (p < 0.001) and a higher rate of those due to Enterobacter spp. (p = 0.003) and P. aeruginosa (p = 0.033). Resistance rates to cefuroxime (p = 0.038), gentamicin (p = 0.043), and fluoroquinolones (p < 0.001) in E. coli isolates and the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC producing E. coli and Klebsiella spp. strains (p = 0.041) and MDRO (p < 0.001) were increased in older males. Inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment (p = 0.004), frequency of hospitalization (p < 0.001), and all cause in-hospital mortality (p = 0.007) were higher among older patients. In the multivariate analysis, being admitted from an long term care facility (OR 2.4; 95% CI: 1.06–5.9), having a urinary tract abnormality (OR 2.2; 95% CI: 1.2–3.8) and previous antimicrobial treatment (OR 3.2; 95% CI: 1.9–5.4) were associated to FUTI caused by MDRO.

Conclusions

Older male adults with a FUTI have different clinical characteristics, present specific microbiological features, and antimicrobial resistance rates. In the multivariate analysis being an older male was not associated with an increased risk of FUTI caused by MDRO.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^fcad96c4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7 to 14 days) for older women, but the evidence for such recommendations is unclear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTI in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies, screened reference lists of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International and Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings without language restriction. Date of most recent search: 7 May 2008.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTIs in elderly women were included. Whenever possible we obtained outcome data for older women included in studies with a broader age range. We excluded patients with fever, flank pain or complicating factors; studies with treatment durations longer than 14 days and prevention studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Fifteen studies (1644 elderly women) were included. Three studies compared single dose with short-course treatment (3 to 6 days), six compared single dose with long-course treatment (7 to 14 days) and six compared short- with long-course treatment. Methodological quality of all studies was low except for a more recent geriatric study. There was a significant difference for persistent UTI between single dose and short-course treatment (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.84) and single versus long-course treatment (RR 1.93, 1.01 to 3.70 95% CI), in the short-term (< 2 weeks post-treatment) but not at long-term follow-up or on clinical outcomes. Patients preferred single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88) to long-course treatments, but this was based on one study comparing different antibiotics. Short versus longer treatments showed no significant difference in efficacy. Rate of adverse drug reactions increased significantly with longer treatment durations in only one study.

Authors' Conclusions

Short-course treatment (3 to 6 days) could be sufficient for treating uncomplicated UTIs in elderly women, although more studies on specific commonly prescribed antibiotics are needed.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^caf7a445]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Risk factors for empiric treatment failure in US female outpatients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection: an observational study [^7166efb7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In this real-world study, we observed an appreciable proportion of female outpatients with uUTI experiencing TF to empirically prescribed, currently available oral antibiotics. Previous antibiotic prescriptions, recurrent UTI, ED setting, and Southern US region were identified as key patient-level risk factors for TF, highlighting the role of prior infections and location of care in subsequent TF. Knowledge of these TF risk factors can be used in clinical practice to inform shared-decision making and supplement existing guidance on appropriate oral antibiotic treatment selection for uUTI in relation to known local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, urine analysis, and the potential need for urine culture and sensitivity testing. Future studies can provide additional insights by investigating the association between AMR and TF in uUTI, including the impact of community non-susceptibility rates on risk of TF.

### Managing uncomplicated urinary tract infections… [^7f335487]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Besides resistance patterns, antibiotic choice should include consideration of the patient's allergy history, the cost and tolerability of the medication, and previous antibiotic use. TMP-SMX has been the standard therapy for UTIs; patients with a sulfa allergy can take trimethoprim alone and achieve a similar cure rate. Side effects include skin rash, nausea, and vomiting. Patients who are concomitantly taking sulfonylureas need glucose monitoring because of the enhanced glucose-lowering effects of TMP-SMX. TMP-SMX therapy should be avoided in patients with liver impairment. Fluoroquinolones provide good coverage for common uropathogens and cause minimal side effects. Fluoroquinolones should not be taken with products that contain cations, because absorption of the fluoroquinolones will be decreased. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should also avoid these antibiotics.

Beta-lactam antibiotics are no longer useful as first-line treatment for UTIs because of increased resistance and higher recurrence rates compared with other agents; however, they may be useful if urine culture indicates susceptibility. Third-generation cephalosporins have lower resistance rates and longer half-lives, allowing for less frequent dosing. The most common side effects of the beta-lactams include rash, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and headache. Nitrofurantoin can be used in patients with normal renal function. Side effects are rare but may include malaise, cough, and dyspnea. Pulmonary fibrosis may rarely occur with long-term use. Fosfomycin is used as a single-dose treatment that is generally well tolerated but may cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or esophageal discomfort. Antibiotics and dosing information for the treatment of UTIs are listed in.

Short-course therapy using three days of antibiotics appears to provide similar eradication rates with fewer side effects than a seven- to 10-day course. Patients who may benefit from the longer course of therapy include women who are pregnant, who have diabetes mellitus, or who have a history of urinary tract symptoms. The authors conclude that TMP-SMX and the fluoroquinolones are useful first-line treatments for uncomplicated cystitis. Other options include a seven-day course of nitrofurantoin or a single dose of fosfomycin.

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^c2cbe3ee]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Results

Characteristics of physicians and patients

This study included a total of 37 physicians and 185 patients. Physicians' and patients' characteristics are summarised in tables1 2. Notably, the distribution of factors involved in the physician decision-making was almost similar for all the included physicians.

Table 1
Characteristics of physicians (n = 37)

Table 2
Characteristics of patients (n = 185)

In general, almost all physicians relied on the clinical evaluation to establish the diagnosis. While urine analysis and culture were prescribed in 49% and 27% of simple cystitis cases, respectively, they were almost universally prescribed for the remaining types of UTIs.

Characteristics and types of UTIs

The most frequent diagnosis in our sample was simple cystitis (71.4% of cases), followed by prostatitis (18.9%), then complicated cystitis, simple pyelonephritis and complicated pyelonephritis with 3.2% of cases each. 20 patients with simple cystitis (15.2%) in our sample were men.

Cultures were positive in 47.6% of cases. The most frequent germ detected was Escherichia Coli (51.2%). The most frequently prescribed ATB was Amoxicillin clavulanate, while the most prevalent class was fluoroquinolones (figure 1 and online supplemental appendix 2).

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^7565d1d4]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, it is important to note that our manual chart review revealed that ~75% of patients who were diagnosed with a UTI by diagnostic code did not meet the definition or clinical criteria for a UTI diagnosis. This suggests that we must reconsider the data that exist on UTI from claims‐based databases that underlie many of our currently held beliefs about this condition. Genitourinary symptoms, particularly when uncomfortable or painful, appear to be frequently misdiagnosed, which complicates the clinical care of patients with these symptoms, particularly women. Rates of pelvic pain among women are estimated at 14%–40%, and at least half of these patients have genitourinary symptoms. Only a third of these women end up getting care and 50% never even receive a diagnosis. If most genitourinary complaints in women are written off as a UTI, it both prevents us from understanding how best to manage actual acute cystitis and recurrent UTIs in women who have them and does a tremendous disservice to the patients with other genitourinary complaints who are not getting treatment for their true, underlying disorder.

Suboptimal treatment of women with genitourinary symptoms leads to additional healthcare costs, worse patient outcomes, and increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance. Although treatment is reasonable for patients with symptomatic UTIs to relieve symptoms, shorten duration of symptoms, and prevent progression, our data suggest that the majority of UTIs are inappropriately diagnosed and overtreated in both the ER and office‐based settings; treatment rates of 95% in the ER and 55% in outpatient settings far exceed the rates of urinary symptoms of 28% in both settings. It is of note that treatment rates were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the ER versus office‐based settings despite similar levels of urinary symptoms and positive cultures between the groups. The equitable care of women requires appropriate consideration of the complete differential diagnosis for nonspecific genitourinary and generalized symptoms; providers should not assume any genitourinary complaint is indicative of a UTI. Consideration of a complete differential is especially important in elderly women with non‐localizing symptoms. Given the challenges providers face in delivering care in the ER setting, this discrepancy in the appropriateness of UTI care further supports the current movement to transition to a "medical home model" that can provide better comprehensive and accessible care that may prevent much of this overtreatment.

### Characteristics of febrile urinary tract infections in older male adults [^75431aac]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent exposure to antimicrobials, as in previous studies, was also associated with FUTI due to MDRO. Antimicrobial consumption is particularly high among residents of LTCF. It has been estimated that 75% of the residents of LTCF who stay for 6 months or longer will receive at least one course of antibiotics, commonly for suspected UTI in older patients with pyuria or ASB and non-specific urinary symptoms. Given the burden of inappropriate management of ASB, particularly in LTCF, it is crucial to establish antimicrobial stewardship programs that have demonstrated to decrease antimicrobial consumption.

In an attempt to decrease antimicrobial overtreatment it has been recommended to avoid therapy in older patients with ASB and non-specific urinary symptoms or even to defer it in case of mild urinary symptoms awaiting urine culture results. These recommendations have been questioned in an article by Gharbi et al. in which the authors suggest that not prescribing or deferring antimicrobials in older patients with a UTI increases the risk of bloodstream infection, hospital admission and all-cause mortality.

Older males with underlying urinary tract abnormalities also had an increased risk of infection by MDRO. Although having urinary abnormalities has been considered a risk factor for having UTI caused by resistant uropathogens different studies show conflicting results. While Lee et al. observed a relationship between bacteremic UTI caused by MDRO and different urinary tract abnormalities, in a study by Gomila et al. only the presence of an IUC was associated with UTI caused by MDRO in hospitalised patients.

Once a FUTI is diagnosed, an empirical antimicrobial treatment has to be started to avoid progression to sepsis or even septic shock. In our study, older males received more frequently a carbapenem or piperacillin-tazobactam than non-older male. The decision to indicate a broad spectrum antibiotic should be based on the severity of the infection, the presence of known risk factors for MDRO and the local antimicrobial resistance rates. An increase in the consumption of carbapenems has been identified as a driver for carbapenemase resistance among Enterobacteriaceae strains. In the present study, 21% of the older males received an IAET, which was lower than the frequency described in previous studies in older patients with UTI with rates that ranged from 27.4 to 29.3%.

### Antibiotic utilization and efficacy associated with treating pediatric urinary tract infections in Texas medicaid patients in the first year of life [^21c1b167]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Historically, amoxicillin (Amoxil) has been used as a first-line agent to treat pediatric urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, emerging antibiotic resistance in urinary pathogens has led to broader treatment options, such as cefdinir (Omnicef). This shift in prescribing practices is predicted to vary among place of service and gender due to differing institutional protocols and antimicrobial stewardship practices.

Objective

This study aimed to describe the antibiotic utilization patterns associated with treating pediatric UTIs in Texas Medicaid patients and to assess the real-world efficacy of the antibiotics that were prescribed.

Methods

Texas Medicaid prescription and medical claims data for patients under 1 year of age were included in the analysis if they presented with a UTI to the healthcare practitioner's office or the emergency department (ED) and were treated with an outpatient antibiotic. Treatment efficacy was assessed by whether a patient received a second (different) antibiotic within 7 days of their initial antibiotic fill.

Results

A total of 12,795 visits met inclusion criteria; 12,561 visits included prescriptions for the top 4 antibiotics prescribed: cefdinir (50%), amoxicillin (25%), cephalexin (Keflex; 13%), and amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin; 12%). Cefdinir utilization predominated in both places of service [office (50%) and ED (55%)], and gender [males (47%) and females (52%)]. Controlling for gender and place of service, initial treatment with amoxicillin when compared with cefdinir (OR = 2.54; 95% confidence intervals: 1.84–3.54; P < 0.001) was associated with a greater rate of treatment failure.

Conclusions

In this study of Texas Medicaid patients, the widespread utilization of cefdinir may be appropriate for the empiric treatment of uncomplicated UTIs because of its low rate of treatment failure compared to other commonly used antibiotics.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^25bb8edc]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotics (guidance for selection), IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to account for patient-specific factors, such as risk of allergic reactions, contraindications, and drug-drug interactions, when selecting empiric antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected complicated UTI, to avoid preventable adverse events.

### Clinical management of an increasing threat: outpatient urinary tract infections due to multidrug-resistant uropathogens [^a7626cc0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most commonly treated bacterial infections. Over the past decade, antimicrobial resistance has become an increasingly common factor in the management of outpatient UTIs. As treatment options for multidrug-resistant (MDR) uropathogens are limited, clinicians need to be aware of specific clinical and epidemiological risk factors for these infections. Based on available literature, the activity of fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin remain high for most cases of MDR Escherichia coli UTIs. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole retains clinical efficacy, but resistance rates are increasing internationally. Beta-lactam agents have the highest rates of resistance and lowest rates of clinical success. Fluoroquinolones have high resistance rates among MDR uropathogens and are being strongly discouraged as first-line agents for UTIs. In addition to accounting for local resistance rates, consideration of patient risk factors for resistance and pharmacological principles will help guide optimal empiric treatment of outpatient UTIs.

### Appropriate use of short-course antibiotics in common infections: best practice advice from the American College of Physicians [^5c5476b6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Description

Antimicrobial overuse is a major health care issue that contributes to antibiotic resistance. Such overuse includes unnecessarily long durations of antibiotic therapy in patients with common bacterial infections, such as acute bronchitis with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and cellulitis. This article describes best practices for prescribing appropriate and short-duration antibiotic therapy for patients presenting with these infections.

Methods

The authors conducted a narrative literature review of published clinical guidelines, systematic reviews, and individual studies that addressed bronchitis with COPD exacerbations, CAP, UTIs, and cellulitis. This article is based on the best available evidence but was not a formal systematic review. Guidance was prioritized to the highest available level of synthesized evidence.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should limit antibiotic treatment duration to 5 days when managing patients with COPD exacerbations and acute uncomplicated bronchitis who have clinical signs of a bacterial infection (presence of increased sputum purulence in addition to increased dyspnea, and/or increased sputum volume).

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should prescribe antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia for a minimum of 5 days. Extension of therapy after 5 days of antibiotics should be guided by validated measures of clinical stability, which include resolution of vital sign abnormalities, ability to eat, and normal mentation.

Best Practice Advice 3

In women with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis, clinicians should prescribe short-course antibiotics with either nitrofurantoin for 5 days, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) for 3 days, or fosfomycin as a single dose. In men and women with uncomplicated pyelonephritis, clinicians should prescribe short-course therapy either with fluoroquinolones (5 to 7 days) or TMP-SMZ (14 days) based on antibiotic susceptibility.

Best Practice Advice 4

In patients with nonpurulent cellulitis, clinicians should use a 5- to 6-day course of antibiotics active against streptococci, particularly for patients able to self-monitor and who have close follow-up with primary care.

### D-mannose for preventing and treating urinary tract infections [^0dec87ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are very common, affecting more than 7 million people worldwide. Whilst many people may only experience a single episode in their lifetime and are generally responsive to standard antibiotics, a significant proportion of adults and children (approximately 15% to 25%) are chronic symptomatic UTI sufferers. Certain population groups are at greater risk than others, such as immunosuppressed and people with chronic kidney disease. D-mannose is a sugar part of normal human metabolism found within most diets. The mechanism of action is to prevent bacterial adherence to the uroepithelial cells. The D-mannose-based inhibitors can block uropathogenic Escherichia coli adhesion and invasion of the uroepithelial cells. The bacteria are then understood to essentially be eliminated by urination. Early pilot studies on animals and humans have trialled concentrated forms of D-mannose (tablets or sachets) in doses ranging from 200 mg up to 2 to 3 g and found possible efficacy in reducing UTI symptoms or recurrence. Although the anti-adhesive effects of D-mannose have been well-established, only recently have we seen a small number of pilot studies and small clinical trials conducted.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of D-mannose for preventing and treating UTIs in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 22 February 2022 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs measuring and reporting the effect of D-mannose, in any combination and any formulation, to prevent or treat UTIs in adults and children, females and males, in any setting (including perioperative). Authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts and, where necessary, the full text to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was independently carried out by two authors using a standard data extraction form. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross-checked by another author. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs (719 participants) in adult females and males who had either acute cystitis or a history of recurrent (at least two episodes in six months or three episodes in 12 months) UTIs (symptomatic or asymptomatic). Two were prevention studies, four were prevention and treatment studies (two perioperative and one in people with multiple sclerosis), and one was a treatment study. Time periods ranged from 15 days to six months. No two studies were comparable (by dose or treatments), and we could not undertake meta-analyses. Individual studies reported no clear evidence to determine whether D-mannose is more or less effective in preventing or treating UTIs. D-mannose (2 g) had uncertain effects on symptomatic and bacteriuria-confirmed UTIs when compared to no treatment (1 study, 205 participants; very low certainty evidence) and antibiotics (nitrofurantoin 50 mg) (1 study, 206 participants; very low certainty evidence). D-mannose, in combination with herbal supplements, had uncertain effects on symptomatic and bacteria-confirmed UTI and pain when compared to no treatment (1 study, 40 participants; very low certainty evidence). D-mannose 500 mg plus supplements (N-acetylcysteine and Morinda citrifolia fruit extract) had uncertain effects on symptomatic and bacteriuria-confirmed UTIs when compared to an antibiotic (prulifloxacin 400 mg) (1 study, 75 participants; very low certainty evidence). Adverse events were very few and poorly reported; none were serious (mostly diarrhoea and vaginal burning). Overall, the quality of the evidence is poor. Most studies were judged to have unclear or high risk of bias across most domains. Data was sparse and addressed very few outcomes. The GRADE evaluation was rated as very low certainty evidence due to very serious limitations in the study design or execution (high risk of bias across all studies) and sparse data (single study data and small sample sizes).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently little to no evidence to support or refute the use of D-mannose to prevent or treat UTIs in all populations. This review highlights the severe lack of high-quality RCTs testing the efficacy of D-mannose for UTIs in any population. Despite UTIs being one of the most common adult infections (affecting 50% of women at least once in their lifetime) and the growing global antimicrobial resistance, we found very few studies that adequately test this alternative treatment. Future research in this field requires, in the first instance, a single adequately powered RCT comparing D-mannose with placebo.

### EAU guidelines on urological infections [^838660fd]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bacterial prostatitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to do not use ciprofloxacin or other fluoroquinolones as empirical therapy in patients from urology departments or when patients have used fluoroquinolones in the last 6 months.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^4bcb9279]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Table 3 — Antibiotic regimens for acute cystitis treatment in women with recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — details first- and second-line options with dosing and precautions. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID × 5 d with the note to "Avoid if early pyelonephritis suspected," trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg BID × 3 d with the caution to "Avoid if resistance prevalence known to be > 20%," and fosfomycin trometamol 3 g single dose. Second-line antibiotics list fluoroquinolones with "Dose varies by regimen; typically 3-d regimen" and β-lactams with "Dose varies by regimen; typically for 3–7 d," and the table specifies, "Do not use ampicillin or amoxicillin for empirical treatment." Self-initiated regimens mirror these doses: nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID × 5 d, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg BID × 3 d, and fosfomycin trometamol 3 g.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^54864520]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that there were similar clinical cure rates between 7 and 14 days of treatment during longer follow-up (70–84 days post-treatment) and this holds both for women and men. In others words, the need for additional antibiotic UTI treatment during longer follow-up is similar irrespective of whether the initial treatment of fUTI was 7 or 14 days. Given the principles of antimicrobial stewardship, this is an interesting finding because, even in men with fUTI, this might be an argument to treat them for 7 days. Indeed, our study indicates that a further study upon treatment duration of men with fUTI should be performed, including outcome measures being set at 3 months or even longer instead of the traditional 2–6 weeks.

Given the consistency of our findings and those of the recent study in Sweden, we conclude that women with fUTI, irrespective of disease severity and comorbidities, can be treated orally with 7 days of adequately dosed fluoroquinolones. Ciprofloxacin was chosen as treatment because of its reliable intestinal resorption and bioavailability, and excellent antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of susceptible gram-negative uropathogens, making it a drug of choice in both outpatient as well as hospital settings. As a surplus, activity against perineum and vagina colonizing Enterobacteriaceae may help to prevent early recurrences. An important concern has been the rise of ciprofloxacin resistance in the community, i.e. up to 15% of Enterobacteriaceae are currently resistant in The Netherlands, that may preclude the use of fluoroquinolones as first-choice empiric oral treatment of fUTI. Of great concern, in other countries, this figure has been reported as high as 40–50%. In countries with concurrent high rates of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, there may be no oral antibiotic option left for general practitioners to treat fUTI at home, raising healthcare costs. These findings underscore the importance of controlling antimicrobial resistance through antibiotic stewardship, including the administration of antibiotics with optimal duration.

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^f970fe5c]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children — empiric therapy and limited fluoroquinolone role — emphasizes cephalosporins for uncomplicated cases and restricts fluoroquinolones to severe presentations. Standard empiric therapy for uncomplicated UTI in the pediatric population continues to be a cephalosporin antibiotic agent, because TMP-SMX– and amoxicillin-resistant E coli are increasingly common. The fluoroquinolones remain potential first-line agents only in the setting of pyelonephritis or complicated UTI.

### Antibiotic switches in urinary tract infection are associated with atypical symptoms and emergent care [^dab2458d]. Urogynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance

Given worsening global antibiotic resistance, antimicrobial stewardship aims to use the shortest effective duration of the most narrow-spectrum, effective antibiotic for patients with specific urinary symptoms and laboratory testing consistent with urinary tract infection (UTI). Inappropriate treatment and unnecessary antibiotic switching for UTIs harms patients in a multitude of ways.

Objective

This study sought to analyze antibiotic treatment failures as measured by antibiotic switching for treatment of UTI in emergent and ambulatory care.

Study Design

For this retrospective cohort study, 908 encounters during July 2019 bearing a diagnostic code for UTI/cystitis in a single health care system were reviewed. Urinary and microbiological testing, symptoms endorsed at presentation, and treatments prescribed were extracted from the medical record.

Results

Of 908 patients diagnosed with UTI, 64% of patients (579/908) received antibiotics, 86% of which were empiric. All patients evaluated in emergent care settings were prescribed antibiotics empirically in contrast to 71% of patients in ambulatory settings (P < 0.001). Of patients given antibiotics, 89 of 579 patients (15%, 10% of all 908 patients) were switched to alternative antibiotics within 28 days. Emergent care settings and positive urine cultures were significantly associated with increased antibiotic switching. Patients subjected to switching tended to have higher rates of presenting symptoms inconsistent with UTI.

Conclusions

Empiric treatment, particularly in an emergent care setting, was frequently inappropriate and associated with increasing rates of antibiotic switching. Given the profound potential contribution to antibiotic resistance, these findings highlight the need for improved diagnostic and prescribing accuracy for UTI.

### Evaluation of optimal treatment for urinary tract infections in outpatient clinics at an academic medical center: opportunities for antimicrobial stewardship [^79135684]. American Journal of Infection Control (2022). Medium credibility.

Outpatient empiric urinary tract infection (UTI) prescribing is an area of interest for antimicrobial stewardship efforts. We conducted a retrospective chart review evaluating optimal antibiotic prescribing for UTIs in our internal medicine and urology clinics and found significant differences in prescribing patterns between provider type and UTI category. These data will inform our antimicrobial stewardship efforts in these clinics.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^402463ca]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 50% of women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, making it the third most common indication for antibiotic treatment in the US after respiratory tract infection and skin and soft-tissue infections. Treatment guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2011 encouraged the use of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line treatments for uncomplicated UTI on the basis of their effectiveness and relatively limited adverse event profile. Fluoroquinolones are listed as an alternative option because of their predilection for selecting for multidrug-resistant organismsand their association with serious adverse events, including Clostridium difficile colitis. Despite this, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are still the most commonly used antibiotics in the treatment of UTI, which may reflect the real or perceived threat of antibiotic resistance to the first-line agents. The guidelines list β-lactams as an inferior alternative because they are associated with reduced treatment effectiveness.

The evidence supporting the IDSA treatment guidelines is based on a small number of randomized clinical trials and observational studies, many of which were completed several decades ago. Although those studies provided important information for policymaking, they were limited in terms of the diversity of patients they recruited and were performed at a time when standards of care and health care–seeking behavior differed greatly from current practice. Furthermore, the pathogen strains in circulation at the time of these studies have likely been replaced by new strains that may have a differential response to drug therapies, regardless of their susceptibility phenotype. Therefore, a re-evaluation of management strategies for uncomplicated UTI could provide useful information for treating clinicians and policymakers. In this study, we sought to estimate treatment effectiveness and adverse events for guideline-concordant and guideline-discordant treatments for UTI using causal inference supported by machine learning applied to a large contemporary claims dataset.

### Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^85c92aa4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In the past, seven day antibiotic therapy was recommended while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.

Objectives

TO compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. We scanned references of all included studies and contacted the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing three-days oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65 years old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference between three-day and 5–10 day antibiotic regimen was seen short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.28) and long-term follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.27). Comparison of the bacteriological failure rates showed that three-day therapy was less effective than 5–10 day therapy for the short-term follow-up, however this difference was observed only in the subgroup of trials that used the same antibiotic in the two treatment arms (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, P = 0.01). This difference was more significant at long-term follow-up (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.73, P = 0.0002). Adverse effects were significantly more common in the 5–10 day treatment group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, P = 0.0010). Results were consistent for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Three days of antibiotic therapy is similar to 5–10 days in achieving symptomatic cure during uncomplicated UTI treatment, while the longer treatment is more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure. In spite of the higher rate of adverse effects, treatment for 5–10 days could be considered for treatment of women in whom eradication of bacteriuria is important.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^21bec297]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens — recent antibiotic class exposure: In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest avoiding fluoroquinolones if the patient has been exposed to that class of antibiotic in the past 12 months (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that more recent antibiotic exposure may be a better guide than more distant antibiotic exposure.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^e7bb3d98]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — antibiogram use: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis (including acute pyelonephritis), we make no specific recommendation about using an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice (no recommendation, knowledge gap). Patients who are not septic have a lower risk of mortality from cUTI (less than or equal to 5%) and initial inappropriate empiric antibiotic choice has little impact on mortality, and routine use of broader-spectrum agents in suspected complicated UTI without sepsis may drive antimicrobial resistance without substantial patient benefit.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infection (rUTI) antimicrobial therapy and stewardship — use of new agents and prescribing strategies: "Promising new antimicrobials such as the first oral carbapenem, sulopenem, may also provide outpatient therapies for patients with high multidrug resistance or antibiotic-intolerant individuals at high risk of infection progression," yet "these agents should still be reserved for those with high multidrug resistance." For prescribing practices, "It may be reasonable to consider collaboration with infectious disease specialists before prescribing to reduce unnecessary prescribing." Regarding prevention, "Preliminary data suggests that continuous prophylaxis with low-dose antibiotics leads to lower rates of antibiotic resistance and fewer adverse events than intermittent treatment of symptomatic episodes," while "little is understood about the short- and long-term consequences of antibiotic use, particularly intermittent, high-dose use."

Antibiotic treatment — Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). In patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes associated with urine cultures resistant to oral antibiotics, clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion).

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^8a99847a]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

These patient encounters were from a large, tertiary medical center in a major metropolitan city with high patient volumes. Although our data were collected from multiple ERs and > 200 medical practice offices, analysis of a single healthcare system may limit the generalizability of our findings. Therefore, our results may not be reproducible in community‐based or smaller‐volume practice settings. As this was a retrospective cohort study, it is difficult to establish causality between any patient factors and UTI diagnosis and treatment patterns. Data were collected via manual chart review and therefore relies on physician documentation, which can be unreliable. Rates of asymptomatic UTIs may be overestimated if patient symptoms were not properly documented in the medical record. The performance of a manual chart review can provide insight on provider rationale, but additional research is needed to identify why UTI treatment rates and patterns vary in the ER and office setting. Patients with medical comorbidities associated with complicated UTIs were included in this analysis, and thus these results are unlikely to be able to be extrapolated to that population. Providers may be empirically treating patients deemed higher risk for complicated UTIs, but without the comparison of those populations, further research is necessary to determine if results are similar in these risk‐stratified populations.

### Current antibiotic resistance patterns of rare uropathogens: survey from central European urology department 2011–2019 [^d96c96e9]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

With approximately 150–250 million cases occurring globally per year, urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent some of the most common infectious diseases in humans. Gram-negative enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. are their most common causative agents. UTIs occur more frequently among women than in men: 50% of females will experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. Recurrences are common and besides associated morbidity, UTIs put pressure on health care systems, too. While the cost of treatment of a single UTI episode is insignificant, their frequent incidence means they consume a non-negligible part of the health care budget: in France alone, the expense for adult female UTIs amounted to 58 million euro in 2012. Complicated UTIs are even more costly: one episode of a complicated UTI costs between 4028 and 7740 euro depending on the health care system.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a major concern threathening many an advance of medicine in the twenty-first century. Uropathogenic microorganisms are no exception to this: rates of AMR among Enterobacteriaceae are increasing globally, albeit with temporal and spatial differences. Antibiotic consumption is a primary driver for the spread of AMR as evidenced on local and country levels. For instance, southern European states exhibit higher AMR rates than northern ones. Of note, four top antibiotic prescribers in Europe (Greece, Cyprus, France and Italy) belong among south European countries.

International guidelines for UTI treatment are freely available; yet, poor antibiotic prescription remains common. Thirty percent of primary care antibiotic prescriptions were inadequate in a report from the United States. Appropriate antibiotic treatment was reported in 68% of adult cystitis cases and only 46% of pyelonephritis cases in another survey.
