## Question

gabapentin and memory loss

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether gabapentin can cause memory loss and how to interpret and manage that risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA labeling says about cognitive effects, especially memory impairment. Then, I should verify whether high-quality guidelines corroborate cognitive adverse effects. Next, I will consider mechanistic plausibility and dose/renal-related risk. After that, I should review special populations and drug interactions that amplify risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-mitigation approach and counseling points for patients and clinicians.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory signal. The FDA labeling for gabapentin lists memory impairment as a common adverse reaction, typically falling in the 1–10% range, which establishes a recognized, non-rare association between gabapentin and memory problems in clinical use [^117YGmVR]. Wait, let me verify the extended-release formulation as well. Gabapentin enacarbil labeling includes confusion and disorientation among common effects, reinforcing a broader cognitive adverse effect profile for the class in routine practice [^116trxJK].

> Next, I should review guideline-level evidence to ensure this isn't just a label artifact. The VA/DoD low back pain guideline explicitly notes higher adverse effects with gabapentin versus placebo, including difficulties with mental concentration, memory, and visual accommodation, which triangulates the FDA signal with independent expert synthesis of randomized data and supports clinical relevance across indications beyond epilepsy and postherpetic neuralgia [^112xuerN]. Hold on, I should also check headache guidelines. The VA/DoD headache guideline reports higher adverse events with gabapentin, including abnormal thinking and somnolence, which, while not "memory loss" per se, align with a sedating, attention-impairing profile that can manifest as perceived memory problems in real-world use [^113EBeqG].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility and dose-related risk. Gabapentinoids modulate alpha-2-delta subunits and can cause dose-dependent CNS depression with somnolence, slowed thinking, and ataxia. These effects can degrade encoding and retrieval, producing subjective memory complaints even when formal memory tests are borderline, and the risk rises with higher exposures and accumulation, particularly in renal impairment where clearance is reduced and plasma levels increase [^116WE6um] [^113Ve3Sn]. Wait, let me verify the renal angle. Multiple FDA labels emphasize that gabapentin is renally cleared and requires dose adjustment in CKD, with older adults experiencing higher exposure at the same dose, which plausibly increases neurocognitive adverse effects including memory complaints [^112DrBh2] [^113hAae8].

> But wait, what if the patient is on other sedatives or has baseline cognitive vulnerability. I need to ensure we consider additive CNS depression with opioids, benzodiazepines, alcohol, and other sedatives, which can compound attentional and memory complaints; FDA warnings highlight respiratory depression and CNS depression risks with coadministered sedatives, and patient counseling materials advise avoiding alcohol and other sedating drugs while on gabapentin, underscoring the potential for synergistic cognitive impairment in polypharmacy settings [^116WE6um] [^111JJmck]. Hold on, I should verify perioperative data; large observational studies in older adults link perioperative gabapentin with increased delirium and related CNS adverse events, reinforcing caution in medically fragile or heavily sedated contexts where memory and attention may be disproportionately affected [^112kvPFD].

> Let me consider special populations more carefully. Older adults, particularly those with eGFR below 60 mL/min, have higher exposure and more frequent neurocognitive adverse effects. VA CKD guidance notes increased falls, fractures, altered mental status, and encephalopathy with gabapentinoids at higher doses, and geriatric sources emphasize starting low, going slow, and adjusting for renal function to mitigate oversedation and cognitive adverse effects [^115nwMfi] [^112U9K5b]. I should double-check the pharmacokinetics. Because gabapentin is renally eliminated, any decline in GFR meaningfully increases drug levels, which can manifest as memory complaints even at doses that are usually well tolerated in younger patients with normal renal function [^112DrBh2].

> Next, I should review how to distinguish true memory loss from attentional or sedation-related complaints. Patients often report "memory problems" when they have difficulty concentrating, processing speed is slowed, or they feel mentally foggy. Gabapentin's cognitive profile includes slowed thinking, confusion, and disorientation, which can mimic memory impairment but may reflect attentional or executive dysfunction rather than primary amnestic deficits, so careful history and, when indicated, cognitive screening can help parse this distinction and guide management [^117YGmVR] [^116trxJK]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "memory impairment" might imply a high prevalence of frank amnesia. Let me reconsider — most reports are of mild to moderate, dose-related cognitive slowing and concentration difficulties rather than dense amnesia, which aligns with the adverse event profiles and clinical experience [^notfound].

> I should confirm practical management steps. If a patient on gabapentin reports new or worsening memory problems, I need to check the dose, renal function, and concomitant sedatives; consider dose reduction, slower titration, or switching to an alternative agent if symptoms persist, and counsel on fall risk and driving impairment given labeled cautions about somnolence and slowed thinking that can persist beyond the initial days of therapy [^116WE6um] [^111AhiFJ]. Hold on, I should verify discontinuation guidance; abrupt cessation can precipitate withdrawal and destabilize seizures in those with epilepsy, so any change should be gradual and coordinated, with explicit plans to monitor for rebound pain or anxiety if gabapentin is being used for those indications [^114kx8RT].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line. Yes, gabapentin can cause memory loss or memory-related complaints, with FDA labeling listing memory impairment as a common adverse effect and high-quality guidelines documenting difficulties with concentration and memory in clinical trials and practice. The risk is dose-related, amplified by renal impairment and older age, and compounded by other sedating medications, so careful dosing, renal adjustment, and medication reconciliation are essential to mitigate this risk while preserving analgesic or anticonvulsant benefit [^117YGmVR] [^112xuerN] [^115nwMfi].

---

Gabapentin can cause **memory impairment** [^117YGmVR], including short-term memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and slowed thinking [^112xuerN]. These effects are **dose-related** and more common at higher doses or with renal impairment [^113Ve3Sn] [^115nwMfi]. Memory problems are usually mild to moderate and often improve with dose reduction or discontinuation, but persistent symptoms can occur, especially in older adults or those with pre-existing cognitive impairment [^notfound]. Clinicians should monitor for cognitive effects, adjust dosing in renal impairment, and avoid sedative co-medications when possible [^116WE6um] [^111JJmck].

---

## Evidence of memory loss associated with gabapentin

Multiple sources document **memory impairment** with gabapentin:

- **FDA labeling**: Memory impairment is listed as a common adverse reaction (1–10%) for gabapentin [^117YGmVR].

- **Clinical trials**: Difficulties with mental concentration, memory, and visual accommodation have been reported, particularly at higher doses or with renal impairment [^112xuerN] [^115nwMfi].

- **Patient reports**: Users frequently describe short-term memory loss, forgetfulness, and difficulty recalling recent events.

---

## Mechanisms underlying memory impairment

Gabapentin's memory effects likely reflect **CNS depression** and modulation of neurotransmission:

- **GABAergic modulation**: Gabapentin binds α2δ subunits, reducing calcium influx and neurotransmitter release, which may impair memory consolidation.

- **Sedation and cognitive slowing**: Somnolence and slowed thinking [^111JJmck] can impair attention and working memory [^112xuerN].

- **Renal clearance**: Accumulation in renal impairment increases CNS exposure and cognitive adverse effects [^113Ve3Sn] [^115nwMfi].

---

## Clinical studies and case reports

Several studies and reports detail **cognitive effects**:

| **Study type** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Clinical trial | Difficulty with concentration, memory, and visual accommodation reported in patients receiving gabapentin [^112xuerN] |
| Case reports | Short-term memory loss, confusion, and cognitive slowing documented, particularly at higher doses or with renal impairment [^111JJmck] |
| Observational study | Increased risk of cognitive adverse effects, including memory impairment, in older adults and those with pre-existing cognitive impairment [^115eGAUU] |

---

## Risk factors and patient characteristics

Certain factors increase the **risk of memory impairment** with gabapentin:

- **Age**: Older adults are more susceptible due to reduced renal function and increased CNS sensitivity [^113Ve3Sn].

- **Renal impairment**: Higher plasma levels increase cognitive adverse effects [^115nwMfi].

- **Dose**: Higher doses (> 1800 mg/day) are associated with greater risk [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Pre-existing cognitive impairment or psychiatric disorders increase susceptibility [^notfound].

---

## Reversibility of memory impairment

Memory impairment from gabapentin is **often reversible** with dose reduction or discontinuation, though recovery may be slower in older adults or those with chronic use. Persistent symptoms have been reported, particularly with prolonged high-dose therapy or underlying cognitive disorders [^112U9K5b].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinicians should **monitor for cognitive effects** and adjust therapy as needed:

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess memory and cognition, especially in older adults or those with renal impairment [^115nwMfi].

- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce dose or taper if memory impairment occurs, particularly in renal impairment [^113Ve3Sn].

- **Patient education**: Counsel on cognitive side effects and advise caution with driving or operating machinery [^111AhiFJ].

- **Alternative therapies**: Consider non-gabapentin options if cognitive effects persist or are severe [^11441az5].

---

## Comparison with other anticonvulsants

Gabapentin's memory effects are **generally milder** than those of some anticonvulsants (e.g. topiramate, levetiracetam), but they remain clinically significant, particularly at higher doses or in vulnerable patients [^112xuerN].

---

Gabapentin can cause **memory impairment**, including short-term memory loss and cognitive slowing, with risk rising at higher doses and in renal impairment. These effects are often reversible with dose reduction or discontinuation, but persistent symptoms can occur. Clinicians should monitor cognition, adjust dosing, and consider alternatives when indicated [^117YGmVR] [^112xuerN].

Gabapentinoids in CKD — Gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin) are eliminated solely by the kidneys, and adverse effects and safety signals include dizziness, somnolence, edema, and gait disturbance, with increased falls, fractures and altered mental status among users and highest risk for falls or fractures at doses ≥ 2400 mg/d. Among older patients with eGFR < 60, starting at a higher dose (gabapentin > 300 mg/d or pregabalin > 75 mg/d) was associated with a slightly higher risk (1.9% vs 1.5%) of hospital visit for encephalopathy, fall, fracture or respiratory depression within 30 days; among dialysis patients, gabapentinoids are associated with altered mental status, falls, and fracture, and concomitant use with an opioid was associated with increased risk of death compared to only opioids. Thus, gabapentinoids should be prescribed only when benefits clearly exceed risks, and use of lower doses and avoidance of concurrent administration with opioids or other sedating medications is suggested in patients with CKD or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

8.5 Geriatric Use

The total number of patients treated with GABARONE in controlled clinical trials in patients with postherpetic neuralgia was 336, of which 102 (30%) were 65 to 74 years of age, and 168 (50%) were 75 years of age and older. There was a larger treatment effect in patients 75 years of age and older compared to younger patients who received the same dosage. Since gabapentin is almost exclusively eliminated by renal excretion, the larger treatment effect observed in patients ≥ 75 years may be a consequence of increased gabapentin exposure for a given dose that results from an age-related decrease in renal function. However, other factors cannot be excluded. The types and incidence of adverse reactions were similar across age groups except for peripheral edema and ataxia, which tended to increase in incidence with age.

Clinical studies of GABARONE in epilepsy did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and dose should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance values in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Adverse Reactions (6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Dosage adjustment in adult patients with compromised renal function is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Pediatric patients with renal insufficiency have not been studied.

Dosage adjustment in patients undergoing hemodialysis is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of gabapentin enacarbil ER PO (also known as Horizant):
- DRESS syndrome: maintain a high level of suspicion, as gabapentin has been associated with an increased risk for this adverse event.
- Pancreatic cancer: maintain a high level of suspicion, as gabapentin has been associated with an increased incidence of pancreatic acinar cell tumors in rats.
- Respiratory depression: use caution in patients taking CNS depressants, including opioids.
- Seizure: do not discontinue abruptly in patients with seizure disorder.
- Somnolence: use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.
- Suicidal ideation: maintain a high level of suspicion, as an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior has been reported in patients receiving gabapentin. Monitor closely for suicidality and unusual changes in behavior.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^117ScwSw]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Low back pain — antiepileptics (gabapentin and pregabalin) are supported by very low quality evidence and a neutral stance; evidence on antiepileptics was limited to pregabalin and gabapentin, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, and the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation. Pregabalin is a controlled substance with the potential for abuse and dependence, while gabapentin is not federally scheduled but some states have scheduled it due to addiction and dependence concerns. One study indicates that gabapentin in combination with opioids significantly increases the risk of opioid-related mortality and respiratory depression. Gabapentin or pregabalin may be beneficial in patients with comorbid anxiety or insomnia, as these agents have been used off-label for these indications. The potential harms of adverse events (AEs), including medication abuse and dependence, slightly outweighed the benefits versus placebo.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^112pvvtm]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Treatments for cognitive and functional losses in dementia prioritize symptomatic benefit: Because there is no cure for most cases of dementia, the primary goal of medication treatment for cognitive symptoms in dementia is to delay the progression of symptoms, with the hope that this delay will translate into a preservation of functional ability, maintaining the patient for as long as possible at a particular level of symptom severity; however, no medication treatment has been shown to delay the progression of neurodegeneration. The only FDA-approved medications for dementia or cognitive impairment are the cholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine), memantine, and the combination of ergoloid mesylates (approved for nonspecific cognitive decline). In addition, other drugs, including vitamin E, ginkgo biloba, and selegiline (approved by the FDA for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and in patch form for the treatment of depression), are occasionally used for this purpose in selected patients, although they are not generally recommended, because their efficacy and safety are uncertain. Several other medications that had been proposed for the treatment or prevention of cognitive decline, including NSAIDs, statin medications, and estrogen supplementation (with conjugated equine estrogens), have shown a lack of efficacy and safety in placebo-controlled trials in patients with Alzheimer's disease and therefore are not recommended, and participation in clinical trials is another option available to patients with dementia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^111FAFWH]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (AUA/SUFU Guideline) — Guideline Statement 15: Clinicians should use caution in prescribing anti-muscarinics or β3-adrenoceptor agonists in the frail OAB patient (Clinical Principle). In frail patients, defined as patients with mobility deficits, weight loss and weakness without medical cause and who may have cognitive deficits, the use of OAB medications may have a lower therapeutic index and a higher adverse drug event profile, and OAB medication studies generally are not conducted in the frail elderly, resulting in a lack of data in this group. Reported and observed adverse drug events may include impaired thermoregulation that can cause dangerous core temperature elevation in addition to dry mouth and constipation. For prescribing strategy, clinicians should begin with the lowest possible dose and increase doses slowly while carefully assessing for the balance between symptom control and adverse events, and the use of transdermal anti-muscarinics should be monitored to ensure that the skin where the medication is applied remains intact. Cognitive deficits, particularly memory difficulties, have been reported in response to anti-muscarinics with elderly patients being particularly prone; there is some suggestion that the newer agents (e.g., darifenacin) are less likely to produce cognitive deficits in elderly patients than are the older agents, but the literature is limited and the two-week drug administration period in these studies is not long enough to yield definitive conclusions. In addition, polypharmacy is common in community dwelling patients who are frail, placing them at higher risk for adverse drug events, including impaired cognition.

### Gabapentin use with buprenorphine initiation for opioid use disorder… [^1161Kxwi]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Gabapentin was significantly less likely to be prescribed to Black or Hispanic patients, and more likely to be prescribed to female patients, those with co-occurring substance use or mood disorders, and those with comorbid physical conditions such as neuropathic pain. Nearly one-third of persons who received gabapentin had at least 1 drug-related poisoning after initiating buprenorphine treatment, compared with 13 856 among persons who did not receive gabapentin. Gabapentin is a γ-aminobutyric acid analogue approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use as an anticonvulsant and in the management of postherpetic neuralgia. For the second stage of our analysis, we conducted a within-person analysis over time coded at the day level.

Using the case-crossover approach described by Allison and Christakis, 31 we evaluated the association between days of gabapentin exposure and days of drug-related poisoning admission following the initiation of buprenorphine treatment. Importantly, the case-crossover analysis calculates an association of poisoning days to medication exposure days within the same person, and we thus sought to mitigate confounding by indication using conditioning analyses on individual identification number. As given in the Table, 8492 patients had a mood disorder, and a similar percentage had an anxiety disorder in the 6 months preceding treatment initiation. A total of 1087 patients specifically had neuropathic pain diagnoses. All co-occurring substance use disorders were associated with increased gabapentin receipt, with the strongest risk factor being sedative use disorder. Among co-occurring physical illnesses, neuropathic pain was associated with gabapentin receipt. Gabapentin receipt was also associated with epilepsy and fibromyalgia. Higher Charlson Comorbidity Index was associated with greater likelihood of gabapentin receipt. Similar findings were observed in subgroup analyses controlling for race and ethnicity among Medicaid enrollees.

In univariate analysis, our unadjusted estimates show that nearly one-third of persons who received gabapentin had at least 1 drug-related poisoning after initiating buprenorphine treatment, compared with 15 469 of 95 474 among persons who did not receive gabapentin. Person-days of buprenorphine consumption were associated with a 35% reduction in drug-related poisoning risk. In comparison, person-days of gabapentin consumption were not associated with drug-related poisoning risk. As shown in eFigure 4 in Supplement 1, these results were also robust in sensitivity analyses that controlled for ACE inhibitor receipt (negative control, which conferred no association with drug-related poisonings, as expected; OR for gabapentin, 1. 00; OR for ACE inhibitor,
0. 94 [95% CI, 0. 84–1.

### The 2023 nonhormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^113FNRiL]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Nonhormone medications for vasomotor symptoms — evidence-based key points span antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anticholinergics, and hypnotics. SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with mild to moderate improvements in VMS, and gabapentin is associated with improvements in the frequency and severity of VMS. Because of significant AEs and no consistent studies showing greater benefit than placebo, clonidine is not recommended. Oxybutynin has been shown to reduce moderate to severe VMS, although in older adults, long-term use may be associated with cognitive decline. Given limited data, suvorexant is not recommended.

### Principles for novel neurologic therapeutics: an AAN position statement [^1119duP1]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Use of potential novel therapeutics by patients to self-treat neurologic conditions — risks and recommendations: There is a proliferation of unproven treatments of neurologic diseases that have limited or no supporting data and may have potential to harm patients, and individuals with rare neurologic conditions with no currently approved therapies may be at particular risk of using these unproven treatments. A variety of compounds have been touted as being helpful for improving memory and staving off Alzheimer disease or other dementias; these approaches, many popularized in social media, offer no proven benefit and may deter patients from seeking therapies for which supporting data are available or from participating in well-designed clinical trials. The AAN believes that rigorous investigation of any treatment is necessary to determine its efficacy and ensure safety, and we recommend patients discuss any potential treatment of a neurologic condition with their neurologist.

Demyelinating diseases (including multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, ADEM, ON, and NMO) workup includes neurologic consultation; ophthalmic or neuro-ophthalmic evaluation if ocular involvement; MRI with contrast of brain, orbit, cervical, and thoracic spinal cord; lumbar puncture with CSF analysis including autoimmune encephalitis panel and oligoclonal bands, CNS demyelinating disease antibodies, and viral PCRs especially JCV PCR; serum studies (B12, HIV, RPR, ANA, Ro/La, TSH, aquaporin-4 IgG, paraneoplastic panel or anti-HU and anti-CRMP5-CV2, thyroid panel including TPO and thyroglobulin, am cortisol and ACTH, and paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis panels); evaluation for urinary retention and constipation; EEG for subclinical seizures; and, less commonly, biopsy. Management by grade: For G1, intervention is not indicated and continue immunotherapy unless symptoms worsen or do not improve. For G2, stop ICPi, obtain neurology consultation, start prednisone 1 mg/kg daily and taper over 1 month, and rule out infection. For G3, permanently discontinue ICPi, obtain neurology consultation, use nonopioid neuropathic pain management (for example, pregabalin, gabapentin, or duloxetine), and admit for methylprednisolone pulse dosing 1 g/d and consider IVIG or plasmapheresis if no improvement or symptoms worsen after 3 days; IVIG 2 g/kg may be administered in divided doses per package insert. For G4, permanently discontinue ICPi, obtain neurology consultation, provide ICU level inpatient care, and start methylprednisolone pulse dosing 1 g/d and consider IVIG or plasmapheresis if no improvement or symptoms worsen after 3 days; plasmapheresis immediately after IVIG will remove immunoglobulin.

Most Common Adverse Reactions

Table 4 lists all adverse reactions, regardless of causality, occurring in greater than or equal to 1% of patients with neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy in the combined pregabalin group for which the incidence was greater in this combined pregabalin group than in the placebo group. A majority of pregabalin-treated patients in clinical studies had adverse reactions with a maximum intensity of "mild" or "moderate".

* PGB: pregabalin

†Thinking abnormal primarily consists of events related to difficulty with concentration/attention but also includes events related to cognition and language problems and slowed thinking.

‡Investigator term; summary level term is amblyopia

Controlled Studies in Postherpetic Neuralgia

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation

In clinical trials in adults with postherpetic neuralgia, 14% of patients treated with pregabalin and 7% of patients treated with placebo discontinued prematurely due to adverse reactions. In the pregabalin treatment group, the most common reasons for discontinuation due to adverse reactions were dizziness (4%) and somnolence (3%). In comparison, less than 1% of placebo patients withdrew due to dizziness and somnolence. Other reasons for discontinuation from the trials, occurring in greater frequency in the pregabalin group than in the placebo group, were confusion (2%), as well as peripheral edema, asthenia, ataxia, and abnormal gait (1% each).

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of CRESTOR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Blood Disorders: thrombocytopenia

Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatitis, jaundice, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure

Musculoskeletal Disorders: arthralgia, rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use

Nervous System Disorders: peripheral neuropathy, rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, and confusion) associated with the use of all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). There have been rare reports of new-onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, and reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered.

Psychiatric Disorders: depression, sleep disorders (including insomnia and nightmares)

Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: gynecomastia

Respiratory Disorders: interstitial lung disease

Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), lichenoid drug eruption

Gabapentin — recommendations for perioperative analgesia state: There is no significant difference in patient outcome between multi-dose gabapentin and placebo; however, additional concerns for adverse events such as sedation and respiratory depression should be recognized with its use. There is no significant difference in patient outcome between single-dose gabapentin and placebo; however, additional concerns for adverse events such as sedation and respiratory depression should be recognized with its use. Strength of Recommendation: Strong, and the CPG group agrees with the authors of these studies that routine clinical use of gabapentin should be avoided outside of controlled clinical research scenarios allowing for gabapentin's potential use in future multimodal pain regimens.

Controlled Studies of Adjunctive Therapy for Partial-Onset Seizures in Adult Patients

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation

Approximately 15% of patients receiving pregabalin and 6% of patients receiving placebo in trials of adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures discontinued prematurely due to adverse reactions. In the pregabalin treatment group, the adverse reactions most frequently leading to discontinuation were dizziness (6%), ataxia (4%), and somnolence (3%). In comparison, less than 1% of patients in the placebo group withdrew due to each of these events. Other adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of at least 1% of patients in the pregabalin group and at least twice as frequently compared to the placebo group were asthenia, diplopia, blurred vision, thinking abnormal, nausea, tremor, vertigo, headache, and confusion (which each led to withdrawal in 2% or less of patients).

### Gabapentin (Gralise) [^114kx8RT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5–100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing GRALISE must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which products containing active components that are AEDs (such as gabapentin, the active component in GRALISE) are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that GRALISE contains gabapentin which is also used to treat epilepsy and that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.

5.2 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions with Abrupt or Rapid Discontinuation

After discontinuation of short-term and long-term treatment with gabapentin, withdrawal symptoms have been observed in some patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. Suicidal behavior and ideation have also been reported in patients after discontinuation of gabapentin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If GRALISE is discontinued, this should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week or longer (at the discretion of the prescriber).

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^116JwMQg]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Neuropathic medications — conditional recommendation, evidence, and dosing in CP/CPPS: Clinicians may prescribe medications for neuropathic pain including the classes of tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentinoids. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of pregabalin in men with CP/CPPS, there was no significant difference at the primary endpoint of a response of 6-point drop in NIH-CPSI total scores (p = 0.07), but secondary outcomes showed improvements on NIH-CPSI subscores with 3.3 (pregabalin) versus 2.2 (placebo) of 21 points for pain (p = 0.04), 1.2 versus 0.6 of 10 points for urinary symptoms (p = 0.01), and 2.1 versus 1.4 of 12 points for QOL (p = 0.02), a higher Global Response Assessment response rate (31.2% versus 18.9%; p = 0.02), and improvement in total McGill Pain Questionnaire score (p = 0.01). This indicates that pregabalin may be effective in some patients; however, it should be noted that improvement of the NIH-CPSI subscores may be statistically significant but not clinically meaningful. There are no trials of gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or norepinephrine selective reuptake inhibitors in men with CP/CPPS; of the tricyclic antidepressants, nortriptyline is typically recommended over amitriptyline in elderly patients as it has fewer side effects and similar efficacy. Tricyclic antidepressants are usually started at a low dose, typically 10 mg orally nightly, with doses titrated for effect up to 75 to 100 mg per day as tolerated, and caution is advised in older patients due to the anticholinergic risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia. For gabapentin, treatment can be started at 900 mg/day (300 mg/day on day 1, 600 mg/day on day 2, and 900 mg/day on day 3), titrated to 1,800 mg/day for greater efficacy with doses up to 3,600 mg/day in some patients, with an even lower starting dose in younger CP/CPPS patients of 100–300 mg orally at night. Pregabalin is approved at 300 mg/day for post herpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy, a lower starting dose can be considered given response to 150 mg per day in the NIH trial, and it is approved at 450 mg/day for fibromyalgia; doses for both gabapentin and pregabalin need to be reduced in patients with a GFR below 60 mL/min.

8.5 Geriatric Use

The total number of patients treated with gabapentin in controlled clinical trials in patients with postherpetic neuralgia was 336, of which 102 (30%) were 65 to 74 years of age, and 168 (50%) were 75 years of age and older. There was a larger treatment effect in patients 75 years of age and older compared to younger patients who received the same dosage. Since gabapentin is almost exclusively eliminated by renal excretion, the larger treatment effect observed in patients greater than or equal to 75 years may be a consequence of increased gabapentin exposure for a given dose that results from an age-related decrease in renal function. However, other factors cannot be excluded. The types and incidence of adverse reactions were similar across age groups except for peripheral edema and ataxia, which tended to increase in incidence with age.

Clinical studies of gabapentin in epilepsy did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and dose should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance values in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Adverse Reactions (6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Dosage adjustment in adult patients with compromised renal function is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Pediatric patients with renal insufficiency have not been studied.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112EKKmp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) taper — adjunctive medications and protracted withdrawal — emphasizes that "the primary clinical strategy for supporting an effective taper is going slow and adjusting based on the patient's response", with guidance to first pause or slow the taper if symptoms emerge and to minimize polypharmacy; if symptoms persist despite a slower taper, medications may be indicated with specialist consultation. The CGC agreed that "no single medication had enough data to support recommending it". The Patient Panel noted that some with protracted withdrawal have trouble tolerating adjunctive psychoactive medication and that agents "that act directly or indirectly on GABA receptors (e.g. SSRIs, gabapentin, magnesium) can exacerbate and extend the duration of protracted withdrawal symptoms". Clinicians "should first consider whether patients' symptoms are likely to be primarily attributable to BZD withdrawal or underlying conditions", with symptoms that change in parallel with BZD dosage or resolve rapidly after pausing the taper more likely related to BZD withdrawal; distinct neurological or sensory symptoms "may be related to protracted withdrawal", warranting more frequent monitoring and possible specialist consultation. Although evidence for medications to treat BZD withdrawal is lacking, treating underlying conditions can be effective (e.g. SSRIs for GAD); clinicians "should attempt to optimize evidence-based treatment" prior to or, if clinically indicated, concurrent with tapering and "should attempt to minimize the risks of polypharmacy whenever possible" when selecting adjunctive medications.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^1111wf4y]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

Non‑opioid pharmacologic therapy in chronic pain — scope, harms, and safety alerts — includes nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidepressants including serotonin‑norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and tricyclics (TCAs), anticonvulsants, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants, and these therapies are associated with risks in older adults, pregnant patients, and those with cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, and hepatic comorbidities. NSAIDs have been associated with serious gastrointestinal and major coronary events and with about 30% of hospital admissions for preventable adverse drug reactions; CDC guidelines show moderate quality evidence (with small improvement) for NSAIDs in chronic low back pain, and for other pain conditions the guidelines strongly recommend the use of NSAIDs. Pregabalin and gabapentin are frequently prescribed with hopes that they can provide opioid‑sparing effects, but on December 19, 2019, the FDA required new warnings for gabapentinoids about risk of respiratory depression, noting reports of abuse alone and with opioids with serious consequences including respiratory depression and increased risk of opioid overdose death, and increases in non‑serious adverse events have been found with pregabalin and gabapentin (e.g., blurred vision, cognitive effects, sedation, weight gain; dizziness and peripheral edema with pregabalin).

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111nNgjg]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — anticonvulsants and adjuncts — states gabapentin is a favorable choice for treating alcohol withdrawal when a clinician also plans to use it for a patient's ongoing treatment of alcohol use disorder; if benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate alternatives; and carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepine therapy to help control alcohol withdrawal, with the instruction that before using an adjunct clinicians should ensure that an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered. It also states valproic acid should not be used in patients who have liver disease or women of childbearing potential and that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of valproic acid as monotherapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. The discussion adds that evidence suggests anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, are effective at preventing alcohol withdrawal progression, seizures and delirium, but there is insufficient evidence to support their use over benzodiazepines for patients at increased risk of severe withdrawal, seizures, or delirium; it notes carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate medications for treating low risk patients and that gabapentin may provide an effective bridge therapy from alcohol withdrawal treatment to long-term alcohol use disorder treatment.

· Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled.

Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms.

Do not stop taking gabapentin without first talking to a healthcare provider.

· Stopping gabapentin suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly in a patient who has epilepsy can cause seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus).

· Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes.

2. Changes in behavior and thinking - Using gabapentin in children 3 to 12 years of age can cause emotional changes, aggressive behavior, problems with concentration, restlessness, changes in school performance, and hyperactivity.

3. Gabapentin may cause a serious or life-threatening allergic reactions that may affect your skin or other parts of your body such as your liver or blood cells. This may cause you to be hospitalized or to stop gabapentin. You may or may not have a rash with an allergic reaction caused by gabapentin. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms:

· skin rash

· hives

· difficulty breathing

· fever

· swollen glands that do not go away

· swelling of your face, lips, throat, or tongue

· yellowing of your skin or of the whites of the eyes

· unusual bruising or bleeding

· severe fatigue or weakness

· unexpected muscle pain

· frequent infections

These symptoms may be the first signs of a serious reaction. A healthcare provider should examine you to decide if you should continue taking gabapentin.

† Thinking abnormal primarily consists of events related to difficulty with concentration/attention but also includes events related to cognition and language problems and slowed thinking.

‡ Investigator term; summary level term is amblyopia

Controlled Studies in Postherpetic Neuralgia

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation

In clinical trials in adults with postherpetic neuralgia, 14% of patients treated with pregabalin capsules and 7% of patients treated with placebo discontinued prematurely due to adverse reactions. In the pregabalin capsules treatment group, the most common reasons for discontinuation due to adverse reactions were dizziness (4%) and somnolence (3%). In comparison, less than 1% of placebo patients withdrew due to dizziness and somnolence. Other reasons for discontinuation from the trials, occurring in greater frequency in the pregabalin capsules group than in the placebo group, were confusion (2%), as well as peripheral edema, asthenia, ataxia, and abnormal gait (1% each).

Most Common Adverse Reactions

Table 5 lists all adverse reactions, regardless of causality, occurring in greater than or equal to 1% of patients with neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia in the combined pregabalin capsules group for which the incidence was greater in this combined pregabalin capsules group than in the placebo group. In addition, an event is included, even if the incidence in the all pregabalin capsules group is not greater than in the placebo group, if the incidence of the event in the 600 mg/day group is more than twice that in the placebo group. A majority of pregabalin-treated patients in clinical studies had adverse reactions with a maximum intensity of "mild" or "moderate", "Overall". 12.4% of all pregabalin-treated patients and 9.0% of all placebo-treated patients had at least one severe event while 8% of pregabalin-treated patients and 4.3% of placebo-treated patients had at least one severe treatment-related adverse event.

### Substituting gabapentin for opioids has significant downsides… [^112kvPFD]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Kenny Lin, MD, MPH Posted on October 3, 2022 Although gabapentin is effective at relieving some types of neuropathic pain, namely diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, it is notably ineffective for treating other types, such as radicular low back pain. A 2019 editorial in. American Family Physician warned of potential unintended consequences of using gabapentinoids as alternatives to opioids for pain management. The authors observed that "as many as one in three patients taking therapeutic doses will experience dizziness or somnolence"; also, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety communication about gabapentinoids causing serious breathing problems in patients with chronic respiratory diseases and older patients. Illicit use of gabapentin is playing an increased role in opioid-related overdoses, according to a May 2022 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The report found that between 2019 and 2020, toxicology results detected gabapentin in almost 10% of fatal overdoses recorded in 23 states and Washington, DC. Misuse of gabapentin occurs for several reasons: "to enhance the effects of opioids, " "to achieve a 'high' when preferred substances unavailable, " and "to self-treat withdrawal or pain". A recent cohort study in JAMA Internal Medicine examined gabapentin use in the perioperative period and in-hospital adverse events in nearly 1 million patients aged 65 years or older. More than 3 in 4 patients underwent orthopedic surgeries. Overall, 12. 3% were prescribed gabapentin perioperatively. Those patients were statistically more likely to experience delirium, receive a new prescription for an antipsychotic drug, and develop pneumonia than gabapentin non-users. In persons using gabapentin, the risk of delirium was higher with chronic kidney disease and a high burden of comorbidities.

An accompanying commentary pointed out that the study results "are consistent with what is now a growing body of literature suggesting that gabapentin may not be the windfall medication for perioperative pain management that surgeons hoped it might be for decreasing opioid use, " particularly in older adults: We need to unwind the automaticity of gabapentin use in the perioperative period. For example, in this study, 80% of gabapentin users received gabapentin on the day of surgery, suggesting that it was started prior to any patient report of pain, representing an opportunity to de-escalate gabapentin use for some patients. Second, engaging patients and caregivers in their care could allow us to better manage expectations for pain control in the perioperative period. A multimodal approach needs to be patient centered and flexible.

Finally, aside from swapping out one potentially problematic medication for another, nonpharmacological techniques that might be used to treat pain should be considered.

Gabapentin regulatory and patient considerations note that several states consider gabapentin a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Schedule V drug with stricter regulations and some inclusion in prescription drug monitoring programs, and cases of gabapentin abuse, dependence, and withdrawal have been documented with abuse and dependence considered to be at higher risk in patients with preexisting alcohol or drug abuse history. The patient focus group noted a high pill burden because gabapentin is usually dosed three times per day, and gabapentin might be a reasonable treatment option for patients with comorbidities for which there are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved indications and off-label uses. Some concern about weight gain exists, and some military duties (most notably flight) could be limited by more common adverse events and should be carefully considered when prescribing this medication.

### Quality improvement in neurology: mild cognitive impairment quality measurement set [^1118SuKk]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) anticholinergic medication measure — use of anticholinergic medications is identified as a distinct and separate quality measure that is not a process measure but an intermediate outcome with the intended ultimate outcome of improved cognitive abilities. Adverse cognitive effects are well‑documented, clinicians often do not sufficiently consider their use in patients with cognitive complaints, and elimination is not the goal; instead, thoughtful consideration should lead to decreased use in patients with MCI. Other medications can contribute to memory loss, but the workgroup believed the most compelling evidence supports focusing attention on anticholinergic drugs.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^112xuerN]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Recommendation 20 — gabapentin or pregabalin for low back pain: For patients with low back pain, with or without radicular symptoms, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against gabapentin or pregabalin. Evidence cited includes a systematic review (SR) by Shanthanna et al. (2017) of radicular and non-radicular chronic low back pain that included three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and found no difference between gabapentin (n = 91) and placebo (n = 94) in reducing pain severity or functional outcomes. The SR also reported overall improvement in pain with pregabalin (n = 163) versus active analgesic control (n = 169), with a pooled SMD of 0.42, (p = 0.0002); however, the quality of the evidence was very low and individual studies had mixed results, with one of the three studies reporting no benefit, and study follow-up ranged from 4–14 weeks. An RCT of pregabalin in radiculopathy not included in the SR reported no significant reduction in leg pain intensity and a higher incidence of adverse events (AEs). Adverse effects are emphasized: higher adverse effects with gabapentin versus placebo, including fatigue, dizziness, loss of balance, and difficulties with mental concentration, memory, and visual accommodation; an increased risk of dizziness with pregabalin when compared to placebo; and that antiepileptic medications, including pregabalin and gabapentin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior, so patients should be monitored for the emergence of worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any changes in mood or behavior.

### American Geriatrics Society abstracted clinical practice guideline for postoperative delirium in older adults [^116k4quU]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Medium credibility.

Analgesia optimization to prevent postoperative delirium — Healthcare professionals should optimize postoperative pain control, preferably with nonopioid pain medications, to minimize pain in older adults to prevent delirium (strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low). Adequate postoperative analgesia is associated with decreased delirium, and studies have found associations between increases in untreated pain and postoperative delirium; while evidence for prescribing nonopioid alternatives is less compelling, clinical studies of gabapentin, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and celecoxib reported reduced incidence with nonopioid pain management. Potential harms include opioid risks such as constipation, nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, sedation, impaired judgment, altered psychomotor function, rash, pruritus, anaphylactic allergic reactions, and dependence, and the need for monitoring for respiratory depression; nonopioid medications also have potential harms.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^116R1Tee]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Dementia — differential diagnosis considerations include that age-associated memory changes are modest and not associated with functional impairment or depression, and memory impairment occurs in both delirium and dementia, but a new diagnosis of dementia cannot be made when delirium is present. Delirium is characterized by a reduced ability to maintain or shift attention appropriately, fluctuating cognitive deficits, and impaired level of consciousness, whereas the deficits in dementia tend to be stable or progressive and level of consciousness is unaffected; the onset of delirium may be acute and its course is often time limited. Other conditions include amnestic disorder (memory impairment without significant impairment in other cognitive domains), mental retardation with onset before age 18 years and significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning which may not include memory impairment, and schizophrenia where cognitive impairment tends to be less severe and occurs against a background of psychotic and behavioral symptoms. In elderly persons, major depressive disorder may present with reported memory impairment, difficulty concentrating, and reduced intellectual abilities; depression versus progressive dementia may sometimes be distinguished by the course and onset of symptoms and by response of cognitive symptoms to depression treatment, yet even when symptoms resolve with antidepressants more than 50% of patients go on to develop dementia or mild cognitive impairment.

### Clinical consensus statement: association of anticholinergic medication use and cognition in women with overactive bladder [^113AHjkz]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) anticholinergic exposure and cognition — observational data link anticholinergic medication use to progression to mild cognitive impairment and/or Alzheimer disease (P = 0.01; HR, 2.47), with the risk greatest in patients taking drugs with the highest anticholinergic activity; studies also report significant differences in memory and executive function and show significant reduced glucose metabolism with evidence of temporal lobe and whole-brain atrophy compared with nonusers. A population-based, retrospective, matched cohort study evaluating 47,324 new users of anticholinergic medications versus 23,662 new users of a β-3 receptor agonist for the treatment of OAB reported an increased risk of dementia among anticholinergic users (HR, 1.23, 95% CI, 1.12–1.35). Authors noted differences in rates of dementia were relatively small, the study was limited by its retrospective nature, and the effect size was unequal between men and women with no statistically significant difference seen among women during subgroup analysis. Across studies, there is no single standard method used to estimate total anticholinergic burden, medication use data may not accurately reflect actual use, and most studies do not distinguish capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier, with insufficient clinical data to demonstrate safety regarding cognitive concerns; nevertheless, the literature presents data supporting the association between anticholinergic medication use and cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer disease.

Cancer pain — anticonvulsant adjuvants and related agents: Anticonvulsants are used as adjuncts to opioids for neuropathic cancer pain, and carbamazepine, gabapentin, phenytoin, and pregabalin appear more effective than placebo, with an RCT of 120 patients showing pregabalin produced a significantly greater reduction in pain score than placebo, amitriptyline, or gabapentin; lamotrigine is unlikely to be of benefit and is not recommended. Ketamine has insufficient evidence for a recommendation, based on two small RCTs totaling 30 patients and 32 case reports. Topical lidocaine 5% plaster lacks RCTs in cancer, with only a single retrospective case series of 18 patients; the evidence is not sufficient to permit any recommendation. Cannabinoids were studied in an RCT of 177 patients; tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol achieved a significant reduction in pain NRS and a statistically significant reduction in memory and concentration scores vs placebo, but the evidence is not considered sufficiently strong to make a recommendation with respect to cannabinoids.

· The most common side effects of gabapentin include:

· lack of coordination

· feeling tired

· viral infection

· fever

· feeling drowsy

· jerky movements

· nausea and vomiting

· difficulty with coordination

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^113EBeqG]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Gabapentin for episodic migraine — trial parameters, efficacy, and adverse events are summarized as follows: In studies using gabapentin at doses ranging between 900–2,400 mg, there was a median 12-week treatment phase (range 12–20 weeks). Regardless of the dose, gabapentin was found to be inefficacious for the treatment of episodic migraine when compared with placebo, and adverse events were higher with gabapentin (68%) versus placebo (57%), including abnormal thinking, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and dizziness, vertigo or both.

### Functional abdominal pain: time to get together and move forward [^113d9Vqm]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Antiseizure medications — use in pediatric FGIDs — lack dedicated pediatric FGID trials but are used off-label for neuropathic pain conditions in children; adult data support efficacy in diabetic neuralgia, postherpetic neuralgia, and migraines, and pediatric seizure literature provides safety and efficacy information. Mechanistically, these agents depress abnormal neuronal discharges and raise the inappropriately lowered threshold of sensitized neurons. First-generation agents such as phenytoin and carbamazepine are associated with serious adverse effects and require regular blood level monitoring, whereas second-generation agents (gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, zonisamide, levetiracetam, pregabalin) may not require laboratory monitoring and have fewer sedation or cognitive effects with less overall adverse effects. Caution is advised because pediatric experience is limited and the true incidence of serious side effects is not fully known.

### Quetiapine (Seroquel) [^114YQwMB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of quetiapine fumarate PO (also known as Seroquel):
- Anticholinergic syndrome: use caution in patients with urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy, constipation, or taking anticholinergic medications.
- Antipsychotic withdrawal: do not discontinue abruptly in any patient.
- Aspiration pneumonia: use caution in elderly patients, particularly with advanced Alzheimer's disease.
- Cataract: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of cataracts.
- Falls: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine may cause somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, motor and sensory instability, leading to falls and injuries.
- Hematologic disorders: use caution in patients with leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia.
- Hyperprolactinemia: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of hyperprolactinemia.
- Hypotension: use caution in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, dehydration/hypovolemia, or taking antihypertensive agents.
- Hypothyroidism: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of hypothyroidism. Monitor TSH and fT4 levels.
- Mania: use caution in patients with bipolar disorder. Screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder before initiating quetiapine.
- Metabolic changes: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of metabolic changes, including hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and weight gain.
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
- Prolonged QT interval: use caution in patients at increased risk of QT prolongation, such as the elderly, patients with CVD, family history of QT prolongation, congestive HF, or cardiac hypertrophy. Avoid using quetiapine with other QT-prolonging agents, including class IA or III antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics (such as ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (such as gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or other medications known to prolong the QT interval (such as pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).
- Seizure: use caution in patients with seizure disorder or low seizure threshold.
- Somnolence: use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.
- Stroke: use caution in elderly subjects with dementia.
- Tardive dyskinesia: maintain a high level of suspicion, as quetiapine has been associated with an increased risk of tardive dyskinesia.
- Torsades de pointes, SCD: use caution, as quetiapine is associated with an increased risk of these adverse events. Avoid using quetiapine in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, such as bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or congenital QT prolongation.
