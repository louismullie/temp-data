## Question

What is the differential diagnosis for a 42-year-old woman with irregular menses x year that are heavy and painful, not on any medication, and denying any ultrasound in the past?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of a 42-year-old woman with a 1-year history of irregular, heavy, painful menses without medications or prior ultrasound. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about framing the problem as abnormal uterine bleeding and selecting an organizing scheme. Then, I should apply the FIGO PALM-COEIN classification to generate a prioritized differential. Next, I will outline key initial evaluations including pregnancy testing, laboratory studies, pelvic examination, and first-line imaging. After that, I should specify thresholds for endometrial sampling and red flags. Finally, I will propose initial management pathways tailored to the leading etiologies and note common pitfalls and self-corrections where needed.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. This is abnormal uterine bleeding in a reproductive-aged, likely perimenopausal woman, characterized by irregular cycles, heavy flow, and significant dysmenorrhea over 12 months, with no iatrogenic triggers reported. Hold on, I should verify the nomenclature and framework; the FIGO PALM-COEIN system remains the standard for categorizing etiologies of AUB, and it will guide both differential diagnosis and investigations in this case [^111FKHQz] [^113PdiQv].

> I will now apply the structural "PALM" categories. Let me think about endometrial or cervical polyps first, as they can cause intermenstrual or heavy bleeding and are optimally evaluated by transvaginal ultrasound, with diagnostic yield enhanced by sonohysterography when intracavitary disease is suspected. Wait, let me verify test characteristics; contrast sonography is highly accurate for intracavitary lesions including polyps and submucous fibroids, supporting early imaging in this presentation [^116EKSh6]. Next, adenomyosis rises on my list because heavy menstrual bleeding paired with dysmenorrhea at age 42 is classic; the SOGC guideline emphasizes this symptom complex and supports considering adenomyosis when pain and HMB coexist. I need to ensure I'm not overlooking fibroids; leiomyomas, particularly submucosal or cavity-distorting intramural types, are frequent causes of heavy bleeding and secondary dysmenorrhea in this age group. Finally, malignancy and hyperplasia must be kept in mind given age and irregular bleeding; this does not imply cancer is likely, but it means endometrial assessment should be thoughtfully planned based on risk factors and response to therapy [^112qBvT7] [^117PA1a1] [^113KNAgg].

> Next, I should review the nonstructural "COEIN" categories. Coagulopathy remains on the table; even in adults, up to roughly 13% of women with heavy menstrual bleeding may harbor a bleeding disorder, and heavy flow with flooding, clots, or anemia should trigger screening questions and selective laboratory evaluation. But wait, what if the bleeding pattern is driven by ovulatory dysfunction? At 42, perimenopausal anovulation is common, and I should also screen for PCOS, thyroid disease, and hyperprolactinemia based on history and exam. I must also consider primary endometrial hemostatic disorders as a diagnosis of exclusion when cycles are ovulatory but flow is heavy. Iatrogenic causes drop down the list here because she denies medications, yet I should double-check for supplements or over-the-counter agents that can affect bleeding. "Not otherwise classified" causes are uncommon and should be reserved for later consideration after more likely etiologies are addressed [^113wNnrS] [^114QnpS4] [^113Yei1w] [^117PA1a1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before we define the initial workup. I need to ensure I obtain a pregnancy test, even at 42, because pregnancy-related complications can mimic AUB. I should confirm hemodynamic stability and assess iron status with CBC and ferritin given the year-long heavy bleeding. Then, based on history, I will add TSH and prolactin if ovulatory dysfunction is suspected, and consider androgens if PCOS features are present. A focused pelvic exam is warranted, followed by first-line transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate the uterus and adnexa; if intracavitary pathology is suspected or the ultrasound is equivocal, saline-infusion sonohysterography can improve detection of polyps or submucosal fibroids. If pain is severe and ultrasound is unrevealing, I should keep adenomyosis or endometriosis in mind and escalate imaging or referral as indicated [^117PA1a1] [^116EKSh6] [^114CgqLZ] [^116FjHo3].

> I should confirm when to perform endometrial sampling. My initial impulse is to say that biopsy is mandatory in all women 35 or older with AUB, but wait, let me verify because that sounds overly broad. The AAFP review advises sampling for women 35 years or older when risk factors are present, in those with persistent bleeding despite therapy, or when clinical suspicion is elevated, while many contemporary algorithms default to biopsy for age 45 and older or younger women with risk factors such as obesity, chronic anovulation, or failed medical management. So I need to individualize the threshold here, integrating risk, bleeding pattern, and imaging findings rather than applying a rigid age cutoff alone [^117PA1a1] [^113KNAgg].

> Let me prioritize the differential for this specific presentation. Adenomyosis is high probability given the combination of heavy bleeding and dysmenorrhea in the early 40s, especially if the uterus is tender or globular on exam or shows characteristic ultrasound features such as heterogeneous myometrium or myometrial cysts. Fibroids, particularly submucous, are plausible and would fit heavy and painful menses if they distort the cavity. Ovulatory dysfunction related to perimenopause is also likely, explaining the irregularity; thyroid or prolactin abnormalities are less common but should be screened as indicated. Endometrial polyps can contribute to irregular or heavy bleeding at this age. Malignancy or hyperplasia is less likely but must be ruled out based on risk factors and response to treatment. Coagulopathy is possible but less probable without a personal or family bleeding history, though I should still ask targeted screening questions before excluding it [^112qBvT7] [^117PA1a1] [^111FKHQz] [^113wNnrS].

> Now, I will consider initial symptom-directed management while the diagnostic workup proceeds, assuming she is hemodynamically stable and pregnancy and malignancy are reasonably excluded or being appropriately evaluated. For heavy bleeding and dysmenorrhea, the levonorgestrel intrauterine system offers the largest bleeding reduction with added analgesic benefit and is often first-line if no contraindications exist. Alternatives include combined oral contraceptives, continuous oral progestins, tranexamic acid during menses, and NSAIDs, with choices tailored to contraceptive needs, comorbidities, and preferences. If adenomyosis emerges as the leading diagnosis and first-line measures are insufficient, GnRH agonists can be considered second-line with add-back therapy when used beyond six months. I need to ensure iron repletion is addressed if ferritin is low to correct iron deficiency and improve fatigue [^115jUQ19] [^113YF2MP] [^117PA1a1] [^115p6g3S] [^117Y76FG] [^114QnpS4].

> Next, I should review indications for escalation. If transvaginal ultrasound or sonohysterography confirms a focal lesion like a polyp or submucosal fibroid, hysteroscopic removal is both diagnostic and therapeutic. If pain remains disproportionate and imaging suggests adenomyosis or deep endometriosis, MRI or specialty referral may be justified when ultrasound is inconclusive. Persistent, unclear chronic pelvic pain merits consideration of laparoscopy after appropriate noninvasive evaluation, although many cases can be managed empirically depending on patient goals. Failure of medical therapy, anemia refractory to treatment, or concerning pathology on biopsy will require gynecologic consultation for procedural or surgical options, including endometrial ablation or hysterectomy where appropriate and aligned with patient preferences [^116EKSh6] [^114CgqLZ] [^116saC94].

> Before I conclude, I need to double-check potential pitfalls. I should confirm there are no overlooked iatrogenic contributors such as anticoagulants, SSRIs, or exogenous hormones, even though she denies medications, because patients may forget to mention over-the-counter or complementary agents. I must ensure pregnancy and ectopic pregnancy are excluded early to avoid anchoring bias. I should also remember that bleeding disorders can coexist with structural pathology, so unexplained flooding and large clots still warrant hematology-minded screening. Finally, irregular bleeding in the 40s is common, but it should not normalize or delay appropriate evaluation for endometrial pathology when risk factors or refractory symptoms are present [^117PA1a1] [^114QnpS4] [^116EKSh6].

> Putting this together into an immediate plan, I will first confirm a urine or serum hCG, check vitals, and obtain CBC and ferritin to assess the severity of blood loss and iron deficiency. I will then proceed with a pelvic examination and order a transvaginal ultrasound, adding saline-infusion sonohysterography if an intracavitary lesion is suspected or the initial study is nondiagnostic. Based on the history and exam, I will add TSH and prolactin, and consider androgen testing if PCOS features are present. I should discuss and, if acceptable, initiate a symptom-directed therapy such as an LNG-IUS or an alternative medical option while planning endometrial sampling if risk factors are present, if bleeding persists despite therapy, or if imaging raises concern. Alongside this, I will start iron repletion when ferritin is low and arrange timely follow-up to reassess bleeding, pain, and test results [^117PA1a1] [^116EKSh6] [^113KNAgg] [^113YF2MP] [^114QnpS4].

The most likely causes of irregular, heavy, and painful menses in a 42-year-old woman are **structural uterine pathology** [^111FKHQz] (fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis [^112qBvT7], endometrial hyperplasia/cancer) and **ovulatory dysfunction** (perimenopause, PCOS, thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia [^117PA1a1]). Initial evaluation includes a focused history, pelvic exam, and **transvaginal ultrasound** [^116EKSh6]; obtain endometrial biopsy if age ≥ 45, BMI ≥ 30, chronic anovulation, or persistent symptoms [^113KNAgg]. Laboratory tests include CBC [^114QnpS4], TSH [^113Yei1w], prolactin [^113HQush], and a pregnancy test [^113HQush]; consider coagulation studies if a bleeding disorder is suspected [^112nicKH]. Management is guided by the underlying cause and patient preferences, with medical therapy first-line [^116RUHof] and surgery for refractory or structural disease [^116h5AGe].

## Differential diagnosis (PALM-COEIN classification)

The **PALM-COEIN system** categorizes causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) into structural and non-structural etiologies [^111FKHQz] [^116EKSh6].

---

### Structural causes (PALM)

- **Polyps (AUB-P)**: Endometrial or cervical polyps causing irregular, heavy bleeding [^114p2x9Y].

- **Adenomyosis (AUB-A)**: Endometrial tissue within the myometrium, causing heavy, painful, irregular menses [^112qBvT7].

- **Leiomyoma (AUB-L)**: Uterine fibroids, especially submucosal or intramural, causing heavy, irregular bleeding and pain [^114p2x9Y].

- **Malignancy and hyperplasia (AUB-M)**: Endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma, particularly in women ≥ 40 years or with risk factors (obesity, chronic anovulation, family history) [^113KNAgg].

---

### Non-structural causes (COEIN)

- **Coagulopathy (AUB-C)**: Bleeding disorders (e.g. von Willebrand disease) causing heavy, irregular bleeding [^112nicKH].

- **Ovulatory dysfunction (AUB-O)**: Anovulation or oligo-ovulation due to perimenopause, PCOS, thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, or hyperandrogenism [^113Yei1w].

- **Endometrial causes (AUB-E)**: Primary endometrial disorders causing irregular bleeding [^114p2x9Y].

- **Iatrogenic (AUB-I)**: Medications (e.g. anticoagulants, hormonal therapy) causing irregular bleeding [^115SNZ7Q].

- **Not otherwise classified (AUB-N)**: Rare or undefined causes.

---

## Clinical evaluation

History should address the menstrual pattern, severity, duration [^114p2x9Y], associated symptoms (pain, fatigue), family history, medication use, and systemic symptoms (weight changes, galactorrhea, hirsutism) [^113HQush]; the **physical examination** should include a pelvic exam assessing uterine size, tenderness, masses, or cervical lesions [^115PXFWv].

---

## Diagnostic investigations

### Laboratory tests

- **CBC**: Evaluate for anemia [^114p2x9Y].

- **TSH**: Screen for thyroid dysfunction [^113Yei1w].

- **Prolactin**: Evaluate hyperprolactinemia [^113HQush].

- **Pregnancy test**: Rule out pregnancy [^113HQush].

- **Coagulation studies**: If bleeding disorder suspected [^112nicKH].

---

### Imaging

Imaging should begin with **transvaginal ultrasound**, the first-line modality to assess uterine structure, endometrial thickness, and ovarian morphology [^115PXFWv]; **MRI** is reserved when ultrasound is inconclusive or adenomyosis/endometriosis is strongly suspected [^114CgqLZ].

---

### Endometrial sampling

Indications for **endometrial sampling** include age ≥ 45, BMI ≥ 30, chronic anovulation, persistent symptoms, or risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia/malignancy [^113KNAgg].

---

## Management strategies

### Medical management

Management depends on the underlying cause, symptom severity, patient preferences, and fertility goals; first-line options include **hormonal therapy** — such as combined oral contraceptives, progestins, a levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) [^115jUQ19], or GnRH agonists — and **nonhormonal therapy** with NSAIDs or tranexamic acid [^113YF2MP].

---

### Surgical management

Surgical management includes **minimally invasive procedures** such as hysteroscopic polypectomy, myomectomy, or endometrial ablation, and **definitive surgery** with hysterectomy for refractory cases or malignancy [^116h5AGe].

---

| **Category** | **Condition** | **Diagnostic approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Structural | Polyps | - Transvaginal ultrasound <br/> - Hysteroscopy [^116EKSh6] |
| Structural | Adenomyosis | - MRI [^112qBvT7] <br/> - Ultrasound |
| Structural | Leiomyoma | - Ultrasound [^115PXFWv] <br/> - MRI |

| Non-structural | Not classified | Further evaluation |

---

In a 42-year-old woman, irregular, heavy, and painful menses most commonly result from structural uterine pathology or ovulatory dysfunction. A **structured evaluation** using the PALM-COEIN system [^111FKHQz], targeted labs, imaging, and endometrial sampling when indicated will guide diagnosis and management.

### Evaluation and management of abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women [^117PA1a1]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Up to 14 percent of women experience irregular or excessively heavy menstrual bleeding. This abnormal uterine bleeding can generally be divided into anovulatory and ovulatory patterns. Chronic anovulation can lead to irregular bleeding, prolonged unopposed estrogen stimulation of the endometrium, and increased risk of endometrial cancer. Causes include polycystic ovary syndrome, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, and use of antipsychotics or antiepileptics. Women 35 years or older with re-anovulation, women younger than 35 years with risk factors for endometrial cancer, and women with excessive bleeding unresponsive to medical therapy should undergo endometrial biopsy.

- **Management**: Treatment with combination oral contraceptives or progestins may regulate menstrual cycles. Histologic findings of hyperplasia without atypia may be treated with cyclic or continuous progestin. Women who have hyperplasia with atypia or adenocarcinoma should be referred to a gynecologist or gynecologic oncologist, respectively.

- **Ovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding**: Also known as menorrhagia, it may be caused by thyroid dysfunction, coagulation defects (most commonly von Willebrand disease), endometrial polyps, and submucosal fibroids. Transvaginal ultrasonography or saline infusion sonohysterography may be used to evaluate menorrhagia. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is an effective treatment for menorrhagia. Oral progesterone for 21 days per month and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are also effective. Tranexamic acid is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

### The FIGO classification of causes of abnormal uterine bleeding in the reproductive years [^111FKHQz]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical management, education for medical providers, and the design and interpretation of clinical trials have been hampered by the absence of a consensus system for nomenclature for the description of symptoms, as well as the classification of causes or potential causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). To address this issue, the Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique (FIGO) has designed the PALM-COEIN (polyp, adenomyosis, leiomyoma, malignancy and hyperplasia, coagulopathy, ovulatory disorders, endometrial disorders, iatrogenic causes, and not classified) classification system for causes of AUB in the reproductive years.

### How I manage heavy menstrual bleeding [^113FGKZC]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a common clinical problem; population-based studies estimate that approximately 10–35% of women report this symptom during their lifetime, while about 5% of women consult a physician for evaluation of HMB. Patients with HMB account for 15% of all referrals to gynaecologists and are frequently seen by haematologists in bleeding disorder clinics as well.

Heavy menstrual bleeding can be caused by a wide variety of local and systemic factors, so a careful clinical and laboratory evaluation is often necessary to determine the aetiology and guide appropriate management. This review discusses the definition, causes and clinical outcomes of HMB. It outlines a diagnostic approach and focuses on medical treatments (as opposed to surgical treatments). Throughout, areas of controversy and opportunities for further research are highlighted.

### Menstrual disorders in adolescents and young adults with eating disorders [^116jnhHs]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2022). Low credibility.

Although amenorrhea is no longer a specific criterion required to make the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN), the relationship between restrictive eating and menstrual status remains important in the diagnosis, treatment, and consequences for patients with eating disorders. Clinicians should understand the relationship between menstrual irregularities and malnutrition due to eating disorders, as it may be possible to intervene sooner if the diagnosis is made earlier. Treatment of AN (in those who are underweight) and atypical AN (in those who are not underweight) is aimed at cessation of restrictive thoughts and behaviors, restoration of appropriate nutrition and weight, and normal functioning of the body.

While eating disorder thoughts and behaviors are helped by both therapy and nutrition, regular functioning of the body, including regular menstruation, is linked to both appropriate nutrition and weight. Patients who are not underweight based on their body mass index (BMI) may still have oligo/amenorrhea due to their caloric restriction; thus, any patient who has irregular menses should have a detailed dietary evaluation as part of their workup. Timely diagnosis and treatment of patients with eating disorders and amenorrhea is important due to the impact on bone mass accrual for adolescents who have prolonged amenorrhea. Menstrual abnormalities may also be seen in patients with bulimia nervosa (BN).

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ovarian cancer, specifically in relation to differential diagnosis, the SOGC 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining laboratory testing to aid in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses. Test for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) to elicit leukocytosis, which can help identify a tubo-ovarian abscess. Additionally, a pregnancy test should be obtained to identify a possible ectopic pregnancy.

### Managing menopause [^115ojchb]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for menopause, particularly in the evaluation of sexual dysfunction, the SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend taking a brief sexual screening history as part of the medical history of menopausal females. Interventions should be pursued only if the patient is distressed about the problem.

### Progestogens with or without oestrogen for irregular uterine bleeding associated with anovulation [^115p6g3S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Irregular menstrual bleeding may arise due to exogenous sex steroids, lesions of the genital tract, or be associated with anovulation. Irregular bleeding due to oligo/anovulation (previously called dysfunctional uterine bleeding or DUB) is more common at the extremes of reproductive life and in women with ovulatory disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In anovulatory cycles, there may be prolonged oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium without progesterone withdrawal, resulting in irregular cycles and potentially heavy bleeding. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence prevent oestrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and oestrogens in combination with progestogens, are widely used in managing irregular menstrual bleeding. However, the regime, dose, and type of progestogen used vary widely, with little consensus on the optimal treatment approach.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of progestogens alone or in combination with oestrogens in the regulation of irregular menstrual bleeding associated with oligo/anovulation.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases in February 2012: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and reference lists of articles.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials were considered for inclusion.

### An unusual cause of postmenopausal bleeding [^116M61E2]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

A 68-year-old postmenopausal woman presented to the gynecology clinic with a one-week history of vaginal bleeding. She was investigated to rule out local and systemic causes, including genital malignancy. The investigations were negative for genital malignancy, and her symptoms settled spontaneously. The bleeding was attributed to corticosteroid treatment for shoulder joint pain. A brief literature review discusses this rare side effect.

### From menarche to menopause, heavy menstrual bleeding is the underrated compass in reproductive health [^1123Q7Fa]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Low credibility.

Menstruation is defined as monthly uterine bleeding and is regarded as a sign of reproductive health. When characterized by excessive bleeding (heavy menstrual bleeding [HMB]), it may act as a useful clinical marker for the diagnosis of reproductive diseases. Endometrial and myometrial mechanisms underlying abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), which includes HMB, have hormonal, cellular, and molecular aspects.

Structural and nonstructural causes of AUB, with HMB as the major symptom, result in iron depletion and consequent anemia. Heavy menstrual bleeding can be considered as a single entity to identify possible underlying causes, which may differ, to some extent, from those of AUB as a whole.

Furthermore, the difficulties in defining HMB through objective methods do not allow for a clear epidemiological scenario of the symptom's prevalence among reproductive-age women. Moreover, the introduction of new diagnostic methods, including imaging technologies, necessitates a revision of the available figures on HMB in different age groups, from menarche to menopause. In addition, a proper diagnostic algorithm for HMB should be implemented to adapt recommendations for clinical investigation when HMB is present.

### Menstruation: choosing whether and when [^114Cckht]. Contraception (2000). Low credibility.

For many women in the United States, menstruation is a significant health concern because menstrual disorders and other conditions that may be aggravated during menses (e.g. migraine headaches, epilepsy) carry substantial morbidity. Women today menstruate nearly three times as often as in primitive societies, and evidence suggests that frequent, repetitive menstrual cycles may increase health risks. Because the conventional 21/7 combination oral contraceptive (OC) regimen provides only limited relief for women with menstrual disorders, alternative OC regimens that reduce menstrual frequency have been proposed. A new OC formulation specifically designed to decrease menstrual bleeding to four times per year is currently under investigation.

Most women welcome less frequent menses or even amenorrhea. Women who may derive particular benefit from reduced menstrual frequency include not only those with medical conditions directly caused or aggravated by menses but also those serving in the military, female athletes, women with mental disabilities facing menstrual hygiene challenges, young teens, and perimenopausal women.

### Von Willebrand disease and other bleeding disorders in women: Consensus on diagnosis and management from an international expert panel [^112nicKH]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Reproductive tract bleeding in women is a naturally occurring event during menstruation and childbirth. In women with menorrhagia, however, congenital bleeding disorders have historically been underdiagnosed. This consensus is intended to allow physicians to better recognize bleeding disorders as a cause of menorrhagia and consequently offer effective disease-specific therapies.

### Approach to the patient: Diagnostic challenges in the workup for polycystic ovary syndrome [^112GpmXG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Ovulatory dysfunction is clinically marked by significant and chronic menstrual dysfunction, including polymenorrhea, which consists of episodes of menstrual-like vaginal bleeding occurring at 35-day intervals or less than eight times yearly. However, even with self-reported eumenorrhea, the presence of hyperandrogenism is associated with ovulatory dysfunction in up to 40% of presenting patients. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) often experience longer menstrual cycle intervals because follicle development is partially arrested by lower sensitivity to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), contributed to in part by elevated levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH).

Moreover, increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse amplitude and frequency results in the pituitary secreting high levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and relatively low levels of FSH. High LH serum levels further contribute to increased androgen production in the ovary, thereby causing follicular arrest. This results in ovulatory dysfunction, characterized by infrequent or prolonged menstrual cycles. Women with a more severe phenotype may experience amenorrhea. The average cycle length for women with anovulation is 60 days, while it is 43 days for women with oligo-ovulation.

Defining oligomenorrhea in adolescents is complex, as irregular cycles and ovulatory dysfunction are a normal component of pubertal transition, with physiological maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis occurring over time.

### Dysmenorrhea [^1156KeHS]. American Family Physician (2021). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dysmenorrhea:

- **Definition**: Dysmenorrhea refers to painful menstruation, characterized by cramping lower abdominal pain that occurs before or during menstruation, and is classified as either primary or secondary based on underlying etiology.

- **Pathophysiology**: Primary dysmenorrhea occurs in the absence of identifiable pelvic pathology and is associated with increased endometrial production of prostaglandins, particularly prostaglandin F2α, and leukotrienes. These induce intense uterine contractions, ischemia, and pain. In contrast, secondary dysmenorrhea results from structural or inflammatory pelvic disorders that contribute to pain through mechanisms such as nerve infiltration, chronic inflammation, or distortion of pelvic anatomy. Symptom severity in both forms often correlates with prostaglandin levels and other local inflammatory mediators.

- **Epidemiology**: Dysmenorrhea is highly prevalent and commonly undertreated, affecting 50–90% of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age. It is a leading cause of school and work absenteeism and significantly impacts quality of life.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for primary dysmenorrhea include early menarche, long or heavy menstrual cycles, smoking, alcohol use, high stress levels, nulliparity, premenstrual syndrome, a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, and a family history of dysmenorrhea. Increasing age and increasing parity are protective factors. Secondary dysmenorrhea is associated with identifiable pelvic pathology such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, and fibroids.

### Approach to the patient with new-onset secondary amenorrhea: Is this primary ovarian insufficiency [^112Mf9JY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Menstrual cyclicity is a marker of health for reproductively mature women. Absent menses, or amenorrhea, is often the initial sign of pregnancy — an indication that the system is functioning appropriately and capable of generating the intended evolutionary outcome. Perturbations of menstrual regularity in the absence of pregnancy provide a marker for physiological or pathological disruption of this well-orchestrated process. New-onset amenorrhea with a duration of 3 to 6 months should be promptly evaluated. Secondary amenorrhea can reflect structural or functional disturbances occurring from higher centers in the hypothalamus to the pituitary, the ovary, and finally, the uterus. Amenorrhea can also be a manifestation of systemic disorders resulting in compensatory inhibition of reproduction. Identifying the point of breakdown is essential to restoring reproductive homeostasis to maintain future fertility and reestablish reproductive hormonal integrity.

Among the most challenging disorders contributing to secondary amenorrhea is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). This diagnosis stems from a number of possible etiologies, including autoimmune, genetic, metabolic, toxic, iatrogenic, and idiopathic, each with associated conditions and attendant medical concerns. The dual assaults of unanticipated compromised fertility concurrently with depletion of the normal reproductive hormonal milieu yield multiple management challenges. Fertility restoration is an area of active research, while optimal management of estrogen deficiency symptoms and the anticipated preventive benefits of…

### Menstrual-cycle-related symptoms: A review of the rationale for continuous use of oral contraceptives [^111RGhC6]. Contraception (2006). Low credibility.

As many as 80% of reproductive-aged women experience physical changes associated with menstruation, and 20% to 40% experience menstrual-cycle-related symptoms. Decades of research in women with menstrual disorders, such as dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, have shown that continuous use of oral contraceptives (OCs), without the hormone-free interval, is a safe and effective method to relieve these symptoms and ultimately induce amenorrhea in many women. If given the opportunity, a majority of women would opt for extended-cycle or continuous regimens. Numerous clinical trials have shown that continuous OC regimens induce amenorrhea in 80% to 100% of women by 10 to 12 months of use. For women who do not wish to become pregnant, a continuous OC regimen should be an available option.

### Chlamydophila abortus pelvic inflammatory disease [^116LghZU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

In February 2001, a 39-year-old woman was admitted to the district hospital of Dornbirn, Vorarlberg, Austria, for chronic abdominal pain, increased vaginal discharge, and unusually heavy menses. Her medical history included two uncomplicated pregnancies, an aseptic abortion in the second trimester, another uncomplicated pregnancy, and two first-trimester miscarriages. Since adolescence, she had experienced lower abdominal complaints, including menstrual irregularities, urinary symptoms, and nonspecific vaginal discharge.

Repeated treatments for mycosis and urinary tract infections did not lead to substantial clinical improvement, nor did symptomatic treatments with corticosteroids or Lactobacillus acidophilus. Her condition worsened after the insertion of a copper-containing intrauterine device in 1999. Episodes of lower abdominal pain became more frequent and severe, accompanied by fatigue, general malaise, and sometimes elevated temperature. Her menses became increasingly heavy, resulting in 10 days of heavy bleeding.

Clinical investigation on admission showed lower abdominal tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness, more prominent on the right side. She exhibited signs of compensatory hypochromic anemia, attributable to menorrhagia. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (22–44 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (0.6 mg/dL) were moderately elevated. Leukocyte count and oral temperature were normal. Results of tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomat concluded here abruptly.

### Postmenopausal endometriosis: a challenging condition beyond menopause [^1161Asmf]. Menopause (2024). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal endometriosis is a complex condition that challenges the conventional belief that endometriosis resolves with menopause. Despite the cessation of menstruation, a subset of women continues to experience or develop endometriosis-related symptoms during the postmenopausal period. This review aims to shed light on postmenopausal endometriosis by exploring its clinical features, diagnostic considerations, management approaches, and the potential impact on women's health.

The research was conducted using PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Only articles in English were considered, using the following terms: "postmenopausal endometriosis", "menopause", "management", "treatment", and "quality of life", from inception to 2023.

The clinical features of postmenopausal endometriosis include persistent or recurrent pelvic pain, dyspareunia, bowel or urinary symptoms, and occasionally, abnormal vaginal bleeding. The absence of menstrual cycles presents a diagnostic challenge, as the traditional diagnostic criteria for endometriosis rely on menstrual patterns. Visual cues may be less evident, and the symptoms often overlap with other gynecological conditions. This necessitates a thorough evaluation to differentiate postmenopausal endometriosis from other potential causes. Management approaches for postmenopausal endometriosis encompass surgical intervention, hormonal therapies, pain management, and individualized care. Postmenopausal endometriosis significantly impacts the quality of life.

- **Neoplasms and tumors**: Pituitary tumors
- **Uterine abnormalities**: Uterine fibromyoma, uterine fibroids
- **Infections and syndromes**: Pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain syndrome

Menorrhagia may also be induced by medications such as:

- **Anticoagulants and antiplatelets**: Warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban, ticlopidine
- **Hormonal therapies**: Norethindrone, medroxyprogesterone, drospirenone, goserelin
- **Psychiatric medications**:
	- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**: Fluvoxamine, fluvoxamine CR, paroxetine hydrochloride
	- **Antipsychotics**: Haloperidol, haloperidol decanoate LA, olanzapine, ziprasidone
	- **Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)**: Venlafaxine ER
- **Antiepileptics and analgesics**: Lamotrigine, lamotrigine XR, topiramate, topiramate XR, zonisamide, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin
- **Antimicrobials**: Metronidazole, metronidazole ER, ofloxacin, tinidazole
- **Miscellaneous medications**: Interferon beta, zolpidem, zolpidem CR, loratadine, mesalamine DR, mesalamine ER, lansoprazole DR, cobimetinib, naproxen sodium ER, naproxen DR, dexlansoprazole DR, imatinib, misoprostol, naproxen

Additionally, contraceptive use and ectopic pregnancy are noted among potential contributors to menorrhagia.

### Lean polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): an evidence-based practical approach [^112QrNzA]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy affecting women of reproductive age. Common features include menstrual irregularities, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology, although the presentation can be heterogeneous. Insulin resistance is thought to be responsible for the hormonal and metabolic derangements observed. PCOS has two phenotypes: overweight/obese and lean, with the latter being a much less common presentation of the syndrome.

- **Aims**: The aim of the present review is to summarize cardinal features and devise diagnostic and treatment algorithms for lean PCOS based on recent literature.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar using search terms such as 'lean polycystic ovary syndrome' OR 'lean polycystic ovarian syndrome' OR 'lean PCOS' OR 'lean polycystic ovary disease' OR 'lean polycystic ovarian disease' OR 'lean PCOD' OR 'hyperandrogenism' AND 'low BMI' OR 'low body mass index' to identify potential articles to be included in the review. Citation searches were subsequently performed to find relevant literature.

- **Results**: Hormonal, metabolic, and hematological profiles were altered in lean women with PCOS compared to healthy counterparts. However, the derangements were either comparable or less obvious compared to obese women with the syndrome. Insulin resistance seemed inherent in PCOS independent of obesity. Treatment options included weight maintenance, restoration of ovulation with insulin-sensitizers such as metformin, and relief of symptoms such as hirsutism, acne, and menstrual dysfunction.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^116EKSh6]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). High credibility.

When more than one structural cause is identified, such as adenomyosis and leiomyomas, interpretation of investigations can be challenging when determining the options for management. Understanding the pathogenesis of the causes of AUB will assist with the interpretation of the investigation.

- **Relationship between pathogenesis and clinical investigations**: Structural causes of AUB.

	- **Polyps**: Uterine polyps may be present in the cervical canal but are most commonly "… focal endometrial outgrowths that can occur anywhere in the uterine cavity. They contain a variable amount of glands, stroma, and blood vessels… " The size, texture, position, and number of polyps can all vary by the patient, features that may influence symptomatology. Whereas the exact pathogenesis and natural history remain unclear, polyps are considered to arise from areas of epithelial and stromal overgrowth.

The macroscopic diagnosis of polyps can be made via two-dimensional (2D) transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), where polyps appear as hypoechogenic lesions and cystic glands may be present. Diagnostic accuracy can be increased with color Doppler, three-dimensional (3D) technology, and especially contrast — a process called sonohysterography — where saline or gel media instilled into the endometrial cavity provides sonographic contrast. Whether with 2D or 3D sonography, this approach is very accurate in diagnosing intracavity uterine lesions such as polyps or leiomyomas (sensitivity 96.9% and 99.5%, respectively). Importantly, meta-analysis suggests that there is no significant difference in accuracy in the identification.

### Women with bleeding disorders [^116jqXaH]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Menorrhagia, or excessive menstrual bleeding, is a common clinical problem affecting reproductive-age women; however, the cause is undetermined in 50% of cases. Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) or other bleeding disorders may be the underlying source of heavy bleeding. Women with menorrhagia and/or VWD are at increased risk for several conditions including anemia, bleeding during pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage, and reduced quality of life (QOL). Proper diagnosis and management can decrease complications and unnecessary surgical interventions. The Division of Blood Disorders (DBD) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has implemented studies to ascertain physician awareness of bleeding disorders, establish prevalence in the US, and determine the best treatment options.

Hypothalamic amenorrhoea (HA) is a common cause of amenorrhoea in women of reproductive age, often going unrecognized. Thorough clinical evaluation is crucial to diagnose these women, establish the causative factor, and initiate appropriate treatment. Treatment options need to be personalized, focusing on alleviating underlying nutritional or psychosocial stress through lifestyle and behavioral interventions. Emerging hormonal therapies may prove useful in the future, especially for women who do not respond to first-line behavioral treatment.

### Identification and management of eating disorders in gynecology: Menstrual health as an underutilized screening tool [^116WV9qf]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Eating disorders are life-threatening conditions that disproportionately affect females, often during child-bearing years. Although the endocrinological and reproductive sequelae of these conditions often fall within the treatment purview of obstetrician-gynecologists, the assessment of eating pathology is challenging and often not part of routine clinical care. This commentary focuses on one of the common presenting symptoms of eating disorders in women: menstrual dysfunction, and discusses considerations for its clinical management in gynecology. Assessment of menstrual status provides a natural starting point for provider-patient discussion of disordered eating and weight behavior. Routine screening for eating disorders is critical and must be universal, given the serious long-term consequences of these disorders.

### Management of pre-, peri-, and post-menopausal abnormal uterine bleeding: When to perform endometrial sampling [^113KNAgg]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is defined as abnormal volume, duration, or frequency of the menstrual period and is a common symptom in women of all ages (premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal). The acronym PALM-COEIN, introduced by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), facilitates the evaluation and differential diagnosis of AUB, mostly in premenopausal women with AUB. Endometrial evaluation, including ultrasound or hysteroscopic imaging and tissue sampling for subtle pathology, is proposed for patients who are at high risk for endometrial cancer and for those at low risk who present with AUB and poor response to medical treatment.

Many new diagnostic modalities are available to clinicians to help assess women presenting with abnormalities in their menstrual patterns. This study reviews the optimal management of women presenting with AUB, considering the actual need for invasive management and determining who requires it versus those who can be diagnosed without histological verification. The importance of endometrial tissue sampling in women who present with AUB, as well as the best timing for a clinician to conduct a biopsy, are analyzed according to the latest worldwide guidelines and major publications on this subject.

### Approach to the patient: Diagnostic challenges in the workup for polycystic ovary syndrome [^115Ki3XB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Patient 1, a 17-year-old high school student, was referred by her general practitioner due to primary amenorrhea. She had breast development at the age of 12, pubic and axillary hair at age 12, and experienced a growth spurt at the age of 13. Her older sister and mother had menarche at age 14. She had never taken any hormonal medication and had never been sexually active.

There were some significant stressors over the last 2 years with her family situation, and she was currently in the final year of high school with significant associated pressure and stress. She had no acne and mild hirsutism, which was probably in keeping with her Sri Lankan heritage. Her weight was 85.6 kg, with a height of 166 cm, giving a BMI of 31.1 kg/m². Her breast and pubic hair were both Tanner stage 4. There were no stigmata suggestive of Cushing syndrome.

Total testosterone, measured using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, was 1.1 nmol/L (reference range < 1.8 nmol/L), with an SHBG level of 11 nmol/L (reference range 25–150 nmol/L) and calculated free testosterone of 33 pmol/L (reference range 1–34 pmol/L). In excluding secondary causes, her prolactin, thyroid function, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) levels were normal. Her karyotype was 46 X, X. The FSH level was 4.9 IU/L (reference range 2–10 IU/L), LH was 2.0 IU/L (reference range 2–10 IU/L), estradiol (by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry) 59 pmol/L (reference range 10–900 pmol/L), and the remaining pituitary panel was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary revealed a normal pituitary gland.

### Clinical practice guideline for abnormal uterine bleeding: Hysterectomy versus alternative therapy [^116h5AGe]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2011). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for abnormal uterine bleeding, particularly concerning general principles, the SGS 2012 guidelines recommend considering offering any of the following treatment options for patients with AUB presumed to be caused by predominantly ovulatory disorders or endometrial hemostatic disorders. The choice of treatment should be based on the patient's values and preferences:

- **Hysterectomy**: Surgical removal of the uterus.
- **Endometrial ablation**: Procedure to remove or destroy the lining of the uterus.
- **Systemically administered medical therapies**: Use of medications affecting the whole body.
- **Levonorgestrel intrauterine system**: A hormone-releasing intrauterine device.

### Non-surgical interventions for treating heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) in women with bleeding disorders [^112vShmC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Heavy menstrual bleeding without an organic lesion is mainly due to an imbalance of the various hormones that have a regulatory effect on the menstrual cycle. Another cause of heavy menstrual bleeding with no pelvic pathology is the presence of an acquired or inherited bleeding disorder. The haemostatic system plays a central role in controlling the amount and duration of menstrual bleeding. Thus, abnormally prolonged or profuse bleeding occurs in most women affected by bleeding disorders. Whereas irregular, pre-menarchal, or post-menopausal uterine bleeding is unusual in inherited or acquired haemorrhagic disorders, severe acute bleeding and heavy menstrual bleeding at menarche and chronic heavy menstrual bleeding during the entire reproductive life are common.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy and safety of non-surgical interventions versus each other, placebo, or no treatment for reducing menstrual blood loss in women with bleeding disorders.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (13 March 2014), Embase (May 2013), LILACS (February 2013), and the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry (February 2013).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled studies of non-surgical interventions for treating heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) in women of reproductive age suffering from a congenital or acquired bleeding disorder.

### Progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems for heavy menstrual bleeding [^115jUQ19]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an important cause of ill health in women, accounting for 12% of all gynaecology referrals in the UK. It is clinically defined as greater than or equal to 80 mL of blood loss per menstrual cycle. However, women may complain of excessive bleeding even when their blood loss is less than 80 mL. Although hysterectomy is often used to treat women with this complaint, medical therapy may be a successful alternative. The intrauterine device was originally developed as a contraceptive, but the addition of progestogens to these devices has resulted in a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss. Case studies of two types of progesterone or progestogen-releasing systems, Progestasert and Mirena, reported reductions of up to 90% and improvements in dysmenorrhoea (pain or cramps during menstruation). However, insertion may be regarded as invasive by some women, which affects its acceptability as a treatment. Frequent intermenstrual bleeding and spotting are also likely during the first few months after commencing treatment.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and safety of progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices in achieving a reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding.

- **Search methods**: All randomised controlled trials of progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding were obtained by electronic searches of The Cochrane Library, the specialised register of MDSG, MEDLINE (1966 to January 2015), EMBASE (1980 to January 2015), and CINAHL (inception onward).

### Nonsurgical management of heavy menstrual bleeding: A systematic review [^113YF2MP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

To compare the effectiveness of nonsurgical abnormal uterine bleeding treatments for bleeding control, quality of life (QOL), pain, sexual health, patient satisfaction, additional treatments needed, and adverse events, data were sourced from MEDLINE, Cochrane databases, and Clinicaltrials.gov, from inception to May 2012. Randomized controlled trials of nonsurgical treatments for abnormal uterine bleeding, presumed secondary to endometrial dysfunction and ovulatory dysfunction, were included. Interventions considered were the levonorgestrel intrauterine system, combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), progestins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and antifibrinolytics, while gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, danazol, and placebo served as comparators.

Two reviewers independently screened 5,848 citations and extracted eligible trials. Studies were assessed for quality and strength of evidence.

Twenty-six articles met the inclusion criteria. For the reduction of menstrual bleeding in women with abnormal uterine bleeding presumed secondary to endometrial dysfunction, treatments such as the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (71–95% reduction), combined OCPs (35–69% reduction), extended cycle oral progestins (87% reduction), tranexamic acid (26–54% reduction), and NSAIDs (10–52% reduction) were found to be effective. The levonorgestrel intrauterine system, combined OCPs, and antifibrinolytics were all superior to luteal-phase progestins, which saw a 20% increase in bleeding.

The ACOG 2019 guidelines recommend several steps for the evaluation of adolescent patients presenting with heavy menstrual bleeding and potential abnormal uterine bleeding circumstances. Essential assessments include checking for anemia due to blood loss, which involves measuring serum ferritin levels. Additionally, it is crucial to identify any endocrine disorders that may lead to anovulation and to evaluate for the presence of a bleeding disorder. These steps are vital to providing appropriate care for adolescent patients.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding [^115B7EjJ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common presenting symptom in the family practice setting. In women of childbearing age, a methodical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation may enable the physician to rule out causes such as pregnancy and pregnancy-related disorders, medications, iatrogenic causes, systemic conditions, and obvious genital tract pathology. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (anovulatory or ovulatory) is diagnosed by exclusion of these causes.

In women of childbearing age who are at high risk for endometrial cancer, the initial evaluation includes endometrial biopsy. Saline-infusion sonohysterography or diagnostic hysteroscopy is performed if initial studies are inconclusive or the bleeding continues. Women of childbearing age who are at low risk for endometrial cancer may be assessed initially by transvaginal ultrasonography.

Postmenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding should be offered dilatation and curettage. If they are poor candidates for general anesthesia or decline dilatation and curettage, they may be offered transvaginal ultrasonography or saline-infusion sonohysterography with directed endometrial biopsy.

Medical management of anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding may include oral contraceptive pills or cyclic progestins. Menorrhagia is managed most effectively with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or the levonorgestrel intrauterine contraceptive device. Surgical management may include hysterectomy or less invasive, uterus-sparing procedures.

### Evaluation of irregular menses in perimenarcheal girls: a pilot study [^116yjgj3]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Acyclic vaginal bleeding in girls within three years of menarche is most commonly attributed to an immature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Assuming this diagnosis may prevent practitioners from performing more definitive studies and diagnosing other treatable causes of menstrual irregularities.

A retrospective chart review of 178 girls presenting to an inner-city hospital-based adolescent clinic within three years of menarche was conducted. The study assessed personal and family medical history and menarcheal history, along with findings from physical and laboratory examinations. Of the 178 girls who were perimenarcheal at presentation, 47 were the focus of this study.

- **Findings on physical examination**: Thirty-nine girls showed no significant findings, while three exhibited signs of functional ovarian hyperandrogenism (FOH), including obesity, hirsutism, and moderate acne with corresponding LH/FSH ratios greater than 3. However, pelvic ultrasound examination revealed normal ovaries.

- **Hormonal testing**: Four of the 39 patients with normal physical exams underwent LH/FSH testing. One of the four exhibited an abnormal LH/FSH ratio, indicating possible FOH.

- **Other significant findings**: Two of the 47 patients were pregnant. Additional laboratory abnormalities included microcytic, hypochromic anemia in some patients and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate in a patient later diagnosed with a rheumatologic disorder.

Perimenarcheal girls presenting with irregular menses and findings such as obesity, acne, or pallor were more likely to have treatable causes of menstrual irregularities. In one of the four girls with a normal physical examination, hormonal testing indicated a potential underlying condition.

### Enskyce [^115SNZ7Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Bleeding irregularities: Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. Nonhormonal causes should be considered, and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.

Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

Ectopic pregnancy: Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy may occur in contraceptive failures.

### Menstrual-cycle and menstruation disorders in episodic vs chronic migraine: An exploratory study [^116x9up7]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Migraine is a chronic condition of recurring moderate-to-severe headaches that affects an estimated 6% of men and 18% of women. The highest prevalence is in those aged 18–49, generally when women menstruate. It is divided into episodic and chronic migraine depending on the total number of headache days per month — 14 or less for episodic and 15 or more for chronic. Migraine has been associated with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and endometriosis, the latter particularly in chronic migraine.

- **Methods**: We conducted a questionnaire survey of 96 women with migraine, aged 18–45, to determine the occurrence of menstrual-cycle disorders (oligomenorrhea, polymenorrhea, and irregular cycles) and menstruation disorders (dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia) in episodic vs chronic migraine.

- **Results**: The prevalence of menstrual-cycle disorders in general (41.2% vs 22.2%) and dysmenorrhea (51.0% vs 28.9%) was statistically significantly higher in women with chronic migraine than in those with episodic migraine (P ≤ 0.05), though results were not corrected for multiple comparisons. Whether the migraine was menstruation sensitive, meaning the headaches consistently occurred or worsened with menstruation, did not impact the prevalence of menstrual disorders.

- **Conclusion**: We conclude that chronic migraine is possibly more often associated with menstrual-cycle disorders in general and dysmenorrhea than episodic migraine, without impact on menstruation sensitivity of the headaches.

### Pelvic pain and menstrual related illnesses [^115V1TZQ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

When approaching a patient with acute pelvic pain, it is imperative to consider the subtle differences each diagnosis can present with. Narrowing down pelvic pain to a specific location in the body while maintaining a high index of suspicion for acute pelvic pain emergencies will aid in a more rapid and accurate diagnosis. It is important to remember that acute pelvic pain is a clinical challenge, and although an exact diagnosis may be elusive, emergency treatment should always be provided first and foremost, regardless of an exact diagnosis.

### The treatment of dysmenorrhea [^114ShZhk]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017).

Menstrual disorders and abnormal uterine bleeding are prevalent concerns among young women. Complaints typically include menses that are: too painful (dysmenorrhea), absent or occur irregularly (amenorrhea or oligoamenorrhea), or prolonged and heavy (menorrhagia, or excessive uterine bleeding).

To provide optimal reproductive care, medical providers must distinguish between normal developmental patterns, which may require only education and reassurance, and pathologic conditions that necessitate prompt assessment and treatment. This article discusses the normal menstrual patterns observed in adolescent females and offers an evaluation and management approach to primary and secondary dysmenorrhea.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^113PdiQv]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). High credibility.

- **Introduction**: Nongestational abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in the reproductive years usually originates in the endometrium, regardless of the primary cause. Abnormal uterine bleeding is an umbrella term that includes heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), irregular, and intermenstrual bleeding (IMB), as well as disorders of cycle length — those more or less frequent than the normal range of 24–38 days. Understanding the physiology of normal endometrial function aids in understanding why the causes of AUB lead to altered endometrial behavior, i.e. altered bleeding characteristics. This knowledge provides a guide to interpreting investigational findings in a manner that facilitates the creation of a personalized menu of therapeutic options.

- **Prevalence and perception**: Almost half of the world's human population will menstruate, and during their reproductive years, it has been estimated that at least one in three women will experience AUB. However, recent questionnaire-based surveys have found that HMB alone may be prevalent in over 50% of women of reproductive age. This suggests that the lifetime risk estimation of AUB affecting one in three women is likely a gross underestimation. For decades, it has been reported that women experience many barriers to receiving care for AUB. This may account for the discrepancies in "patient data"-based studies that suggest the one in three lifetime risk of AUB, whereas "direct-to-patient" studies suggest the much higher point prevalence of over 50% for HMB alone.

### Menstrual disorders in the college age female [^115Vkosn]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

College-age young women frequently experience a variety of menstrual-related complaints, including dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, irregular menses, and menstrual-related mood changes. These problems deserve careful evaluation as they may reflect normal ovulatory menstrual symptoms or suggest significant pathology that can have a major impact on future reproductive and general health. The menstrual cycle is a vital sign; its normalcy suggests overall good health, while abnormalities require evaluation. Eating disorders and the female athlete triad increase the risk of osteoporosis; polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with future cardiovascular risks. Diagnosing and managing these problems not only improve a young woman's health, sense of well-being, and overall quality of life but may also lower her risks for future disease and ill health.

This article addresses normal menstrual function, excessive bleeding, infrequent or absent menses, pain with menses, menstrual-related mood disorders, and provides recommendations about routine gynecologic examinations and evaluations.

### Clinical and biochemical discriminants between functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea (FHA) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [^111SmDdr]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Low credibility.

In women with menstrual disturbances, where PCOS and FHA are the most likely differential diagnoses, a diagnostic conundrum is often encountered. For example, a cardinal feature of PCOS is polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM), which is present in 80%–88% of cases. However, PCOM is also commonly found in healthy women (20%–30%) and even more so in FHA (30%–45%), making its presence potentially incidental. Thus, even clinicians with specialist expertise may face diagnostic uncertainty in women presenting with oligo/amenorrhoea, with the potential for mis-categorization difficult to fully circumvent. Moreover, as both conditions are common, it is feasible that they may co-exist, further complicating the diagnostic process. Herein, we aim to review clinical, biochemical, and radiological parameters that could aid clinicians in distinguishing between PCOS and FHA as causes of menstrual disturbances.

### Heavy menstrual bleeding: Work-up and management [^114QnpS4]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), the preferred term for menorrhagia, affects approximately 90% of women with an underlying bleeding disorder and about 70% of women on anticoagulation. HMB can be identified by clots of ≥ 1 inch in diameter, low ferritin levels, and "flooding", which refers to changing pads or tampons more frequently than hourly. The goal of the work-up is to determine whether the cause is uterine/endometrial, a disorder of ovulation, or a disorder of coagulation. HMB manifested by flooding and/or prolonged menses, or accompanied by a personal or family history of bleeding, is highly suggestive of a bleeding disorder and warrants a referral to a hematologist.

The evaluation includes the patient's history, pelvic examination and/or pelvic imaging, and a laboratory assessment for anemia, ovulatory dysfunction, and underlying bleeding disorder. In cases of patients on anticoagulation, an assessment for over-anticoagulation is also essential. The treatment goal is to reduce HMB. The strategy will depend on factors such as ovulatory dysfunction, uterine pathology, coagulation abnormalities, the patient's age, and her desire for immediate or long-term fertility. Hemostatic therapy for HMB can serve as an alternative to hormonal or surgical therapy and may even be life-saving when used to correct a coagulation abnormality.

### The medical management of abnormal uterine bleeding in reproductive-aged women [^116RUHof]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

In the treatment of women with abnormal uterine bleeding, once a thorough history, physical examination, and indicated imaging studies are performed and all significant structural causes are excluded, medical management is the first-line approach. Determining the acuity of the bleeding, the patient's medical history, assessing risk factors, and establishing a diagnosis will individualize their medical regimen.

In acute abnormal uterine bleeding with a normal uterus, parenteral estrogen, a multidose combined oral contraceptive regimen, a multidose progestin-only regimen, and tranexamic acid are all viable options, given the appropriate clinical scenario. Heavy menstrual bleeding can be treated with a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, combined oral contraceptives, continuous oral progestins, and tranexamic acid with high efficacy. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be utilized with hormonal methods and tranexamic acid to decrease menstrual bleeding. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are indicated in patients with leiomyoma and abnormal uterine bleeding in preparation for surgical interventions.

In women with inherited bleeding disorders, all hormonal methods as well as tranexamic acid can be used to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. Women on anticoagulation therapy should consider using progestin-only methods as well as a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist to treat their heavy menstrual bleeding. Given these myriad options for medical treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding, many patients may avoid surgical intervention.

### Amenorrhea: A systematic approach to diagnosis and management [^113HQush]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Menstrual patterns can be an indicator of overall health and self-perception of well-being. Primary amenorrhea, defined as the lifelong absence of menses, requires evaluation if menarche has not occurred by 15 years of age or three years post-thelarche. Secondary amenorrhea is characterized by cessation of previously regular menses for three months or previously irregular menses for six months and warrants evaluation.

Clinicians may consider etiologies of amenorrhea categorically as outflow tract abnormalities, primary ovarian insufficiency, hypothalamic or pituitary disorders, other endocrine gland disorders, sequelae of chronic disease, physiologic, or induced. The history should include menstrual onset and patterns, eating and exercise habits, presence of psychosocial stressors, body weight changes, medication use, galactorrhea, and chronic illness. Additional questions may target neurologic, vasomotor, hyperandrogenic, or thyroid-related symptoms.

The physical examination should identify anthropometric and pubertal development trends. All patients should be offered a pregnancy test and assessment of serum follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Additional testing, including karyotyping, serum androgen evaluation, and pelvic or brain imaging, should be individualized.

Patients with primary ovarian insufficiency can maintain unpredictable ovary function and may require hormone replacement therapy, contraception, or infertility services. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea may indicate disordered eating and low body weight.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), specifically concerning differential diagnosis, the ES 2013 guidelines recommend excluding disorders that mimic the clinical features of PCOS before making a diagnosis:

- **Thyroid disease**: Clinically evaluate thyroid function to rule out thyroid-related issues.

- **Hyperprolactinemia**: Assess prolactin levels to ensure hyperprolactinemia is not contributing to the symptoms.

- **Non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia**: Focus primarily on diagnosing 21-hydroxylase deficiency by evaluating serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels.

### Characteristics of menstrual and nonmenstrual attacks in women with menstrually related migraine referred to headache centres [^116SJ2cw]. Cephalalgia (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine whether menstrual attacks differ from nonmenstrual attacks (NMA) in terms of clinical features or response to abortive treatment in women affected by menstrually related migraine (MRM) referred to tertiary care centers. Sixty-four women with MRM were enrolled in a 2-month diary study.

Perimenstrual attacks were divided into three groups: premenstrual (PMA), menstrual (MA), and late menstrual (LMA), and these were compared to nonmenstrual ones. Perimenstrual attacks were significantly longer than NMA. No other migraine attack features were found to differ between the various phases of the cycle. Migraine-related work disability was significantly greater in PMA and MA than in NMA.

Acute attack treatment was less effective in perimenstrual attacks, with pain-free status at 2 hours after dosage achieved in only 13.5% of MA (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.22, 0.76) compared to 32.9% of NMA. We concluded that, in MRM, perimenstrual attacks are longer and less responsive to acute attack treatment than NMA.

### Menstruation: science and society [^114FozE3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

The progress in the field of menstrual health is remarkable given the multiple challenges and obstacles in the field of menstruation science. Menstruation is a physiological process experienced almost universally across cultures from the ages of menarche to menopause.

What makes menstrual health and menstrual health literacy challenging is that for many, it is a normal process not associated with any distress or disability. However, for some, it can significantly negatively impact the quality of life. Collecting data on such a nearly universal process requires collaboration across various disciplines and careful consideration of "who" to collect data from, "what" data elements to collect, and "how" to best collect data.

Furthermore, the normalization of women's pain and stigma surrounding menstrual bleeding and reproductive health represent significant barriers to women's care-seeking, diagnosis, and ability to conduct research in this area. Menstrual health and menstrual health literacy research is further complicated by a lack of standardized tools and access to those tools, the multiple different etiologies of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), the multidimensional symptom complex surrounding bleeding, lack of clear diagnostic tests for reproductive health disorders affecting menstrual health, suboptimal norms for menstrual health and bleeding across the life span, and insufficient information.

### The clinical rationale for menses-free contraception [^114MioWV]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

The impact of monthly menstruation may range from a minor inconvenience for some women to a major health concern for those who suffer from menstrual disorders and health conditions that are aggravated during their menstrual cycle. Oral contraceptives (OCs) have been used safely in continuous regimens for the treatment of menstrual disorders in some women and for others who choose to extend their 28-day menstrual cycle to accommodate major life events. There is no physiological requirement for the monthly hormone-withdrawal bleed that is experienced by women taking cyclic OCs or for a menstrual period in women who do not desire to (or cannot) become pregnant. Thus, the use of continuous or extended-cycle OC regimens that eliminate the menstrual cycle represents a viable and attractive option for many women. The availability of more choices for menstrual suppression, such as continuous use of OCs, will improve the quality of life for many women who suffer from menstrual-related disorders and provide greater convenience for women with busy and active lifestyles.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^112Nw4mD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Summary of recommendations

- **Diagnosis of PCOS**:
	- **Diagnosis in adults**: We suggest that the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) be made if two of the three following criteria are met: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries (PCO), whereas disorders that mimic the clinical features of PCOS are excluded. These include, in all women: thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, and nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (primarily 21-hydroxylase deficiency by serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone [17-OHP]). In select women with amenorrhea and more severe phenotypes, we suggest more extensive evaluation excluding other causes.

- **Diagnosis in adolescents**: We suggest that the diagnosis of PCOS in an adolescent girl be made based on the presence of clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism (after exclusion of other pathologies) in the presence of persistent oligomenorrhea. Anovulatory symptoms and PCO morphology are not sufficient to make a diagnosis in adolescents, as they may be evident in normal stages in reproductive maturation.

- **Diagnosis in perimenopause and menopause**: Although there are currently no specific recommendations.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^114p2x9Y]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). High credibility.

FIGO System 1, by structuring the menstrual history, serves as an essential gateway for the rest of the evaluation as it provides invaluable insight into the possible causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). For example, regular cycles with normal frequency suggest the presence of ovulation, while the irregular onset of menses suggests ovulatory dysfunction (AUB-O). Intermenstrual bleeding may indicate the presence of a focal lesion, like a polyp (AUB-P), and the clinician should consider evaluation for malignancy or endometrial hyperplasia, as appropriate, given the clinical context (AUB-M). If intermenstrual bleeding is consistently early in the cycle (in the follicular phase) and typically comprises dark spotting or bleeding, a cesarean scar defect may be present and contribute to the symptom.

The symptom of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in the context of apparently ovulatory cycles likely reflects a disorder of hemostasis, whether it be systemic (AUB-C, further discussed in Section 5) or local. If local, it may indicate a primary endometrial disorder (AUB-E) or one secondary to the presence of adenomyosis (AUB-A) or a leiomyoma (AUB-L, uterine fibroids), most commonly one that is submucous in location (AUB-L SM). Regardless of the underlying cause, HMB is frequently associated with iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA), and related symptoms such as fatigue and reduced physical and cognitive function.

The structured history required for FIGO System 1 allows the clinician insight into disorders that may have been normalized by women and girls based on family, friends, or other healthcare practitioners, particularly in cases of HMB, which many women may have lived with unknowingly.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding in the adolescent [^111QEuV2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common problem in adolescents. The differential diagnosis varies from pregnancy and infection to anovulation and coagulopathy. A careful history and examination can help elucidate the best next steps for workup and management. Heavy menstrual bleeding is particularly worrisome in this group, not only when it occurs at menarche but also anytime afterward when bleeding lasts longer than 7 days, blood loss is greater than 80 mL per cycle, or when there are other warning signs that indicate a history of heavy bleeding, such as anemia. Once conditions of pregnancy, infection, structural abnormalities, and hormonal causes have been ruled out, first-line treatment is medical management with hormonal therapy or nonhormonal options. Invasive measures are a last resort in this patient population because maintaining fertility is of critical importance.
