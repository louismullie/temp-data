## Question

I've been having these awful panic attacks. My chest tightens up, I shake, and I feel like I can't breathe. I'm not sure what's causing them. I don't know if I should talk to a professional or if there's something I can do on my own. What do I do?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do about panic attacks with chest tightness, shaking, and breathlessness, including whether to seek professional help and what self-help options are effective. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding medical mimics. Then, I should verify the urgency of evaluation and when to seek immediate care. Next, I will review first-line treatments and their comparative effectiveness. After that, I need to consider benzodiazepine use and its risks. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepped plan that integrates self-help, primary care, and mental health referral, and I will double-check that each recommendation aligns with current guidelines and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic picture. Panic attacks are discrete episodes of intense fear with rapid onset, peaking within minutes, and accompanied by multiple physical and cognitive symptoms such as chest tightness, shaking, and breathlessness; panic disorder is diagnosed when attacks are recurrent, unexpected, and followed by persistent concern or behavioral change, with a lifetime prevalence around 1–4% in the general population and higher in primary care settings, so your symptoms fit the classic profile [^111RS2og] [^112XVSfc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these symptoms can mimic medical emergencies. I need to check for red flags that warrant urgent evaluation: new chest pain, exertional symptoms, syncope, or risk factors for cardiac or pulmonary disease; in such cases, seek emergency care to rule out ischemia, arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or asthma/COPD exacerbation, because panic attacks are a diagnosis of exclusion when symptoms are new or atypical [^115UJM2k] [^116oPAHD].

> Next, I should review first-line treatments. Wait, let me verify the hierarchy: multiple high-quality sources converge on SSRIs and CBT as foundational options. SSRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy with robust evidence, and CBT is the most extensively studied psychotherapy with durable benefits; both are recommended by WHO and AAFP, and network meta-analyses support CBT's superiority among psychotherapies, though effect sizes vary and head-to-head differences between active treatments are often modest [^111YyzMN] [^114DSbVV] [^114e9xBc] [^1111aWUh].

> I will now examine pharmacotherapy specifics. SSRIs such as sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram are all effective, with no clear superiority among them; venlafaxine is also effective. Typical timelines show improvement over 4–6 weeks, and continuation for at least 12 months reduces relapse risk, so I should set expectations accordingly and monitor closely during initiation and dose changes [^114DSbVV] [^111y3NA8] [^1121JuDE].

> Let me consider psychotherapy delivery formats. Individual CBT is effective, but wait, I should double-check whether briefer or guided formats work too. Evidence supports brief CBT (even 5–7 sessions), group CBT, and guided self-help CBT as acceptable alternatives with similar efficacy in many trials, which expands access and can be a good starting point if in-person therapy is limited; digital CBT and therapist-guided online programs are also reasonable options supported by WHO guidance [^115BftCk] [^111VHqBL] [^113o7Zkk] [^1121JuDE].

> But wait, what about benzodiazepines? I initially thought they might be first-line because of rapid relief, but hold on, I should verify current guidance. Contemporary guidelines advise against routine benzodiazepine use for panic disorder due to dependence, withdrawal, and cognitive risks; they may be considered only short-term for acute distress or as a brief bridge during SSRI initiation, with explicit plans to taper, and even then the evidence quality is low and long-term benefit is questionable [^1121JuDE] [^11347y8h] [^114iZuMB] [^1122sdfX].

> Next, I should review what you can do on your own while arranging care. Let me think about evidence-based self-help: structured breathing retraining, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness-based stress reduction can reduce panic frequency and intensity; regular aerobic exercise is also recommended and can meaningfully reduce anxiety symptoms; these strategies are endorsed by WHO and AAFP and can be paired with psychoeducation about panic physiology to reduce catastrophic misinterpretations [^116VWZqt] [^113ksv58] [^117LhQ3c] [^1121JuDE].

> I should confirm the role of primary care. Primary care is an appropriate first stop for assessment, screening, and initiation of treatment; validated tools like the GAD-7 and Panic Disorder Severity Scale can track symptoms, and collaborative care models improve outcomes. If symptoms are moderate to severe or comorbidities are present, referral to mental health specialists is advised, and in complex presentations (e.g., comorbid respiratory disease), integrated care can help distinguish panic from organic disease and optimize management [^111y3NA8] [^113Lp9Kd] [^111QeHrA] [^115WTqve].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepped plan. First, if there are any red flags or this is a new presentation, seek urgent medical evaluation to exclude cardiac or pulmonary causes. Second, if no red flags, schedule a primary care visit within 1–2 weeks for screening, education, and to discuss starting an SSRI or a CBT referral; in the meantime, begin daily breathing retraining, relaxation, and 20–30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling. Third, if access to CBT is delayed, consider a guided self-help CBT program or digital CBT while monitoring symptoms. Fourth, if symptoms are severe or disabling, request expedited mental health referral; for refractory cases, augmentation strategies (e.g., adding CBT to medication or switching modalities) are reasonable next steps [^115UJM2k] [^114DSbVV] [^115BftCk] [^1121JuDE].

> I should double-check special situations. If you have asthma or COPD, panic attacks can mimic and exacerbate breathlessness; GINA and GOLD recommend screening for anxiety and panic and integrating breathing control, relaxation, and, when needed, CBT into care, because distinguishing panic from bronchoconstriction improves outcomes and reduces unnecessary emergency use [^115WTqve] [^117M1xRR] [^1125JrqF].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety and follow-up. Panic disorder is associated with increased suicide risk, so I should ask about suicidal thoughts and substance use at each visit; monitor for SSRI side effects and activation early in treatment; and plan for at least 12 months of continuation before tapering to reduce relapse risk, adjusting the plan based on response and patient preference [^115PjAE5] [^111y3NA8] [^116uNLsH].

You should **see a professional** for panic attacks, especially with chest tightness and breathlessness, to rule out medical causes and get effective treatment [^115UJM2k]. While waiting, use **slow breathing** (inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds) and grounding techniques (5–4–3–2–1) to reduce intensity. CBT is the **most effective therapy** [^114e9xBc], and SSRIs are first-line if medication is needed [^111YyzMN] [^114DSbVV]. Self-help can help short term, but professional care prevents worsening and relapse [^111y3NA8].

---

## Why professional help is important

- **Rule out medical conditions**: Chest tightness and breathlessness can signal cardiac, respiratory, or gastrointestinal disease; a clinician should confirm the diagnosis and exclude these [^115UJM2k] [^116oPAHD].

- **Accurate diagnosis**: Panic disorder has specific criteria; a professional can confirm this and identify comorbidities (e.g. anxiety, depression) that shape treatment [^111QeHrA].

- **Effective treatment**: CBT and SSRIs are first-line and reduce symptoms and relapse; professionals tailor these to you [^111YyzMN] [^114DSbVV].

- **Prevent worsening**: Untreated panic can progress to agoraphobia and greater disability; early care reduces this risk [^111RS2og].

---

## Self-help strategies while awaiting professional care

While arranging care, these strategies can reduce attack intensity and frequency:

| **Technique** | **Description** | **How it helps** |
|-|-|-|
| Slow breathing | Inhale 4 sec, exhale 6 sec, repeat | Counteracts hyperventilation, lowers arousal |
| Grounding (5–4–3–2–1) | Name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste | Anchors attention, reduces catastrophic thoughts |
| Progressive muscle relaxation | Tense then relax muscle groups from toes to head | Reduces physical tension, lowers anxiety |
| Mindfulness meditation | Focus on present moment, observe thoughts nonjudgmentally | Decreases anticipatory anxiety, improves coping |
| Regular exercise | 30 min moderate activity (e.g. brisk walking) most days | Reduces anxiety, improves mood and sleep |
| Sleep hygiene | Regular schedule, limit caffeine/alcohol, avoid screens before bed | Improves resilience, reduces triggers |
| Avoidance of triggers | Limit caffeine, alcohol, and cannabis | Reduces physiological triggers |

---

## Professional treatment options

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Highly effective, teaches coping, and has durable benefits; consider individual, group, or guided self-help formats [^114e9xBc] [^115BftCk].

- **Medication**: SSRIs are first-line; benzodiazepines may be used short-term only for severe symptoms due to dependence risk [^111YyzMN] [^1121JuDE].

- **Combined treatment**: CBT plus an SSRI can be more effective than either alone, especially in severe or chronic cases [^notfound].

---

## When to seek immediate medical attention

Seek urgent care if chest pain is **new, severe, or radiating**; if there is **shortness of breath with blue lips or confusion**; if there is **fainting or a new irregular heartbeat**; or if there are **severe, unfamiliar, or escalating symptoms**. These features suggest possible medical emergencies and should be evaluated promptly [^115UJM2k].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

You should **see a professional** for panic attacks with chest tightness and breathlessness to exclude medical causes and receive evidence-based treatment. Use self-help strategies now, but pursue CBT and consider SSRIs for lasting relief and relapse prevention [^111YyzMN] [^114DSbVV].

### Next-step strategies for panic disorder refractory to initial pharmacotherapy: a 3-phase randomized clinical trial [^112t3DUv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Background

More data are needed to guide next-step interventions for panic disorder refractory to initial intervention.

Method

This 24-week randomized clinical trial (RCT) enrolled 46 patients with DSM-IV-defined panic disorder from November 2000 to April 2005 and consisted of 3 phases. Patients who failed to meet remission criteria were eligible for randomization in the next treatment phase. Phase 1 was a 6-week lead-in with open-label sertraline flexibly dosed to 100 mg (or escitalopram equivalent) to prospectively define treatment refractoriness (lack of remission). Phase 2 was a 6-week double-blind RCT of (1) increased-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) versus (2) continued SSRI plus placebo. Phase 3 was a 12-week RCT of added cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) compared to "medication optimization" with SSRI plus clonazepam. Primary endpoints were remission and change in Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) score in the intent-to-treat sample in each phase.

Results

In phase 1, 20.5% (8/39) of the patients achieved remission, and only baseline severity predicted endpoint PDSS score (beta [SE] = 1.04 [0.15], t = 6.76, P < .001). In phase 2, increasing the SSRI dose did not result in greater improvement or remission rates (placebo 15% [n = 2] vs increased dose 9% [n = 1]: Fisher exact test P = NS). In phase 3, remission was minimal (medication optimization = 11% [n = 1]; CBT = 10% [n = 1]), with a lack of group difference in PDSS score reduction (t(17) = 0.51, P > .60) consistent with a small effect size (d = 0.24).

Conclusions

Although power was limited and larger studies are needed, we failed to find evidence for greater benefit of increased SSRI dose versus continuation of current dose for panic disorder symptomatic after 6 weeks at moderate dose. Further, augmentation with CBT or medication optimization with clonazepam augmentation in nonremitted panic after 12 weeks of an SSRI did not differ, suggesting that both are reasonable next-step options. However, low overall remission rates in this comorbid refractory population suggest that better predictors of response to specific treatments over time and additional interventions are needed.

### Long-term management of panic disorder [^112Ua63f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Panic disorder is a chronic, disabling condition that is often associated with a need for long-term clinical treatment. While a variety of pharmacotherapy options, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and benzodiazepines, are effective in reducing symptoms in the acute phase, a significant number of patients do not fully respond to initial treatment, and a large majority of patients experience relapse after medication discontinuation. Optimal long-term treatment of panic disorder involves attention to adequate medication dosing and adequate duration of treatment to achieve maximum improvement before discontinuing. Recent reports suggest the efficacy of adjunctive pharmacotherapies and combining pharmacotherapy with behavioral therapy to improve treatment response. Further research is necessary to determine the long-term effectiveness of these multifaceted treatment strategies among patients suffering from refractory panic disorder.

### Management of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in general health care settings: new WHO recommendations [^116dwH2K]. World Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

The GDG highlighted a number of key considerations in making these recommendations. First, the GDG emphasized that the WHO's process for guideline development does not intend to make recommendations that cover the totality of interventions proven effective in a given area. Instead, the process focuses on areas or interventions where evidence is most substantial or where there have historically been controversies or the need for a policy change. Thus, the GDG noted that these initial guidelines may not encompass the totality of interventions that have been proven effective for GAD or PD.

Additionally, the GDG noted a limitation in the fact that the majority of evidence available comes from research conducted in high‐income countries, and highlighted the need for increased distribution of research funding to institutions in low‐ and middle‐income countries. It also noted considerable evidence for models of care, such as task‐sharing and training and supervision of non‐specialists, that are particularly appropriate for those countries. However, the GDG also specifically noted the challenges in human resources and health worker time and capacity to deliver certain interventions, particularly structured psychological interventions or collaborative care models.

Third, the GDG noted the need for further research to explore the longer‐term impact of interventions on symptoms, functioning and other key outcomes, while also recognizing the substantial evidence for symptom reduction in medium to short term. Fourth, the GDG made particular note of the need to consider cultural variability and individual preferences in applying recommendations in practice. For instance, the GDG highlighted the value of physical exercise for anxiety disorders generally, while also noting the need to consider daily habits of communities receiving care, such as when physical exertion is already a part of their daily life (e.g. farmers, manual labor workers).

Fifth, the GDG emphasized the need to ensure adequate training and follow‐up supervision for non‐specialists in any setting. Sixth, the GDG discussed the frequent over‐prescription of benzodiazepines for anxiety symptoms, particularly in non‐specialist care settings, and emphasized the risks associated with these prescriptions. Lastly, the GDG described the importance of adaptation for delivery of these interventions, including the use of innovative and digital technologies.

### Management of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in general health care settings: new WHO recommendations [^115jWLmC]. World Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

To date, there were no evidence‐based guidelines for managing common anxiety disorders in non‐specialized care settings focusing on low‐ and middle‐income countries. These recommendations were produced to fill this gap and will serve as a foundation for forming a new module in the mhGAP Intervention Guide, a tool frequently used to operationalize the mhGAP guidelines. Extensive work will be needed to scale up capacities in countries to act on these mhGAP recommendations and ensure effective management of anxiety disorders globally.

### Second-stage treatments for relative nonresponders to cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia-continued cbt versus ssri: a randomized controlled trial [^113BbYWS]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy are efficacious for the short-term treatment of panic disorder. Less is known about the efficacy of these therapies for individuals who do not respond fully to short-term CBT.

Method

The current trial is a second-step stratified randomized design comparing two treatment conditions-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; paroxetine or citalopram; n = 34) and continued CBT (n = 24)-in a sample of individuals classified as treatment nonresponders to an initial course of CBT for panic disorder. Participants were randomized to 3 months of treatment and then followed for an additional 9 months. Only treatment responders after 3 months were maintained on the treatment until 12-month follow-up. Data analysis focused on panic disorder symptoms and achievement of response status across the first 3 months of treatment. Final follow-up data are presented descriptively.

Results

Participants in the SSRI condition showed significantly lower panic disorder symptoms as compared to continued CBT at 3 months. Results were similar when excluding individuals with comorbid major depression or analyzing the entire intent-to-treat sample. Group differences disappeared during 9-month naturalistic follow-up, although there was significant attrition and use of nonstudy therapies in both arms.

Conclusions

These data suggest greater improvement in panic disorder symptoms when switching to SSRI after failure to fully respond to an initial course of CBT. Future studies should further investigate relapse following treatment discontinuation for nonresponders who became responders.

### The pharmacotherapy of panic disorder [^114aFKnu]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Panic disorder is common and associated with significant morbidity and dysfunction. The pharmacologic treatment of panic disorder is aimed at reducing or eliminating panic attacks, avoidance behavior, anticipatory anxiety, and comorbid conditions — and substantially improving and normalizing overall function and quality of life. Antidepressants and benzodiazepines remain the current mainstays of pharmacotherapy for panic disorder, although other novel agents and strategies are becoming available and may add effective alternatives to the therapeutic armamentarium.

### CBT treatment delivery formats for panic disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115BftCk]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Our findings may inform clinical practice and policy. Current guidelines on panic disorder (American Psychiatric Association; Katzman et al; NICE; Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists Clinical Practice Guidelines Team for Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia,) lack specific indications on treatment delivery strategies and should be updated according to the following key findings. First, with the same efficacy and acceptability of CBT delivered through the group or the individual format, guided self-help CBT should be viewed as a first line option for the treatment of panic disorder, with the goal of reducing personal, social, and monetary costs, and expanding the accessibility of treatments (Fairburn & Patel; Kazdin & Blase). Second, guidelines should highlight the need to routinely implement a shared-decision making framework that considers both the preferences and the clinical situation of the patient, promoting the use of guided self-help protocols for patients that may have difficulties in leaving home or have transportation or other personal difficulties that hamper the possibility to perform face-to-face sessions. Finally, our findings might encourage policy makers to consider the implementation of a stepped care approach in the clinical routine, where people are first offered a potentially highly available, flexible and low-cost option (guided self-help programs) followed by more intensive and structured therapies (face-to-face or drug therapy) only if the first step is unsuccessful.

### Recognition and treatment of panic disorder [^112xyDJi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Panic disorder is a common, disabling condition that affects 3% to 5% of the world's population. Although it is treatable, panic disorder goes unrecognized and untreated in many patients. Patients with panic disorder have an increased risk for other psychiatric disorders, especially other anxiety disorders, and panic disorder is associated with other medical conditions such as migraines, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome. Clinicians treating panic disorder must be able to recognize the disorder, differentiate it from other disorders in which panic attacks are part of the symptomatology, and map out an individualized treatment plan for each patient. This presentation discusses the importance of collaboration between doctor and patient and details available treatment options, including antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.

### Identifying and treating panic disorder in primary care [^113TEqUf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Many individuals who experience a panic attack at some point in their lives will meet criteria for panic disorder. However, although most primary care physicians recognize broad-spectrum mood and anxiety disorders, they may not make a specific diagnosis such as major depressive disorder or panic disorder. Comorbid panic disorder and other anxiety conditions are a well-established phenomenon in depressive disorders and can have a negative impact on treatment and worsen prognosis. This negative impact underscores the importance of specifically identifying these disorders and their comorbidities. Although an analysis of other potential causes of presenting symptoms is at times indicated, diagnosis should be made positively by identifying the symptoms diagnostic of the anxiety conditions rather than negatively by eliminating other conditions. Treatment of patients with panic disorder can improve quality of life and productivity as well as reduce health care costs. Pharmacotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and collaborative relationships with patients and psychiatrists can all aid primary care physicians in providing acute and long-term treatment for patients with panic as well as other mood and anxiety disorders.

### Understanding and treating panic disorder in the primary care setting [^113HxWmD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

According to studies, the median prevalence of panic disorder in the primary care setting is 4%. Rates are higher among certain patient populations, such as those with cardiac (20% to 50%) or gastrointestinal presentations (28% to 40%). Consequently, patients with panic disorder are high utilizers of medical services and are heavily represented among patients classified as high health care utilizers, compared with other psychiatric or non-psychiatric groups. Despite its frequency in the primary care setting, panic disorder is significantly under-recognized by medical providers. Corresponding with inadequate recognition is the substantial proportion of these patients who fail to receive appropriate treatment (pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy). Most experts have concluded that panic disorder is poorly managed in the primary care setting because of the process of care and patient engagement. In terms of process of care, primary care practice still operates on an acute disease model (leaving no time for initial patient education or follow-up), which is a poor fit for the management of chronic diseases. Insufficient patient engagement in treatment (i.e., being involved in the treatment process, "buying into" rationale for treatment, and being willing to collaborate with clinician and adhere to recommendations) is the second important contributor to inadequate treatment. Use of a chronic disease self-management approach would enhance treatment of panic disorder. This model requires that patients, in collaboration with the health care provider/system, take day-to-day responsibility for managing their illness by doing 3 things: adhering to recommended medical management, adopting improved health habits/coping skills, and assisting in ongoing monitoring of illness status/change. Future approaches to treating panic disorder in primary care would be enhanced by including assessments of patient beliefs and preferences, spending more time in preparing the patient for treatment, utilizing a simple pharmacotherapy algorithm, utilizing simple rating scales to monitor outcomes, and training providers in brief CBT interventions.

### The management of panic disorder [^114ijhDE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The evidence for benzodiazepines in panic disorder is compelling; along with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), they are a standard treatment for panic and other anxiety disorders. However, extended-release formulations of these agents may prove to be as effective as the immediate-release formulations, and extended-release agents have clinical benefits that may make them more attractive treatments than the currently available, shorter-acting benzodiazepines. Because of their longer duration of action, extended-release benzodiazepines can protect against breakthrough anxiety and need to be taken only once or twice a day, which may improve compliance in some patients. Because the other standard treatments of panic disorder, the SSRIs, have a slow onset of action, adding an extended-release benzodiazepine to the treatment regimen for the initial 6 to 8 weeks could serve as an effective bridge until the desired SSRI effect is realized.

### A contemporary protocol to assist primary care physicians in the treatment of panic and generalized anxiety disorders [^113Lp9Kd]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders are prevalent in primary care practice and generate a significant excess of morbidity, health services utilization, and health care expenditures. Complexities in delivering effective care for such disorders have led to stepped collaborative care models that involve nonphysician care managers following guideline-based protocols under the direction of patients' primary care physicians and a medical specialist. With the goal of aiding colleagues attempting to improve the primary care for panic and generalized anxiety disorders, we detail the collaborative care strategy for treatment of these conditions used by our National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-funded clinical trial in which a telephone-based care manager performs timely, patient-specific clinical and case management tasks. We illustrate the clinical considerations underlying the steps taken to implement and then sustain our care manager intervention at four geographically dispersed primary care practices linked by a common electronic medical record system and the modifications made as we encountered clinical situations common to typical practice settings. This report serves to familiarize physicians contemplating use of a similar strategy for improving the quality of primary care for an anxiety disorder or any other chronic mental health condition.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117M1xRR]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Anxiety and depression in asthma — anxiety symptoms and psychiatric disorders, particularly depressive and anxiety disorders, are more prevalent among people with asthma, and psychiatric comorbidity is associated with worse asthma symptom control and medication adherence, and worse asthma-related quality of life. Anxiety and depressive symptoms have been associated with increased asthma-related exacerbations and emergency visits, and panic attacks may be mistaken for asthma. Although several tools are available for screening in primary care, the majority have not been validated in asthma populations, and difficulties distinguishing anxiety or depression from asthma symptoms may lead to misdiagnosis. It is important to be alert to possible depression and/or anxiety in people with asthma, particularly when there is a previous history of these conditions, and where appropriate, patients should be referred to psychiatrists or evaluated with a disease-specific psychiatric diagnostic tool to identify potential cases of depression and/or anxiety.

### Psychological therapies for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults: a network meta-analysis [^114e9xBc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Panic disorder is characterised by the presence of recurrent unexpected panic attacks, discrete periods of fear or anxiety that have a rapid onset and include symptoms such as racing heart, chest pain, sweating and shaking. Panic disorder is common in the general population, with a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 4%. A previous Cochrane meta-analysis suggested that psychological therapy (either alone or combined with pharmacotherapy) can be chosen as a first-line treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. However, it is not yet clear whether certain psychological therapies can be considered superior to others. In order to answer this question, in this review we performed a network meta-analysis (NMA), in which we compared eight different forms of psychological therapy and three forms of a control condition.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy and acceptability of different psychological therapies and different control conditions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults.

Search Methods

We conducted the main searches in the CCDANCTR electronic databases (studies and references registers), all years to 16 March 2015. We conducted complementary searches in PubMed and trials registries. Supplementary searches included reference lists of included studies, citation indexes, personal communication to the authors of all included studies and grey literature searches in OpenSIGLE. We applied no restrictions on date, language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on adults with a formal diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. We considered the following psychological therapies: psychoeducation (PE), supportive psychotherapy (SP), physiological therapies (PT), behaviour therapy (BT), cognitive therapy (CT), cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), third-wave CBT (3W) and psychodynamic therapies (PD). We included both individual and group formats. Therapies had to be administered face-to-face. The comparator interventions considered for this review were: no treatment (NT), wait list (WL) and attention/psychological placebo (APP). For this review we considered four short-term (ST) outcomes (ST-remission, ST-response, ST-dropouts, ST-improvement on a continuous scale) and one long-term (LT) outcome (LT-remission/response).

Data Collection and Analysis

As a first step, we conducted a systematic search of all relevant papers according to the inclusion criteria. For each outcome, we then constructed a treatment network in order to clarify the extent to which each type of therapy and each comparison had been investigated in the available literature. Then, for each available comparison, we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis. Subsequently, we performed a network meta-analysis in order to synthesise the available direct evidence with indirect evidence, and to obtain an overall effect size estimate for each possible pair of therapies in the network. Finally, we calculated a probabilistic ranking of the different psychological therapies and control conditions for each outcome.

Main Results

We identified 1432 references; after screening, we included 60 studies in the final qualitative analyses. Among these, 54 (including 3021 patients) were also included in the quantitative analyses. With respect to the analyses for the first of our primary outcomes, (short-term remission), the most studied of the included psychological therapies was CBT (32 studies), followed by BT (12 studies), PT (10 studies), CT (three studies), SP (three studies) and PD (two studies). The quality of the evidence for the entire network was found to be low for all outcomes. The quality of the evidence for CBT vs NT, CBT vs SP and CBT vs PD was low to very low, depending on the outcome. The majority of the included studies were at unclear risk of bias with regard to the randomisation process. We found almost half of the included studies to be at high risk of attrition bias and detection bias. We also found selective outcome reporting bias to be present and we strongly suspected publication bias. Finally, we found almost half of the included studies to be at high risk of researcher allegiance bias. Overall the networks appeared to be well connected, but were generally underpowered to detect any important disagreement between direct and indirect evidence. The results showed the superiority of psychological therapies over the WL condition, although this finding was amplified by evident small study effects (SSE). The NMAs for ST-remission, ST-response and ST-improvement on a continuous scale showed well-replicated evidence in favour of CBT, as well as some sparse but relevant evidence in favour of PD and SP, over other therapies. In terms of ST-dropouts, PD and 3W showed better tolerability over other psychological therapies in the short term. In the long term, CBT and PD showed the highest level of remission/response, suggesting that the effects of these two treatments may be more stable with respect to other psychological therapies. However, all the mentioned differences among active treatments must be interpreted while taking into account that in most cases the effect sizes were small and/or results were imprecise.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no high-quality, unequivocal evidence to support one psychological therapy over the others for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. However, the results show that CBT - the most extensively studied among the included psychological therapies - was often superior to other therapies, although the effect size was small and the level of precision was often insufficient or clinically irrelevant. In the only two studies available that explored PD, this treatment showed promising results, although further research is needed in order to better explore the relative efficacy of PD with respect to CBT. Furthermore, PD appeared to be the best tolerated (in terms of ST-dropouts) among psychological treatments. Unexpectedly, we found some evidence in support of the possible viability of non-specific supportive psychotherapy for the treatment of panic disorder; however, the results concerning SP should be interpreted cautiously because of the sparsity of evidence regarding this treatment and, as in the case of PD, further research is needed to explore this issue. Behaviour therapy did not appear to be a valid alternative to CBT as a first-line treatment for patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.

### Management of anxiety and depression in adult survivors of cancer: ASCO guideline update [^111QeHrA]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Assessment of anxiety — specific concerns such as risk of harm to self and/or others, severe anxiety or agitation, or the presence of psychosis or confusion (delirium) requires referral to a psychiatrist, psychologist, physician, or equivalently trained professional. When moderate to severe or severe symptomatology is detected through screening, individuals should have a diagnostic assessment to identify the nature and extent of the anxiety symptoms and the presence or absence of an anxiety disorder or disorders, and medical and substance-induced causes of anxiety should be diagnosed and treated. As a shared responsibility, the clinical team must decide when referral to a psychiatrist, psychologist, or equivalently trained professional is needed (ie, all patients with a score in the moderate to severe or severe range, with certain accompanying factors and/or symptoms, identified using valid and reliable measures for assessment of symptoms of anxiety). Assessments should be a shared responsibility of the clinical team, with designation of those who are expected to conduct assessments as per scope of practice. The assessment should identify signs and symptoms of anxiety (for example panic attacks, trembling, sweating, tachypnea, tachycardia, palpitations, and sweaty palms), severity of symptoms, possible stressors, risk factors and times of vulnerability, and explore underlying problems/causes. A patient considered to have severe symptoms of anxiety following the further assessment should, where possible, have confirmation of an anxiety disorder diagnosis before any treatment options are initiated (eg, DSM-V, which may require making a referral).

### Management of anxiety disorders: the added challenge of comorbidity [^117Jivpx]. Depression and Anxiety (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with anxiety present with a wide variety of disorders that cause significant impairment to their everyday lives. To complicate matters, patients seldom present with just one anxiety disorder. Such comorbidity, particularly where depression is also present, has important implications for both the patient and the physician. The patient typically suffers from a greater degree of everyday impairment, is more reliant on healthcare services, in particular mental health services, and may be at a greater risk of attempting suicide. For the physician, comorbidity in anxiety disorders presents a challenge as the patient's symptoms are often more severe, present earlier in life, and are frequently prolonged which makes their management more complex. This review will focus on the anxiety disorders: panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The impact of co-existing multiple anxiety disorders, depression, or a history of substance abuse will be discussed with a view to choosing the appropriate management strategy. Treatment options will be reviewed.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with panic disorder — Co-occurring panic disorder may respond to the SRI used for OCD or to CBT for panic. When panic disorder or a history of panic attacks is present, SRI treatment should be initiated at low doses and slowly titrated upward over a period of weeks to avoid initiating or exacerbating panic attacks. Alternatively, an SRI can be started at usual doses combined with a benzodiazepine at antipanic doses for the first month or so and then the benzodiazepine can be tapered over weeks.

### Initial severity and antidepressant efficacy for anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^111kcpw1]. Depression and Anxiety (2018). Low credibility.

3.3 Panic disorder

For PD, the model with the lowest AIC (38,267.2) contained the two‐way interaction between baseline severity and group, but because this term was not significant (p = 0.11), we preferred a more parsimonious model without the interaction and with an only marginally larger AIC (38,268.6 after removing two nonsignificant terms, see Supporting Information Table 3). This model indicated that the drug‐placebo difference was constant on the log scale of the negative binomial model and hence that the ratio of the endpoint number of panic attacks/2 weeks in the placebo group compared to the drug group was constant (2.46) on the original scale. Consequently, the absolute difference between drug and placebo groups actually increased with increasing severity (Figure 2). For participants experiencing two panic attacks/2 weeks at baseline, the estimated drug–placebo difference was 0.2 (95% CI: 0.2–0.3) (in favor of antidepressants) at week 10. This increased to 0.4 (95% CI: 0.3–0.6) for participants experiencing 10 panic attacks/2 weeks at baseline, 0.9 (95% CI: 0.7–1.2) for participants experiencing 20, and 4.7 (95% CI: 3.0–6.4) for participants experiencing 40 (Table 3).

### Predictors of outcome in a primary care depression trial [^111kzKq9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

Previous treatment trials have found that approximately one third of depressed patients have persistent symptoms. We examined whether depression severity, comorbid psychiatric illness, and personality factors might play a role in this lack of response.

Design

Randomized trial of a stepped collaborative care intervention versus usual care.

Setting

HMO in Seattle, Wash.

Patients

Patients with major depression were stratified into severe (N = 149) and mild to moderate depression (N = 79) groups prior to randomization.

Interventions

A multifaceted intervention targeting patient, physician, and process of care, using collaborative management by a psychiatrist and primary care physician.

Measurements and Main Results

Patients with more severe depression had a higher risk for panic disorder (odds ratio [OR], 5.8), loneliness (OR, 2.6), and childhood emotional abuse (OR, 2.1). Among those with less severe depression, intervention patients showed significantly improved depression outcomes over time compared with those in usual care (z = -3.06, P < .002); however, this difference was not present in the more severely depressed groups (z = 0.61, NS). Although the group with severe depression showed differences between the intervention and control groups from baseline to 3 months that were similar to the group with less severe depression (during the acute phase of the intervention), these differences disappeared by 6 months.

Conclusions

Initial depression severity, comorbid panic disorder, and other psychosocial vulnerabilities were associated with a decreased response to the collaborative care intervention. Although the intervention was appropriate for patients with moderate depression, individuals with higher levels of depression may require a longer continuation phase of therapy in order to achieve optimal depression outcomes.

### Bridging the gap between complexity science and clinical practice by formalizing idiographic theories: a computational model of functional analysis [^113fWMn9]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Step 4: Choosing initial values of system variables and parameters

Prior to conducting simulations, initial values of each system variable and parameters need to be defined. In contrast to many data-driven approaches of estimating networks, these values are difficult to interpret numerically. This is because formalizing idiographic theories does not require the clinician to operationalize variables, since these will not (necessarily) be measured. The units of system variables are therefore not meaningful. We will discuss advantages and disadvantages of aligning theory components with the measurement procedure later on.

In contrast to common parameter estimation techniques in data models, the approach outlined in this paper treats parameters in formalized theories as "tuning-knobs" to tailor the relations towards the patient's case until theory-implied behavior resembles phenomena of interest. For instance, one can increase the parameter encoding the extent to which avoidance behavior follows panic, if it is known that the patient has a strong tendency to employ avoidance behavior as coping. Further, one can vary values of parameters to examine differential effects of unknown relations; for instance, clinician and patient can collaboratively examine the effects of different parameter choices for catastrophizing leading to panic. This allows patients to experimentally examine the responses of their system towards alterations.

For our example model, we chose parameters and initial values of the variables according to a qualitative examination of the system behavior, i.e. through adjusting parameters until the system resembled behavior to be expected given the information on the case of our hypothetical patient. The choice of parameters and initial values can be found in the mathematical appendix (see Additional file 1: Mathematical Background), alongside all differential equations used in the simulations.

Step 5: Simulating and visualizing theory-implied data

Following the system specification, we can simulate and visualize data. We provide the code to reproduce our analysis and plots in R (Additional file 2: Code to reproduce analyses). System data is commonly visualized in time-series plots and phase portraits. Time-series plots indicate the time trajectories of all system variables, with time on the x -axis and variable levels on the y -axis. Phase portraits are useful to display the relationship between two or three variables over time. Each variable is represented on an axis, and following the trajectory in the phase portrait gives us information regarding the time course of the displayed variables. To illustrate, we used the example of three-dimensional phase portraits, indicating the relationship between panic, avoidant coping, and the credibility of the catastrophic interpretation.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^114vZB1e]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Past psychiatric history in OCD — when assessing past psychiatric history, a chronological history should be obtained of past psychiatric illnesses, including substance use disorders and treatment, and hospitalizations. The psychiatrist should attempt to document the initial chronological course of the patient's symptoms and their relationship to aggravating or ameliorating factors, including treatment. Details of past medication trials should be obtained to ensure that drug doses and trial durations have been adequate, to understand side effects and other factors influencing adherence, and to evaluate the degree of response. The nature, extent, and response to all trials of psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, should also be documented. When past medical records are accessible, these can be helpful in augmenting the treatment history provided by the patient. Past histories of psychiatric symptoms or co-occurring disorders will influence treatment planning and should also be elicited, such as alcohol or substance abuse or dependence, prominent fluctuations in mood, or panic attacks.

### Diagnosis and management of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in adults [^111y3NA8]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD) are among the most common mental disorders in the United States, and they can negatively impact a patient's quality of life and disrupt important activities of daily living. Evidence suggests that the rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis of GAD and PD are high, with symptoms often ascribed to physical causes. Diagnosing GAD and PD requires a broad differential and caution to identify confounding variables and comorbid conditions. Screening and monitoring tools can be used to help make the diagnosis and monitor response to therapy. The GAD-7 and the Severity Measure for Panic Disorder are free diagnostic tools. Successful outcomes may require a combination of treatment modalities tailored to the individual patient. Treatment often includes medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and/or psychotherapy, both of which are highly effective. Among psychotherapeutic treatments, cognitive behavior therapy has been studied widely and has an extensive evidence base. Benzodiazepines are effective in reducing anxiety symptoms, but their use is limited by risk of abuse and adverse effect profiles. Physical activity can reduce symptoms of GAD and PD. A number of complementary and alternative treatments are often used; however, evidence is limited for most. Several common botanicals and supplements can potentiate serotonin syndrome when used in combination with antidepressants. Medication should be continued for 12 months before tapering to prevent relapse.

### Treatment of panic disorder [^1116FTyo]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia occurs commonly in patients in primary care settings. This article assesses multiple evidence-based reviews of effective treatments for panic disorder. Antidepressant medications successfully reduce the severity of panic symptoms and eliminate panic attacks. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants are equally effective in the treatment of panic disorder. The choice of medication is based on side effect profiles and patient preferences. Strong evidence supports the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy in treating panic disorder. Family physicians who are not trained in cognitive behavior therapy may refer patients with panic disorder to therapists with such training. Cognitive behavior therapy can be used alone or in combination with antidepressants to treat patients with panic disorder. Benzodiazepines are effective in treating panic disorder symptoms, but they are less effective than antidepressants and cognitive behavior therapy.

### Five sessions and counting: considering ultra-brief treatment for panic disorder [^111VHqBL]. Depression and Anxiety (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Brief cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic disorder has the potential to lower health care costs and enhance dissemination of evidence-based interventions to clinical practice. This manuscript evaluates the utility of brief cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic disorder.

Methods

A narrative review of studies examining the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral brief treatment of panic disorder, with a specific focus on an ultra-brief, 5-session, intervention developed by our group.

Results

Brief cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic disorder is associated with clinically meaningful symptom improvement reflecting large effect sizes, comparable to those observed for standard protocols.

Conclusions

Growing evidence encourages the further evaluation and application brief cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic disorder. Controlled trials of cognitive-behavioral therapy have established the dramatic benefit that can be offered by brief treatment (often 12–15 sessions) approaches for Axis I disorders. Yet, as the field advances and core mechanisms of change are identified, there is the potential for offering efficacy in even briefer treatment protocols. In this manuscript, we describe the elements and initial efficacy estimates, based on published studies, for an ultra-brief treatment approach for panic disorder. We also discuss the potential impact, and such brief treatment can have relative to dissemination issues and the desire for the timely end to psychological suffering.

### Management of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in general health care settings: new WHO recommendations [^1121JuDE]. World Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

The new mhGAP anxiety recommendations have been developed according to the WHO's guideline development process. A Guideline Development Group (GDG) was convened and was responsible for making recommendations based on systematic review and appraisal of available evidence. Seven PICO questions were identified based on expert consensus to guide evidence retrieval, review, synthesis and assessment using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Results were then reviewed by the GDG to produce recommendations. The mhGAP anxiety guidelines address the role of psychological interventions, pharmacotherapies, stress management, physical exercise, and collaborative care for adults with GAD or PD.

The guidelines recommend brief structured psychological interventions based on principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for adults with GAD and/or PD. Most available evidence on the psychological treatment of GAD actually regards CBT, with third‐wave CBT also frequently studied. Evidence indicates that guided self‐help is likely to be more effective than unguided self‐help, and that specialist delivered interventions are likely to be more effective than those provided by non‐specialists, while there appear to be minimal to no differences between digital and face‐to‐face interventions, and between individual and group modalities.

The guidelines also recommend the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for GAD and PD, while tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are recommended only for PD in cases where SSRIs are unavailable. No specific differentiation in terms of effectiveness or adverse effects emerged among the reviewed SSRIs, including citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline. There was insufficient evidence for the use of TCAs in a‐dults with GAD.

Stress management techniques, including relaxation and/or mindfulness training, are also recommended for adults with GAD and/or PD, as is engagement in structured physical exercise. The guidelines recommend against the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of adults with GAD and/or PD. These drugs should only be used for severe, acute anxiety symptoms and only as a very short‐term measure (3‐7 days). Finally, the guidelines recommend the consideration of collaborative care for adults with depression and/or anxiety and physical health conditions.

### A 2010 evidence-based algorithm for the pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder [^115zc3aR]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

A growing evidence base on the management of social anxiety disorder has yielded many meta-analyses and guidelines on the pharmacotherapy of this clinically important condition. We aimed to update a pharmacotherapy algorithm for the treatment of social anxiety disorder that was developed to be concise and user friendly and that was addressed to the primary care practitioner in particular. The updated algorithm attempts to summarize succinctly the recent literature in this area, as well as to include the views of an international panel of experts with diverse experience. The algorithm comprises eight sequential steps, beginning with those focused on diagnosis and initiating treatment and ending with the management of the treatment-refractory patient.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Data source

We requested IPD from Clinical Study Data Request (CSDR). We first identified all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) developed by participating sponsors. These were paroxetine (GlaxoSmithKline), fluoxetine (Lilly), and duloxetine (Lilly). Although other SSRIs and SNRIs are also used for anxiety disorders, these were not available through CSDR. We then identified all double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, and short‐term (≤ 16 weeks) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of these antidepressants for an anxiety disorder, OCD, or PTSD in adults that were mentioned in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approval packages (Roest et al. 2015) or the GlaxoSmithKline and Lilly trial registries.

2.2 Primary outcomes

As our primary outcome, we chose the outcome usually considered primary for that disorder. For GAD, this was the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM‐A); for SAD, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS); for OCD, the Yale–Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale (Y‐BOCS); and for PTSD, the Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). For PD, most trials used response (defined as having 0 full panic attacks) as an outcome, but we selected the number of full panic attacks per 2 weeks, since dichotomization leads to a significant loss of information (Altman & Royston, 2006).

2.3 Patient population

We included patients with a valid baseline score and at least one valid follow‐up score on the primary outcome (modified intention‐to‐treat population). Patients assigned to placebo, the investigative antidepressant, or a comparator SSRI or SNRI were included. We excluded patients assigned to other active comparators.

### Patient perceptions of severe COPD and transitions towards death: a qualitative study identifying milestones and developing key opportunities [^116FhUri]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

3. Episodes of acute care

Some participants identified the need for acute hospital care to manage symptoms as a milestone. These participants expressed confidence in the hospital to reduce their physical symptoms and related anxiety. Acute hospital care was often seen as a haven or place of security.

Participants who were admitted to hospital believed they could not have been managed at home. They recalled the need for admission to intensive care unit, requiring bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) or resuscitation. Participants explained how such interventions were required to keep them alive; however, the negative prognostic implication of these admissions were not explored by participants.

Participants described different degrees of acceptance of acute care, yet all identified the need for increasing acute care as a milestone.

4. Long-term oxygen treatment

All participants noted requirement of long-term oxygen treatment as a transition point in the management of their care.

Many had preconceptions about the benefits of oxygen and its impacts on symptoms. Participants expressed their frustration about lack of improvement in energy level and mobility, as well as the practical burden of the equipment.

Long-term oxygen therapy was identified as a milestone that would result in more dependency.

5. Panic attacks

Several participants described panic attacks as part of their COPD journey. Many identified strategies that worked best for them, such as slowing breathing down or having someone to talk to for reassurance.

For some participants, cognitive strategies were insufficient and medications were required to manage the anxiety.

Panic attacks, not breathlessness, were identified as a milestone by participants. Participants did not always initially volunteer these attacks unless specifically asked; however, panic episodes were used by patients as a marker of advancing disease.

6. Assistance with self-care

Participants mentioned difficulty completing specific tasks, such as shopping, cleaning, washing and cooking. Support from friends and family enabled some participants to remain in their home. These participants articulated a feeling of burden on their support system.

For most participants, the ability to take care of their own personal hygiene was paramount in maintaining their dignity. This included the ability to independently toilet, shower/bath and dress. Participants expressed frustration and disappointment when they could not perform these tasks. Retaining this independence was seen as integral to their wellness highlighted by a desire to maintain dignity throughout their illness.

Participants articulated the inability to self-care as a milestone in their COPD journey.

### Facilitating treatment of anxiety disorders in patients with comorbid medical illness [^115msxw7]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2005). Low credibility.

Anxiety is a universal human response that usually is adaptive, allowing one to prepare for a perceived threat. This can be a normal coping mechanism when dealing with a medical illness that may require hospitalization, surgery, or painful procedures. It becomes maladaptive when it is persistent and leads to panic attacks, severe physical symptoms, and impairment in functioning. Most of these patients are treated by primary care providers who frequently fail to adequately recognize and treat anxiety disorders in their patients. This leads to increased health care costs and chronic disability. To reach this under-served group of patients, mental health practitioners need to collaborate with their primary care colleagues to provide screening tools and education on diagnosis and effective treatment of these disorders.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^116oPAHD]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea evaluation — clinical categories and diagnostic value of descriptors include two major patient categories: those with new onset of breathing discomfort for whom the underlying cause has not yet been determined and those with known cardiovascular, respiratory, or neuromuscular disease who are experiencing worsening dyspnea; for the former, evaluation focuses on discovering an underlying abnormality or diagnosis, and for the latter the goal is to discern deterioration of a known disorder or emergence of a new problem. In new-onset dyspnea, the history and physical examination remain the mainstays of diagnostic evaluation, and when diagnosis remains elusive, specialty referral (e.g., pulmonologist, cardiologist, or multidisciplinary dyspnea clinic) may help identify a potentially treatable underlying cause. In most cardiopulmonary diseases both increased ventilatory demand and altered ventilatory mechanics are present, whereas in some nonpathological circumstances (e.g., at altitude or during pregnancy) increased drive predominates; patient words or phrases describing the quality of breathing discomfort may provide insight into pathophysiological mechanisms, with chest tightness relatively specific for dyspnea due to bronchoconstriction, sensations of "air hunger" and "inability to get a deep breath" probably representing increased drive to breathe plus limited tidal volume and being common with dynamic hyperinflation and restrictive mechanics, and sensations of effort, suffocation, and rapid breathing characterizing CO2-induced panic attacks but being nonspecific; linguistic and cultural differences can affect symptom characterization, and some patients have difficulty grasping the concept of "quality" of their breathing sensations.

### Neurobiology and etiology of panic disorder [^115JvLHc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Panic disorder entered the psychiatric nomenclature a quarter-century ago, and an explosion of studies followed. Defining the core phenomenology of panic disorder can be advanced by an understanding of its pathophysiology and exploration of its etiology. The lessons learned can guide the delivery of treatments to enhance the likelihood of achieving remission and the discovery of novel treatments for panic disorder.

5 TREATMENT OF COMORBID CONDITIONS

5.1 Recommendation 9. We suggest screening and treatment for comorbid conditions such as anxiety, depression, migraine headache, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, and substance use. We suggest referral to appropriate allied health services (psychologist, psychiatrist, neurologist, sleep, or substance use specialist) as indicated

Vote: 100% agreement

Psychiatric conditions, including anxiety, panic, and depression, are common in adults with CVS, 18, 75 with one systematic review finding a prevalence of 39.7% (CI: 33.6‐46.1). 76 However, few studies used standardized diagnostic interviews to ascertain psychiatric disorders, with most reporting the presence of psychiatric conditions based on either a patient report/chart review or via a screening instrument. One case report described persistent nausea that provoked anxiety, leading to conditioned anticipatory nausea and vomiting that in turn aggravated the patient's CVS. 77 Other studies reported that panic symptoms can trigger episodes of CVS. 75, 78 Taranukha et al 79 recently reported that 41% of adults with CVS had high degrees of psychological distress measured by the Basic Symptom Inventory. Anxiety and mood symptoms may both be risk factors for precipitating episodes of CVS or as a consequence of CVS. It is prudent to assess for psychiatric comorbidity in adult CVS patients. Further, several population studies have found increased symptom burden, functional disability, decreased quality of life, and increased healthcare costs when medical and mental health conditions co‐occur. 80

Migraine headache (including a family history of migraine) is closely linked with CVS. 4, 5 The prevalence of migraine headaches in adults with CVS varies between 13% and 70%. 15 75 Furthermore, 57% of adult CVS patients (with or without migraine) were reported to have a first and/or second‐degree relative with migraines or migraine variants. 75 It is unclear whether treating migraines independently improves the CVS disease course, but many medications are effective prophylactic therapies (i.e. TCAs, anti‐epileptic drugs) or abortive therapies (ie, triptans) for both conditions. Anecdotally, some committee members have observed that when CVS and migraines co‐occur, they may both respond to TCAs but at different dosages, requiring the clinician to keep titrating the dose upwards even when symptoms of one of the disorders have been abolished.

### Brief intervention for anxiety in primary care patients [^115pmy9t]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

To address the difficulty of assessing and managing multiple anxiety disorders in the primary care setting, this article provides a simple, easy-to-learn, unified approach to the diagnosis, care management, and pharmacotherapy of the 4 most common anxiety disorders found in primary care: panic, generalized anxiety disorders, social anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder. This evidence-based approach was developed for an ongoing National Institute of Mental Health-funded study designed to improve the delivery of evidence-based medication and psychotherapy treatment to primary care patients with these anxiety disorders. We present a simple, validated method to screen for the 4 major disorders that emphasizes identifying other medical or psychiatric comorbidities that can complicate treatment; an approach for initial education of the patient and discussion about treatment, including provision of some simple cognitive behavioral therapy skills, based on motivational interviewing/brief intervention approaches previously used for substance use disorders; a validated method for monitoring treatment outcome; and an algorithmic approach for the selection of initial medication treatment, the selection of alternative or adjunctive treatments when the initial approach has not produced optimal results, and indications for mental health referral.

### Diversity of effective treatments of panic attacks: what do they have in common? [^117KVLNF]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

By comparing efficacious psychological therapies of different kinds, inferences about common effective treatment mechanisms can be made. We selected six therapies for review on the basis of the diversity of their theoretical rationales and evidence for superior efficacy: psychoanalytic psychotherapy, hypercapnic breathing training, hypocapnic breathing training, reprocessing with and without eye-movement desensitization, muscle relaxation, and cognitive behavior therapy. The likely common element of all these therapies is that they reduce the immediate expectancy of a panic attack, disrupting the vicious circle of fearing fear. Modifying expectation is usually regarded as a placebo mechanism in psychotherapy, but may be a specific treatment mechanism for panic. The fact that this is seldom the rationale communicated to the patient creates a moral dilemma: Is it ethical for therapists to mislead patients to help them? Pragmatic justification of a successful practice is a way out of this dilemma. Therapies should be evaluated that deal with expectations directly by promoting positive thinking or by fostering non-expectancy.

### Pharmacological treatments in panic disorder in adults: a network meta-analysis [^112XVSfc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A panic attack is a discrete period of fear or anxiety that has a rapid onset and reaches a peak within 10 minutes. The main symptoms involve bodily systems, such as racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, churning stomach, faintness and breathlessness. Other recognised panic attack symptoms involve fearful cognitions, such as the fear of collapse, going mad or dying, and derealisation (the sensation that the world is unreal). Panic disorder is common in the general population with a prevalence of 1% to 4%. The treatment of panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions, including antidepressants and benzodiazepines.

Objectives

To compare, via network meta-analysis, individual drugs (antidepressants and benzodiazepines) or placebo in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. To rank individual active drugs for panic disorder (antidepressants, benzodiazepines and placebo) according to their effectiveness and acceptability. To rank drug classes for panic disorder (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), mono-amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and benzodiazepines (BDZs) and placebo) according to their effectiveness and acceptability. To explore heterogeneity and inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence in a network meta-analysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, CENTRAL, CDSR, MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and PsycINFO to 26 May 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people aged 18 years or older of either sex and any ethnicity with clinically diagnosed panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. We included trials that compared the effectiveness of antidepressants and benzodiazepines with each other or with a placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We analysed dichotomous data and continuous data as risk ratios (RRs), mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD): response to treatment (i.e. substantial improvement from baseline as defined by the original investigators: dichotomous outcome), total number of dropouts due to any reason (as a proxy measure of treatment acceptability: dichotomous outcome), remission (i.e. satisfactory end state as defined by global judgement of the original investigators: dichotomous outcome), panic symptom scales and global judgement (continuous outcome), frequency of panic attacks (as recorded, for example, by a panic diary; continuous outcome), agoraphobia (dichotomous outcome). We assessed the certainty of evidence using threshold analyses.

Main Results

Overall, we included 70 trials in this review. Sample sizes ranged between 5 and 445 participants in each arm, and the total sample size per study ranged from 10 to 1168. Thirty-five studies included sample sizes of over 100 participants. There is evidence from 48 RCTs (N = 10,118) that most medications are more effective in the response outcome than placebo. In particular, diazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, paroxetine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, fluoxetine and adinazolam showed the strongest effect, with diazepam, alprazolam and clonazepam ranking as the most effective. We found heterogeneity in most of the comparisons, but our threshold analyses suggest that this is unlikely to impact the findings of the network meta-analysis. Results from 64 RCTs (N = 12,310) suggest that most medications are associated with either a reduced or similar risk of dropouts to placebo. Alprazolam and diazepam were associated with a lower dropout rate compared to placebo and were ranked as the most tolerated of all the medications examined. Thirty-two RCTs (N = 8569) were included in the remission outcome. Most medications were more effective than placebo, namely desipramine, fluoxetine, clonazepam, diazepam, fluvoxamine, imipramine, venlafaxine and paroxetine, and their effects were clinically meaningful. Amongst these medications, desipramine and alprazolam were ranked highest. Thirty-five RCTs (N = 8826) are included in the continuous outcome reduction in panic scale scores. Brofaromine, clonazepam and reboxetine had the strongest reductions in panic symptoms compared to placebo, but results were based on either one trial or very small trials. Forty-one RCTs (N = 7853) are included in the frequency of panic attack outcome. Only clonazepam and alprazolam showed a strong reduction in the frequency of panic attacks compared to placebo, and were ranked highest. Twenty-six RCTs (N = 7044) provided data for agoraphobia. The strongest reductions in agoraphobia symptoms were found for citalopram, reboxetine, escitalopram, clomipramine and diazepam, compared to placebo. For the pooled intervention classes, we examined the two primary outcomes (response and dropout). The classes of medication were: SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and BDZs. For the response outcome, all classes of medications examined were more effective than placebo. TCAs as a class ranked as the most effective, followed by BDZs and MAOIs. SSRIs as a class ranked fifth on average, while SNRIs were ranked lowest. When we compared classes of medication with each other for the response outcome, we found no difference between classes. Comparisons between MAOIs and TCAs and between BDZs and TCAs also suggested no differences between these medications, but the results were imprecise. For the dropout outcome, BDZs were the only class associated with a lower dropout compared to placebo and were ranked first in terms of tolerability. The other classes did not show any difference in dropouts compared to placebo. In terms of ranking, TCAs are on average second to BDZs, followed by SNRIs, then by SSRIs and lastly by MAOIs. BDZs were associated with lower dropout rates compared to SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs. The quality of the studies comparing antidepressants with placebo was moderate, while the quality of the studies comparing BDZs with placebo and antidepressants was low.

Authors' Conclusions

In terms of efficacy, SSRIs, SNRIs (venlafaxine), TCAs, MAOIs and BDZs may be effective, with little difference between classes. However, it is important to note that the reliability of these findings may be limited due to the overall low quality of the studies, with all having unclear or high risk of bias across multiple domains. Within classes, some differences emerged. For example, amongst the SSRIs paroxetine and fluoxetine seem to have stronger evidence of efficacy than sertraline. Benzodiazepines appear to have a small but significant advantage in terms of tolerability (incidence of dropouts) over other classes.

### Self-help strategies for sub-threshold anxiety: a Delphi consensus study to find messages suitable for population-wide promotion [^113nEsB2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Many self-help strategies have been recommended for anxiety, but it is not clear which strategies are most effective and could be encouraged as part of an early intervention approach. This study used the Delphi expert consensus method to identify which strategies for mild (sub-threshold) anxiety are thought to be helpful and feasible to implement for individuals without professional assistance.

Methods

Participants were an international sample of 51 clinicians/researchers and 32 consumer advocates with expertise in anxiety. The scientific and lay literature was systematically searched for strategies claimed to be effective for anxiety. Participants rated the likely helpfulness of each strategy in reducing sub-threshold anxiety (related to generalised anxiety, social anxiety, or non-specific anxiety symptoms) and the feasibility of implementation in an iterative process across three questionnaire rounds.

Results

66 out of 324 candidate strategies were endorsed by at least 80% of both consumers and clinicians/researchers as likely to be helpful, and 18 were judged as feasible to carry out. Endorsed strategies were most frequently related to cognitive strategies and other psychological methods, interpersonal strategies, reducing physical tension, and lifestyle strategies. Few strategies were endorsed that were related to diet, supplements, or complementary medicine.

Limitations

Findings may not apply to other forms of mild anxiety related to panic attacks or specific phobias.

Conclusions

This study contributes to the evidence-base on strategies that individuals can use to improve mild anxiety symptoms. Research is now required to evaluate whether promoting the strategies can help reduce the overall community burden from anxiety disorders.

### Panic attacks and panic disorder in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a cognitive behavioral perspective [^112qU9bx]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The prevalence of panic disorder in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is up to 10 times greater than the overall population prevalence of 1.5–3.5%, and panic attacks are commonly experienced. When present, clinically significant anxiety decreases quality of life for COPD patients, and also increases health care costs. Therefore, understanding why COPD patients have such high rates of panic attacks and panic disorder is important for optimal management of COPD. The cognitive model of panic anxiety is the most widely accepted theory of panic attacks and panic disorder in physically healthy adults. According to this model, panic attacks occur when catastrophic misinterpretations of ambiguous physical sensations (such as shortness of breath or increased heart rate) increase arousal, creating a positive feedback loop that results in panic. As the major symptom of a terminal illness that threatens our most basic physical requirement, dyspnea in COPD is open to catastrophic misinterpretation. There is some experimental and clinical evidence for the applicability of the cognitive model of panic anxiety in COPD, and of the utility of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), based on this model, for treating anxiety symptoms and panic attacks in COPD patients. However, there is much need for further studies. Evidence is increasing that mental health professionals, in collaboration with multi-disciplinary pulmonary teams, potentially have key roles to play in preventing and treating panic attacks and panic disorder in COPD patients. This review addresses diagnosis, epidemiology, theoretical conceptualizations, treatment, and recommendations for future research.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of adjunctive paroxetine in panic disorder patients unsuccessfully treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy alone [^115M7Par]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Both cognitive-behavioral therapy and treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have proved to be effective in the treatment of panic disorder. The present study examined the effects of paroxetine added to continued cognitive-behavioral therapy in patients who were unsuccessfully treated with initial cognitive-behavioral therapy alone.

Method

161 patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (DSM-IV criteria) underwent a manual-guided cognitive-behavioral therapy of 15 sessions. Forty-three unsuccessfully treated patients from this group were included in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, next-step treatment study consisting of continued cognitive-behavioral therapy plus adjunctive paroxetine at a dose of 40 mg/day or continued cognitive-behavioral therapy plus placebo.

Results

Overall, patients in the cognitive-behavioral therapy plus paroxetine condition improved significantly on agoraphobic behavior (p < .05) and anxiety discomfort (p < .01), whereas patients in the cognitive-behavioral therapy plus placebo condition did not. Effect sizes in the cognitive-behavioral therapy plus paroxetine condition ranged from 1.0 to 1.8 and in the cognitive-behavioral therapy plus placebo condition, from 0.4 to 1.0.

Conclusion

Patients with panic disorder who are unsuccessfully treated with initial cognitive-behavioral therapy may benefit from the addition of an SSRI as a second treatment modality. The importance of timely evaluation of treatment results is emphasized.

### When to panic about a panic attack: a challenging case of hypersensitivity pneumonitis [^114uRRSs]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created diagnostic difficulties with the increase in mental health illnesses that often present with nonspecific symptoms, like hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a complex syndrome of varying triggers, onset, severity, and clinical manifestations that can be challenging to diagnose in many cases. Typical symptoms are nonspecific and can be attributed to other entities. There are no pediatric guidelines, which contributes to diagnostic difficulties and delays in treatment. It is particularly important to avoid diagnostic biases, have an index of suspicion for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and to develop pediatric guidelines as outcomes are excellent when diagnosed and treated promptly. This article discusses hypersensitivity pneumonitis with a focus on the causes, pathogenesis, diagnostic approach, outcomes, and prognosis while using a case to illustrate the diagnostic difficulties worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Antidepressants and benzodiazepines for panic disorder in adults [^113Te87J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A panic attack is a discrete period of fear or anxiety that has a rapid onset, reaches a peak within 10 minutes and in which at least four of 13 characteristic symptoms are experienced, including racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, stomach churning, faintness and breathlessness. Panic disorder is common in the general population with a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 4%. The treatment of panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions. Amongst pharmacological agents, antidepressants and benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment for panic disorder. Different classes of antidepressants have been compared; and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) consider antidepressants (mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)) as the first-line treatment for panic disorder, due to their more favourable adverse effect profile over monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). In addition to antidepressants, benzodiazepines are widely prescribed for the treatment of panic disorder.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the effects of antidepressants and benzodiazepines for panic disorder in adults.

Search Methods

The Specialised Register of the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group (CCMDCTR) to 11 September 2015. This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-) and PsycINFO (1967-). Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. We contacted experts in this field for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

All double-blind randomised controlled trials allocating adult patients with panic disorder to antidepressants or benzodiazepines versus any other active treatment with antidepressants or benzodiazepines.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data using a standard form. Data were entered in RevMan 5.3 using a double-check procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability.

Main Results

Thirty-five studies, including 6785 participants overall (of which 5365 in the arms of interest (antidepressant and benzodiazepines as monotherapy)) were included in this review; however, since studies addressed many different comparisons, only a few trials provided data for primary outcomes. We found low-quality evidence suggesting no difference between antidepressants and benzodiazepines in terms of response rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.47; participants = 215; studies = 2). Very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit for benzodiazepines compared to antidepressants in terms of dropouts due to any cause, even if confidence interval (CI) ranges from almost no difference to benefit with benzodiazepines (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.63; participants = 1449; studies = 7). We found some evidence suggesting that serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are better tolerated than TCAs (when looking at the number of patients experiencing adverse effects). We failed to find clinically significant differences between individual benzodiazepines. The majority of studies did not report details on random sequence generation and allocation concealment; similarly, no details were provided about strategies to ensure blinding. The study protocol was not available for almost all studies so it is difficult to make a judgment on the possibility of outcome reporting bias. Information on adverse effects was very limited.

Authors' Conclusions

The identified studies are not sufficient to comprehensively address the objectives of the present review. The majority of studies enrolled a small number of participants and did not provide data for all the outcomes specified in the protocol. For these reasons most of the analyses were underpowered and this limits the overall completeness of evidence. In general, based on the results of the current review, the possible role of antidepressants and benzodiazepines should be assessed by the clinician on an individual basis. The choice of which antidepressant and/or benzodiazepine is prescribed can not be made on the basis of this review only, and should be based on evidence of antidepressants and benzodiazepines efficacy and tolerability, including data from placebo-controlled studies, as a whole. Data on long-term tolerability issues associated with antidepressants and benzodiazepines exposure should also be carefully considered. The present review highlights the need for further higher-quality studies comparing antidepressants with benzodiazepines, which should be conducted with high-methodological standards and including pragmatic outcome measures to provide clinicians with useful and practical data. Data from the present review will be included in a network meta-analysis of psychopharmacological treatment in panic disorder, which will hopefully provide further useful information on this issue.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112GQ6Cj]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Outcomes of interest

The primary outcomes were remission, defined as no panic attack for at least one week at the end of study, and dropout, defined as patients who discontinued treatment or withdrew before the end of the study owing to adverse events, protocol violation, or a lack of treatment efficacy. The secondary outcomes were anxiety and depression symptom scores and any adverse events (eg, sedation, fatigue or weakness, malaise, ataxia, slurred speech, cognitive impairment, sleep problems, sexual dysfunctions, tachycardia, palpitations, dry mouth, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea or vomiting, gastrointestinal problems, chest pain, nervousness, headache, lack of coordination, blurred vision, difficulty with urination, menstrual irregularity, change in appetite, change in body weight, upper respiratory tract infection, irritability, agitation, paraesthesia, diaphoresis, tremor, anxiety, depressive symptoms, asthenia, and orthostatic hypotension). Anxiety and depression symptom scores were originally measured by the tools specified in the studies included, such as the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety, clinical anxiety scale, Hamilton rating scale for depression, and Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale. These validated tools have been accepted and commonly used for measuring anxiety and depression symptoms. Given the limited number of studies that reported health related quality of life, this was not considered as an outcome (see review protocol registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020180638).

Data extraction

Two reviewers (NC and KC) independently extracted data on study characteristics (eg, setting, design, study period), participant characteristics (eg, mean age, percentage of women, duration of panic disorder), duration of treatment, and outcome measurements. Data used for pooling were extracted as means and standard deviations or continuous outcomes, and number of participants across treatments for dichotomous outcomes. When data were insufficient, we contacted the corresponding authors of the studies.

### Management of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in general health care settings: new WHO recommendations [^115Quag6]. World Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders are highly prevalent and account for a significant burden of disease. However, in many countries, there is a gap between the need for MNS services and the available health system capacity and resources. The World Health Organization (WHO)'s mhGAP Action Programme was launched to address this gap by developing recommendations for the identification and management of priority MNS conditions in non‐specialist care settings. Several derivative tools, such as the mhGAP Intervention Guide (mhGAP‐IG), have been developed to support the programme's implementation.

The mhGAP approach consists of interventions for the management of priority MNS conditions. These interventions are identified on the basis of evidence about their effectiveness and the feasibility of their scaling up in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Among MNS conditions covered in the first and second iterations of the mhGAP‐IG were depression, psychoses, self‐harm/suicide, epilepsy, dementia, disorders due to substance use in adults, and mental and behavioural disorders in children and adolescents.

The need has emerged for additional guidance on conditions not covered in the programme. Among these are anxiety disorders, which as a group are the most common mental disorders worldwide, with over 300 million people, about 4% of the global population, living with an anxiety disorder as of 2019. Anxiety disorders also represent the second leading cause of disability‐adjusted life years (DALYs) among mental and substance use disorders, and carry a significant social and economic burden. Moreover, anxiety disorders have an early onset, representing the most prevalent mental disorder among older adolescents overall (4.6%), and particularly among adolescent girls (5.5%).

Although there are many effective treatments available, as many as 75% of people with anxiety disorders do not receive any care globally. To address this gap, the WHO has developed a new module, as part of the mhGAP guideline update released in November 2023, to provide recommendations for the management of anxiety disorders and promote broader implementation of evidence‐based interventions in low‐ and middle‐income countries. This module focuses on generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD), selected due to their prevalence, their estimated burden, the likelihood of their presentation in general health care settings, and the availability of evidence on feasibility and effectiveness of interventions in non‐specialist care settings.

### 'The COPD breathlessness manual': a randomised controlled trial to test a cognitive-behavioural manual versus information booklets on health service use, mood and health status, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115PHtc4]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The CM

The CM was developed by a health psychologist, with multidisciplinary team input and piloted with small focus groups of COPD patients over 6 months. The final version consisted of a 5-week intervention, with each week divided into six sections. For example, week 1: 'Understanding COPD and the experience of breathlessness' was divided into the following six sections:

Section 1: What is COPD all about?

Section 2: Focus on breathlessness — part 1

Section 3: How to control breathlessness and panic

Section 4: Daily exercises

Section 5: Relaxation CD: Introduction and exercise 1: Breathing control

Section 6: Summary and weekly record

The main theme was breaking the cognitive-behavioural maintenance cycle of breathlessness, panic, frustration and depression, with a specific focus on ways to manage distress (for both patients and carers) to ultimately prevent inappropriate A&E attendance and hospital admissions. Education on distinguishing between a COPD exacerbation and a panic attack was provided alongside self-management guidance. Shifting unhelpful illness cognitions and encouraging adaptive behaviours using pacing and goal-setting was a central strategy. Breathing control and mobility exercises were demonstrated and trialled and participants were encouraged to practise these daily. Participants were asked to complete self-help tasks as well as a weekly mood and breathlessness rating. The manual was accompanied by a relaxation CD.

IB

Participants received a series of British Lung Foundation COPD booklets and were encouraged to work through them over 5 weeks.

Facilitator input

The facilitators (psychologists) were trained in applying CBT techniques within a physical health context to formulate common cognitive-behavioural maintenance patterns as well as utilising motivational interviewing to facilitate behaviour change. A one-day training workshop consisted of understanding the physical and psychological issues in COPD, the challenges of self-management in COPD, the theory and application of the CBT model for breathlessness, panic and prevention of A&E attendance as well as managing frustration and low mood. In addition, practical role plays were conducted for enhancing skills in assessing patients' current psychological status, explaining the interaction between emotions and COPD symptoms, motivation (and barriers) to participation, as well as demonstration of exercises and breathing techniques.

Primary outcome: health service use

Frequency of A&E attendance and frequency and duration of COPD-related hospital admissions 12 months pre- and post-intervention were recorded from a district general hospital's electronic records. Health-care resource group tariffswere calculated for each activity.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116PiXa1]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Evaluation of acute chest pain with suspected anxiety and other psychosomatic considerations — For patients with recurrent, similar presentations for acute chest pain with no evidence of a physiological cause on prior diagnostic evaluation including a negative workup for myocardial ischemia, referral to a cognitive-behavioral therapist is reasonable (COR 2a, LOE B-R). This presentation includes recurrent chest pain despite angiographically normal coronary arteries and no definable cardiac disease, including an assessment for INOCA, and has been variously labeled angina, angina-like, "atypical" angina, or noncardiac chest pain. Prognosis of patients with noncardiac chest pain is largely devoid of cardiac complications, and the close association with psychological syndromes such as anxiety, panic attack, depression, somatoform disorder, and cardiophobia suggests that there may be a psychogenic origin in many patients.

### Dismantling cognitive-behaviour therapy for panic disorder: a systematic review and component network meta-analysis [^1111aWUh]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by the recurrence of unexpected panic attacks, in which an intense fear accompanied by a series of bodily and/or cognitive symptoms develops abruptly, without an apparent external cause (American Psychiatric Association). In the general population, about one-quarter of people suffering from panic disorder also have agoraphobia (Kessler et al.). Panic disorder is common in the general population, with a life-time prevalence of 3.7% without agoraphobia and 1.1% with agoraphobia (Kessler et al.). In primary care settings, panic syndromes have been reported to have a prevalence of around 10% (King et al.).

Three types of intervention are recommended for treating individuals with panic disorder (NICE). The intervention for which there is evidence for the longest duration of effect is psychological therapy, followed by pharmacological therapy and self-help. Among various psychological therapies, guidelines recommend the use of cognitive-behaviour psychotherapy (CBT) (American Psychiatric Association; Royal Australian & New Zealand College of Psychiatrists; NICE; Katzman et al.). In line with these recommendations, a recent Cochrane review and network meta-analysis (Pompoli et al.) found CBT to be the most efficacious treatment among other competing psychological therapies.

### A case of hyperventilation leading to apnea and desaturation in PACU [^115FMD17]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our patient responded to haloperidol, and therefore, the possibility of postoperative delirium (POD) cannot be ignored. However, in our case there were no identified perioperative triggers that might have caused POD. Moreover, postoperative delirium is more common on 1st or 2nd postoperative day and it persists for a longer period. On the contrary, our patient had an event immediately following the surgery and it lasted for a brief period of time. Also, once she recovered from the initial insult she did not have any fluctuation in the mental status or attention deficits. Thus it is less likely to be POD.

After ruling out all the possible causes, we suspected it to be conversion disorder, since it is more common in young females. There are several case reports of conversion disorder presenting during the postoperative period with symptoms like paraplegia, headache, visual loss, non-epileptic seizures and hyperventilation. But these patients had risk factors and occurrence of such events in the past. Our patient did not give any supportive history, nor did she manifest any further episode during her stay in the hospital. The psychiatrist denied the diagnosis of conversion as this was the first episode of such nature and there were many confounding factors such as use of multiple anesthetic drugs, stress of surgery, etc. The features also did not fit the diagnostic criteria for panic attack. So, the psychiatrist suggested acute stress reaction to be a more likely cause.

Although we could not identify the exact reason for hyperventilation, we were able to manage it successfully without any further complication. In any case with hyperventilation during the immediate postoperative period, a step by step approach is needed to identify its cause and manage accordingly. Therefore, here we have proposed an algorithmic approach to manage such patients in the PACU (Fig. 1).

### Review of the long-term effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy compared to medications in panic disorder [^114QRJtV]. Depression and Anxiety (2003). Low credibility.

Panic disorder is a recurrent and disabling illness. It is believed that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has a long-term protective effect for this disorder. This would offer CBT considerable advantage over medication management of panic disorder, as patients often relapse when they are tapered off their medications. This is a review of the literature about the long-term effectiveness of CBT. We searched for follow-up studies of panic disorder using CBT. Of the 78 citations produced in the initial search, most had major methodological flaws, including ignoring losses to follow-up, not accounting for interval treatment, and unclear reporting. Three papers met strict methodological criteria, and two of these demonstrated a modest protective effect of CBT in panic disorder patients. We make recommendations for well-designed studies involving comparisons of medications and cognitive behavior therapy.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1125JrqF]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Panic, anxiety and depression in COPD — psychological and rehabilitation interventions: The causes of depression and anxiety symptoms in people with COPD are multifactorial and include behavioral, social and biological factors. Pulmonary rehabilitation may help reduce anxiety symptoms. The efficacy of antidepressants in people with COPD has been inconclusive, possibly as a result of methodological issues in the published trials. Cognitive behavioral therapy and mind-body interventions (e.g., mindfulness-based therapy, yoga, and relaxation) can reduce anxiety and depression; mind-body interventions also improve physical outcomes such as lung function, dyspnea, exercise capacity and fatigue in people with COPD and psychological problems. Fatigue in people with COPD can be improved by self-management education, pulmonary rehabilitation, nutritional support and mind-body interventions.

### Acute stress reaction in combat: emerging evidence and peer-based interventions [^114EhzmV]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

It is also useful to distinguish panic attacks from ASRs. In both panic attacks and ASRs, the individual is overwhelmed by intense physiological and psychological stress, but there are important differences. Panic attacks are understood to occur within the context of a specified disorder (such as panic disorder), frequently present in the absence of a clearly identifiable external trigger, and are often recurrent. In contrast, ASRs appear to affect individuals regardless of their mental health history and are considered to be a normal response to a discrete and singular external threat. Symptom duration also appears to differ, with panic attacks resolving within minutes and an ASR resolving over a more variable time frame (from a few minutes to a few days). For individuals working in high-stress occupations, the potential for prolonged duration of symptoms in the context of an ASR is a critical concern.

### Benzodiazepines versus placebo for panic disorder in adults [^11347y8h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent unexpected panic attacks consisting of a wave of intense fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes. Panic disorder is a common disorder, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 1% to 5% in the general population and a 7% to 10% prevalence in primary care settings. Its aetiology is not fully understood and is probably heterogeneous. Panic disorder is treated with psychological and pharmacological interventions, often used in combination. Although benzodiazepines are frequently used in the treatment of panic disorder, guidelines recommend antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as first-line treatment for panic disorder, particularly due to their lower incidence of dependence and withdrawal reaction when compared to benzodiazepines. Despite these recommendations, benzodiazepines are widely used in the treatment of panic disorder, probably because of their rapid onset of action.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and acceptability of benzodiazepines versus placebo in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR Studies and References), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), and PsycINFO (1967-) up to 29 May 2018. We handsearched reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews. We contacted experts in the field for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

All double-blind (blinding of patients and personnel) controlled trials randomising adults with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia to benzodiazepine or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked the eligibility of studies and extracted data using a standardised form. Data were then entered data into Review Manager 5 using a double-check procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability.

Main Results

We included 24 studies in the review with a total of 4233 participants, of which 2124 were randomised to benzodiazepines and 1475 to placebo. The remaining 634 participants were randomised to other active treatments in three-arm trials. We assessed the overall methodological quality of the included studies as poor. We rated all studies as at unclear risk of bias in at least three domains. In addition, we judged 20 of the 24 included studies as having a high risk of bias in at least one domain. Two primary outcomes of efficacy and acceptability showed a possible advantage of benzodiazepines over placebo. The estimated risk ratio (RR) for a response to treatment was 1.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39 to 1.96) in favour of benzodiazepines, which corresponds to an estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 7). The dropout rate was lower among participants treated with benzodiazepines (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.64); the estimated NNTB was 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). We rated the quality of the evidence as low for both primary outcomes. The possible advantage of benzodiazepine was also seen for remission (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.88) and the endpoint data for social functioning (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.53, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.42), both with low-quality evidence. We assessed the evidence for the other secondary outcomes as of very low quality. With the exception of the analyses of the change score data for depression (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.04) and social functioning (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.88 to 0.24), all secondary outcome analyses showed an effect in favour of benzodiazepines compared to placebo. However, the number of dropouts due to adverse effects was higher with benzodiazepines than with placebo (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.15; low-quality evidence). Furthermore, our analyses of adverse events showed that a higher proportion of participants experienced at least one adverse effect when treated with benzodiazepines (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.37; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Low-quality evidence shows a possible superiority of benzodiazepine over placebo in the short-term treatment of panic disorders. The validity of the included studies is questionable due to possible unmasking of allocated treatments, high dropout rates, and probable publication bias. Moreover, the included studies were only short-term studies and did not examine the long-term efficacy nor the risks of dependency and withdrawal symptoms. Due to these limitations, our results regarding the efficacy of benzodiazepines versus placebo provide only limited guidance for clinical practice. Furthermore, the clinician's choice is not between benzodiazepines and placebo, but between benzodiazepines and other agents, notably SSRIs, both in terms of efficacy and adverse effects. The choice of treatment should therefore be guided by the patient's preference and should balance benefits and harms from treatment in a long-term perspective.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^115uLCj5]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Areas for additional treatment research in pediatric anxiety — the AHRQ/Mayo review yielded insufficient information to draw conclusions about benefits or harms in several domains, so treatment statements for these domains are not offered and research is urgently needed. Priority gaps include circumstances suggesting preferential use of SSRIs or CBT, preferential sequencing of SSRIs and CBT, treatment effect modifiers, use of non-CBT psychotherapies, use of benzodiazepines, long-term safety risks of pharmacologic treatment, and effectiveness of psychosocial and pharmacological treatments in underserved populations and minorities. Additional evidence limitations include a relatively small body of evidence especially for medication studies, brief follow-up, heterogeneity in rating scales, sparse reporting of mediators and moderators, poor representation of very young children, young adults, and multiracial youths, paucity or lack of medication studies for selective mutism, specific phobias, panic, or agoraphobia as the primary disorder, variable methods for reporting treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events, and insufficient data to assess risk of suicidal behavior.

### Antidepressants versus placebo for panic disorder in adults [^114KtvmP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Panic disorder is characterised by repeated, unexpected panic attacks, which represent a discrete period of fear or anxiety that has a rapid onset, reaches a peak within 10 minutes, and in which at least four of 13 characteristic symptoms are experienced, including racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, stomach churning, faintness and breathlessness. It is common in the general population with a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 4%. The treatment of panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions. Amongst pharmacological agents, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the British Association for Psychopharmacology consider antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as the first-line treatment for panic disorder, due to their more favourable adverse effect profile over monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Several classes of antidepressants have been studied and compared, but it is still unclear which antidepressants have a more or less favourable profile in terms of effectiveness and acceptability in the treatment of this condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antidepressants for panic disorder in adults, specifically:1. to determine the efficacy of antidepressants in alleviating symptoms of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in comparison to placebo;2. to review the acceptability of antidepressants in panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in comparison with placebo; and3. to investigate the adverse effects of antidepressants in panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, including the general prevalence of adverse effects, compared to placebo.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders' (CCMD) Specialised Register, and CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO up to May 2017. We handsearched reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

All double-blind, randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) allocating adults with panic disorder to antidepressants or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data using a standard form. We entered data into Review Manager 5 using a double-check procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and settings. Primary outcomes included failure to respond, measured by a range of response scales, and treatment acceptability, measured by total number of dropouts for any reason. Secondary outcomes included failure to remit, panic symptom scales, frequency of panic attacks, agoraphobia, general anxiety, depression, social functioning, quality of life and patient satisfaction, measured by various scales as defined in individual studies. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome MAIN RESULTS: Forty-one unique RCTs including 9377 participants overall, of whom we included 8252 in the 49 placebo-controlled arms of interest (antidepressant as monotherapy and placebo alone) in this review. The majority of studies were of moderate to low quality due to inconsistency, imprecision and unclear risk of selection and performance bias. We found low-quality evidence that revealed a benefit for antidepressants as a group in comparison with placebo in terms of efficacy measured as failure to respond (risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.79; participants = 6500; studies = 30). The magnitude of effect corresponds to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 7 (95% CI 6 to 9): that means seven people would need to be treated with antidepressants in order for one to benefit. We observed the same finding when classes of antidepressants were compared with placebo. Moderate-quality evidence suggested a benefit for antidepressants compared to placebo when looking at number of dropouts due to any cause (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97; participants = 7850; studies = 30). The magnitude of effect corresponds to a NNTB of 27 (95% CI 17 to 105); treating 27 people will result in one person fewer dropping out. Considering antidepressant classes, TCAs showed a benefit over placebo, while for SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs) we observed no difference. When looking at dropouts due to adverse effects, which can be considered as a measure of tolerability, we found moderate-quality evidence showing that antidepressants as a whole are less well tolerated than placebo. In particular, TCAs and SSRIs produced more dropouts due to adverse effects in comparison with placebo, while the confidence interval for SNRI, noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (NRI) and other antidepressants were wide and included the possibility of no difference.

Authors' Conclusions

The identified studies comprehensively address the objectives of the present review. Based on these results, antidepressants may be more effective than placebo in treating panic disorder. Efficacy can be quantified as a NNTB of 7, implying that seven people need to be treated with antidepressants in order for one to benefit. Antidepressants may also have benefit in comparison with placebo in terms of number of dropouts, but a less favourable profile in terms of dropout due to adverse effects. However, the tolerability profile varied between different classes of antidepressants. The choice of whether antidepressants should be prescribed in clinical practice cannot be made on the basis of this review. Limitations in results include funding of some studies by pharmaceutical companies, and only assessing short-term outcomes. Data from the present review will be included in a network meta-analysis of psychopharmacological treatment in panic disorder, which will hopefully provide further useful information on this issue.

### Treatment principles in adults and development of patient-reported outcomes in cyclic vomiting syndrome [^115YXLxR]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a disorder of gut–brain interaction (DGBI) with a prevalence of about 2% in the US, 1% in the UK, and 0.7% in Canada based on a recent population‐based international survey study. Cyclic vomiting syndrome is characterized by episodes of recurrent nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that are separated by periods of normal or baseline health. Episodes of CVS are often triggered by stress, both positive and negative. Panic symptoms are often part of the episode as patients struggle given the unpredictable nature of symptoms and the lack of effective treatment. This cycle of increasing anxiety and fear associated with episodes and the debilitating nature of the illness results in diminished quality of life.

There are four phases of CVS: (a) interepisodic phase when patients are at baseline; (b) a prodromal phase when patients experience nausea, abdominal pain, and a premonition of an impending attack; (c) the emetic phase consisting of severe vomiting, retching and other symptoms; and (d) the recovery phase when patient slowly resume oral intake and return to baseline. These phases have important therapeutic implications as recent management guidelines by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society (ANMS) recommend prophylactic therapy in patients with moderate‐to‐severe CVS. All patients regardless of severity should be offered abortive therapy for use in the prodromal phase to try and stop progression to a full‐blown episode, much like the treatment of migraine headaches.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^111H5aVq]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

When treatment fails

A conclusion that treatment has failed should be made with caution and must always be preceded by a thorough review of the underlying reasons. In some cases, apparent failures might be remediable, such as when failure is due to poor adherence or suboptimal dosing. Whereas some patients benefit from higher doses, others might benefit from lower doses that have fewer adverse effects and therefore improve adherence. Alternatives when first-line medications fail are outlined above (see Step 4 and Step 5). If all treatments fail, the diagnosis should be questioned and specialist referral is indicated.

When specialist referral is needed

Approximately 90% of people who seek professional care for migraine should be treated in primary care. Referral to specialist care should be reserved for the minority of patients whose condition is diagnostically challenging, difficult to treat or complicated by comorbidities. Specialist care provides access to greater expertise maintained by experience and to multidisciplinary care. However, specialist capacity is limited and the cost is much higher.

Recommendations

Evaluate treatment responses shortly after initiation (after 2–3 months) or a change of treatment and regularly thereafter (every 6–12 months).
Evaluate the effectiveness of treatment by assessing attack frequency, attack severity and migraine-related disability.
When outcomes are suboptimal, review the diagnosis, treatment strategy, dosing and adherence.
If all treatment fails, question the diagnosis and consider specialist referral.

### Panic disorder [^111RS2og]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Panic disorder is a common mental disorder that affects up to 5% of the population at some point in life. It is often disabling, especially when complicated by agoraphobia, and is associated with substantial functional morbidity and reduced quality of life. The disorder is also costly for individuals and society, as shown by increased use of health care, absenteeism, and reduced workplace productivity. Some physical illnesses (eg, asthma) commonly occur with panic disorder, and certain lifestyle factors (eg, smoking) increase the risk for the disorder, but causal pathways are still unclear. Genetic and early experiential susceptibility factors also exist, but their exact nature and pathophysiological mechanisms remain unknown. Despite an imprecise, although increased, understanding of cause, strong evidence supports the use of several effective treatments (eg, pharmacological, cognitive-behavioural). The adaptation and dissemination of these treatments to the frontlines of medical-care delivery should be urgent goals for the public-health community.

### Efficacy of 2 interventions for panic disorder in patients presenting to the ED with chest pain [^117ANacU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Brief and efficacious interventions for panic disorder (PD) in patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) for chest pain are essential. This study assessed the effects of 2 interventions for this population: a brief cognitive-behavioral therapy delivered by psychologists, and a 6-month pharmacologic treatment initiated and managed by the ED physician. The relative efficacy of both interventions was also examined.

Materials and Methods

Forty-seven adult patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for PD upon presentation to the ED were assigned to 1 of 3 experimental conditions: a brief cognitive-behavioral therapy (7 sessions), a pharmacologic intervention (paroxetine; 6 months); and a usual care control condition. The primary outcome was severity of PD on Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and secondary outcomes included measures of PD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and cardiac anxiety. Outcome measures were taken at baseline, postintervention, as well as at 3- and 6-month follow-ups.

Results

Patients receiving either intervention demonstrated significant reductions of PD severity (P = 0.012), frequency of panic attacks (P = 0.048), and depressive symptoms (P = 0.027).

Conclusion

Taken together, these findings suggest that empirically validated interventions for PD initiated in an ED setting can be feasible and efficacious, and future studies should assess their impact on both the direct (ie, health care utilization) and indirect (ie, lost productivity) costs associated with PD morbidity in this population.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^116v7jjD]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

AHRQ/Mayo review — scope and methods for treatments of child and adolescent anxiety disorders — The objective of the AHRQ/Mayo review was to evaluate the effectiveness of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of specific child and adolescent anxiety disorders and to evaluate safety concerns, and it was made available in August 2017 with errata published in July 2018. To be eligible, studies included children and adolescents between 3 and 18 years old with confirmed diagnoses of panic, social anxiety, specific phobia (including school phobia), generalized anxiety, or separation anxiety disorder, who received any psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy (alone or combined), and reported specified outcomes. Specified outcomes included primary anxiety symptoms from patient, parent, or clinician measures; secondary anxiety outcomes such as coping, avoidance, or anxious thoughts; global function; social function; satisfaction with treatment; response to treatment; and remission of the disorder. Both randomized controlled trials and comparative observational studies were included for effectiveness outcomes, and case reports or case series were used to identify adverse events. The key questions were twofold, addressing the comparative effectiveness of treatments for these disorders and the general and potential harms of available treatments. The strength of evidence for each outcome and comparison (e.g., fluoxetine vs. CBT) was rated via a consensus process, with randomized controlled trials starting with high strength of evidence and observational studies starting with low strength, and initial ratings were then raised or lowered based on five additional domains: risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency, and publication bias.

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy and the treatment of panic disorder: efficacy and strategies [^114S2u6Z]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

In this article, we review the efficacy and applications of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for panic disorder. Research supports CBT as an effective first-line treatment of panic disorder that offers relatively quick onset of action and long-term maintenance of treatment benefits. These characteristics, plus the acceptability, tolerability, and cost-efficacy of CBT, make it an especially attractive treatment option for panic disorder. We review these findings as well as some newer developments in the field including research on emotional acceptance, the importance of context in extinction learning, and the use of CBT in combination with pharmacotherapy.

### Bupropion hydrochloride — Bupropion hydrochloride — sr [^116uNLsH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases [see Boxed Warning].

The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

### Assessing vulnerability to panic: a systematic review of psychological and physiological responses to biological challenges as prospective predictors of panic attacks and panic disorder [^117Q2gv2]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Bias assessment and quality of evidence

We used the Cochrane Collaboration's bias assessment guidelines to evaluate risk of performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias and reporting bias in each eligible study. Performance bias denoted systematic differences between 'groups' (ie, those who exhibited an elevated response to the biological challenge relative to those who did not) in exposure to factors other than the response to the biological challenge (eg, if responders were provided treatment, but non-responders were not). Detection bias denoted systematic differences between groups in outcome assessments (eg, if those conducting follow-up assessments were aware of the participant's responder status, they may be biased in their assessment of panic attacks and panic disorder). Attrition bias denoted differences between groups in withdrawal from the study (eg, if responders were more likely to drop from the study during the follow-up period). Reporting bias denoted selective outcome reporting (eg, if two measures of panic attacks were administered during the follow-up period, but only one is reported). In addition, we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines to consider the quality of evidence in favour of the hypothesis that response to a biological challenge is predictive of subsequent panic attacks and panic disorder.

### Disseminating treatment for anxiety disorders step 2: peer recommendations to seek help [^112Yypjq]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the high prevalence of and significant psychological burden caused by anxiety disorders, as few as 25% of individuals with these disorders seek treatment, and treatment seeking by African-Americans is particularly uncommon. This purpose of the current study was to gather information regarding the public's recommendations regarding help-seeking for several anxiety disorders and to compare Caucasian and African-American participants on these variables. A community sample of 577 US adults completed a telephone survey that included vignettes portraying individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia/social anxiety disorder (SP/SAD), panic disorder (PD), and for comparison, depression. The sample was ½ Caucasian and ½ African American. Respondents were significantly less likely to recommend help-seeking for SP/SAD and GAD (78.8% and 84.3%, respectively) than for depression (90.9%). In contrast, recommendations to seek help for panic disorder were common (93.6%) and similar to rates found for depression. The most common recommendations were to seek help from a primary care physician (PCP). African Americans were more likely to recommend help-seeking for GAD than Caucasians. Findings suggested that respondents believed individuals with anxiety disorders should seek treatment. Given that respondents often recommended consulting a PCP, we recommend educating PCPs about anxiety disorders and empirically-supported interventions.

### Acute aortic syndrome [^114sZA8k]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

Acute aortic syndrome is a life threatening condition caused by a tear in the thoracic aorta.
Consider acute aortic syndrome in all patients presenting with chest pain that is unexplained or associated with a high risk condition, pain feature, or examination finding in the aortic dissection detection risk score.
Undertake immediate computed tomography angiography if the patient is acutely unwell and has characteristic features of acute aortic syndrome.
Consider using D-dimer as an alternative to computed tomography angiography for ruling out acute aortic syndrome in patients who have a high risk feature, but the diagnosis is considered unlikely.

A healthy woman in her mid 50s experiences sudden, tearing pain, like a lightning bolt from her neck to her chest, radiating to her back, coming in waves, with severity fluctuating over subsequent hours. At times she is able to talk and even walk, but she feels that her consciousness level is mostly reduced, and she has difficulty breathing. She feels dizzy and nauseous. Her mother survived a type A aortic dissection, three years previously, at the age of 77.

An ambulance is called and arrives 90 minutes later. A paramedic makes a tentative diagnosis of aortic dissection based on the presenting features. The woman is given oral morphine and transported to hospital, arriving 45 minutes later. In the emergency department she receives an initial diagnosis of panic attack and is managed conservatively, until reassessment some hours later triggers computed tomography angiography, which shows an aortic dissection.

### Are benzodiazepines still the medication of choice for patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia? [^112F2Ehv]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Recently, pharmacological treatment guidelines for panic disorder have changed as newer treatment options have become available. The authors examined how the use of psychotropic drugs has shifted over the course of 10 years to determine if prescribing patterns have changed to reflect these revised treatment guidelines.

Method

A total of 443 patients with panic disorder were enrolled in the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Project, a prospective longitudinal study of anxiety disorders. These patients were interviewed over the course of 10 years to examine their use of psychotropic medications.

Results

Despite efforts aimed at increasing the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in patients with panic disorder (e.g. APA's practice guideline for panic disorder, Food and Drug Administration approval of particular SSRIs for the treatment of panic disorder), only a modest increase in their use was found. Treatment patterns for psychotropic drugs appear to have remained stable over the past decade, with benzodiazepines being the most commonly used medication for panic disorder. In comparison, SSRI use throughout the follow-up period has remained low. Patients using an SSRI did not have a more favorable clinical course than those using a benzodiazepine, nor were there significantly better rates of remission in patients using SSRIs and benzodiazepines concomitantly.

Conclusions

These results highlight a gap between pharmacological treatment guidelines and actual delivery of care in that recommendations to use SSRIs to treat panic disorder are not being followed. Factors potentially associated with promoting and ignoring treatment recommendations are discussed.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^112JeQe8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Panic disorder and air hunger descriptors — unexplained dyspnea is one of the hallmarks of panic disorder, and clustering of suffocating, smothering, and air hunger has been observed in patients with panic disorder in response to breath-holding and carbon dioxide (CO2) rebreathing or challenge; similar clustering has been reported in idiopathic hyperventilation without cardiopulmonary or neuromuscular disease. This suggests that, in susceptible individuals, air hunger may occur even in the absence of reduced ventilatory capacity, with possible roles for excessive ventilatory drive, impaired perception of achieved ventilation, increased sensitivity to CO2 (potentially with a genetic component), or excessive responses to cerebral acidosis or hypoxia due to hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia. Whatever term is used, it represents a perception that the drive to breathe is not being matched by adequate pulmonary ventilation.

### CBT treatment delivery formats for panic disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1169QeBy]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1 shows selected characteristics of the included studies. Seventy-seven per cent of participants suffered from panic disorder associated with agoraphobia. The mean age was 37.3 years. The mean proportion of included women was 69.4%. All studies enroled adults between 18 and 65 years of age, with only one study including older adults (i.e. ⩾ 65 years) (Hendriks et al.). Studies were distributed over 31 years (1989–2020) and generally had their main endpoint evaluation around the 12th week of treatment (range: 1 to 24). The mean number of therapy sessions was approximately 10 (range: 1 to 19). Most participants were receiving medications during the treatment period: 68 RCTs (91.9% of the total) allowed various psychotropic drugs to be taken on top of the experimental and control treatments. However, the great majority of the RCTs enroled participants only if they had been on a stable dosage for at least 1–3 months, and upon agreement to keep the dosages constant throughout the treatment period. Most treatments were implemented following the guidance of a manual (72 RCTs, 97.3%) and were delivered by licensed or specifically trained and supervised therapists (61 RCTs, 82.4%) but treatment integrity was verified in only 25 studies (33.8%) (online Supplementary material appendix I). Thirty-nine studies (70.9%) employed scales specifically designed to capture panic disorder symptoms.

Risk of bias of included studies

In most cases (40 RCTs, 54.2%) studies were considered to be at overall high risk of bias, for 25 (33.7%) studies there were 'some concerns', and 9 (12.1%) were judged to be at low risk of bias (online Supplementary material appendix J). The majority of the studies missed to adequately report the randomisation process, leading to 'some concerns' judgment in 58 studies (78.3%), 38 studies (51.5%) were judged to be at low risk of deviation from the intended interventions, for 45 (60.8%) there were no concerns of missing outcome data, 32 (43.2%) had low risk of bias in the measurement of the outcome, but only 7 (9.4%) were identified as having a low risk of bias in the selection of reported results.

### Panic disorder [^115PjAE5]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Panic disorder occurs in up to 3% of the adult population at some time, and is associated with other psychiatric and personality disorders, and with drug and alcohol abuse. The risk of suicide and attempted suicide has been found to be higher in people with panic disorder than in people with other psychiatric illness, including depression.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of non-drug treatments for panic disorder? What are the effects of drug treatments for panic disorder? What are the effects of combined drug and psychological treatments for panic disorder? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 36 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: applied relaxation, benzodiazepines, breathing retraining, brief dynamic psychotherapy, buspirone, client-centred therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (alone or plus drug treatments), cognitive restructuring, couple therapy, exposure (external or interoceptive), insight-orientated therapy, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), psychoeducation, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), self-help, and tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine).

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111DkVJU]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Results

A total of 2019 studies were identified, of which 87 (12 800 participants) met the inclusion criteria (fig 1). Table 1 shows the characteristics of the included studies (see supplementary file for references e1-e87). The mean age of participants was 35.0 years and 63.7% (7819/12 276) were women. Most of the studies (39/87, 44.3%) used the DSM-III-TR (text revision) criteria for diagnosing panic disorder. Eighty three studies (95%) included participants with agoraphobia, and duration of panic disorder was 6.9 years before study commencement. The most common duration of treatment was eight weeks (35%), followed by 12 weeks (19%). A total of 21 comparisons were considered for analysis; most compared benzodiazepines with placebo (n = 16 studies) and SSRIs with placebo (n = 16), followed by tricyclic antidepressants versus benzodiazepines (n = 8), tricyclic antidepressants versus SSRIs (n = 8), and SSRIs versus SSRIs (n = 6), and tricyclic antidepressants versus placebo (n = 5), with the remaining comparisons represented in only a few studies. Fifty two studies reported outcomes for remission, 75 for dropouts, 41 for anxiety symptoms, 22 for depression symptoms, and 54 for adverse events. Quality of life outcomes were not considered as data were only available from seven studies.

Characteristics of included studies — part 1 (see supplementary file for references)

Table 1b
Characteristics of included studies — part 2 (see supplementary file for references)

DSM = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; ICD-10 = International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th revision; SSRIs = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; SNRIs = serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors; SR = sustained release; CR = controlled release; ER = extended release.

Risk of bias assessment

Most of the studies had at least some concerns (70%; 61/87) or were at high risk of bias (29%; 25/87); only a single study was considered low risk (supplementary eFigures 1 and 2). Risk of bias was mostly related to insufficient details of randomisation and concealment processes (88%; 77/87 studies) and selection of results reported (91%; 79/87) owing to non-registration or publication of study protocols.

### A randomized, controlled clinical trial of standard, group and brief cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic disorder with agoraphobia: a two-year follow-up [^113dGuD1]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

A randomized controlled clinical trial with a wait-list control group was conducted to examine the effectiveness of three modalities (brief, group, and standard) of cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for panic disorder with agoraphobia. A total of 100 participants meeting DSM-IV criteria were randomly assigned to each treatment condition: a 14-session standard CBT (n = 33), a 14-session group CBT (n = 35) and a 7-session brief CBT (n = 32). Participants received a self-study manual and were assigned weekly readings and exercises. The results indicate that regardless of the treatment condition, CBT for moderate to severe PDA is beneficial in medium and long term. To this effect, all three-treatment conditions significantly reduced the intensity of symptoms, increased participants' quality of life, offered high effect sizes, superior maintenance of gains over time, and lower rates of relapse, compared to the wait-list control.
