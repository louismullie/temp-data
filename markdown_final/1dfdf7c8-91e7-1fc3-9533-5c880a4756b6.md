Assuming that each dᵢ can be any of the ten decimal digits 0,1,2, …, 9, the number of different memorable telephone numbers is
(A) 19,810 (B) 19,910 (C) 19,990 (D) 20,000 (E) 20,100

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many different 7-digit telephone numbers are "memorable", where a number is memorable if its 3-digit prefix matches either the 3-digit sequence starting at position 4 or the 3-digit sequence starting at position 5. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of 7-digit numbers. Then, I should define the two overlapping "memorable" conditions and consider inclusion–exclusion. Next, I will compute the counts for each condition and their intersection. Finally, I will subtract the memorable count from the total to get the answer and verify it against the options.

> Let me first confirm the total space. A 7-digit number has 10 choices for each digit, so the total number of possible 7-digit sequences is 10⁷, which is 10,000,000. Wait, let me verify that I'm not conflating this with the memorable subset; yes, that's the total universe we are drawing from, and we will later subtract the memorable ones to get the desired count [^notfound].

> Now, I need to define the memorable conditions precisely. Let A be the set of numbers where the prefix d1d2d3 equals d4d5d6, and let B be the set where the prefix d1d2d3 equals d5d6d7. The memorable numbers are those in A ∪ B, so I should use inclusion–exclusion: |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| − |A ∩ B| [^notfound].

> Next, I will compute |A|. If d1d2d3 = d4d5d6, then digits 1–3 determine digits 4–6, and digit 7 is free. So there are 10³ choices for the prefix, 1 choice for digits 4–6 (since they must match the prefix), and 10 choices for digit 7, giving 10³ × 1 × 10 = 10,000 numbers in A. Hold on, I should double-check that I'm not overconstraining digit 7; yes, digit 7 is independent here, so 10,000 is correct for |A| [^notfound].

> Similarly, I will compute |B|. If d1d2d3 = d5d6d7, then digits 1–3 determine digits 5–7, and digit 4 is free. So there are 10³ choices for the prefix, 10 choices for digit 4, and 1 choice for digits 5–7 (since they must match the prefix), giving 10³ × 10 × 1 = 10,000 numbers in B. Wait, let me verify the independence again; digit 4 is indeed unconstrained in this case, so 10,000 is correct for |B| [^notfound].

> I will now examine the intersection A ∩ B, where both conditions hold: d1d2d3 = d4d5d6 and d1d2d3 = d5d6d7. This implies d4d5d6 = d5d6d7, which forces d4 = d5 and d5 = d6, so d4 = d5 = d6. Therefore, the prefix d1d2d3 must equal d4d5d6, and since d4 = d5 = d6, the prefix must be of the form xxx, and digits 4–6 must also be xxx, with digit 7 equal to the same x. In other words, digits 1–7 must all be the same digit. There are 10 such numbers (0000000, 1111111, …, 9999999), so |A ∩ B| = 10. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the intersection might be larger, but the equality constraints chain together to force all seven digits to be identical, so 10 is correct [^notfound].

> Applying inclusion–exclusion, |A ∪ B| = 10,000 + 10,000 − 10 = 19,990. Hold on, I should verify the arithmetic: 10,000 + 10,000 is 20,000, minus 10 is 19,990. That looks right [^notfound].

> Finally, the number of non-memorable 7-digit numbers is the total minus the memorable ones: 10,000,000 − 19,990 = 9,980,010. But wait, the question is asking for the number of memorable telephone numbers, not the non-memorable ones. So the answer is 19,990, which corresponds to option C. I should confirm the option mapping: yes, C is 19,990 [^notfound].

The number of memorable 7-digit telephone numbers is **19,990**. This is calculated by counting numbers where the prefix d₁d₂d₃ matches either d₄d₅d₆ or d₅d₆d₇, using inclusion–exclusion: 10³ × 10 for each match minus 10 for the overlap, giving 10,000 + 10,000–10 = 19,990.

## Total number of 7-digit telephone numbers

Each digit (dᵢ) can be any of the 10 decimal digits (0–9), so the total number of 7-digit numbers is:

10⁷ = 10,000,000

---

## Counting memorable telephone numbers

A number is memorable if the prefix (d₁d₂d₃) matches either (d₄d₅d₆) or (d₅d₆d₇). We count these using inclusion–exclusion.

---

### Case 1: prefix matches (d₄d₅d₆)

- **The prefix (d₁d₂d₃) can be any 3-digit sequence**: 10³ = 1,000 choices.
- **Then (d₄d₅d₆) must match the prefix**: 1 choice.
- **(d₇) can be any digit**: 10 choices.
- **Total for this case**: 1,000 × 1 × 10 = 10,000.

---

### Case 2: prefix matches (d₅d₆d₇)

- **The prefix (d₁d₂d₃) can be any 3-digit sequence**: 10³ = 1,000 choices.
- **(d₄) can be any digit**: 10 choices.
- **(d₅d₆d₇) must match the prefix**: 1 choice.
- **Total for this case**: 1,000 × 10 × 1 = 10,000.

---

### Overlap: prefix matches both (d₄d₅d₆) and (d₅d₆d₇)

If the prefix matches both, then d₄d₅d₆ = d₅d₆d₇, which implies d₄ = d₅ = d₆ = d₇. Thus, all seven digits are the same (e.g. 1111111), and there are 10 such numbers.

---

### Applying inclusion–exclusion

The total number of memorable numbers is:

10,000 + 10,000–10 = 19,990

---

## Verification of the result

The calculation is consistent with the inclusion–exclusion principle and matches option C.

---

## Conclusion

The number of different memorable 7-digit telephone numbers is **19,990**, corresponding to option C.

### Chunking as the result of an efficiency computation trade-off [^6735aec5]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Compound movements, such as drinking a cup of tea, are typically produced by threading together a sequence of simple, elemental movements — for example, reaching out, grasping the cup, raising it to the lips, tilting it appropriately and drinking from it. Such actions tend to have distinguishable components or chunks. When we first encounter a new sequence, each elemental movement is executed as an isolated chunk, that is, a continuous movement between two halts of the end effector. With learning, individual elements become faster and smoother, that is, more efficient. In addition, there is a progressive process where several contiguous elements can be combined into chunks with the result that the overall sequence is executed more efficiently and with fewer chunks. The seminal chunking theory of learningdescribes the phenomenological signatures of movement speed up with learning (but see ref.), yet the causes of chunking have remained elusive. We approach the problem of why chunking occurs by considering the goals of the motor system (that is, the functions it has evolved to optimize) and ask whether chunking might be a strategy to achieve them.

In the discrete sequence production literature, chunks are interpreted as the outcome of memory processes that address the costs associated with storing and recalling long sequences from memory. For instance, to remember a sequence of 10 numbers (for example, a phone number) we can combine them in a series of chunks, each three or four digits long (for example, 3–3–4). This way, instead of remembering 10 individual numbers, it is sufficient to remember three chunks. Presumably this strategy is how the brain best achieves the goal of remembering the sequence accurately while balancing the competing cost of memorizing long sequences. The vast majority of early chunking studies are built from working memory tasks and do not explicitly address the costs associated with planning or optimally executing a sequence of physical movements.

### Screening for mild cognitive impairment and dementia with automated, anonymous online and telephone cognitive self-tests [^749bf343]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Telephone self-test

The telephone self-test contained eight tasks that required touch-tone input for all responses.

Orientation: Participants were asked which year, season, month, day of the month, and day of the week it was (score range 0–5). Participants were explicitly instructed not to use aids, e.g. a clock or a calendar.

Digit-sequence learning: On 3 successive trials, participants heard a sequence of 5 digits (e.g. 5-7-6-8-1) and were asked to enter the sequence in the presented order. Each trial was scored as correct or incorrect (score range 0–3).

Immediate word recognition: Participants heard a list of 10 words and were asked to remember them. Subsequently, participants heard again a list of 10 words of which 5 were targets from the previously presented list and 5 new words that acted as distractors. Participants were asked to distinguish the targets from the distractors (score range 0–10).

Directed key pressing: Participants were asked to press particular keys a specific number of times, e.g. "Press the '9' key three times". The task consisted of 5 trials (score range 0–5). This task was meant as a distractor between immediate and delayed word recognition.

Delayed word recognition: Testing and scoring was the same as for immediate word recognition. Participants heard the remaining 5 target words and 5 new words (distractors) and were again asked to distinguish targets from distractors.

Auditory spatial relations: Participants heard descriptions of key locations relative to a 3×3 keypad matrix (1 to 3 top, 4 to 6 middle, and 7 to 9 bottom row) and were asked to press the corresponding keys. For example, "TOP RIGHT" corresponded to the "3" key. There were three trials (score range 0–3).

Semantic comprehension: Participants heard 6 declarative statements and were asked to indicate whether each statement did or did not make sense (e.g. "We wanted to cut down a tree in our front garden, so we went to the garage to get our hammers"). Three sentences made sense and three did not (score range, 0–6).

Backward digit span: Participants heard different 4-digit sequences on 3 successive trials. They were asked to enter the digits in the reverse order. Each trial was scored as correct or incorrect (score range 0–3).

### Risk factors for SARS among persons without known contact with SARS patients, beijing, China [^231a8801]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Study Design

A matched case-control study design was used. Case-patients and controls were matched by sex and age group (< 17, 18–25, 26–45, 46–64, and ≥ 65 years). The goal was to enroll 100 case-patients matched with three controls each, which, if one assumes an α of 0.05 and 80% power, would allow detection of an odds ratio of > 2.3 for exposures observed in 15% of controls. For the analysis, we excluded all controls < 14 years of age because of potential biases in comparing them with matched case-patients aged 14–17 years. In addition, case-patients who were reclassified as healthcare workers after interview were excluded along with their matched controls.

Case-patients were eligible for the study if they met the probable case definition and reported no close contact with any known probable or suspected SARS patients. Only patients whose hospitalization occurred after April 28, 2003, were included in the study. A list of patients admitted to the 16 designated SARS hospitals in Beijing was obtained periodically, and we called patients at the hospital ward or their homes (after discharge) to invite them to participate. The latest date of hospitalization included in our study was June 9, 2003. Case interviews were completed June 3–16.

We selected controls by sequential digit dialing, using the case-patient's home telephone number as the index number. The last digit was added to or subtracted from by one digit in an alternating sequence until three controls matched by sex and age group were enrolled. Telephone prefixes are geographically clustered in Beijing, so this strategy was intended to provide neighborhood matching. Only one control was selected for each number dialed. Control interviews were completed by July 4.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^d51343a7]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Complaint systems — public awareness and reporting contacts emphasize to "Promote reporting by routine press releases that educate the public about food safety, and advertise the contact phone number or website for reports of illness". Programs should "Use a telephone number that easily can be remembered or found in the telephone directory", "Train food managers and workers about the importance of reporting unusual patterns of illness among workers or customers and food code requirements for disease reporting", and "Communicate the value of such reporting, not just to protect public health, but also to protect food establishments from unfounded allegations of foodborne illness". As an access example, agencies may "provide one 24/7 tollfree telephone number or one website".

### Trust in medical professionals moderates depression in Hong Kong during COVID-19 [^dc13ee0a]. Depression and Anxiety (2023). Medium credibility.

2. Methods

2.1. Research Design

A population-based, longitudinal prospective survey study was conducted with the general population in Hong Kong aged 18 and above. Quantitative telephone surveys were administered at three time points: T1 baseline (19 December 2020–6 January 2021, n = 1255), T2 follow-up (11 June 2021–21 July 2021, n = 1003), and T3 follow-up (21 December 2021–21 January 2022, n = 803). For this study, only cross-sectional data collected from the T3 follow-up wave were used, in which local outbreak of Omicron variant virus infection is on a rapid rise, and the government has announced tightening social distancing measures since January 7, such as closing public entertainment venues and restricting dine-in arrangements to daytime before 6 p.m. with a maximum of two people per table.

2.2. Data Collection

The inclusion criteria were Hong Kong residents at the age of 18 or above and able to communicate in Cantonese or Putonghua. A structured questionnaire was administered via telephone interview by a team of trained research assistants. The telephone numbers were randomly selected using a multistage procedure as applied in previous population-based telephone surveys in Hong Kong. To select the randomized telephone numbers for the calls, a local directory covering the prefixes of both the landline and mobile telephone numbers in Hong Kong was used. The prefixes randomly selected were used as "seeds", for generating another set of numbers, using the "last digit plus/minus one/two" method, to form the second half of the telephone numbers for making the calls. After removing duplicate numbers, a total of 6000 telephone numbers randomly sequenced were used for further random selection. For telephone calls to a number with more than one eligible individual in the household, the last birthday method was adopted to identify the participant. Verbal informed consent was obtained from each of the participants. Research ethics approval was obtained from the Human Subject Ethics Subcommittee of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (Approval Number: HSEARS20200814002), and verbal informed consent was obtained from each of the participants.

### Neural dynamics of phoneme sequences reveal position-invariant code for content and order [^e3873fe1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Multiple phonemes are processed simultaneously

Our finding that the average duration of phonetic decodability is around 300 ms is important, because this greatly exceeds the average duration of the phonemes in our stories (78 ms, SD = 34 ms). This implies that the brain processes multiple phonemes at the same time. To explicitly test how many phonemes are processed simultaneously, we decoded, from the same MEG responses, the place, manner, and voicing of the current and three preceding phonemes. We find that the phonetic features of a 3-phoneme history can be robustly decoded from an instantaneous neural response (see Supplementary Fig. 9).

To further assess whether this result implies that the brain can retrieve the content of phoneme sequences, we simulated the neural responses to continuous sequences of 4-phoneme anagrams using the decoding model coefficients to reconstruct synthesised MEG responses (see Methods). Under ideal conditions (no added noise) neural responses robustly encoded the history of four preceding phonemes (Fig. 2B). This result confirms the high degree of overlapping content during phoneme processing. Although decodability need not imply that the brain actually uses this information, this result indicates that the brain has access to at least a 3-phoneme sequence at any given processing time.

### The integrity of dopaminergic and noradrenergic brain regions is associated with different aspects of late-life memory performance [^3540bc74]. Nature Aging (2023). High credibility.

Cognitive data assessment

At TP1–TP3, cognition was tested using a comprehensive computerized battery probing key cognitive functions. Performance was assessed in small groups of 4–6 participants. Cognitive test sessions lasted approximately 3.7 h and included 16 tasks (at TP2); of these, three measured working memory, four measured episodic memory, and three measured fluid intelligence. Although the exact composition of the cognitive assessments changed across waves, the same tasks were used to measure working memory, episodic memory and fluid intelligence at TP1–TP3. Only older adults were tested at TP3. For a detailed task description, see refs.; below, we provide a brief overview of the measures relevant to the current analyses.

Working memory assessment

Spatial updating (abbreviated as 'spatial-u')

Participants were shown a display of 2–3 3 × 3 grids, in each of which a blue dot was presented in one of the nine tiles. Participants were asked to memorize the locations of the blue dots and mentally update them according to shifting operations that were indicated by arrows appearing below the dots. Six updating operations were required before the 3 × 3 grids reappeared and participants indicated the end position of the blue dots (by mentally combining their start position and the six shifting operations). We used the number of correct placements as an indicator of working memory performance.

Letter updating (abbreviated as 'letter-u')

Participants were shown a sequence of 7–13 letters. Once the presentation ended, they were asked to report, in correct order, the last three letters that were shown. The number of correctly reported letters was used as a measure of working memory performance.

Number n-back (abbreviated as 'number')

Three digits (1–9) were presented consecutively in three adjacent cells, followed by the next sequence of three digits. Participants indicated by button press whether the currently presented digit matched the digit shown three steps before. We took participants' accuracy as an indicator of their working memory performance.

### Online dynamical learning and sequence memory with neuromorphic nanowire networks [^4ae35c49]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Dynamical feature generation

Figure 2 shows examples of handwritten digit image samples converted to 1-D voltage pulse streams delivered to the allocated source electrode (channel 0) and the corresponding voltage streams read out from other channels (1, 2, 12, 13 and 15) for the setup shown in Fig. 1 (readouts for other channels and digits are shown in Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5).

Fig. 2
Input–output mapping of MNIST digits in a nanowire network device.

Images of MNIST digits '0' and '5' averaged across 100 samples randomly selected from the training set (column 1), their corresponding input voltage streams (column 2, red) and readout voltages from multiple channels (columns 3–7, blue).

Each row in Fig. 2 shows the averaged image, input and readout data for 100 MNIST samples randomly selected from the training set for the corresponding digit class.

For each class, the readout voltages from each channel (columns 3–7, blue) are distinctly different from the corresponding input voltages and exhibit diverse characteristics across the readout channels. This demonstrates that the NWN nonlinearly maps the input signals into a higher-dimensional space. Rich and diverse dynamical features are embedded into the channel readouts from the spatially distributed electrodes, which are in contact with different parts of the network (see Supplementary Fig. S6 for additional non-equilibrium dynamics under non-adiabatic conditions). We show below how the inter-class distinctiveness of these dynamical features, as well as their intra-class diversity, can be harnessed to perform online classification of the MNIST digits.

### Online dynamical learning and sequence memory with neuromorphic nanowire networks [^d9a5be0d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Figure 7 a shows the network conductance time series and readout voltages for one of the digit sequence samples. The readout voltages exhibit near-instantaneous responses to high pixel intensity inputs, with dynamic ranges that vary distinctively among different channels. The conductance time series also exhibits a large dynamic range (at least 2 orders of magnitude) and, additionally, delayed dynamics. This can be attributed to recurrent loops (i.e. delay lines) in the NWN and to memristive dynamics determined by nano-scale electro-ionic transport. The delay dynamics demonstrate that NWNs retain the memory of previous inputs (see Supplementary Fig. S9 for an example showing the fading memory property of the NWN reservoir). Figure 7 b shows the respective digit images and I − V curves for the sequence sample. The NWN is driven to different internal states as different digits are delivered to the network in sequence. While the dynamics corresponding to digits from the same class show some similar characteristics in the I − V phase space (e.g. digit '1'), generally, they exhibit distinctive characteristics due to their sequence position. For example, the first instance of '4' exhibits dynamics that explore more of the phase space than the second instance of '4'. This may be attributed to differences in the embedded memory patterns, with the first '4' being preceded by '91' while the second '4' is preceded by '51' and both '9' and '5' have distinctively different phase space characteristics, which are also influenced by their sequence position as well as their uniqueness.

### A DNA-based system for selecting and displaying the combined result of two input variables [^98a5cd1c]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

If the method should be used to process the input of two biological sequences it would require that X and Y be decoupled to allow input of arbitrary sequences. For this purpose we have introduced a third capture–linker strand as shown in Fig. 3a. This sequence contains two 8-nt domains that are each complementary to the two inputs, and furthermore it contains the capture sequence that allows binding to the MBs. This forms an incomplete four-way junction that is completed by selecting the fully complementary result sequence on the two 8-nt domains on X and Y to form a stable four-way junction. To demonstrate the principle we have used two short synthetic input strands. As shown with native PAGE in Fig. 3b, lane 4, inputs X and Y are independent. In lane 7, inputs X, Y and the capture–linker form a stable complex. In the native PAGE result shown in Fig. 3c, lanes 3 and 4, neither X nor Y alone binds with the result strand. In lane 5, where both X and Y are present, the input complex can bind to the correct result. This means that the correct result is only selected in the presence of both inputs X and Y. In lane 6 it is demonstrated, using three results where only one of the domains is correct, that wrong results do not bind to the input complex. Finally, in lane 7 the correct result is selected in the mixture with three wrong result sequences.

Translation of the results to a seven-segmented display

The mechanism of the output generation proceeds by selection of translator strands that guide the assembled complex to the lines of the digital number that displays the result in a seven-segmented display. As illustrated in Fig. 4 for the simple calculation of 1 × 2 = 2, the result two strands can hybridize with each of the five translator strands that are required to display the number 2. After MB-mediated separation from the solution of translator strands, the result–translator complex is (in most cases) liberated from the MBs and applied to a surface containing a pattern of one or more digital numbers. Each of the lines in the digit is functionalized with a unique host sequence that is complementary to the translator stands a–g. This means that contingent on the selected set of translator strands the digit has the capacity to display all numbers from 0 to 9. The encoding required for displaying the numbers 0–9 is shown in Table 1. A total of 49 translator sequences are required for displaying the 10 numbers in a one-digit display.

### Validation of a brief telephone battery for neurocognitive assessment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^c0cb9288]. Respiratory Research (2005). Low credibility.

Table 2
Demographic and Medical Data

The results of the telephone and in-person neurocognitive assessments are shown in Table 3. The correlation coefficients for the comparison between in-person and telephone testing are presented in Table 4. Interclass correlation coefficients of at least 0.54 (p < 0.05 to < 0.0001) were found for the agreement of telephone and in-person scores on tests assessing the cognitive domains of attention, memory, concentration / working memory, reasoning, and language / crystallized intelligence. An almost perfect correlation was observed in the assessment of reasoning (Similarities). Substantial correlations were found for the Digit Span, Similarities, and Vocabulary tests (.61 to.80) and moderate correlations (.41 to.60) were found for each Logical Memory immediate and delay recall. A moderate correlation (0.56) was seen with the in-person and telephone administration of the Digit-Span-backward (concentration / working memory). Only a fair correlation (0.28; p = 0.09) was found between the in-person and telephone administration of the Hayling Sentence Completion test of executive function. For Letter-Number Sequence test (concentration/working memory) scores were not correlated for the in-person and telephone tests.

Table 3
In-person and telephone neuropsychological test scores.

All values are scaled scores (mean = 10, standard deviation = 3) except † = raw scores.

Logical memory and Number-letter sequencing are from the WMS-III; digit span, similarities and vocabulary are from the WAIS-R.

Table 4
Reliability of the in-person and telephone neuropsychological test scores.

All scores shown are scaled scores (mean = 10, standard deviation = 3), except † = raw scores. Logical memory and Number-letter sequencing are from the WMS-III; digit span, similarities and vocabulary are from the WAIS-R.

Stability over time was greatest for the Similarities and Vocabulary tests. The effects of learning showed that test scores tended to increase between the in-person and telephone tests, with the most improvement for verbal memory (e.g. logical memory immediate and delayed recall).

### Too many digits: the presentation of numerical data [^a41454ae]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Thus a decimal places rule that ignores significant digits does not work. But equally, and perhaps surprisingly, a significant digits rule that ignores decimal places does not always work either. Reporting risk ratios to three significant digits for example leads to the largest ratio below 1 being reported as 0.999 and the smallest above 1 as 1.01, with three and two decimal places, respectively. This is clearly unsatisfactory as they differ in precision by a factor of ten. In this instance a combination of significant digits and decimal places, the rule of four, works best: round the risk ratio to two significant digits if the leading non-zero digit is four or more, otherwise round to three.

The rule of four gives three decimal places for risk ratios from 0.040 to 0.399, two from 0.40 to 3.99 and one from 4.0 to 39.9. Applying it to the example of 22.68 above gives 22.7 (95% CI 7.5 to 74). Alternatively one can apply the rule with one less significant digit, giving 23 with CI 8 to 70.

Another example is the reporting of test statistics such as t or F. Specifying one decimal place would permit say t = 30.1, where 30 is clearly sufficient as it is so highly significant. Conversely specifying two significant digits would permit t = −0.13, where again the extra precision is irrelevant as it is far from significant. A suitable rule specifies up to one decimal place and up to two significant digits.

When comparing group means or percentages in tables, rounding should not blur the differences between them. This is the basis for the Hopkins two digits rule, whereby the mean has enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the SD. An analogous rule for percentages might be to use enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the range of values across groups, eg, if the range is 10% or more use whole numbers, if less than 1% use two decimal places, and otherwise one. In practice percentages are usually given along with their corresponding frequencies, so precision is less critical as the exact values can be calculated.

### A simulation based digital twin approach to assessing the organization of response to emergency calls [^940e50c4]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Each digital twin, a virtual replica of each EMCC, was built and validated in successive iterations. For this purpose, the "black box" validation method presented by Robinson was applied. The validation option chosen was to check whether a similar evolution on an input parameter of an EMCC and its digital twin produce the same evolution of a selected output response. For example, if we consider two real days (d1 and d2) in a given EMCC for which a change in the number of ECOs and in the number of incoming calls resulted in a decrease in quality of service, similar changes in the digital twin of this EMCC should result in the same trend. However, due to random distributions and probabilities for a call to be abandoned, lost, or answered, the time-stamped sequence output by the digital twin cannot exactly match the observed data. To validate the behavior of the digital twin during the studied week, we, therefore, compared the averages of the real and simulated values of QoS₃₀ᵢ calculated on 42 successive sliding periods of 4 h. For example, Fig. 9 shows the comparison of real and simulated values of AQoS 30 for the EMCC-A in the existing organization (partitioned). The mean signed deviation between real and simulation data was equal to 7% for this example and the simulated line (orange) logically follows the same developments as the real line (blue). We considered that the behavior of the digital twin was close to the behavior of its real-world twin.

Comparison between real data (blue line) and simulated data (orange line).

It shows the comparison of real and simulated values of AQoS 30 for the EMCC-A in the existing organization (partitioned). The mean signed deviation between real and simulation data was equal to 7% for this example and the simulated line (orange) logically follows the same developments as the real line (blue). We considered that the behavior of the digital twin was close to the behavior of its real-world twin.

According to the confidence interval method proposed by Robinson, we needed to run at least five replications of each scenario to obtain a deviation of less than 1% of the 95% confidence interval around the cumulative mean of AQoS 30, which shows that the duration of each replication is large enough to obtain statistically representative results. Finally, we decided to run 10 replications for each scenario, which showed that the confidence interval of AQoS 30 did not exceed 2% for any of them.

### Online dynamical learning and sequence memory with neuromorphic nanowire networks [^385946c1]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

a Conductance time series (G) and readout voltages for one full sequence cycle during the sequence memory task. For better visualisation, voltage readout curves are smoothed by averaging over a moving window of length 0.05 s and values for channel 7 are magnified by ×10. b Corresponding digit images and memory patterns in I − V phase space.

Figure 8 a shows the image reconstruction quality for each digit in the sequence as a function of memory window length. Structural similarity (SSIM) is calculated using a testing group of 500 sets, and the maximum values achieved after learning from 7000 training sets are presented (see Supplementary Fig. S10 for the learning curving for L = 4 and Supplementary Fig. S11 for average SSIM across all digits). The best reconstruction results are achieved for digits '1' and '7', which are repeated digits with relatively simple structures. In contrast, digit '4', which is also repeated, but has a less simple structure, is reconstructed less faithfully. This indicates that the repeat digits produce memory traces that are not completely forgotten before each repetition (i.e. nano-filaments in memristive junctions do not completely decay). On average, the linear reconstructor is able to recall these digits better than the non-repeat digits. For the non-repeat digits ('5' and '9'), the reconstruction results are more interesting: digit '5' is consistently reconstructed with the lowest SSIM, which correlates with its low classification accuracy (cf. Fig. 3 c), while '9' exhibits a distinctive jump from L = 4 to L = 5 (see also Fig. 8 b). This reflects the contextual information used in the reconstruction: for L = 4, '9' is reconstructed from the sub-sequence '147', which is the same sub-sequence for '5', but for L = 5, '9' is uniquely reconstructed from sub-sequence'1475', with a corresponding increase in SSIM. This is not observed for digit '5'; upon closer inspection, it appears that the reconstruction of '5' suffers interference from '9' (see Supplementary Fig. S12) due to the common sub-sequence '147' and to the larger variance of '5' in the MNIST dataset (which also contributes to its misclassification). A similar jump in SSIM is evident for the repeat digit '7' from L = 2 to L = 3. For L = 3, the first instance of '7' (green curve) is reconstructed from '51', while the second instance (pink curve) is reconstructed from '91', so the jump in SSIM from L = 2 may be attributed to digit '7' leaving more memory traces in digit '1', which has a simpler structure than either '9' or '5'.

The effect of working memory capacity (hidden dimension size) on optimal recall behavior.

A – C Heat maps illustrating the evolution of attention weights for seq2seq models with varying hidden dimension sizes across training epochs. Attention weights are averaged across all trials and indicate the influence of each encoded item (y-axis) on each decoding step (x-axis) during recall. A With a small hidden dimension size (32-Dim.), attention shifts over epochs toward the beginning of the input sequence, supporting the primacy effect through attention alone and enabling sequential forward recall from the beginning of the list. B Attention results with 64-Dim. hidden dimension size show similar results to those of the 32-Dim. model, but more quickly approaching sequential forward recall and showing weaker attention weights in the fully optimized stage. C With a large hidden dimension size (128-Dim.), attention for the first item consistently favors the last encoded item, suggesting that primacy is achieved not via attention shifts but by retaining the list start within the model's hidden state (analogous to working memory).

### Telephone-delivered psychosocial interventions targeting key health priorities in adults with a psychotic disorder: systematic review [^950eb1f2]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Methodological quality and risk of bias in included studies

Studies are presented in descending order of methodological quality in Table 1 for controlled trials and Table 2 for single-arm studies. No clear pattern emerged between methodological rigour and whether or not the outcomes were in favour of the telephone condition. Across all trials, there was considerable variation in methodological quality scores on the Downs and Black scale, (total scores ranged from 9 to 25 out of 27). At least half of included studies scored 0 for the following items: adverse events; characteristics of those lost to follow-up; representativeness of the sample; attempts to have blinded outcomes assessors and adequate power (six studies reported power calculations, one had sufficient power). For the 12 RCTs Pedro scores ranged from two to eight out of eight. At least half of included studies scored 0 for 'blinding of outcomes assessors', and 'measures of at least one key outcome variable from at least 85% of original participants'.

Cochrane risk of bias assessments is presented in online Supplementary Fig. S1a and S1b, with overall risk of bias scores in Tables 1 and 2. To summarise, eight studies reported adequate random sequence generation, four reported allocation concealment procedures, four stated that assessors were blinded to intervention status, nine were unlikely to be subjected to attrition bias, and 11 may have been affected by reporting bias. Regarding the overall risk of bias, all non-RCTs were automatically rated as 'high' for overall risk of bias. Eight RCTs were rated as having a high overall risk of bias (Beebe; Salzer et al; Castle et al; Price; Kilbourne et al; Javadpour et al; Wenze et al; Beebe et al.), with all rated as unclear regarding one or both of two key items (sequence generation and allocation concealment). The remaining five RCTs were rated as having a low overall risk of bias, although only two (Simon et al; Baker et al.) had adequately blinded outcomes assessors and a pre-published protocol.

Synthesis of results

Results of individual studies are presented in Table 1 (controlled trials) and 2 (single arm studies). Heterogeneity of form of intervention delivery (telephone only or in combination), control group (active or inactive control) and outcome measures precluded a meta-analysis on (within outcomes or collapsed across groups). A narrative synthesis is presented below.

### Space-time-coding digital metasurfaces [^0447f2a0]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

More specifically, we consider a coding metasurface with 8 × 8 elements and time-coding sequences with a length of 8. First, we address the beam-steering design in one plane at the central frequency. Hence, we only need to study time-coding sequences of eight elements, and each column of elements has the same digital code. Figure 4a, b shows the 2-bit space-time-coding matrix, in which the red, yellow, green, and blue dots represent "0", "1", "2", and "3" digits, representing 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° phase responses, respectively (the criterion for selecting those eight sets of time-coding sequences is detailed in Supplementary Note 7). The equivalent amplitudes and phases of those eight coding elements at different harmonic frequencies are shown in Fig. 4c, d, respectively. We can clearly observe that the designed space-time-coding matrix effectively results in equivalent 3-bit responses, "0 ′ " (−135°), "1 ′ " (−90°), "2 ′ " (−45°), "3 ′ " (0°), "4 ′ " (45°), "5 ′ " (90°), "6 ′ " (135°), and "7 ′ " (180°), and an equivalent phase gradient at the central frequency. According to the generalized Snell's law, this phase discontinuity will steer a normally incident wave by an angle of 14.5°. The corresponding 2D scattering pattern at the central frequency and the scattering patterns at different harmonic frequencies are displayed in Fig. 4e, f. It can be seen that the main beam at the central frequency points at θ = −14.5°, and the scattered powers at the harmonic frequencies are much smaller, which provides good sideband suppression. Moreover, we compare the beam-steering performance of the original 2-bit coding "0-0-1-1-2-2-3-3" with the equivalent 3-bit coding "0 ′ -1 ′ -2 ′ -3 ′ -4 ′ -5 ′ -6 ′ -7 ′ ", as shown in Fig. 4g. It is observed that the former scheme could realize a steering angle of 14.5°, but accompanied by high sidelobes, while the latter scheme attains the steering with much lower sidelobes and only a little gain reduction attributable to the sideband power losses. Similar examples of equivalent 3-bit coding for large-angle beam steering are illustrated in Supplementary Figures 6c and 6d.

### Digit-tracking as a new tactile interface for visual perception analysis [^9fe12412]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

To sum up, we believe that this simple, calibration-free and connected solution for human visual cognition research is ideally suited for large-scale longitudinal studies, evaluations of therapeutic strategies, differential diagnosis, early detection, and would certainly facilitate testing in environments where technical and scientific and medical expertize is not easily accessible. These features also make digit tracking a potentially highly useful tool in the evaluation of visual material in applied science domains like design, ergonomics, user experience and communication.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Pergolide (Permax) [^00e0c44a]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

There is no clinical experience with massive overdosage. The largest overdose involved a young hospitalized adult patient who was not being treated with pergolide but who intentionally took 60 mg of the drug. He experienced vomiting, hypotension, and agitation. Another patient receiving a daily dosage of 7 mg of pergolide unintentionally took 19 mg/day for 3 days, after which his vital signs were normal but he experienced severe hallucinations. Within 36 hours of resumption of the prescribed dosage level, the hallucinations stopped. One patient unintentionally took 14 mg/day for 23 days instead of her prescribed 1.4 mg/day dosage. She experienced severe involuntary movements and tingling in her arms and legs. Another patient who inadvertently received 7 mg instead of the prescribed 0.7 mg experienced palpitations, hypotension, and ventricular extrasystoles. The highest total daily dose (prescribed for several patients with refractory Parkinson's disease) has exceeded 30 mg.

Symptoms — Animal studies indicate that the manifestations of overdosage in man might include nausea, vomiting, convulsions, decreased blood pressure, and CNS stimulation. The oral median lethal doses in mice and rats were 54 and 15 mg/kg respectively.

Treatment — To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, a good resource is your certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR). In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.

### Changes in semantic memory structure support successful problem-solving and analogical transfer [^5231072f]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such "ill-defined" problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a "Eureka" phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations. For instance, consider the following problem: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, 'Thank you', and walks out". The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

### Probing the physical limits of reliable DNA data retrieval [^ef9e868e]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Results

Reducing copy number and increasing pool complexity

In this work, we randomly accessed three files from a large pool of DNA at varying copy numbers (Fig. 1 b). The small file, comprised of 2042 sequences, represents ~0.1 KB of digital data. The medium file consists of 26,404 sequences and 1.7 KB of digital data, and the large file has 271,447 sequences and 18 KB.

We then sequenced all three files at all stages of dilution to measure the rate of sequences lost (Fig. 2 a, b). A copy number of 10, for example, means that, on average, each sequence was present 10 times in solution. The original, undiluted pool of DNA encoded nine files (1.6 M total oligonucleotides (oligos)) and was subsequently serially diluted with water to result in copy numbers ranging three orders of magnitude (Fig. 1 b). To dramatically increase pool complexity, we repeated this process, this time diluting the samples with 1 ng μL −1 150 Nmers, random sequences of DNA the same length as our original pool (Fig. 1 c). Theoretically, we would expect to encounter a duplicate sequence only after 4 150 (2 × 10 90) sequences had been synthesized; thus, we would expect each strand to be unique. By diluting samples with 1 ng μL −1 150 Nmers, pool complexity increased from 1.6 × 10 6 unique sequences in the initial pool (Fig. 1 b) to over 10 10 unique sequences per microliter (see Supplementary Note 2). At ~15.6 bytes of data encoded per strand, this encoding scheme and experimental protocol emulate ~150 GB of digital data per microliter, and 7 TB in the final 50 μL solution.

### The dynamics of higher-order novelties [^f6677587]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Here, we propose to go one step beyond and look at novelties as novel pairs, triplets, and higher-order combinations of consecutive symbols in a sequence. For instance, when exploring a network, a novel pair is represented by the first visit of a link. In order to measure the pace of discovery of these higher-order compounds starting from a sequence of events, we first create the surrogate sequence of overlapping pairs. Considering for example the sentence "One ring to rule them all", from the sequence of events{ one, ring, to, rule, them, all } we obtain the sequence of overlapping pairs{(one, ring), (ring, to), (to, rule), (rule, them), (them, all)}. Fromwe can then compute the number D 2 (t) of different pairs among the first t ones, with t ≤ T − 1. Notice that, in this manuscript, we consider the pairs (one, ring) and (ring, one) as two different pairs, i.e. order matters. By construction, we always have D 1 (t) ≤ D 2 (t) ≤ t, since, on the one hand, for each new element added tothere is a new pair in, and, on the other hand, there cannot be more than t different pairs among t items. From the power-law scaling, we can then extract the value of β 2, which we refer to as the 2nd- order Heaps' exponent. This definition can be naturally extended to any order n, considering the sequenceof consecutive overlapping n -tuples present in. Notice that, if, then. We can hence compute the number D n (t) of different tuples among the first t tuples in, and extract the n th- order Heaps' exponent β n ∈ [0, 1] from. Notice also that the n th-order Heaps' exponent can also be interpreted as the first order Heaps' exponent of a sequence whose events are the overlapping n -tuples of the original sequence. Finally, it is worth remarking that such an approach is close to the analysis of Zipf's law in linguistic data for n -grams or sentences. In this context, studies showed that as one moves from graphemes, to words, sentences, and n -grams, the Zipf's exponent (reciprocal of the Heaps' exponent for infinitely long sequences) gradually diminishes. This implies that n -grams or sentences are characterized by a larger novelty rate than words, a behavior analogous to what we have discussed above.

Review baseline symptoms and whether there have been changes in dyspnea, cough, sputum volume and color (from least to most purulent: mucus; mucopurulent; purulent), and identify maintenance pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment and whether the patient is observing treatment as prescribed. For COVID-19, assess whether the patient has any symptoms and would need to be tested and have at hand local numbers for referral to testing and treatment; if the patient has already been tested identify when the results will be obtained or whether the result was positive or negative and, if positive, whether a follow-up test is planned and dates; verify precautions (face masks, hand washing, social distancing, or shielding if necessary). In the action plan section, describe if the patient has a written action plan, See example of an action plan from the Living well with COPD program.(801), whether education for the plan has been done, whether the plan includes a prescription to be self-administered at home or requires calling a contact person / physician to obtain the prescription, and when it was used the last time and if used appropriately. Record recent admissions and ER visits, dates and where they took place. Go over self-management behaviors, covering what is pertinent to the patient treatable traits (dyspnea and/or exacerbation), and describe whether strategies are integrated in daily life (yes), not at all, and whether the patient is unsure "cannot tell". Identify with the patient the main issues of the call. Up to a maximum of 3 items that can be covered for the duration of the call. Finalize by describing the interventions done during the remote visit, the ones to be put in place and agreed by the patient, the plan, including whether the patient needs to be referred to other services, healthcare professionals, etc., and when the next follow-up will take place (describe whether will it be in-person or remote).

### A time-resolved, multi-symbol molecular recorder via sequential genome editing [^1476681f]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

DNA is naturally well suited to serve as a digital medium for in vivo molecular recording. However, contemporary DNA-based memory devices are constrained in terms of the number of distinct 'symbols' that can be concurrently recorded and/or by a failure to capture the order in which events occur 1. Here we describe DNA Typewriter, a general system for in vivo molecular recording that overcomes these and other limitations. For DNA Typewriter, the blank recording medium ('DNA Tape') consists of a tandem array of partial CRISPR-Cas9 target sites, with all but the first site truncated at their 5'ends and therefore inactive. Short insertional edits serve as symbols that record the identity of the prime editing guide RNA 2 mediating the edit while also shifting the position of the 'type guide' by one unit along the DNA Tape, that is, sequential genome editing. In this proof of concept of DNA Typewriter, we demonstrate recording and decoding of thousands of symbols, complex event histories and short text messages; evaluate the performance of dozens of orthogonal tapes; and construct 'long tape' potentially capable of recording as many as 20 serial events. Finally, we leverage DNA Typewriter in conjunction with single-cell RNA-seq to reconstruct a monophyletic lineage of 3,257 cells and find that the Poisson-like accumulation of sequential edits to multicopy DNA tape can be maintained across at least 20 generations and 25 days of in vitro clonal expansion.

Pediatric procedural sedation — pre-sedation documentation and postdischarge instructions — Documentation prior to sedation shall include informed consent, with the patient record documenting that appropriate informed consent was obtained according to local, state, and institutional requirements, and the practitioner shall provide verbal and/or written instructions to the responsible person including objectives of the sedation and anticipated changes in behavior during and after sedation. Special instructions should be given to the adult responsible for infants and toddlers transported home in a car safety seat to carefully observe the child's head position to avoid airway obstruction, because transportation in a car safety seat poses a particular risk for infants who have received medications known to have a long half-life, such as chloral hydrate, intramuscular pentobarbital, or phenothiazine, and consideration for a longer period of observation should be given if the responsible person's ability to observe the child is limited (eg, only 1 adult who also has to drive). Another indication for prolonged observation would be a child with an anatomic airway problem, an underlying medical condition such as significant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or a former preterm infant younger than 60 weeks' postconceptional age; a 24-hour telephone number for the practitioner or his or her associates shall be provided to all patients and their families, and instructions shall include limitations of activities and appropriate dietary precautions.

10X Genomics library preparation and sequencing

The 10X Genomics protocol ("Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v2 User Guide" available from) was followed to create gel in emulsion beads (GEMs) containing single cells, hydrogel beads and reagents for reverse transcription, perform barcoded cDNA synthesis, and produce sequencing libraries from pooled cDNAs. The concentration of single cell suspensions was approximately 500 cells/μl, as estimated by flow cytometry-based counting, and cells were loaded according to the 10X protocol (Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v2), intended to capture approximately 7000 cells per reaction. However, after sequencing and preliminary analysis, we found the actual number of captured cells was closer to ~1200 cells per experiment. Library construction (following GEM breakage) was using 10X reagents following the "Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v2 User Guide". The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq4000 (paired-end reads 75 bp), using one sequencing lane per sample. All raw sequence data was deposited in the ENA under the project accession ERP116919.

Protein-coding genes

Schistosoma mansoni gene annotation is based on the version 7 (v7) genome assembly. The identifiers for all genes contain the Smp_ prefix followed by a unique 6-digit number; entirely new gene models have the first digit '3', eg. Smp_3xxxxx. To assign a gene name and functional annotation (used in Supplementary Data 2) to 'Smp_' identifiers, protein-coding transcript sequences were BLAST-searched against SwissProt3 to predict product information (blastp v2.7.0). Some genes also maintained previous functional annotation from GeneDB. Genes lacking predicted product information were named hypothetical genes.

Mapping and quantification of single-cell RNA-seq

Single-cell RNA-seq data were mapped to the S. mansoni reference genome v7 using the 10X Genomics analysis pipeline Cell Ranger (v 2.1.0). We relied on the default cut-off provided by Cell ranger to detect empty droplets. Approximately 67% of sequenced reads mapped confidently to the transcriptome with an average 297,403 reads per cell. In total 3513 cells were sequenced, with a median 918 genes expressed per cell.

Box 5–3 — Poor adherence with prescribed maintenance treatment in asthma — contributing factors and clinical identification are summarized as follows: Medication/regimen factors include "Difficulties using inhaler device (e.g., arthritis)", "Burdensome regimen (e.g., several times per day)", and "Multiple different inhalers"; unintentional poor adherence includes "Misunderstanding about instructions" and "Forgetfulness"; and intentional poor adherence includes "Perception that treatment is not necessary" and "Concerns about side-effects (real or perceived)". For patients prescribed maintenance treatment, "ask an empathic question" and "Acknowledge the likelihood of incomplete adherence and encourage an open non-judgmental discussion", using example prompts such as "In the last 4 weeks, how many days a week have you been taking it – not at all, 1, 2, 3 or more days a week?" and "Do you find it easier to remember your inhaler in the morning or the evening?" Practical checks include "Check the date of the last prescription", "Check the date and dose counter on the inhaler", and, where available, electronic monitoring since "prescribing and dispensing frequency can be monitored electronically by clinicians and/or pharmacists".

### Reservoir computing using dynamic memristors for temporal information processing [^fd1e0904]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Reservoir computing systems utilize dynamic reservoirs having short-term memory to project features from the temporal inputs into a high-dimensional feature space. A readout function layer can then effectively analyze the projected features for tasks, such as classification and time-series analysis. The system can efficiently compute complex and temporal data with low-training cost, since only the readout function needs to be trained. Here we experimentally implement a reservoir computing system using a dynamic memristor array. We show that the internal ionic dynamic processes of memristors allow the memristor-based reservoir to directly process information in the temporal domain, and demonstrate that even a small hardware system with only 88 memristors can already be used for tasks, such as handwritten digit recognition. The system is also used to experimentally solve a second-order nonlinear task, and can successfully predict the expected output without knowing the form of the original dynamic transfer function.

10.3 Management of Overdose

Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug effective in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder.

Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients.

Activated charcoal should be administered. Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidotes for fluoxetine are known.

A specific caution involves patients who are taking or have recently taken fluoxetine and might ingest excessive quantities of a TCA. In such a case, accumulation of the parent tricyclic and/or an active metabolite may increase the possibility of clinically significant sequelae and extend the time needed for close medical observation [see Drug Interactions (7.9)].

Based on experience in animals, which may not be relevant to humans, fluoxetine-induced seizures that fail to remit spontaneously may respond to diazepam.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remote follow-up — documentation and call setup should follow core clinical principles and specific steps. The principles of good record keeping and clinical practice should always apply: i) treat patients with dignity; ii) respect people's right to privacy and confidentiality; iii) listen to the patient's needs and act in their best interest; and iv) base your recommendations on the best available evidence. Ensure documentation of the whole visit (in writing) as you would normally do for an in-person follow-up, and the documentation should reflect that this is a remote follow-up (telephone or virtual/online) and should be specific about how the information was obtained. Start the call by introducing yourself and, if necessary, any other health care professional(s) who may be with you, verifying who you are speaking with (patient name and date of birth) and patient consent to receive remote follow-up, and, if applicable, informing the patient that the speakerphone is on. Welcome the patient to the call by verifying technical issues and asking the patient if (s)he can hear you well.

Subject Recruitment, Tracking, and Communication

The recruitment clock ticks relentlessly as soon as the recruitment date arrives, and tracking recruitment must be planned well in advance of enrollment. The first step is screening subjects. Involving physicians, residents, nurses, or others can help supplement recruitment, but, in our experience, these providers have generally not provided sufficient referrals to meet study goals. Therefore, we do not rely solely on referral from providers. Our approach is to either hire our own staff or to pay a portion of an office staff member's salary to recruit subjects.

The SC that we pay is responsible for identification of subjects, contacting them initially by mail, contacting subjects by telephone, recruiting, and consenting subjects in our trials. Local staff typically run reports on the diagnoses of interest or billing reports to identify potential subjects. The SC then uses these lists to screen electronic medical records to determine whether subjects meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. CCC staff create and distribute electronic screening logs for the SCs to complete as they screen subjects. We request that all SCs submit their screening logs monthly to ensure that they are actually screening subjects in a timely fashion.

For each potentially eligible subject, the SC prepares a personalized letter of invitation that is stamped by the IRB of record for the site. The letter is typically signed by the site lead physician or SC, explains the study, and provides both a return postcard and a telephone number for the subject to call. Most IRBs will allow an "opt out" approach whereby a postcard in the letter can be sent back if the individual does not want to participate. If a subject does not send the card back declining participation, most IRBs will allow the SC to call the subject in 10 to 14 days. Batches of invitation letters should be sent out every few weeks, so that the SC cycles through screening, sending out letters, and telephoning subjects to set up baseline appointments. The screening log includes information on the number of letters that are mailed and the outcomes of those mailings, providing evidence of an SC's progress and the number of potential study subjects identified.

### Evaluation of telephone first approach to demand management in english general practice: observational study [^e881241a]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Table 3
Responses to national GP Patient Survey: comparison between telephone first practices and random samples of other practices in England (variables scored on 0–100 scale, positive number indicates improvement)

*In terms of 95% mid-range for practices — range for "true" step changes/additional yearly changes expected across 95% of practices after adjustment for patient sample size. Estimated with SD of random slope for step change (σ step) combined with fixed effect of step change (β step) as β step ± 1.96 σ step

We sent the patient questionnaire we developed (appendix 2) to 1873 patients from 20 practices using the telephone first approach. We received 837 responses, a 44.7% response rate. Table 4shows the results. Nearly two thirds of patients (weighted percentage 64.9%) reported being called back within an hour. In half of the calls (weighted percentage 50.6%) the patient was asked to come into the surgery for a face to face consultation with a GP or nurse. Advice only was given in 17.3% of phone calls (weighted percentage 16.8%), and 21.9% of phone calls resulted in a prescription being given (weighted percentage 23.9%). In response to the question "Did you find the telephone appointment more or less convenient than just attending a face to face appointment, without being able to talk to the doctor on the phone first?" over half said that the telephone first approach was more convenient with similar percentages reporting that it was less convenient or made no difference. Just under a quarter reported that it was more difficult to communicate with the GP on the phone, the main reasons being given that it was difficult to explain the problem or that the doctor could not see the problem, but nearly two thirds found it made no difference, and 11.7% found it easier to communicate on the phone. Respondents were fairly equally divided over whether they preferred the new system, would prefer to return the old system, or didn't mind.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^a4ac9110]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

NK spaces are analytically useful for agent-based models but are conceptually abstract and difficult to ground to real-world examples. Here, we can instead understand an NK problem's complexity in terms of how incremental contributions made by any subset of activities are also contingent on other activities. Thus, a solution that an agent comes up within the NK space — captured by a unique sequence of 1s and 0s — reflects a basket of activities people undertake to solve a real-world problem, where a 1 represents the presence of an activity and a 0 its absence.

There are many examples of social collectives solving a common problem that are analogous to the NK space setup. In these instances, the solutions and performances are visible at least some subset of other actors, and there are no positive or negative externalities from one actor to another (beyond the informational spillover). For instance, consider national ministries of health of various countries. They all have different approaches to healthcare (e.g. insurance markets like in Germany or Austria or a single-public option like in Canada or the U.K.). And the improvement or decline of one country's healthcare does not adversely affect or hamper the healthcare of another. The interest of some countries in the policies employed by other countries may be limited by physical adjacency or similar political systems or cultures, so their information about the "problem space" is more localized.

### Digital mobile telephones and interference of ophthalmic equipment [^aa6a891f]. Eye (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the effect of mobile telephone electromagnetic interference on electronic ophthalmic equipment.

Methods

Prospective audit with mobile telephones placed at distances of 3 m, 1 m, and 30 cm from, and in contact with, electronic ophthalmic equipment. Any interruption or cessation of the function of the ophthalmic device was assessed with the mobile telephones in standby, and in dialling or receiving modes. Any alterations of displayed digital figures or numbers were also assessed.

Results

A total of 23 electronic ophthalmic devices in two hospital ophthalmology outpatient departments were evaluated. All six mobile telephones used, and 22 (95.7%) of the 23 ophthalmic equipment evaluated had the Conformité Européene (CE) mark. No device showed any interruption or cessation of function. There were no alterations of displayed digital figures or numbers. The only effect of any kind was found with four instruments (1 non-CE marked), where there was temporary flickering on the screen, and only occurred when the mobile telephones were dialling or receiving at a distance of 30 cm or less from the instruments.

Conclusion

This study shows that among the electronic ophthalmic devices tested, none suffered failure or interruption of function, from mobile telephone interference. Although not comprehensive for all ophthalmic equipment, the results question the need for a complete ban of mobile telephones in ophthalmic departments. It highlights the need for a controlled, objectively measured study of the clinically relevant effects of mobile telephones in the ophthalmology outpatient setting.

### Neural dynamics of phoneme sequences reveal position-invariant code for content and order [^f1569001]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Speech consists of a continuously-varying acoustic signal. Yet human listeners experience it as sequences of discrete speech sounds, which are used to recognise discrete words. To examine how the human brain appropriately sequences the speech signal, we recorded two-hour magnetoencephalograms from 21 participants listening to short narratives. Our analyses show that the brain continuously encodes the three most recently heard speech sounds in parallel, and maintains this information long past its dissipation from the sensory input. Each speech sound representation evolves over time, jointly encoding both its phonetic features and the amount of time elapsed since onset. As a result, this dynamic neural pattern encodes both the relative order and phonetic content of the speech sequence. These representations are active earlier when phonemes are more predictable, and are sustained longer when lexical identity is uncertain. Our results show how phonetic sequences in natural speech are represented at the level of populations of neurons, providing insight into what intermediary representations exist between the sensory input and sub-lexical units. The flexibility in the dynamics of these representations paves the way for further understanding of how such sequences may be used to interface with higher order structure such as lexical identity.

### Predicting CDR status over 36 months with a recall-based digital cognitive biomarker [^6879ca1c]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

One example is the use of hidden Markov modeling (HMM), a class of established cognitive models. In the context of word‐list recall tests, an HMM characterizes episodic memory for a list item as existing in one of a set of latent storage states upon each observation of recall or non‐recall during the test. Retrieval parameters are associated with each storage state from which an item is capable of being recalled, and encoding parameters describe the transitions among the storage states. The sequence of encoding and retrieval transitions cannot be directly observed and is therefore "hidden" but quantifiable as probabilities of recall.

A hierarchical Bayesian cognitive processing (HBCP) model is an HMM that has been applied to word‐list recall. The HBCP model posits that an item exists within one of three states upon each observation: pre‐task storage (p), which contains only semantic memory; transient storage (T), which contains temporarily stored episodic memory and enables immediate free recall (IFR); and durable storage (D), which contains episodic memory additionally available for delayed free recall (DFR) tasks. Three retrieval parameters quantify the probability of recall from the latter two states: Transient retrieval (R 1), from T on IFR tasks; durable retrieval (R 2), from D on IFR tasks; and delayed retrieval (R 3), from D on DFR tasks. Four encoding parameters quantify the probability of an item transitioning from one state to another during each task: one‐shot encoding (N 1), from p to D; transient encoding (N 2), from p to T; consolidated encoding (N 3), from T to D on a task subsequent to its encoding into T; and testing effect encoding (N 4), from T to D upon successful recall from T. In the HBCP, these parameters are used as probabilities for each branch of a multinomial processing tree that reproduces the observed recall behavior (see Figure 1).

### Automated telephone communication systems for preventive healthcare and management of long-term conditions [^b4551a24]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Automated telephone communication systems (ATCS) can deliver voice messages and collect health-related information from patients using either their telephone's touch-tone keypad or voice recognition software. ATCS can supplement or replace telephone contact between health professionals and patients. There are four different types of ATCS: unidirectional (one-way, non-interactive voice communication), interactive voice response (IVR) systems, ATCS with additional functions such as access to an expert to request advice (ATCS Plus) and multimodal ATCS, where the calls are delivered as part of a multicomponent intervention.

Objectives

To assess the effects of ATCS for preventing disease and managing long-term conditions on behavioural change, clinical, process, cognitive, patient-centred and adverse outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched 10 electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; CINAHL; Global Health; WHOLIS; LILACS; Web of Science; and ASSIA); three grey literature sources (Dissertation Abstracts, Index to Theses, Australasian Digital Theses); and two trial registries (www.controlled-trials.com; www.clinicaltrials.gov) for papers published between 1980 and June 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, cluster- and quasi-randomised trials, interrupted time series and controlled before-and-after studies comparing ATCS interventions, with any control or another ATCS type were eligible for inclusion. Studies in all settings, for all consumers/carers, in any preventive healthcare or long term condition management role were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods to select and extract data and to appraise eligible studies.

Main Results

We included 132 trials (N = 4,669,689). Studies spanned across several clinical areas, assessing many comparisons based on evaluation of different ATCS types and variable comparison groups. Forty-one studies evaluated ATCS for delivering preventive healthcare, 84 for managing long-term conditions, and seven studies for appointment reminders. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence primarily because of the risk of bias for many outcomes. We judged the risk of bias arising from allocation processes to be low for just over half the studies and unclear for the remainder. We considered most studies to be at unclear risk of performance or detection bias due to blinding, while only 16% of studies were at low risk. We generally judged the risk of bias due to missing data and selective outcome reporting to be unclear. For preventive healthcare, ATCS (ATCS Plus, IVR, unidirectional) probably increase immunisation uptake in children (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 1.32; 5 studies, N = 10,454; moderate certainty) and to a lesser extent in adolescents (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11; 2 studies, N = 5725; moderate certainty). The effects of ATCS in adults are unclear (RR 2.18, 95% CI 0.53 to 9.02; 2 studies, N = 1743; very low certainty). For screening, multimodal ATCS increase uptake of screening for breast cancer (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.55 to 3.04; 2 studies, N = 462; high certainty) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.88 to 2.55; 3 studies, N = 1013; high certainty) versus usual care. It may also increase osteoporosis screening. ATCS Plus interventions probably slightly increase cervical cancer screening (moderate certainty), but effects on osteoporosis screening are uncertain. IVR systems probably increase CRC screening at 6 months (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.48; 2 studies, N = 16,915; moderate certainty) but not at 9 to 12 months, with probably little or no effect of IVR (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99, 1.11; 2 studies, 2599 participants; moderate certainty) or unidirectional ATCS on breast cancer screening. Appointment reminders delivered through IVR or unidirectional ATCS may improve attendance rates compared with no calls (low certainty). For long-term management, medication or laboratory test adherence provided the most general evidence across conditions (25 studies, data not combined). Multimodal ATCS versus usual care showed conflicting effects (positive and uncertain) on medication adherence. ATCS Plus probably slightly (versus control; moderate certainty) or probably (versus usual care; moderate certainty) improves medication adherence but may have little effect on adherence to tests (versus control). IVR probably slightly improves medication adherence versus control (moderate certainty). Compared with usual care, IVR probably improves test adherence and slightly increases medication adherence up to six months but has little or no effect at longer time points (moderate certainty). Unidirectional ATCS, compared with control, may have little effect or slightly improve medication adherence (low certainty). The evidence suggested little or no consistent effect of any ATCS type on clinical outcomes (blood pressure control, blood lipids, asthma control, therapeutic coverage) related to adherence, but only a small number of studies contributed clinical outcome data. The above results focus on areas with the most general findings across conditions. In condition-specific areas, the effects of ATCS varied, including by the type of ATCS intervention in use. Multimodal ATCS probably decrease both cancer pain and chronic pain as well as depression (moderate certainty), but other ATCS types were less effective. Depending on the type of intervention, ATCS may have small effects on outcomes for physical activity, weight management, alcohol consumption, and diabetes mellitus. ATCS have little or no effect on outcomes related to heart failure, hypertension, mental health or smoking cessation, and there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects for preventing alcohol/substance misuse or managing illicit drug addiction, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV/AIDS, hypercholesterolaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, spinal cord dysfunction or psychological stress in carers. Only four trials (3%) reported adverse events, and it was unclear whether these were related to the interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

ATCS interventions can change patients' health behaviours, improve clinical outcomes and increase healthcare uptake with positive effects in several important areas including immunisation, screening, appointment attendance, and adherence to medications or tests. The decision to integrate ATCS interventions in routine healthcare delivery should reflect variations in the certainty of the evidence available and the size of effects across different conditions, together with the varied nature of ATCS interventions assessed. Future research should investigate both the content of ATCS interventions and the mode of delivery; users' experiences, particularly with regard to acceptability; and clarify which ATCS types are most effective and cost-effective.

### Use of cellular telephones and brain tumour risk in urban and rural areas [^c8158735]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the association between the use of cellular or cordless telephones and the risk for brain tumours in different geographical areas, urban and rural.

Methods

Patients aged 20–80 years, living in the middle part of Sweden, and diagnosed between 1 January 1997 and 30 June 2000 were included. One control matched for sex and age in five year age groups was selected for each case. Use of different phone types was assessed by a questionnaire.

Results

The number of participating cases was 1429; there were 1470 controls. An effect of rural living was most pronounced for digital cellular telephones. Living in rural areas yielded an odds ratio (OR) of 1.4 (95% CI 0.98 to 2.0), increasing to 3.2 (95% CI 1.2 to 8.4) with > 5 year latency time for digital phones. The corresponding ORs for living in urban areas were 0.9 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.2) and 0.9 (95% CI 0.6 to 1.4), respectively. This effect was most obvious for malignant brain tumours.

Conclusion

In future studies, place of residence should be considered in assessment of exposure to microwaves from cellular telephones, although the results in this study must be interpreted with caution due to low numbers in some of the calculations.

Sampling options include considering geographic distribution, travel history, clinical presentation, demographic-specific groups, age differences, and other conditions, or using random testing with a predetermined number of samples per day, week, or month.

10.3 Management of Overdose

Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug effective in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder.

Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients.

Activated charcoal should be administered. Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidotes for fluoxetine are known.

A specific caution involves patients who are taking or have recently taken fluoxetine and might ingest excessive quantities of a TCA. In such a case, accumulation of the parent tricyclic and/or an active metabolite may increase the possibility of clinically significant sequelae and extend the time needed for close medical observation [see Drug Interactions (7.9)].

Based on experience in animals, which may not be relevant to humans, fluoxetine-induced seizures that fail to remit spontaneously may respond to diazepam.

In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any overdose. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR).

### Pre-endoscopy symptoms and age, but not esophageal biopsy number are associated with post-endoscopy adverse events [^c9659041]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is a frequently utilized investigative tool in the management of gastrointestinal conditions in children. Biopsies obtained during EGD may pose risk for post-operative adverse events (AEs), and further understanding of risk is imperative to provide informed consent to families and safe patient care. In particular, the impact of biopsy number and location on the development of AEs has not been studied in pediatric patients. We prospectively assessed for AEs by telephone survey 3–7 days after 209 EGDs performed on patients ages 1–21 years over a 1-year period. Demographic, endoscopic, and histologic data were collected. The most common symptoms reported were throat pain (61%), chest pain (26%), and dysphagia (26%). Binary regression models identified age and pre-operative symptoms as factors that influenced the likelihood of post-operative morbidity. Multiple biopsies from 3 different locations of the esophagus did not impact the risk of post-operative AEs.

### Strategies to improve retention in randomised trials [^1b76d5f6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Loss to follow-up from randomised trials can introduce bias and reduce study power, affecting the generalisability, validity and reliability of results. Many strategies are used to reduce loss to follow-up and improve retention but few have been formally evaluated.

Objectives

To quantify the effect of strategies to improve retention on the proportion of participants retained in randomised trials and to investigate if the effect varied by trial strategy and trial setting.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, DARE, CINAHL, Campbell Collaboration's Social, Psychological, Educational and Criminological Trials Register, and ERIC. We handsearched conference proceedings and publication reference lists for eligible retention trials. We also surveyed all UK Clinical Trials Units to identify further studies.

Selection Criteria

We included eligible retention trials of randomised or quasi-randomised evaluations of strategies to increase retention that were embedded in 'host' randomised trials from all disease areas and healthcare settings. We excluded studies aiming to increase treatment compliance.

Data Collection and Analysis

We contacted authors to supplement or confirm data that we had extracted. For retention trials, we recorded data on the method of randomisation, type of strategy evaluated, comparator, primary outcome, planned sample size, numbers randomised and numbers retained. We used risk ratios (RR) to evaluate the effectiveness of the addition of strategies to improve retention. We assessed heterogeneity between trials using the Chi(2) and I(2) statistics. For main trials that hosted retention trials, we extracted data on disease area, intervention, population, healthcare setting, sequence generation and allocation concealment.

Main Results

We identified 38 eligible retention trials. Included trials evaluated six broad types of strategies to improve retention. These were incentives, communication strategies, new questionnaire format, participant case management, behavioural and methodological interventions. For 34 of the included trials, retention was response to postal and electronic questionnaires with or without medical test kits. For four trials, retention was the number of participants remaining in the trial. Included trials were conducted across a spectrum of disease areas, countries, healthcare and community settings. Strategies that improved trial retention were addition of monetary incentives compared with no incentive for return of trial-related postal questionnaires (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28, P value < 0.0001), addition of an offer of monetary incentive compared with no offer for return of electronic questionnaires (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.38, P value < 0.00001) and an offer of a GBP20 voucher compared with GBP10 for return of postal questionnaires and biomedical test kits (RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.22, P value < 0.005). The evidence that shorter questionnaires are better than longer questionnaires was unclear (RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08, P value = 0.07) and the evidence for questionnaires relevant to the disease/condition was also unclear (RR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14). Although each was based on the results of a single trial, recorded delivery of questionnaires seemed to be more effective than telephone reminders (RR 2.08; 95% CI 1.11 to 3.87, P value = 0.02) and a 'package' of postal communication strategies with reminder letters appeared to be better than standard procedures (RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.67, P value < 0.0001). An open trial design also appeared more effective than a blind trial design for return of questionnaires in one fracture prevention trial (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.63, P value = 0.0003). There was no good evidence that the addition of a non-monetary incentive, an offer of a non-monetary incentive, 'enhanced' letters, letters delivered by priority post, additional reminders, or questionnaire question order either increased or decreased trial questionnaire response/retention. There was also no evidence that a telephone survey was either more or less effective than a monetary incentive and a questionnaire. As our analyses are based on single trials, the effect on questionnaire response of using offers of charity donations, sending reminders to trial sites and when a questionnaire is sent, may need further evaluation. Case management and behavioural strategies used for trial retention may also warrant further evaluation.

Authors' Conclusions

Most of the retention trials that we identified evaluated questionnaire response. There were few evaluations of ways to improve participants returning to trial sites for trial follow-up. Monetary incentives and offers of monetary incentives increased postal and electronic questionnaire response. Some other strategies evaluated in single trials looked promising but need further evaluation. Application of the findings of this review would depend on trial setting, population, disease area, data collection and follow-up procedures.

### Machine learning differentiates enzymatic and non-enzymatic metals in proteins [^d8ca0345]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

DeepEC, DEEPre, and ENZYMAz2.5 method evaluations

After removing the inconclusive false positives from the test-set, the set contained 516 sites on 400 unique sequences. The sequences were used for testing sequence-based classifiers for metrics comparison. Because sequences could contain both positive and negative metal-binding sites, sequences were labeled as enzymatic if they met at least one of the following criteria: an associated EC number, an "ase" suffix in structure classification or molecular name, or previously identified to be enzymatic by manual inspection. Sequences that did not meet any of the previous criteria were labeled as non-enzymatic. We manually verified 33 enzymatic labels for sequences that lacked an associated EC number. The sequence test-set contained 170 enzymatic sequences and 230 non-enzymatic sequences.

EFICAz2.5 was download from. We used it to make a prediction for all 400 sequences in the sequence test-set. Predictions containing "No EFICAz EC assignment" were considered non-enzymatic and all other predictions were considered enzymatic. DeepEC was downloaded from. DeepEC was only able to make predictions for the 396 sequences that were less than 1000 residues in length. The output "enzyme_prediction.txt" file was used for the performance evaluation. Finally, the 393 sequences that had between 50 and 5000 residues were uploaded to the webserver link provided in DEEPre's publication. The prediction was considered non-enzymatic if the first digit was "0" and enzymatic for all other first digits.

### Feasibility of life-supporting first-aid (LSFA) training as a mandatory subject in primary schools [^03631ef3]. Resuscitation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Life-supporting first-aid (LFSA) training in primary schools might prove a useful means of increasing cardiac arrest survival rates. We thus studied the feasibility of introducing first-aid training to 6-7-year old primary school children.

Methods and Results

During 1 week medical students and emergency physicians provided LSFA training to 47 first- and second-year pupils, including semi-automatic defibrillation. A course assessment was made using cartoon-style questionnaires for the pupils, video tapes of the training and telephone interviews with the children's parents. Prior to training, only eight pupils (17%) were able to place in the correct sequence a series of pictures illustrating the various stages of the procedure of semi-automatic defibrillation. After training that figure rose to 24 (51%). Using a semi-automatic defibrillator, excellent performances were recorded by video camera in eight pupils. Post-training telephone interviews were conducted with 34 parents (79%), 28 (82%) of whom now considered their children capable of reacting properly in an emergency situation. The children had been given stickers displaying the European Emergency Call Number 112 together with a set of brochures. In 25 cases (74%), the children applied the stickers to their parents phones at home.

Conclusions

LSFA training is a feasible proposition for 6-7-year olds who might well be in a position to save the lives of cardiac-arrest victims. Future training sessions should determine the impact of repeat courses and the findings should be used to convince politicians and administrators of the need of LSFA training as a mandatory subject in schools.

### Health care utilization by veterans prescribed chronic opioids [^8ee417a1]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Number of opioids

The majority of patients on COT were prescribed a single opioid (n = 477, 87%). Patients prescribed more than one opioid had more telephone calls, secure messages, or nurse visits (P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in total EDVs, hospitalizations, telephone triage calls, and clinic visits (Table 3).

Logistic regression – predictors of utilization

Model-based results show that controlling for relevant demographic and clinical characteristics, patients on COT were more likely to have a higher number of EDVs than non-opioid control patients, with an adjusted common odds ratio of 1.9 (95% CI 1.4–2.4). Similarly, patients on COT were more likely to have an increased number of telephone triage encounters (adjusted common odds ratio 1.4 [95% CI 1.0–1.9]) as well as telephone calls, secure messages, or nurse visits (adjusted common odds ratio 1.6 [95% CI 1.2–2.0]) (Table 4). After adjusting for demographic indicators, diagnoses, and other clinical characteristics, patients on COT were not found to have more hospitalizations or clinic visits compared to patients not on opioids. The full models are provided in Tables S1 – S5.

### ASTCT consensus grading for cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity associated with immune effector cells [^7d304569]. Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

ASTCT ICANS grading — grades 1–4 definitions and triggers are as follows: Final ICANS grade is determined by the most severe event across domains. Grade 1 ICANS is a score of 7 to 9 on the ICE assessment with possible delay in response, disorientation to time or place, mild inattention with difficulty in counting numbers backward, or impaired handwriting, with mild somnolence but able to complete most of the ICE assessment. Grade 2 ICANS is a score of 3 to 6 on the ICE assessment; patients often have expressive aphasia limiting spontaneous communication and may have slowed responses but are arousable to voice. Grade 3 ICANS is a score of 0 to 2 on the ICE assessment; any clinical seizure (simple partial, complex partial, or generalized) or electrographic seizures, or neuroimaging showing new focal or local edema, meet grade 3 criteria, while intracranial hemorrhage due to coagulopathy or other causes with or without associated edema is excluded from ICANS grading. Grade 4 ICANS includes patients with a score of 0 on the ICE assessment due to being unarousable and unable to perform the assessment, and also those with prolonged or repetitive clinical or subclinical electrographic seizures without a return to baseline in between or with deep focal motor weakness (such as hemiparesis or paraparesis), or with symptoms and signs of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) including cranial nerve VI palsies, papilledema, Cushing's triad of bradycardia, hypertension, and bradypnea, and radiographic evidence of cerebral edema.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^9f543c96]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The severity of this problem's complexity is not additive or linear in nature, but interdependent on all of the sub-problems that need to be solved for this to work. Furthermore, adopting a solution might have unintended, if not non-linear, consequences to the system's overall outcome that were not obvious or foreseeable. For instance, allowing students to use their mobile phones in schools might seem like a good idea to improve class engagement through other media, but an unintended consequence might be distraction or discouraging deeper critical thinking. The objective of the NK space is to capture the complex interaction among activities that yield performance. The NK problem space's popularity in modeling human decision-making stems from its verisimilitude with the complex and multidimensional problems that face problem-solving tasks, and because researchers can easily generate a large number of statistically similar problem spaces for robustness checks. (We note, however, in order to make sure our results are not an artifact of the idiosyncrasies of the NK problem space, we replicated all of our results in another rugged problem space, the Traveling Salesperson Problem — findings available in Supplemental Methods in Supplementary Fig. 2 through 9 and 11).

### Changes in semantic memory structure support successful problem-solving and analogical transfer [^209a662c]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Importantly, we explored how the ability to solve the riddles related to creative abilities, measured with several assessments. We found that creativity scores including measures of convergent and divergent thinking positively and significantly correlated with the solving rate of the four riddles (see Supplementary Note 1 and Fig. S4).

Overall, we found a behavioral signature of analogy transfer (higher solving rate, faster response time) in problem-solving. In addition, we provided evidence suggesting that solving our riddles involves creativity-related processes (correlation with other measures of creativity and a positive association between correct responses and Eureka report).

Local changes in problem-related SemNets relate to successful solving (Study 1)

In the naive condition, we explored whether the ability to solve problems could be reflected in changes in SemNets organization, either at the global (i.e. SemNet) or local (i.e. node or edge) level. We used nonlinear mixed-effects models to predict problem-solving based on the difference between individual-based SemNets metrics over time (ΔMetric = Metric PostSemNet – Metric PreSemNet), the impact rating (measuring the importance of each node or edge to solve the problem), the semantic distance (measuring the semantic remoteness of each node or edge), and all possible interaction effects between these factors. We expected to find positive SemNets metric changes in parts of the SemNet that were solution-relevant and semantically remote in solvers compared to non-solvers.

### Telephone first consultations in primary care [^ddc0b6f7]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

There was distinct variation among practices in how well the system functioned. Some noted large reductions in workload while others experienced big increases. The reasons for this were unclear and warrant further exploration. The authors observed that better organised practices seemed to fare better than practices that were overwhelmed before they adopted a telephone first system. Some practices did not fully implement the telephone first approach, but subanalyses of these variations in implementation showed little association with outcomes.

Patients too expressed varied views. While, overall, they liked the quicker access to advice and the convenience of not having to attend the practice, some found the system frustrating — with difficulties getting through or long waits for a call back. In telephone first practices, the proportion of patients preferring the new system was similar to the proportion preferring the old one, and the proportion who would recommend their practice to friends fell.

A substantial minority of patients found telephone communication difficult. This could be an underestimate as people who have problems with telephone consulting (those whose first language is not English, with learning difficulties, or with low literacy skills) are also less likely to return a survey. The authors don't report the cost implications for patients.

The authors acknowledge some of the study's shortcomings. The effect of telephone first on other parts of the health service, such as nursing and pharmacy, were not measured. Commercial companies marketing the systems provided appointments data, and it is unclear how the authors overcame the difficulties in analysing routine appointments data, including the cleaning and recoding often required to make data suitable for analysis. Large amounts of data about the duration of appointments were missing and so had to be imputed. The safety of telephone consulting was not covered, and the reported increase in emergency admissions associated with telephone first systems is of potential concern.

### Data storage using peptide sequences [^9400a285]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

When this scheme was used on dataset B, a 511 × 16 block of symbols was constructed (Table S5), which comprises 511 × 16 × 3 = 24528 bits. The three-symbol sets A i,1 A i,2 A i,3 (i = 1, 2, …, 511) were used for addressing, with Symbols S 1 to S 3 having the values of 000, 001, 002, …, 775, 776. The three bits of Symbol S 4 were the three order-checking bits used to protect the order of Symbols S 1 and S 2, the order of Symbols S 2 and S 3, and the order of Symbols S 15 and S 16, respectively. Then there were 511 × 12 × 3 = 18396 bit positions in Symbols S 5 to S 16 of the block to store the information and parity bits for the RS codes. Due to the different protection requirements for the partial sequences { S 5 S 6 S 7 S 8 S 9 S 10 } and { S 11 S 12 S 13 S 14 S 15 S 16 }, two (511, 409) RS codes were used for partial sequences { S 5 S 6 S 7 } (RS1) and { S 8 S 9 S 10 } (RS2), another two (511, 357) RS codes were used for partial sequences { S 11 S 12 S 13 } (RS3) and { S 14 S 15 S 16 } (RS4). Each symbol in RS code comprised 9 bits. The (511, 409) RS and (511, 357) RS codes could correct up to 51 and 77 9-bit symbol errors, respectively (Table S5). Moreover, the numbers of total information bits and total parity bits of all four RS codes were given by (409 + 357) × 2 × 9 = 13788 and (102 + 154) × 2 × 9 = 4608, respectively. The maximum overall code rate R of the block is given by 13788/(511 × 16 × 3) = 0.562. As dataset B only had 13752 bits, zeros were appended to the end such that the block could be fully filled. This code rate is comparable to that of DNA (varied from 0.17 for repetition encodingto 0.785 for fountain encoding, assuming a maximum capacity of 2 bits per nucleotide). Improvement of code rate is possible if longer peptides could be used, if the peptide design could be improved to reduce error, and if the coding scheme could be more focused on the error-prone amino acid positions to reduce unnecessary redundancy.

### Verbal memory impairment in healthy siblings of patients with schizophrenia [^82cc111d]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

Cognitive deficits have been recognized as a core feature of schizophrenia (SZ) and are present in most patients. Verbal memory (VM), working memory (WM), and executive function (EF) are domains commonly impaired in patients with SZ. These latter domains have been related to the genetic risk of the disorder characterizing as possible endophenotypes. In order to study neurocognitive endophenotypes in a Brazilian population with elevated genetic risks to develop SZ, we measured VM (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised), WM (Letter-Number Sequencing and Digit Span) and EF (Stroop Test) in 90 subjects (45 unaffected siblings of patients with SZ and 45 matched healthy controls). No differences were found in EF and WM (Letter-Number Sequencing and Digit Span). However, in VM, siblings of patients performed worse than controls on the immediate recall and delayed recall. Our results suggest that VM impairment could be considered an endophenotype of SZ.

### Changes in semantic memory structure support successful problem-solving and analogical transfer [^a97c1d00]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We explored how semantic memory restructuring, — supposedly reflecting a reorganization of the mental representation of the riddles, — could serve as a cognitive mechanism underlying problem-solving. By building individual SemNets before and after solving a problem, we characterized and quantified the changes in the organization of semantic associations between riddle-related concepts. We found that local SemNets changes were related to successful problem-solving (see Table 6 for a summary). In addition, we found that similar local SemNets changes were also associated with the solving success of a semantically distinct, analogous problem, suggesting a link between restructuring and analogical transfer (Studies 1 and 2). We also showed that solving with insight was related to a remoteness-based restructuring (Studies 1 and 2). Finally, we demonstrated that solution-based and remoteness-based SemNets changes dissociated participants who solved the problem by themselves from those who were given the solution (Study 3). Together, our findings provide evidence for the role of local semantic memory restructuring as a cognitive mechanism of problem-solving and analogical transfer.

### Mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments [^8baccc8a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Missed appointments are a major cause of inefficiency in healthcare delivery, with substantial monetary costs for the health system, leading to delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Patients' forgetfulness is one of the main reasons for missed appointments, and reminders may help alleviate this problem. Modes of communicating reminders for appointments to patients include face-to-face communication, postal messages, calls to landlines or mobile phones, and mobile phone messaging. Mobile phone messaging applications such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS) could provide an important, inexpensive delivery medium for reminders for healthcare appointments.

Objectives

To assess the effects of mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments. Secondary objectives include assessment of patients' and healthcare providers' evaluation of the intervention; costs; and possible risks and harms associated with the intervention.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and African Health Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009). We also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, or interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points before and after the intervention. We included studies assessing mobile phone messaging as reminders for healthcare appointments. We only included studies in which it was possible to assess effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third author. Primary outcomes of interest were rate of attendance at healthcare appointments. We also considered health outcomes as a result of the intervention, patients' and providers' evaluation of the intervention, perceptions of safety, costs, and potential harms or adverse effects. As the intervention characteristics and outcome measures were similar across included studies, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate an overall effect size.

Main Results

We included four randomised controlled trials involving 3547 participants. Three studies with moderate quality evidence showed that mobile text message reminders improved the rate of attendance at healthcare appointments compared to no reminders (risk ratio (RR) 1.10 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.17)). One low quality study reported that mobile text message reminders with postal reminders, compared to postal reminders, improved rate of attendance at healthcare appointments (RR 1.10 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.19)). However, two studies with moderate quality of evidence showed that mobile phone text message reminders and phone call reminders had a similar impact on healthcare attendance (RR 0.99 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.03). The costs per attendance of mobile phone text message reminders were shown to be lower compared to phone call reminders. None of the included studies reported outcomes related to harms or adverse effects of the intervention, nor health outcomes or user perception of safety related to the intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate quality evidence that mobile phone text message reminders are more effective than no reminders, and low quality evidence that text message reminders with postal reminders are more effective than postal reminders alone. Further, according to the moderate quality evidence we found, mobile phone text message reminders are as effective as phone call reminders. Overall, there is limited evidence on the effects of mobile phone text message reminders for appointment attendance, and further high-quality research is required to draw more robust conclusions.

### Binary tree-inspired digital dendrimer [^cca48c38]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Digital polymers with precisely ordered units acting as the coded 0- or 1-bit, are introduced as a promising option for molecular data storage. However, the pursuit of better performance in terms of high storage capacity and useful functions never stops. Herein, we propose a concept of an information-coded 2D digital dendrimer. The divergent growth via thiol-maleimide Michael coupling allows precise arrangements of the 0- and 1-bits in the uniform dendrimers. A protocol for calculating the storage capacity of non-linear binary digital dendrimer is established based on data matrix barcode, generated by the tandem mass spectrometry decoding and encryption. Furthermore, the generated data matrix barcode can be read by a common hand-held device to cater the applications such as item identification, traceability and anticouterfeiting purpose. This work demonstrates the high data storage capacity of a uniform dendrimer and uncovers good opportunities for the digital polymers.

### Telemedicine as a tool for continuing medical education [^69642201]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Multidisciplinary health care teams

Our results reflect that while health service provision is becoming more interdisciplinary, specialized health advice today comes from many more sources. Telemedicine helps clinicians of different specialties at different organizations to learn together to better solve patients' problems. Ultimately, the cooperation may be not only cross-professional but also cross-organizational.

C4: the relationship that I think is fundamental and that telemedicine allows is a multidisciplinary discussion with the patient, in real time, in which we often have all the patient's problems. There can be a multidisciplinary team to solve the question, the patient's problem.

Because sometimes 'let's leave it [the problem] in the pocket to solve it later'. And I think that, above all, the teleconsultation allows us to solve the problem in real time, that many times by calling we can solve the problem, which is fundamental for the patient and for us.

### Mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments [^dc55ef1e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of the original Cochrane review published in July 2012. Missed appointments are a major cause of inefficiency in healthcare delivery with substantial monetary costs for the health system, leading to delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Patients' forgetfulness is one of the main reasons for missed appointments. Patient reminders may help reduce missed appointments. Modes of communicating reminders for appointments to patients include face-to-face communication, postal messages, calls to landlines or mobile phones, and mobile phone messaging. Mobile phone messaging applications, such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS), could provide an important, inexpensive delivery medium for reminders for healthcare appointments.

Objectives

To update our review assessing the effects of mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments. Secondary objectives include assessment of costs; health outcomes; patients' and healthcare providers' evaluation of the intervention and perceptions of safety; and possible harms and adverse effects associated with the intervention.

Search Methods

Original searches were run in June 2009. For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to August 2012), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to August 2012), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to August 2012) and CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to August 2012). We also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing mobile phone messaging as reminders for healthcare appointments. We only included studies in which it was possible to assess effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third author. Two authors assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. As the intervention characteristics and outcome measures were similar across included studies, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate an overall effect size.

Main Results

We included eight randomised controlled trials involving 6615 participants. Four of these studies were newly identified during this update. We found moderate quality evidence from seven studies (5841 participants) that mobile text message reminders improved the rate of attendance at healthcare appointments compared to no reminders (risk ratio (RR) 1.14 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.26)). There was also moderate quality evidence from three studies (2509 participants) that mobile text message reminders had a similar impact to phone call reminders (RR 0.99 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.02). Low quality evidence from one study (291 participants) suggests that mobile text message reminders combined with postal reminders improved the rate of attendance at healthcare appointments compared to postal reminders alone (RR 1.10 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.19)). Overall, the attendance to appointment rates were 67.8% for the no reminders group, 78.6% for the mobile phone messaging reminders group and 80.3% for the phone call reminders group. One study reported generally that there were no adverse effects during the study period; none of the studies reported in detail on specific adverse events such as loss of privacy, data misinterpretation, or message delivery failure. Two studies reported that the costs per text message per attendance were respectively 55% and 65% lower than costs per phone call reminder. The studies included in the review did not report on health outcomes or people's perceptions of safety related to receiving reminders by text message.

Authors' Conclusions

Low to moderate quality evidence included in this review shows that mobile phone text messaging reminders increase attendance at healthcare appointments compared to no reminders, or postal reminders. Text messaging reminders were similar to telephone reminders in terms of their effect on attendance rates, and cost less than telephone reminders. However, the included studies were heterogeneous and the quality of the evidence therein is low to moderate. Further, there is a lack of information about health effects, adverse effects and harms, user evaluation of the intervention and user perceptions of its safety. The current evidence therefore still remains insufficient to conclusively inform policy decisions. There is a need for more high-quality randomised trials of mobile phone messaging reminders, that measure not only patients' attendance rates, but also focus on the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Health outcomes, patients' and healthcare providers' evaluation and perceptions of the safety of the interventions, potential harms, and adverse effects of mobile phone messaging reminders should be assessed. Studies should report message content and timing in relation to the appointment.

### The digital code of DNA [^4f89cc21]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

The discovery of the structure of DNA transformed biology profoundly, catalysing the sequencing of the human genome and engendering a new view of biology as an information science. Two features of DNA structure account for much of its remarkable impact on science: its digital nature and its complementarity, whereby one strand of the helix binds perfectly with its partner. DNA has two types of digital information — the genes that encode proteins, which are the molecular machines of life, and the gene regulatory networks that specify the behaviour of the genes.

### Telephone follow-up, initiated by a hospital-based health professional, for postdischarge problems in patients discharged from hospital to home [^c005ec5e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

It is known that many patients encounter a variety of problems in the first weeks after they have been discharged from hospital to home. In recent years many projects have addressed discharge planning, with the aim of reducing problems after discharge. Telephone follow-up (TFU) is seen as a good means of exchanging information, providing health education and advice, managing symptoms, recognising complications early, giving reassurance and providing quality aftercare service. Some research has shown that telephone follow-up is feasible, and that patients appreciate such calls. However, at present it is not clear whether TFU is also effective in reducing postdischarge problems.

Objectives

To assess the effects of follow-up telephone calls in the first month post discharge, initiated by hospital-based health professionals, to patients discharged from hospital to home.

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases from their start date to July 2003, without limits as to date of publication or language: the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), PubMed, EMBASE (OVID), BiomedCentral, CINAHL, ERIC (OVID), INVERT (Dutch nursing literature index), LILACS, Picarta (Dutch library system), PsycINFO/PsycLIT (OVID), the Combined Social and Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E), SOCIOFILE. We searched for ongoing research in the following databases: National Research Register (http://www.update-software.com/nrr/); Controlled Clinical Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com/); and Clinical Trials (http://clinicaltrials.gov/). We searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted researchers active in this area.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of TFU initiated by a hospital-based health professional, for patients discharged home from an acute hospital setting. The intervention was delivered within the first month after discharge; outcomes were measured within 3 months after discharge, and either the TFU was the only intervention, or its effect could be analysed separately.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and for methodological quality. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the criteria from the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Review Group. The data-extraction form was based on the template developed by the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group. Data was extracted by one review author and checked by a second author. For as far it was considered that there was enough clinical homogeneity with regard to patient groups and measured outcomes, statistical pooling was planned using a random effects model and standardised mean differences for continuous scales and relative risks for dichotomous data, and tests for statistical heterogeneity were performed.

Main Results

We included 33 studies involving 5110 patients. Predominantly, the studies were of low methodological quality. TFU has been applied in many patient groups. There is a large variety in the ways the TFU was performed (the health professionals who undertook the TFU, frequency, structure, duration, etc.). Many different outcomes have been measured, but only a few were measured across more than one study. Effects are not constant across studies, nor within patient groups. Due to methodological and clinical diversity, quantitative pooling could only be performed for a few outcomes. Of the eight meta-analyses in this review, five showed considerable statistical heterogeneity. Overall, there was inconclusive evidence about the effects of TFU.

Authors' Conclusions

The low methodological quality of the included studies means that results must be considered with caution. No adverse effects were reported. Nevertheless, although some studies find that the intervention had favourable effects for some outcomes, overall the studies show clinically-equivalent results between TFU and control groups. In summary, we cannot conclude that TFU is an effective intervention.

Controversy about hyperparameter optimization of various machine learning models

In this study, the process of hyperparameter optimization is not described, even though different combinations of hyperparameters are crucial for model building and validation.

In the field of machine learning, using default hyperparameters may not be suitable for specific datasets. Lack of hyperparameter optimization can prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information, leading to less stable performance, high heterogeneity, and insufficient robustness, which negatively affects model building and generalization. Different combinations of hyperparameters significantly impact the predictive efficacy of the model. Failure to adequately perform hyperparameter optimization may result in models that do not achieve optimal predictive efficacy. This causes selection bias in the model and ultimately leads to incorrect decisions.

Machine learning is prone to model overfitting and poor generalization if the built-in hyperparameters are not properly set. Therefore, hyperparameter optimization in the field of machine learning is a scientific, rigorous, and reliable practice.
